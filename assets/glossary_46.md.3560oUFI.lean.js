I loved Mistoffelees but didn't like that he sang \\"Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer\\". After watching Jo Gibb and Drew Varley sing this song, noone has been able to compare.

The show is from the 80's and sounds mildly so. The show has also evolved since then, a few things changing for example on this CD, Timothy Scott (Mr. Mistoffolees) has a large singing part as well as his dancing and acting roles. But that was soon abolished and Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer became felines, not his pet puppets.This version differs from the London one in the sense that not only did the show evolve slightly, Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer were given a more upbeat tune, the Italian aria was added in place of \\"The Ballad of Billy McCaw\\" and Bustopher Jones has had a verse cut.A very sweet version with a great cast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buying this cd is like spending 26 dollars on a coaster...","review":"This is a horrible musical which has only one thought-provoking theme and that is \\"why the hell do people continue to see this musical?\\".

I listened to some of the songs, at first I thought they were kinda catchy. After a while I resorted to concussing myself to get the songs out of my head. So, long story short, avoid unless you enjoy Webber's reptitive format (beltzy soprano, love that dosen't work out, etc.) and you are the insane person who can listen to a musical hundreds of times and not get tired of them.

Don't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst CD EVER!!!","review":"This is the single most disgraceful piece of music I have ever heard in my entire life. Andrew Lloyd Webber should be ashamed as a musician and admit his awful flaw. The music has no range in melody whatsoever and the lyrics don't blend in at all with the poorly written music and script. A CD like \\"Wicked\\" has beautiful lyrics and equally blending music. THAT is what you want from a CD of a musical. You don't want 3 hours of poorly sung nonsense about a bunch of street cats living behind a dumpster. I have been to countless shows and from my viewpoint, this CD lacks everything a CD should have. How a worthless piece of junk like \\"Cats\\" ran on a broadway stage for so long is a complete disgrace and mystery to me and should also be to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not NEARLY as Good as the London Recording","review":"I am Sorry if you like the Broadway Version, but it sucks. I was raised on the London version, may be that is why I prefer it. The Broadway version doesn't even compare. I heard it and I was like, \\"This is Broadway?\\" Community Theater is better than that, and more believeable. They just try too hard, and it just sounds stupid. I guess my main problem with this recording is Growltiger's Last Stand. That is my favorite number, and I just HATE it when the Broadway cast sings it. They just make it REALLY stupid. I mean, they start to SING OPERA for crying out loud, OPERA??? What the heck is up with that? I just can't stomach it. If you are looking to buy CATS, and I sincerely hope that you do, buy the London Cast Recording from 1981. It is much better in every which way."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEFINITELY not worth the money!","review":"The ONLY song in here that is any good is Memory!

Cats is Ok but it just didn't thrill me as much as Andrew Lloyd Webber's wonderful The Phanom of The Opera did or as much as the non webber musicals Les Miserables and Miss Saigon did and since I didn't enjoy the Cats cast recording I recently gave it away to a relative who loved Cats and will get better use of the CD's.

For those who can't appreciate the work put into the musical and can't let loose and enjoy, too bad you can't enjoy the CD as much as CATS fans do. You don't have to understand music, you just need to enjoy the tune. There's a lot of \\"meaningless\\" songs out there, but I think over the years, the song from CATS had changed making each version sound more unique even though it's the same song. A bit of warning: the songs in the CD is nothing like the songs on the video. They're much faster and the Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer track has an entirely different tune. The Pekes and the Pollicle soundtrack isn't in the CD either which is a shame cos I loved that song. Overall, if you're a CATS fan, you'll love it. If you're not, then why are you here in the first place? If you haven't seen CATS at all, visit CATS fans websites to get an overview of what its about otherwise you might not enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Superb","review":"Cats is a great musical.

There is never, ever, a need to strike an animal or a child. Rather, the approach called \\"Inductive Discipline\\" is far more effective. Discipline is not synonymous with punishment, and the approach takes note of the common word root (disciple) and the priority of maintaining, not disrupting, the loving relationship.

Instead it is the post-Gram group, which is a very average country rock band. This is a way below average effort. Recorded live and badly, it offers booming bass, distorted highs, and even static (apparently from the amplifiers connections). The singers were not in especially good form either.If you're interested in this group because of the alt.country connection, go for Farther Along, a 21-song compilation of the best of the REAL Flying Burrito Brothers.

Most of Sutherland's screen time is spent in mute staring and trying not to react to anything. When he does say a few lines it is in an emotionless mumble.

Klute is one of those movies that looks great but has no real substance. You don't care about the characters.Klute does not offer any surprises whatsoever and the ending became quite predictable before it was half over. What good is a mystery if everything is pretty obvious and you can guess everything that's about to take place? This attempt at a psychological thriller is mindless. The plot is thin. Guy kills for no apparent reason.In sum, Klute is a movie to avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Short","review":"I have had these for a while now.

I'm a noir freak and the combination of classic noir style and story and period made this book a treat. I'm a Megan Abbott fan for life, though this is still my favorite of the three I've read. It's also refreshing and delightful to read a female author who has such a true ear for noir. There's not much else to say without recapping the story and that would undermine the surprises. If you like noir, you'll love Die a Little."},{"rating":"2","title":"Megan Abbott evolves the noir genre","review":"For those who trashed Megan Abbott for being verbose, I disagree. Megan Abbott's refreshing & original take on the noir formula combines the page turning suspense of Ross MacDonald with the literary flair of a writer who genuinely loves the possibilities and playfulness of the English language. I've also read her books \\"The Song for You\\" and \\"Bury Me Deep\\"; \\"Die a Little\\" is my favorite read of the three."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thinking person's noir","review":"I loved Megan's Abbott's book! It's an achievement. She handles the form as a master. The writing is elegant -- I especially like the rhythms of the catalogs, the litanies; the vivid present tense. And, I like the subtlety with which she weaves her ideas -- the fusion of noir and fifties-suburban-ideal; the feminist take on both genres -- into a fast-paced and entertaining novel. It is cinematic. A great debut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ancient Wisdom","review":"Jose illuminates us with his mastery of the ancient Mayan knowledge and reveals to all of us in a simple yet profound way the shift of consciousness we are all experiencing in this decade.

It reads like an acid ramble -- cosmic assertions tumble over startling insights, with no notion sustained beyond two sentences, properly connected to others, or backed by evidence. I kept waiting for him to settle down and present out some facts and build his case, but he just keeps laying bricks on air. I researched some of the more checkable facts, and found him generally wrong: for example, Isamu Noguchi's \\"The Sculpture to be Seen From Mars\\" looks nothing like the \\"face on Mars\\" (which was an illusion anyway), which he says shocked him into realizing the transmission of universal information. The irony is that despite savaging Western science as unable to understand the Maya, he is so absorbed in his own insights and revelations and discoveries that he never tries to see the Maya through their own eyes, as any good scientist would, and so fails to truly respect the subject he supposedly exalts."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Alternative to Argulles","review":"This is for reviewer CHRISTOPHER FUNG. If you found Argulles' work to be a load of mallarky, you might find an alternate study of the Mayan Calendar interesting. Swedish Mayanist/authro Carl Johan Calleman has written a book on the subject and he is in strong disagreement with Argulles' conjectures (and this whole Dreamspell business). He even sets a completely different date for the end of the Mayan Calendar (a year earlier).

Who cares about character depth here? This is fun reading. I do take issue with some of his novels endings. Quite ironic I must say that after escaping advertising to Luberon he ends up being offered it again. Anyway life can be NOT SO SIMPLE and UNEXPECTED."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely read","review":"Charming and delicious! The characters aren't exactly realistic but they are well done and fun to know. The plot isn't exactly realistic either, it's fiction after all!

The way these observations and thoughts are conveyed are refreshingly honest and admittedly naive. I have recommended this fast-read gem to all English guys I know who want to revisit an awkward time and laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metroland","review":"Julian Barnes is my preferred author for the present time.

If you like Tarantino films you will enjoy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Tarantino's best","review":"I had meant to get around to watching this for the longest time, always hearing that it was worth it even though it's not one of Tarantino's most popular. I'm glad I finally did because I think it is one of his best. The characters in this story are great and so are the performances. It is not as graphic as some of the director's other work and I applaud him for achieving similar effect despite this."},{"rating":"2","title":"good deal","review":"had to get this for the collection!! cheap cheap. came really fast in the mail too. this movie is a classic that had to be added to the collection"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best of 1997 not 1998.","review":"Jackie Brown is a film that should be seen repeatedly and with no interruptions. Pam Grier's career is back in full swing, I wish she would make more movies. Robert Forester is the best actor in the entire film, by the end we feel very simpathetic for his character which I endeer in the many times I have watched the movie. Some people will say that it is too long or the profanity could have been cut down, but it shouldn't. The character developings are so wonderful that I could have watched the characters for hours and hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tarantino for the folks","review":"I loved Pulp Fiction but always felt it necessary to turn it down or off when my father came in the room. What Pulp Fiction acheived with shock value Tarantino's Jackie Brown gets a bit more subtley. Robert Foerester was my favoriete character but Jackson, De Niro, and Grier also act perfectly. Very under-rated by critics because they compared it w/ Pulp fiction but the movies are difficult to compare. The last sequence of Jackie Brown shows the director's maturity and evolution as a film-maker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jackie Brown - The Usual Tarantino or not!","review":"Jackie Brown may have a slower pace than previous Tarantino outings, but the sophisticated presentaion and time lines are still there in all there glory. This film is a definite must have for the Tarantino fan and also Elmore Leonard fans. If you liked Out of Sight this may weel be the film your looking for. Also try: Reservoir dogs, Pulp Fiction, Natural Born Killers, True Romance and definetly Out Of Sight. I personally loved this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Cool Movie packed with great features","review":"This DVD is great! Not only does it contain a great movie but the special features are some of the most in depth and informative I have ever seen. We all already know what a gifted writer/director QT is and I think that this is one of his best works (next to Pulp Fiction of course) and that it has quickly become a worthy cult classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie's Real Star is the Music!","review":"Quentin Tarantino pays homage to the blackploitation era of the 70's in this film based on Elmore Leonard's novel, \\"Rum Punch\\". Unlike the book, the film's lead character is black, not white. That change actually enhances the movie, making it more authentic. Pam Grier gives a Oscar worthy performance as the flight attendant hooked into a dangerous plot. Robert Forester gives one of his best performances of his career as bail bondsman, Max Cherry. Couple that with an all-star cast featuring Robert DeNiro, Michael Keaton, Bridget Fonda and Samuel L. Jackson. But what makes this film shine is the music. Fans of late 70's soul music will be asking for the soundtrack. Though a notch below Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, Tarantino's \\"Jackie Brown\\" still delivers the goods! Very Good Film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quentin and co. at their best","review":"It upsets me that so many critics tend to belittle this excellent film. Being a fan of Quentin's work, I find this to be his finest moment. He strays from his hackneyed, recycled ideas of the past and delivers a movie intriguing to follow with actors who make the characters belivable. On top of superb acting, by both big names and cult icons, the character development makes what could be a boring and semi-predictable plot into a layered, emotional, and innovative look at how different people handle different situations (of course, in a more exaggerated state).I've been looking forward to this movie being released on DVD for years now, and on top of seeing the movie in a new light; the extras are also worth the price of admission. Do yourself a favor; pony up and buy the pic...you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snail's pace melodrama","review":"I expected much more from Tarintino. I expected the energetic, zany, ultraviolent rollercoster I saw in all his previous projects- \\"Resevoir Dogs,\\" \\"True Romance,\\" \\"From Dusk till Dawn,\\" and \\"Pulp Fiction.\\" But his latest film, \\"Jackie Brown\\" left me wanting more. I think Tarintino purposley tried to screw his die-hard fans with this movie. It's the opposite of his other films. It's a logically told, slow moving, even DULL mix of mystery, satire, action, and campy comedy. It's complexity actually hurts it. The running time is much to long and it never really gets intresting. The cast is really good, but other than that you get nothing you've come to expect out of a Quinton Tarintino film."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WELL WENT DRY...","review":"THis is the last movie I watched by Tarantino. It seems to me that his formula of cloning old scenes and ideas from older movies, comic books and TV shows are beginning to seem repetitive. He's a very limited director, who had a brief stardom then went back to the place he belongs. THis movie is boring, although no doubt the actors are great. I'm only sorry for De Niro being in his ridiculous small part as a little bad guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not widescreen, less than fullscreen.","review":"I love this movie, but the widescreen version isn't widescreen, it is fullscreen with black bars that erase the top and bottom of the picture. See also my reviews of the Shawshank Redemption DVD as it is also flawed. Compare the two versions of Jackie Brown. It is easy enough to see in the scene where Bridgit Fonda services Robert DeNiro. Her buns disappear in the widescreen version but are fully visible in the fullscreen version. I took both these \\"widescreen\\" items back to the point of purchase, demonstrated the difference and was promptly granted a refund. We should check our 1.85-1 ratio videos to see what other movies are flawed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality","review":"Product was not 100% in good condition.

Also there is nonremovable scuff/scratch mark in the inner circle of DVD on the back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sickening -","review":"Movie was boring and pointless. Academy-Award Winner - Wasted Talent Category - Robert De Niro. Overall demeanor was repulsive. If this is how minority people live, or even what they think is entertaining, there's absolutely no question in my mind why their relative arrest records are so high."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jackie Brown Gets Down","review":"It's a shame to prominently feature such a negative and dismissive review of 'Jackie Brown' because it really is Quentin Tarrantino's finest hour. This film is not Quentin's take on Blaxploitation films, as so many movie critics seem to assume. This is a very soulful movie about survival in all of it's forms. Most of the characters in this movie are just trying to get by, to cling to what they have because it's all they know. This probably resonates a bit more for those of us who are a little more mature, or have ever felt trapped by the circumstances of our own lives. Bottom line though, this movie holds up because it is a well told, thoroughly engrossing, incredibly well acted story. Robert Deniro is hilarious, Sam Jackson is evil incarnate, and Robert Forster and Pam Grier are positively luminous. Don't let that review discourage you. This is a very worthy and entertaining film."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Lewis are you a sweating?\\"","review":"I loved this film, from Samual L Jackson's whacky pony tail to Bridget Fonda's sexy beach girl, de Niro is great as the \\"dont push me cause I'm close to the edge\\" Lewis and the black Femme Fatale - Jackie Brown.Great soul soundtrack, pacy plot, immpeccably casted and scripted - why is it not 5 stars?Well despite all of the above all we get is entertainment, which is fine but dont expect any philosophy or meaning here, it is just 100% good fun.

Terrific cast (for the most part), but a deeply flawed film. Forster is great, Jackson is great, De Niro is De Niro, Fonda is less horrible than usual but Pam Grier is a cipher. Touted as her 'comeback' the simple fact remains that the reason we see so little of her on the screen is that she really isn't a very interesting actress. But to be fair she sure can light a cigarette. And how about that Tarantino? What about the middle class white boy video clerk fixation on superfly black gangster stereotypes? Anyone but me a little offended?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A more sedate Tarantino","review":"This is not the usual Tarantino film in that there is not much action and not the usual buckets of blood, but it is a very good movie. Samuel L. Jackson plays a gun-seller with many small-time crooks working for him like Robert DeNiro, Bridget Fonda and Pam Grier. Pam Grier works as a flight attendant on a small airline that flies to Mexico which is where Jackson's money is hidden. Grier gets arrested by an ATF agent while carrying $50,000 of Jackson's money. Along with her bail bondsman Robert Forster, Grier concocts a plan where she has both the ATF and Jackson believing she is working with them. This is a well written and acted movie. It is also a testament to how well-made it is that while this a long movie and is very slow-paced, I wasn't bored as I usually would be with a film that took its time like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quentin was in it!!!","review":"Not Tarantino's finest, by far, but Tarantino's worst can stand up to most screen writers and directors any day. A fairly typical Tarantino movie, with a fairly typical Tarantino cast, with typical Tarantino dialogue. A good movie, but not his best. By the way, Tarantino's cameo in this movie is on an answering machine. Granted, it isn't Quentin in the flesh, but he still makes his presence known."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another exceptional movie from QT","review":"Tarantino has the near impossible task of trying to top himself from Pulp Fiction. With Jackie Brown, he has proven how talented he is by taking someone elses material-Elmore Leonard & putting his trademark on it with snappy dialogue. Another stellar performance by Samuel Jackson, & it would have been nice to have had QT do a small cameo. Technically, he's in the movie, he's the voice message on Pam Grier's answering machine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!!!","review":"It was an excellent portrayal of a life of crime and how the employee can sometimes outwit the employer.

Unfortunately, the movie moved a little slow for me, though I've seen \\"Kill Bill\\" & loved it. That's why I'm giving it 4 stars. Better than \\"Scarface.\\" That movie was a piece of crap. Rated R, but should've been PG-13."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I gave Tarantino a chance and he blew it big time. The movie was boring, pointless, and an insult to Elmore Leonard.

Tarantino had no sense of pacing whatsoever on this disastrous excursion. The movie moves at the speed of mammal evolution.Quentin failed at adapting the book. He sucked all the life from the novel then filmed the corpse.

I can't believe Tarantino is capable of such garbage. Nothing happens!!! It's like 2.5 hrs long and nothing happens. Is that even possible? Brutally boring. How does anyone rate this movie highly? Maybe it's a movie where you have to be a book nerd who liked the transation to film? All I know is NOTHING HAPPENS! Q: What is the plot? A. Who knows. If someone asks me what this movie was about - I say 'It's about NOTHING'. And not in a good Seinfeld way. Sad really. I think Tarantino tried to make a cool movie. But along the way he forgot that a movie needs to tell a story. This movie is like watching a slideshow - and who the hell needs that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Name of the blues song?","review":"Awesome movie with an awesome soundtrack. One question though, in the scene where Sam Jackson and Chris Tucker are walking out of the apartment and down to his car to get in the trunk, there is a bluesy song playing in the background, it is also played as you select features on the dvd menu, does anyone know the name of the song and who plays it? It is not on the soundtrack cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Movie","review":"I enjoyed it when I saw us in the theatre and had it on DVD and lent it out I guess? So I have been adding Blu-Ray to my collection in particular movies when I hear or read about decent transfers to Blu Ray either exceptional audio or video. This is not the best video transfer, but audio is an impovement. And still a great film with great acting and direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie.","review":"I think the main reason many critics and audiences spoke so low of this movie when it first came out was because so many people were expecting a \\"Pulp Fiction, part II.\\" I still like Pulp better, but Jackie Brown is still a very good movie. The performances are top notch, and the story line is steady and gripping. I will admit to finding it a bit long, but in end it all seemed to work out for the best. The abrupt ending was quick and eqasy and very likeable. The characters seemed real and very down to earth, even the ones we grew to hat. As always, Sam Jackson gives a fine performances, Pam Greer is irresistable, and even Bridget Fonda, who I normally hate, was fun to watch. I thought Robert Forster was great and extremely belivalbe as a simple bail bondsman who falls for Greer's Jackie. I was surprised to see Bobby DeNiro with such a small part, with such little dialogue, but he worked it well. This is a very good movie that I highly recomend, with a warning to be patient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elmore Leonard + Quentin Tarantino = a great movie","review":"Jackie Brown...what can I say? Excellent. I loved it. Elmore Leonard is the BEST crime writer ever, and Quentin Tarantino is the best crime director ever...so, they are such a great match. I won't give anything away, but the final scene at the mall had me on the edge of my seat. The music is perfect for the climax. I love Elmore Leonard, and Jackie Brown is one of the best Leonard movie adaptations I've seen. Some other good Elmore Leonard book adaptations: Stick, Out of Sight, Get Shorty. Another plus is that I've heard that Tarantino has bought the rights to 4 more of Elmore Leonards books: one, a western, called Forty Lashes Less One; and three crime novels, Bandits, Killshot, and Freaky Deaky. I can't wait until that happens! Jackie Brown is no Pulp Fiction, so Fiction fans may be dissapointed, but if you watch with an open mind, and you are a crime movie fan, you'll love Jackie Brown."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Tarantino's Best","review":"Well in my opinion, this is Tarantino's best piece of work. He met Pam Grier at a party in LA and said to her that he wanted to use her in his next film. Well, this is what happened. He got her career back on groove and showed off his sophistication by making this mind-blowing movie! I sure waited a long tome for this to come out on dvd but when it did a couple of years ago, I immediately bought it!Yes, it is slower-paced than Pulp Fiction but I promise that if you give this film the chance it deserves you will absolutely love it! I am younger than the cast here and I didn't even know who Pam Grier was but was completely blown away with her performance as Jackie Brown. Keaton, Fonda, DeNiro, and of CORSE Samuel L. were outstanding in their roles. This film is SERIOUSLY under-rated!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Tarantino","review":"A great cast that makes a classic Tarantino movie.

Grier is lovely and cocky in the title role, and Sam Jackson as Ordell... gets more and more evil every time I see him! DeNiro is sublime as Louis, an ex-con, and Robert Forster (Nom. Best Supporting Actor) is wonderful as the bail bondsman, Jackie's tool to get $500,000!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The music grabs your attention, casting and acting is superb","review":"This movie will entertain you from start to finish,the music is genius, and the casting was calculated, in the Tarantino style. Watching Deniro, in a supporting role takes some getting use to, he pulls it off with class and artistry. The ending is not predictable and does not dissapoint. Samuel Jackson deserved an award for his acting, but then he usually does. If I would have paid to see this on the big screen I would have walked out feeling like I got my moneys worth, that is very rare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movies that make you go 'hmmmm'","review":"I read with great interest the 4 and 5 stars reviews. I liked Tarantino's first 2 movies but would have been terribly disappointed if he had made something close. So I give some kudos to him for trying something new. What is similar is his desire to tell a story through dialogue and circumstances. What I didn't feel were the accolades others have bestowed - interesting story, strong characters, etc. I feel like I should go back and watch this again just to make sure I'm not losing my mind. Quite honestly I was bored. None of the characters seemed interesting and I had no emotional attachment to any of them. The story seemed to plod. The 2 stars are really for the acting which is well done. But you can't act yourself out of bad writing and direction. Maybe I'll go back and rent this. Surely I'm missing something?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE TARANTINO BUT READ THIS REVIEW!","review":"Hi. This is a great Quentin Tarantino movie by all means. The dialoge is good, the acting is good, the story is good and it is shot very good. For the people who don't really like the Tarantino violence then this is a good flick for you. The only thing is, is that this movie seems long. I know Pulp Fiction is long but that movie is getting places and its enjoyable to watch the characters doing everyday stuff and its exciting to watch them for a long time (Ex. Bruce Willis' character walking from his car to his apartment to get his fathers watch). This is just a long movie that tends to drag just a little to long. It's still a great movie and it's very much worth it to wait for the great ending. Quentin Tarantino is my hero and I love his movies. He has inspired me to becoe a film maker. -Taylor J. age 14."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"After watching movies like 'Pulp Fiction' and 'From Dusk Til Dawn' and knowing Quentins way of directing I was dissapointed in 'Jackie Brown'.

It's not one of his best!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it.","review":"After seeing the brilliant \\"Pulp fiction\\" I went and had a look at the trailer for \\"Jackie Brwon\\", it looked good -- but think again. Trailers can sometimes be wrong. It was meant that this would have more action than Pulp fiction, but this didn't have any sort od action what so ever. The cast is quite nice though, Quentin always knows to pick the right people, they played their interesting characters well. The story was quite cool, but it jjust got to complicated. There was lots of dialogue, but it wasn't interesting at all. Un-intersting dialogue=boring. The movie dragged a lot too, it seemed like Quentin was making the film long on purpose. If you're expecting anything like \\"Pulp fiction\\" then you won't like this. It's nothing like it. I wouldn't buy this, Pulp fiction fans. Probably just Tarantino fans. However, Chris Tucker did shine some light in the movie, but he isn't in it for long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Voice","review":"I purchased this CD upon its original release and it has been close by ever since.

Baldwin displays the mind of an individual reluctantly discovering a new piece of his identity. The work is thoroughly 'gay' insofar as it adopts an incredibly diverse personality. It seems impossible to say plainly what a gay man is, and Baldwin's narrative testifies to this impossibility. His narrator is observant, yet obscure. He shows us almost everything we might imagine ourselves to see, and yet the novel offers no conclusions."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not gay but...","review":"I had to read this book for an college English class that was part of LGBT studies...Normally I don't read gay media products, I'm a married father of two with many gay friends though...What a great and tragic story, along the lines of Romero and Juliet...This guy can write some beautiful lines...an amazing book...I actually read it twice, partly for my assignment related to the book but also this is just a great book...at 169 pages it's pretty quick and it just flows...well done and now I will try and read more of his books...I just wish he wrote more science fiction:P"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another James Baldwin Classic","review":"This is one of James Baldwin's best novel. The young man's struggle with his sexuality and the person who loves and ultimately pays the price for his struggle will make you cry and keep reading through your tears. Buy the book and everything else James Baldwin has written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good at all","review":"I had heard a lot of hype about this novel, but it just didn't live up to it. I have to say that I agree with the reviewer who said that this book gets praise because the characters are white. While Baldwin does deal with some fundamental relationship issues, his knowledge of audience -to be blunt-- believing that only white gays read books in the 50's- leaves the book hollow at it's core. I was always told that great literature comes from finding the universal in the specific, and Baldwin can't find the specific here because he is too afraid to present inner thoughts that could have lifted this novel up.To the other reviewer, color does have a lot to do with Baldwin's literature, and it does influence his writing. I am an amatuer Baldwin scholar, and I know his workd well, race should have been in this book. The fact that it is absent here, to me, says that his heart was not fully in this novel, only his head. And that's not great literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another view","review":"I had to read this book for class, otherwise I would have thrown it in the trash. People pay money for this?Sure, Baldwin can write, but I feel like I need a shower after Giovanni's Room. It's not the sex; there is hardly any in the book. It's the depravity.People hate themselves, hate others, try to drink it away and then go home to a nasty room where no one cleans. Lovely.I feel like I did after watching Pulp Fiction or the Deer Hunter. I kept waiting for some redeeming character to step forward to pull this creepy book out of the muck.If you feel like hating yourself, or want a taste of suicidal tendencies, read this book.Yeah, he's good writer, but please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the book without knowing the writer","review":"Picked up the book in a shop in Paris.

This society makes those people feel alienated as well as uncomfortale about their prefference.

It's a great read for anyone who is interested in LGBT studies/literature. It can be boring, but groundbreaking for its time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A literary masterpiece","review":"This novel, for me, is a masterpiece in literature. When I read Baldwin's works, I am not as swept away by the struggles of race or gender as I am by the genius of his writing. Baldwin was primarily seen as a social commentator for his time, place and circumstances, but he was more lurid, in my opinion, in his observance and narrative of the human condition and struggles of us all. This novel is stunning, candid and beautiful. Baldwin has delicately placed each word to give us a lasting sensation of literary satisfaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Baldwin's Best Work","review":"Giovanni's Room is one of James Baldwin's best work of literature. In the book he expresses all the circumstance that went along with homosexuality in the 1950's set in Paris. His technique in writing the book is so great that if a person is not paying a lot of attention they probably wouldn't even know that the book is about homosexuality. Baldwin makes homosexuality seem like a simple everyday thing. He is not an explicit, provocative writer, yet you feel and see everything that he wrote. Instead of being all about physical acts, in the novel, he more discusses the emotional. Baldwin told of how homosexuality not only affects the person dealing with their sexuality, but the people that surround that person. He wrote of how most homosexuals have to live hiding who they really are just so that society will accept them."},{"rating":"1","title":"And the point was....?","review":"James Baldwin is an overrated writer in my opinion. I've read three of his \\"best\\" works and am not just basing this sentiment on one novel. Giovanni's room begins excellently; it vividly captures the mood of Paris and its more colorful characters. It presents the inner conflicts of Jacques and the main character well. But by the middle, it goes downhill with stereotyping (Giovanni is the proverbial loudmouth chauvanist Italian who's prone to fits of rage and crying; Hella is the spoiled, scattered-brain blond with no backbone; and Jacques is the sad, empty queen). In the end the story becomes a melo/crime drama. And what was the point? The main character was always a cold, detached soul that never came to any realization at the end, wasn't changed, and made no decisions about his life and treatment of people. Even THAT wasn't made the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Just Above My Head\\" is FAR, FAR BETTER!!!","review":"While \\"Giovanni's Room\\" is a fine novel, Baldwin does a much better job with the themes presented here (identity, sexuality, place, etc.) in his later novel, \\"Just Above My Head.\\" My personal opinion is that \\"Giovanni's Room\\" has received such positive praise and hype in the gay (white) community becasue the characters are white. \\"Just Above My Head\\" is ignored and bastardized because it dares to challenge conventional (racist) white gay norms by showing clearly that black men can and do love other balck men. Because \\"Giovanni's Room\\" falls into one of the two acceptable camps (no black gays at all or black gays with white lovers) it is accepted. Baldwin's writing skills are strong here, however, and his use of the European backdrop is excellent. The confusion, anguish, and tension that Baldwin is able to generate in relatively few pages is truly outstanding. A worthwhile read, to be sure, but not the author's best waxing on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad (Two and a HALF stars)","review":"I agree with one reviewer in saying that the book is not really about race or gender, but passion and pain, loss and \\"what if's\\". And I think that's why it fell short of my expectations. While you are told that the two main men feel this passion for each other, it's hard to internalize it because the writer has basically ignored what should be a necessary interrogation into the complete aspects, not just the nature, of their relationship. We get a summary of what their love was. I couldn't help wanting to know more - more about the room; about what they did together in a sexual, and day to day sense; about everything! Perhaps the characterization needed to be slightly deeper. Let's hear a bit more about Giovanni at least; it's apparent the main character can't describe himself better, being as he is completely unaware of his true nature. A bit more description and angst and this book would have had a bit more oompf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsafe -","review":"I took this seat to a safety check provided by police officers and was told that this seat has caused a ton of problems installing into cars.

Our Sequoia supports the LATCH system, and after reading the instructions found in the carrier, my husband was able to install the base SECURELY in the backseat. It moves no more than .5 inch in either direction. The trick is, you have to push down on the back of the base, and pull the belt system tight. We also found the red elevator to be a deterence in keeping the base secure. So, we keep it retracted.I will admit that the instructions are tricky. There are too many sets of directions that are not consistent with each other.Other than spending an hour figuring out how to install the base correctly, we're happy with this system."},{"rating":"1","title":"unsafe, do not waste your money","review":"I fell in love with this stroller when I saw it.

This was my 1st child and didn't know what to look for in a carseat. This seat is AWFUL. It is extreamly heavy and bulky. The carseat base is very unsafe. It is so thin and narrow that nomatter how tight we put the seatbelt around it the carseat would still move all around. It was so bad the hospital would not let us leave until we had buckled the carseat in itself with the seat buckle. Another very unhandy feature is that you can't hook this seat into shopping carts. There are no hooks that latch onto the cart seat. This means that everytime you go into a store that you will need a cart for you will need to put your baby into a Snuggly or something like that. This adds about and extra 15-20 minutes onto a shopping trip not to mention wakes up a sleeping baby. This is the worst seat. The stroller isn't bad but not worth dealing with the carseat. Don't waste your money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nurse Mom states \\"NOT SAFE\\"","review":"My husband picked out this travel system because of the Eddie Bauer name & we both liked the pattern. It was very difficult to fold this down & set it up. I practiced several times before the baby came so hopefully I could opperate it. When we delivered, the hospital had a nurse who would come out to your car to check to make sure your car seat was safely installed. We took them up on this offer!! We were very disappointed to see how unsafe this car seat was. It would slide side to side & was not secure. In a collision, this car seat would not be safe for our child.We took our baby home from the hospital in it, then immediately took it back to exchange it for something safe!!! My best advice- Buy Graco Snugride!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous","review":"Do not buy! The infant car seat is not safe at all! My poor son flipped over in it when it was securley fastened.

I was so excited to finally have a new, updated carseat. After installing the base in my car, I was quickly surprised to how wobbly the base and carseat was, at first I thought it was normal, until my 6 month old has flipped TWICE while I was driving. Thank god he was not hurt. As of now I am trying to get the base recalled. I urge no one to buy this model. It is very unsafe and the stroller is a whole different issue, it is very hard to open. It's very disturbing to know that my hand me down is much safer than a new model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money!!","review":"I bought this a few months before my son was born, and it was the worst purchase I made. For starters, it was very difficult to install thanks to the confusing instructions. We ended up making it secure by using every seat belt in the back seat. It is also very difficult to strap my son into the car seat. I faced another problem when trying to use the stroller alone. I am not sure who thought it was a good idea to make the seat recline only. My son hates to ride in his stroller because he can't see anything lying so far back and the canopy doesn't extend far enough to keep the sun out of his face. This stroller is hard to push with two hands, and nearly impossible with just one. I drive a Pathfinder, and the stroller still takes up quite a bit a space.I am now stuck with a product a hate, and I have to buy a new stroller. Save your money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"We bought this travel system for our first son. Besides it being so heavy, it is unsafe. We could never get the carseat to secure correctly. When going around sharp corners the carseat would either crash into the door or fall on it's side. I could have dealt with the weight of the system if it was safe. The stroller was okay, again heavy but okay. The only downfall was that I had a hard time getting the carrier to lock into the stroller. Thank goodness I had the forsight to buy a protection warrenty because I bought this 2 months before my son was born. I returned it with no questions asked & purchased a Chicco Cortina set. Love that one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware...Try it out before buying!!!!","review":"We purchased this travel system because we liked how sturdy it seemed. My husband thinks the car seat/carrier is too heavy, but to me that makes it seem more sturdy. I LOVE the stroller. It is extremely easy to maneuver, and very user-friendly! We had absolutely no trouble when our son was small, but now, the car seat will tip over when you go around a corner. No matter which way we install this seat (seat belt or tether straps), we cannot get it tight enough. I think it must be our car (we have a montero), because not everyone has this trouble. I highly recommend that you try it in your car before you purchase this. As any parent would agree, the safety of your child is most important!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT USE THIS ITEM!!!!!!!!","review":"This has got to be to worst design I have ever seen. Who would ever think a round object would work well against a flat surface? Yes it's a very beautiful system, but the carseat base is absoutly UNSAFE. Upon putting the base into the car even with car seat anchors built into the car the base will slide out of the anchor harness. Once installed, the base would slide completely from side to side. I am appauled that this is still being sold! We were actually told by Babies R Us employees that the actual car seat had been recalled but not the travel system, which contains the recalled carseat. Please do not put your precious cargo into this very UNSAFE carseat.

The kind firefighter tried to fasten the base, but it was so flimsy that it moved from side to side. My husband and I were told that this car base/seat was very UNSAFE and that they (the fire department)have yet to find a way to get this product to work. The safety of your child is number one and I was completly shocked that a product like this can be put on the market for others to purchase when safty obviously is not a concern to this company!!! Luckily I was able to return not only the travel system but the extra base that I purchased as well. When I called Babies R Us and went there to drop this wasteful product off, I wasn't surprised to see the large amount of others that were returning this as well!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird and Difficult Car Seat base","review":"Infant car seat and stroller are very nice, but car seat base is another story.

In general, I recommend these texts. That said, I used this as a supplement to a DE class I taught and it was such a pain. The notation is nonstandard, symbols for Bessel functions are downright wrong and things like this. The application exercises were more focused on converting from English units to SI units than on the variety of application problems. To add to the fun, the cgs system is also thrown into the mix. Granted, engineers and the like need to be able to switch, but that's not the point of a DE class. It is nice to have sections on the Laplace transform and first-order systems and most exercises are ok, if repetitive. Students will have to work hard to keep the notation straight and not confuse themselves. I wouldn't use this in another class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-Aggrandizing Apologia","review":"In these pages, Mr. Hentoff relentlessly promotes himself, without even attempting to reconcile his contradictory positions.

This meant the book was it, and as a book, it is BORING. The authors convey information in the form of bulletined lists, without elaboration.

While there's nothing theologically wrong with the CDs, I didn't like the music at all. Frankly, I was shocked at how outdated it sounded. There's only one song I can stand to listen to out of the entire thing. Small children may go for it, but it will drive adults crazy! Also, I was expecting there to be actual Bible verses, word for word, being sung, and thereby teach Scripture memory. This, too, was a disappointment.

It's sad, but yes, that's how many times ive watched it. ;) I would very much appreciate it if they would finally release it to bluray. There are other movies out there that I would definitely not have cared to see on bluray and they released them, and this one is a 5 star drama/comedy, you name it! It has most everything!

Juliette Lewis and Giovanni Ribisi are exceptional in this quirky tale of love and determination. With Tom Skerritt never more likable and Diane Keaton never more annoying(on purpose)this story of a young retarded women's determination to be independent is sometimes funny, insightful and heartbreaking! More importantly than her independence is her need to get from under her mother's thumb. She finds a friend in Giovanni Ribisi's character of Daniel and the two fall in love.

As a special education major, I was touched by it's reality and bluntness. Some say that it was sugar-coated, but my peers and I feel that this movie speaks to us. The time that Carla runs away from home back to the boarding school is a testament to the way that she feels at home, that it is not a home. When Carla helps Danny at registration, you know she is a caring person who will survive in this world. She is ready to become independent and that is the best thing for her. I applaud the director, writers and Diane Keaton, for her role as an overprotective mother, which most mothers are, especially if they are a parent of a mentally-challenged child. The movie showed the benefits Carla has and Danny does not. This movie is a very good way to gently introduce people to the mentally-challenged population."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Even though this movie is star packed, we all know that doesn't necessarly lead to a good movie.

Never rent this, I am glad I never paid money for this movie, instead I only lost 2 hours watchin cable.

I always liked the GoBots more than Transformers, because Leader-One (both sizes) could beat the diodes out of Optimus Prime.So, instead of watching a movie with the boyfriend from \\"My Two Dads\\" pretending to have Down's Syndrome, you should try to find a copy of a GoBots adventure.

However, the movie succeeded only in trivializing these challenges by turning them into a series of slapstick, buffoonish situations. Certainly the mentally challenged experience difficulties with many aspects of life; however, this does not mean that they completely lack all judgement and sense of social norms.

Dahlberg's intent seems to have been as much to display his bulging erudition and arch, archaic way with words as to decry man's slavery to the sexual urge. His ostensible subject is often buried beneath an avalanche of classical, historical, and anthropological allusions, but at least the book is riddled with eccentric epithets along the lines of \\"Man is double, and who may know his heart: he is a moral hermaphrodite.\\" The author's tone is judgmental and defiant throughout, but that doesn't energize the book.

You will notice in the Amazon listing there is no mention of the artists on the first TP, only that there is a new cover by Gary Frank, the only highlight for Born in Fire.Dollar for dollar your payoff is Supreme Power."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing read","review":"I became a fan of J.Michael Strazinsky with Babylon 5.

I highly recommend this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Cup of Tea","review":"I found this book very dull, so much so I gave up half way through it. The three days I was readingthe book felt like the longest \\"month\\" of my life. I have to admit that the book was given to me; I did not go out looking for it. Becuase it was given to me, I felt a responsiblity to keep reading. This in not an area I am interested in which is a bit part of my review.

No wonder Robert Carlyle didn't come to Hollywood to do movies. He can't enunciate! He peaked with Full Monty! It's a ridiculous plot!I bought it because I do like Carlyle on Once Upon A Time but not this. This movie is stupid and a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and 'lost in..lack of translation'","review":"I thought it would be a nice love story, but it is hopelessly depressing and not a happy movie. The worst thing about the movie is that somewhere in the middle; the director stop translating the spanish dialogue into english, and left us non-speaking spanish to figured out what was being said. The best part was the ending. No place like home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning! Monetarist madness!","review":"When the ECB's Chief Economist, Otmar Issing, wrote a book on the Bank's monetary policy, he made no mention at all of the policy's impact on jobs or industry. He larded the book with praise for the monetarist economist Milton Friedman, whose well-known and disastrous impact on Chile's economy was, oddly, not referred to in the book.Thatcher's monetarist fallacy was that the battle against inflation was the overriding economic aim, because low or zero inflation would produce higher growth. But in the real world, other things being equal, low inflation was not the cause of high growth but the effect of low growth, and high inflation was not the cause of low growth but the effect of high growth. Monetarism's battle against inflation was a policy of deflation, forcing unemployment and low wages on the working class. So, just as Thatcher therefore became the deadly enemy of the working class, so now joining the euro has become the main threat to us."},{"rating":"2","title":"A midsummer's night rain.","review":"One night two summer's ago I wanted to go for a ride in the middle of the night. It was raining and that was perfect. I grabbed Perdition City. I turned my car on and put the album in. I left. I drove around downtown and let the rain accumulate before wiping it away with my wipers each time and with the music playing it gave it this sort of surreal feel. I didn't feel like I was apart of the world. It was odd. The lights had a different meaning as they were skewed both by the droplets of water on my windows, but also with my aural senses. It was a night I won't soon forget. I drove around and around and around, the greens the reds the yellows all filtering in so bright so alive. Ulver _Perdition City_ is the album to listen to while driving on a rainy night. It's epic and dark. Evil and uplifting. Free and concise. Everything is meticulously placed yet not forced. Imaginative. This is a masterpiece of modern music and highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Spirit of a Great Artist","review":"While Vincent van Gogh has always been one of my favorite artists, this compilation of his letters combined with a more in-depth study of his work has intensified my appreciation of him as both an artist and a person. I've always felt it was impossible to separate this particular artist from his work and reading his letters has led me to a better understanding of why this is. These letters beautifully capture his soul and spirit and reveal him as the caring, expressive and socially aware person that he was. The combination of strength of character and vulnerability expressed in these letters explain both the intensity and sensitivity of his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"intimate look into the artistic process","review":"this collection of van gogh's letters to his brother Theo both captivated me and broke my heart. Such an intimate look into the vulnerability of the artistic soul. Those who appreciate the artistic process will love this collection of letters. You don't need to be an admirer of Van Gogh's to appreciate this; but you will walk away admiring the man behind the sunflowers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great selection of letters for the time-wary.","review":"One thing in another review I read that really sold this collection to me, was the fact that they're not making him out to be some insane martyr for the sake of art, which he most definitely was not. While I'd love the complete view on his life, I have neither the time nor effort for his complete letters, and this book seems to be a fairly good representative sample of his letters. I personally read these to watch his progression into an artist, and how he saw and overcame certain things."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Self-Portrait in Post","review":"These letters provide a more intimate look into the person of Vincent van Gogh than any college course you'll ever take. In going through the book, the reader gets a real sense that by the end the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. This collection isn't an oversimplified summary of a life, but rather a look at Vincent as a complicated soul with many layers to his personality, like most of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Font Formatting is Flawed","review":"The Letters of Vincent Van Gogh (Penguin Classics eBook)I was prepared to purchase the Kindle version of this volume.

Apparently the design was changed by some female virgin who doesn't know male physiology and moved the gap so high that you have to lower them in order to do your number 1 while standing up. i really hate that, and returned my last batch the moment I realized what had happened to make them claim them to be \\"Gapless\\". Actually that name is correct for this design -- there is no gap where you have to have it. Since that change to a \\"panties\\" design as I see it, I have been unable to find the original design any further, making me very frustrated.What can we real males do to get them to offer their original so-successful design. Lacking that, does anyone know of another equally good brand that doesn't suffer from this fatal flaw?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Full-Cut Boxer","review":"Been wearing them for about 10 years now - never liked the feel of briefs. Hanes boxers fit & feel great. They are nice and baggy with plenty of leg & seat room. They also last a long time & hold up well in the washer. My only advice is to size-UP when you order. I got a 34 waist & only wear size LARGE. Med is too snug . Hanes boxers are classic comfort for the guy that has to feel some slack in the sack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fly opening is too short","review":"I'm used to manufacturers/retailers constantly cutting corners and cheapening the product. Never mind the inferior cotton/poly blend, the lack of elastic in the waistband, the limited of choice in sizing, I expected all that at this price. What is truly astounding and unforgivable is an opening that is does not come down far enough to function for its intended purpose. Another reviewer flagged this, but I didn't quite believe it. Here you have a major brand name in underwear that cannot design a simple product. These shorts are an insult to the customer.

And OMG, I thought that it was the most adorable movie ever. Through these 2 hours I've grown to feel for the Toothless and fell in love with this cure dragon. Separate thing to mention that the face expressions of the dragon are something else. Without saying a word you can read his thoughts and emotions. My favorite part was when he was offering the boy his half of fish to eat. But really really wanted to eat it himself.... I am pretty sure I had a huge smile on my face too.

Once you accept it, you become unique! Like any animation movie - there was a message in the movie and a happy ending. Dreamworks did a great job with the plot and its characters. I could easily recognize the deep voice of one of the Vikings - Gerard Butler. Losers became heros and the \\"dangerous\\" dragons turned into adorable pets. What more could I ask. ;) Overall a fun movie and would recommend to watch. The quality of the movie was great on my TV. It was easy to setup my amazon account on my player and watch from Amazon On Demand. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Dragons","review":"This is a very funny motion picture. They've taken a lot of the precepts we have about dragons and blown them right out of the water. I watched with nieces and nephews, ages 8-13 and everybody was really entertained. We enjoyed the extras on the disk as well. Highly recommended, a good time for kids and adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"2-disc combo","review":"The movie itself I loved. I'd seen the film in theaters and just had to have it, so I bought the 2 disc combo pack; I now regret it.I was under the impression that the second disc was bonus materials and a second short film by Dreamworks. Instead I spent more time then I'd like to say just trying to find the menu on the second disc and finally found no second film and some really weak bonus features.I'm left with a second disc of no value. I recommend that the 2 disc combo be avoided for this film. Don't get me wrong I loved the movie, just stick to the single disc. This second disc isn't worth the extra money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheapest Around","review":"Daughter wanted this for Christmas. Searched the internet and Amazon was the cheapest around. Good movie and my kid has watched it over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"There be dragons","review":"How to Train Your Dragon has all of the best qualities of Pixar/Dreamworks movies: the lovable characters, great CG graphics, and comedy. While the overall design of the dragons is comic, their skin looks incredibly realistic. I did however take one star off for lack of originality. In many respects, the plot is pretty predictable and the same as many other \\"boy-meets-the-enemy\\" type movies. The boy befriends the dragon a bit too easily, first with food then healing his broken tail fin. Overall, it's a cute story, and families will surely enjoy it, but I don't know how much enduring appeal it will have."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"Came in perfect condition and even early, My daughter was so excited and has watched it at least 20 times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movies at a Great Price!","review":"The movie is a favorite of my children and at the great price on Amamzon we are able to watch it in Blue-Ray at home and the regular DVD in the Car.

Now that ive seen it i wish i had taken the kids to see it in theaters. The characters are wonderful the plot moves quickly but not to quickly. Its a movie i can watch again and again. The message in the movie is great for ppl of all ages.The dragons were i think the best part of the movie they way they were designed for the film was great. I think this would be a great addition to anyone's media library and im sure it will be one to be watched again and again through out the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Movie","review":"Great, cute movie.

What if he punched her repeatedly? What if he hit her hard enough with a blunt object to bounce it several feet off of her flesh? What, then, if the female lead came to love the man who abused her in these ways? Would this film be good entertainment for your young daughter?It's terrifying that a female treating a male character the same way qualifies as children's entertainment. Unfortunately, How to Train Your Dragon openly depicts this kind of abusive relationship as a happy relationship."},{"rating":"1","title":"They changed the price too quickly","review":"I put How To Train Your Dragon on Blu-Ray w/ CD bonus from Amazon into my cart. I was just looking for one more thing to buy and during that time they changed the price. It was $17 something and now it's $26.99 which is more than what Walmart has it for.

Why does the dragon look and smell like a lizard? Black dragons are supposed to be cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not full screen!","review":"For those who screen size matters, this film is not wide screen. Obviously for the great majority this is not an issue as only one reviewer complained about it. Watching a film in 2/3 of the display real estate and nobody complaining is amazing. No wonder they keep formatting it like that. I tried all possible ways to adjust it (tv,player,disk) with no success. It ruined the experience for me.On the other hand the 3d is almost perfect and overall I give it 4 stars. I learned a lesson alright. Next time look for the aspect ratio and check reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie.","review":"This is a great movie for kids. A great film for the whole family. This movie is good for kids and adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"The dragon characters definitely make the movie. One does warm up to the human characters by the end of the movie but it's the dragons that take on some of the characteristics of our everyday dogs and cats that are great fun and laughing out loud. The movie is of the good kind where the boy learns about morals and ethics and responsibility. Definitely worth watching!"},{"rating":"2","title":"3d effect","review":"Bought this movie for the 3d effect. It was a good price and received very timely.

Every morning, she asks \\" I watch Dragon!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Was that \\"Train\\" or \\"Tame\\"?","review":"This was a great film. The story is simple and plays out in a rather straightforward fashion with few real surprises. However, in this case that's not bad. The writers clearly gave the story some heart and then went out to capture the hearts of the viewers. Despite being animated the characters feel real with emotions and feelings.There are not a lot of extras, but the ones on the DVD are interesting and the interviews demonstrate the love and care that went into this movie. Dreamworks created a winner here, this is definitely a movie to have in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"I watched it 7 times and itching to see it more.","review":"I've watched it seven times in 3 months(I usually watch a movie once and forget it), and I make all my friends watch it. It is a fantastic movie about friendship and being the odd one out. There are only a few points in the show where they could have made the movie a little more believable. But this movie is one of my favorite as well as my husband's! There are some little added gems that you can notice, like that they made the main character left-handed.I really wish I could have seen this in 3D in theaters. Get the BLU-RAY and get a nice LED TV to really enjoy the graphics.Every parent I know says this is one of their children's FAVORITE movies. And all the parents love it too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this dragon","review":"This movie is a wonderful animated feature that I've watched several times with my entire family and we all enjoy it.

My daughter is only 20 months and doesn't really pay attention to the T.V. or any movies yet, but when I put 'How to Train Your Dragon' in, she actually watched some of it, and laughed at the dragons. My husband and I also loved it too. It had heartwarming moments and made us laugh too.

Loved the story and characters. Not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this movie","review":"The animation was amazing, the action scenes were exciting, and the plot was fresh and enjoyable. Good family fun. Kids will love it, and there is plenty for adults to enjoy as well. Saw it in the theater in IMAX and just watched it for the first time at home in HD on the home theater. Both experiences were excellent, but completely different. In IMAX, you are so immersed in movie, with things going on all around you, that you can miss how beautifully animated this film is. If you are like me, and saw it previously in 3D, then watch it again for the first time. Highly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Viking Tale","review":"Yes, it's for kids, but it has a certain charm and undercurrent that adults may appreciate. It starts a bit slowly, but gathers momentum. I also like the ending a lot. It shows that things don't always end perfectly, that adventure can be dangerous, that there may be a large price to pay for being different or for trying something that no one has ever tried before. But it also gives the message that even bad things can have a plus side. For older kids the message may be too simplistic. For little kids, however, the ending shouldn't be too scary and gives a positive twist. I liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie","review":"Great movie. Sure, it was made for kids, but there's plenty for adults to enjoy as well. If you're into fantasy and sci-fi, you'll like it too. Oh, yeah, and the animation is awesome!Ok, sure - Some of the Vikings had Scotch accents... and some had no accents at all. There were some inconsistencies in plot as well. However, details aside, the movie was enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"I enjoyed this movie and so will my grand children when they come over to visit.I always have plenty of movies to entertain everyone, this is a movie that can be enjoyed by all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie.","review":"I took the chance and order this without EVER seeing the movie, glad I did.

I higly recomed this movie for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"How To Train your Dragon - DVD","review":"I recently purchased \\"How to Train Your Dragon\\" in DVD from Anazon and I am very pleased with the purchase. The movie was a delight for the whole family, even the teenage sons who thought this \\"cartoon\\" was beneath them. It was funny and entertaining.

(now I'm ready to buy my own copy)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great family movie!","review":"My son wanted this for Christmas but we couldn't find it in time. We were able to get it from Amazon for his birthday at a killer price. I greatly appreciated the fabulous price for a \\"new release\\" as well as the fast shipping. As a family, we sat down to watch this movie the day it arrived. It's got everything for a family with young children - comedy (including a bit of rude humor for the kids, or young at heart like my hubby), love, a message (very important in kids movies), and a satisfying ending. Be prepared though (SPOILER ALERT), the ending is NOT for very little children as it is shocking and a bit sad. Though there is a point to the shock and sadness as the movie is wrapped up quite nicely in the epilogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"The kids loved it","review":"Although I haven't watched the movie myself, the kids and the rest of the family just loved it.

Great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreamworks Best!","review":"To me, this is by far Dreamworks' best animated film to date. Such a wonderful, thoughtful story. And pretty suitable for all ages (though there is one very frightening monster in it, so keep that in mind with the little ones). Having said that, the other cute dragons more than make up for it.The story's quite different than the one in the children's book it's based on, but I didn't mind at all. It seemed to improve on its subject matter in many many ways, with animation and voicing that was superb. This should have been one of those years where the Oscars declared a tie in the voting and awarded Best Animated Film to both Toy Story 3 AND How to Train Your Dragon! Too bad. Oh, and check out the film score, too. One of my all-time favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"This movie is fantastic.

Enjoy, it's a movie you can watch over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Film - What happened to the Special Features","review":"This is one of the most fantastic animated films to come along. Right up there with any Pixar classic. The sound track is second to none. Adults and kids (7ish and over) will love this movie. It's a bit tense at parts for little ones. It looks great in 3D. I would have rated it a 5 if it wasn't for one thing. Almost all of the special features are absent from this 3D version! The 2D Blu-Ray (sold separately) has loads of great special features on it. This 3D version has 2 minor ones. Not even a \\"Making Of\\". If the movie wasn't so good, I would have rated it lower for leaving out the special features."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"This movie is really good. The dragons are very cute!

Overall, this is a great familly movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good movie!","review":"I had the pleasure of seeing this movie in theaters, not really being sure what I was going to get. To say that the movie defied expectations is an grand understatement. This movie is fantastic! And I have to say, it looks even better on blu ray. I don't own many movies, but this one was so good that I had to. As with most family movies, there are plenty of special features, most of which are very entertaining. And the extra DVD of the movie that you get in case a blu ray player isn't handy, is just icing on the cake. I highly recommend this set!"},{"rating":"2","title":"such an awesome movie!!","review":"you have to watch it.

It is an amazing work that is at the same time full of heart and action. The writers did not sacrifice one for the other. The movie has a surprising depth to it also. Not just in the relationship between boy and dragon, which is magnificent, but in the many other relationships played out during the film. It is a great family film. If children are young be sure they don't scare easily or wait on it till they are older.I will watch this film again and again! Enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie","review":"My wife and I really enjoy this movie. We have a black cat that reminds us of Toothless, so it is really fun to watch the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best!","review":"I love this movie. The characters are real and draw you into their story quickly. The animation is tremendous, especially if you have an HD player and TV. The best part, however, is the dragons. Toothless, in particular, is a fully-fleshed out character in his own right. If you don't finish this movie wanting a dragon of your own, you are probably made of stone or just hate animation features. I'm 57 and I watch this movie over and over--without any kids around! And that score! It plays over and over in my head sometimes because it is so beautiful and expressive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Blu-Ray 3D release not the film.","review":"This is a prime example of why 3D is having trouble taking off for home viewing. Dreamworks's decision to hold back so long on releasing this film on Blu-Ray 3D was almost as painful as the version we did finally get. Sure, it's great to have it in 3D, but with no special features, and only available at Best Buy it is almost insulting. The film is great and the best 3D I have ever seen so it's a must own if you have a 3DTV, I can only hope Dreamworks wakes up and gives it the proper release it deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to Train Your Dragon","review":"Loved the movie!

I ended up keeping it for 4 days and watching it 4 times. I dont care who you are, this movie is amazing. great acting, animation, and story. It starts out like a lot of movies; an underdog struggling to keep up with his peers. He then discovers something that will put him in the history books but it all explodes in his face. I don't want to give anything away, but this is a very emotion-driven movie with some very serious situations. *****!"},{"rating":"2","title":"keeps the kids entertained for hours","review":"The kids in my family watch this over and over for hours.

It does leave a brownish tint, which doesn't blend so well with a light skin tone. So I wash it off after 20 minutes or put on before going to sleep, or just don't put on that much. But it works great. This is hard to find in stores, so I went to Amazon. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"It may work, but the smell....","review":"I don't know if I'm going to be able to continue using this product long enough to evaluate whether it works to clear up my acne or not because the smell is just too bothersome.

It does dry up my pimples and reduces itchiness and redness. When I stopped using it, the pimples began to come back. I bought the white vanishing cream, not the tinted version, so it goes on and disappears into my skin. For those people who don't like the tinted version, this could be a better option. The only down side for me is the smell. I personally don't mind the smell but I think other people could smell it on me and they might be turned off by that. Because of the smell, I use it mostly at night. Maybe it could be combined with a nice smelling essential oil or cream that is noncomodogenic to hide the smell."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I wanted to have acne, why would I pay for it?","review":"All this did was make it worse. It was thick & not flesh friendly at all. I smelled like sulfur all day long, which eventually made me sick. NOT worth paying to have acne when I can just get it for free. Another waste of my money. Had some insensitive jerk accuse me of actually working for a rival company because of my review. Hate to tell you all but there are just some of us who never find anything that will clear up a complexion. Nothing has worked for me in 2 decades - or if it did they would discontinue it. I'm a hideous mess with dozens of growths plaguing my face & nothing, not some stupid kit, or cream, or lotion, or gel, all of the popular medicated additives, or Rx's...nothing.

But the film lost me a little with its sanitized view of sex (all the sex the boy has in the movie, and not once does he get a venereal disease, or get someone pregnant, or have any real regrets after visiting prostitutes{all of whom seem to have hearts of gold}). The film wraps up quickly with only a vague sense of growth in the boy turned man. A much better road movie (though different in many respects) is \\"Central Station.\\" Better screenplay, better story, deeper meaning.But, yes, it was great to see Omar again. Hope to see more of him soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christian Baladas","review":"Soft Christian music from the leading Salsa Band of the 80's.

However, rather than being humorous, this book is quite serious. It is sort of like reading a secular version of \\"Our Daily Bread\\" or other religious devotional guide. Each entry has a brief but interesting background on the artist and the song (the reason for two stars rather than one), followed by a reflection and some questions or exercises designed to put into practice the lessons taught by the songs. These reflection and question sections are overly serious and didactic, and it is the contrast between the somewhat \\"cute\\" concept behind the book, and the \\"preachy\\" tone of the meditations that makes it quite unsatisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent edition","review":"I recently used the Arden edition of the Sonnets in a graduate level course on Renaissance literature. It's useful, too, to have Helen Vendler's \\"Art of the Sonnet,\\" as well as the Penguin edition (fewer notes than the Arden). Quite simply, the Arden excels in the scholarly apparatus. Also, for a concise, readable supplement, include Greenblatt's \\"Will in the World\\" (the chapter on the sonnets). But for a close study of the sonnets, if you need a single edition, Arden is terrific."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Introduction is worth the price of the book, ten times the price","review":"Ms. Duncan-Jones' Introduction is an extraordinary example of scholarship. To say that the Sonnets have been controversial throughout the time since their publication is a mild understatement. Ms. Duncan-Jones casts a brilliant and unwavering spotlight on these controversies and resolves them.Any serious student of Shakespeare must read this Introduction.If there is a failing in the book, it is in the actual footnotes to the Sonnets themselves. But in the context of Booth's footnotes, for example, this failing is insignificant. Anyone who wants a line-by-line exegesis of the Sonnets has many resources available.Go get this book and read the Introduction!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great books come to those who wait","review":"I am a great fan of Shakespeare, so when I bought this book what I was expecting wasn't what I saw.

Adults can relate to the wonderful family histories of people and property, the way one's occupation can break your heart, the need to pick yourself up and dust yourself off afterwards, and the powerful pain that made-up gossip can inflict. I especially appreciated the film maker's gifts for making the audience see and respect people who can seem invisible in our society. For example, an aging mom or the Mexican-American worker with a gazillion handy skills. My church paired this movie with Barbara Kingsolver's \\"Animal, Vegetable, Miracle\\" for a thought-provoking focus on the food we eat and how we obtain it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neck pillow","review":"The product is too stiff..............I use one in meditation class w/ the same components and it is softer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure about this product","review":"Perhaps I don't know much about buckwheat pillows but this was too firm for me.

But you should go with the Signet paperback instead. This one gets hard to read.This edition retains the original, unabridged text as printed, which may sound like what you want but gets to be pretty irritating. Original punctuation is retained, as is the Fielding's italicizing of all character names all the time -- not to mention capitalizing every common noun, as was the German-inspired fashion at the time of publication. Antiquated spellings are also intact. This gets very distracting.I'm glad this is out there, but I'm surprised Penguin did this. It makes the book much harder to read: couldn't they have left such a scholarly edition for some university press somewhere?"},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO MUCH FOR ME!","review":"This book is so well written it was a shame I could not finish its almost 900 pages. I simply found the tale too silly, too uninteresting to continue. It seemed just to be the rather mindless adventures of the hero, Tom Jones, as he fights over women, fights with soldiers and his friends ... with everyone. I need something a bit more serious and profound. I even watched the overly long film as I read, and even found the film to be inane. If you like light-hearted nonsense with lots of characters coming and going, then you might enjoy this.

Fielding's sharp wit and no-holds-barred views on human nature more than make up for the extragavant use of coincidences in the plot.In the novel, Fielding takes the convention of \\"talking to the reader\\" to absurd and hilarious heights.

I most enjoyed getting a flavor of life in mid-eighteenth century England not warped through the lens of a historian or historical fiction. These were interesting times! I've been attending a few contemporary Handel operas; this book was a nice complement. The classics (language, history, etc.) were over-arching during this baroque era, and moderation and rationality are the virtues to nurture.

Her in-between song banter will have you rolling on the floor mostly due to how seriously she can say something so off-the-wall. The songs are typical Pardes, well developed, full of emotion and get you thinking.

It could be the missing of Stuart Staples voice on the main part of this album, although this is not the case while listening 'More Trouble Eveyday' over and over.

I have just about everything she has done. Before ADP was released there were songs that leaked onto the Internet and I listened to them and I was not impressed with what I was hearing. Today, I finally broke down and bought this album only because I wanted my collection to be complete. My opinion has not changed whatsoever. It's still rather bland and lifeless. There's a reviewer here who mentions that Tori needs to get back out and experience some life (besides touring) and I say AMEN to that! I'm extremely disappointed with this collection. I wish...oh how I wish I could say there are a few gems here in this set of songs but there really aren't. I like, like NOT love, one or two songs. That makes for a disappointing collection. Take off the wigs Tori and get real again. Please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A minor disappointment","review":"I've enjoyed the melody and the passion that I've been able to find in Tori Amos's past albums, but American Doll Posse fell short of that for me. The tracks are heavily political and subsequently they lose the raw emotion that I have always admired as her signature."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Can you blame nature if she's had enough of us...\\"","review":"My first review never appeared and I'm so mad so I am gonna make this short and sweet. American Doll Posse by Tori Amos is other beautiful, gutsy, and remarkable piece of work from my favorite singer/songwriter. Songs I cannot get enough of are: Yo George, Big Wheel, Bouncing Off Clouds, Digital Ghost, Girl Disappearing, Secret Spell, Roosterspur Bridge, Beauty of Speed, Velvet Revolution, and Smokey Joe. I love her concept albums so what's all the fuss guys? I highly recommend this album, it's her best piece of work since To Venus and Back. Happy Listening!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"A great rock dense political and intense album! I would excpect nothing less from Tori! US government hated this record at the time it was released and it is a good thing of course! lol"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and Boring","review":"I'm a huge Tori fan, and I'm really disheartened to admit that her albums have been in slow decline. American Doll Posse was boring. I thought The Beekeeper was nothing special, and it took me many listens to get into Scarlet's Walks, which I ended up liking - not loving. I think the best thing she has released lately is her best-of albums. There are a few good songs on this recent album: Big Wheel, Bouncing Off Clouds, Digital Ghost."},{"rating":"2","title":"really great album","review":"Tori is a creative genius, whether we like individual songs and concepts or not. That said, on an emotional level her past few albums have been mostly lukewarm for me with some great moments but no real draw overall. I agree that the Beekeeper was a little emotionally flat, I felt the same about Scarlet's Walk, and I never got into Strange Little Girls. American Doll Posse, however, goes back to the more dynamic and engaging songwriting style from her earlier albums. The moods and texturing of the music are at times exquisite. I haven't been this moved by a Tori Album since maybe Choirgirl Hotel. I LOVE this album. Body and Soul (whice reminds me of Siouxie and the Banshees), Code Red, Father's Son...I haven't even made it to the end because I keep replaying these songs. Tori's work is a real gift to the music world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!!","review":"Please note-- I'm not a HUGE Tori head..BUT-- My husband is & he got this before it came out. We went to see here recently in Santa Barbara & WOW! Great show & this cd.. Gets totally stuck in my head..Being a metal headed guitar player... this is a HUGE complament!!I can honestly say Its worth getting even if you are a metal head & seeing her in concert .... You cant imagine how wonderful she is!All the songs on this cd are so catchy & I do admit, she can write & perform & just make you a fan even if your trying not to be.. lolYou go girl & everyone.. get the cd you'll love it.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad.","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect from this album, but somehow I was still pleasantly surprised. Can something surpass one's expectations if one had no expectations to begin with?While I'm not entirely on board with the supposed concept of this album or the somewhat creepy cover art, I am on board with the music. This album is definitely an ecclectic mix of different sounds, as if Tori is rediscovering herself musically and trying to find out where she fits in within today's music scene. While some songs are reminiscent of the past (compare Girl Disappearing to various tracks onScarlet's Walkor Code Red to some of the grittier tracks onBoys for Pele), other tracks most certainly march to the beat of their own drummers (Fat Slut, Yo George, and Teenage Hustling for example).Overall, I really enjoyed this venture from Tori Amos. I look forward to the tour and any future albums she releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tori Amos/ American Doll Posse","review":"I have followed Tori for 15 years now. I find this albumn depressing and preachy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tori Fatigue","review":"I have been a huge Tori fan since Little Earthquakes and own just about everything she has released. While I might not listen as often as when we had Tori lyric reciting contests, she is still among my faves.That said, American Doll Posse is practically unlistenable. Clouds Bouncing is great, and then there are 23 songs I can barely stand. It's sad. I also find the multiple photo thing and photo video a bit self indulgent. Dave Matthews, another of my faves, seems to have gone the same direction and it's tough.The release of a new Tori CD used to mean months of constant pleasure enjoying the new sounds. This is just grating.But hey, maybe it's just me. Seems like plenty of people still love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a lot of good songs get lost","review":"This is not my favourite Tori album, but it has some pretty amazing tracks that just get lost because there are too many. :< I hate saying that, but I think a lot of people were turned off by its length.

I think \\"Big Wheel\\" and \\"Yo George\\" will get the play out of this CD initially, but \\"Posse\\" can follow any of Tori's work and stand on its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her best album in almost a decade","review":"This is Tori's best album since Choirgirl. I've been listening to her entire catalogue for the past few weeks and have come to the conclusion that this is my #3 favourite Tori album right after \\"Boys for Pele\\" and \\"From the Choirgirl Hotel\\". The songwriting, the production, the energy, the beauty, the fire - it's all here in top form.It's a shame about the marketing concept though. Many of the people I know were turned off by it, especially after the mellow TBK. I say ignore the concept and simply embrace the music for what it is. Tori said she was going to let the music speak for itself. I wish she'd have kept her word in that regard because this album is incredible and deserves much attention. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hummmmmmmm","review":"I was a Tori fan from the git go, just so you know, BUT...Even from Little Earthquakes (an album soley devoted to aspects of sex, as all her recordings are (even Big Wheel spurts the acronym M I L F)) I found her derivative....and thus dismissable.She and fans like to compare her to every one in rock, but no one compares her to the ONE and ONLY true influence she has ever really had, the one whom she emulates with every note she sings...Kate Bush.Tori is a Kate Bush wannabe, and no one, not her, not her fans want to admit it, but she has been ever since she was a teenager, and that is an unarguable fact.Kate is the real deal. Tori is a boring wannabe in denial."},{"rating":"2","title":"...As If I Could Have Had A Doubt...","review":"This a great album, full of twists and turns and musical lanscape. From the opening \\"Yo George\\" until you rock along with \\"Almost Rosey\\" until you breathe in \\"Dragon\\" I know you will be hooked. \\"Miracle\\" the itunes bonus track was well worth the price of the digital buy as well as the physical buy. I wish \\"Miracle\\" would have made the album. All in all, I highly recomend this album for all Tori fans, old and new."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful","review":"I love Tori - alway have, always will. I haven't loved all of her albums, but she's always trying to reinvent herself, for better or worse, and yet still remains the Tori that we all know and love. This album is just beautiful. The up-tempo songs are awesome, and songs like \\"Bouncing off Clouds\\" are classic Tori.

Relationship and relational variables are underrepresented. Or course, MCO's require this more specified approach, but books (and series) such as the \\"Complete\\" Treatment Planner reduce our professional work to an easier-than-it-really-is perspective, and as a result, devalue professional experience as well as client/patient contibutions and collaborations in psychotherapy. While I appreciate the author's attempts to simplify a rather complex undertaking, is is disturbing to see psychotherapy presented almost like auto mechanics. I understand that Jonqsma and Peterson fill a need but the format and construction of this book leave me wondering about the human side of the psychotherapy endeavor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gehlen: Spy of the Century","review":"An interesting account of this man, who work with the CIA and others shaped a lot of our actions taken during the cold war.Not all Nazis were bad and this books details the story of one who was not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great classroom set!","review":"I love using this with my high school students.

We haven't gotten into the other two Chem videos yet.I think it's so corny it's well into the stupid-funny range, but my students like it. Be prepared to do a LOT of pausing, and I strongly recommend either finding an online study guide or watching and creating one before showing the video. It tends to move pretty fast.

Scientifically proven facts on psychology by clever authors. A new and updated test based on the newest knowlegde from all parts of America. I read about 80 pages and got really disappointed. Why? Because psychiatrists focus on stating a diagnosis, not giving practical advise. However, they do try to give you some idea, but these ones are thinner than the paper it has been printed on. Therefore I don't think that you will get any help from this book, which has more than 400 pages of nonsense. For specific problems, read specific books. The Personality Test in this book is a disaster. 107 strange questions and a very odd calculation method to diagnose your socalled type.

It is useful, even fun, to use this book to gain a better understanding of yourself. If, on the other hand, you are trying to figure out what makes other tick, dealing with fourteen different personality traits is a bit overwhelming. If you're seeking to have a better understanding of those around you, I would recommend David Keisey's \\"Please Understand Me,\\" which is based on Jung and the Myers-Briggs Temperament Indicator. Don't get me wrong, this book may increase your awareness and understanding of other peoples' quirks, but I feel you can get just as clear a picture much more easily with the MBTI."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative, but read with some caution...","review":"This is a VERY informative book, and the test was relatively easy, albeit a little lengthy. The only downfall is that if you're not cautious, you can almost take the assessments to read like a horoscope and take them to be what defines you fully rather than partially. While I can see that there are strong tendencies in the attributes described, they can make one overly suspicious of the negative characteristics if you are not careful. However, it is an accurate depiction according to the tests, the results are pretty accurate (my husband and I both did the tests). It doesn't take into account someone who is disciplined and moral who decides to make better choices beyond there human/animalistic tendancies...ie, those who choose to submit themselves to their belief systems, like Christianity with a renewed mind. Each chapter delves further in study than most other books like it in that it introduces research on the corresponding personality disorders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't lend this book out, you will never get it back!","review":"There are some things that can't be believed until they are experienced. I don't think I exaggerate when I say that next to the Bible, this may be the most important book ever written. I didn't believe in psychology or in self-help books, but this book is absolutely outstanding!!!!! It is not pop psychology. It is nonjudgmental and non-threatening. EVERYONE needs to read it. This book will make you believe that psychology finally has something intelligent to say.Whatever you do don't lend this book out. It was lent to me, I lent it to a friend, who lent it to their spouse, who lent it to a relative, who lent it to an in-law, who lent to . . . at this point I lost track.

The filmmakers managed to track down an extraordinary number of relatives of these two obscure WW2 partisan fighters. They also have lots of home movies of the two men in their primes after both had emigrated to NYC after the war. In the film, we see how the two managed to save more than 1,000 Jews from their Nazi hunters by secluding them in a Belorussian forest for three years at the height of the war. Much violence. But very well executed overall, especially the lead role by James Bond star Daniel Craig. Many will want to look up and read the real history behind the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"I bought this movie for my husband he loves history/movies with a meaning, he absolutely loves this movie and we have watched it several times already. Great message, true history."},{"rating":"2","title":"The truth be known","review":"Great actors and terrific story line .I highly recommend this film that accurately describes the persecution of the Jews .It is a reminder of how the world has so often descriminated against this great people and of their resillence to shine! Brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Defiance by Brandon M. Moskos","review":"I pre-ordered this movie, and I was amazed on just how great this movie was. True story about ordinary jewish bothers who lead a group of jews to survive the holocaust. As they try to survive, they live in forests and often have to relocate because of attacks on them. They learn how to live in the forests and count on each other for survival. Daniel Craig was flawless as the main leader, who has disagreements with one of his brothers and other refugees, but always stays in control to get revenge on the germans, by surviving. This is a must-see. The only flaw in this movie was that I thought it was too long at almost 2 and a half hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"A simple story about large issues in difficult times","review":"Belorussia in 1941. Germans and local collaborators hunt Jews. The Bielski brothers, in civilian times apparently not really choir boys, escape into the forests and attract followers, other refugees, who are desperate for help. A camp in the forest, an unsteady symbiosis with Russian troops nearby. Raids for food can't avoid getting noticed by the German army, whose attacks follow; the camp has to run. The refugees find another location for a camp. Apparently based on true events.The film is about big subjects: strategy, leadership, discipline, solidarity. No surprises,just basic constellations and human conflicts. Wonderful cinematography. Solid work by Mr.Zwick (who apparently has a personal relation to the real Bielskis; family?). Good show by Mr.James Bond as Tuvia Bielski; the other actors do well too (but I don't know them)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Defiance","review":"AWESOME!

(and no I am not anti-Semitic) The movie has redefined tedious, by the end I was pulling for the Germans to kill everyone and end the movie. Really people, what planet are you on that you think this is a good movie?? The movie also has attempted to redefine melodramatic! I would give it zero stars but that is not an option. What a horrible movie!!I had to edit this review, so now Daniel Craig has starred in two of the worst movies I have ever seen. Have any of you seen Cowboys and Aliens? He needs to change agents now before he stars in another horrible movie. And yes at the end of that movie I was really hoping the aliens would win.Of course there are movies that are much worse but for a movie trying to be legitimate this is really horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull cliche'","review":"I agree with the professional movie critics.

We didn't bother to see the last 20 minutes of \\"Defiance's\\" tedium. We were both really really really bored. I'm glad I got this dvd used(and cheap). I will resell it. The script is mediocre(full of cliches), the brothers don't look at all alike, the photography is poor or has been marred by the use of too much computer color filtering and contrast adjusting. Even many Sy-Fy channel movies look better than this. I do think this is an important story. I just think this movie is a MAJOR DUD. There are much better war movies out there. I don't understand why Amazon critics like this. It sucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"POORLY DONE","review":"Bad casting, acting, script, direction; basically all the elements that went into making this WWII \\"true story\\" film were bad. Above all it's boring and the film does not make you care about any of the characters. The filmmakers make the mistake of just showing you what happened like a boring log of events--this happened, then this, then this--without creating any air of suspense, intrigue, fear, or any level of emotional investment to make you care about the characters or their plight. I threw the dvd away after I (barely) managed to struggle through it till the hoaky and ridiculous ending. Hard to believe in this day and age films this bad are still made. Shame on everyone involved with making this very poorly made film. You had a good topic (WW2!!!) to make a serious, compelling and entertaining film and you completely botched it on all levels. The lower budget TV movie \\"Uprising,\\" which has a similar revolt-against-Germans topic, is light years better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and poorly acted","review":"I had to laugh everytime Daniel Craig, playing an Eastern European Jewish rebel leader during World War II, opened his mouth to demonstrate his inconsistent accent. I was looking forward to watching this movie after seeing the preview, but found myself begging for it to end. Instead, it's more than a two-hour procession of every cliche you can imagine from other World War II movies. It has occasional action scenes to maintain viewer interest, but mostly the movie has nearly endless boring dialog and cartoonish portrayals of the freedom fighters who beg for audience sympathy, which is an important message for today's youth."},{"rating":"2","title":"good choice in blu ray","review":"I'm picky about what I buy in blu-ray because of the price.

I would highly recommend this movie to anyone over age 13."},{"rating":"2","title":"Defiantly realistic","review":"Great movie, not just a tear jerker, but something that shows the truly heroic story of a group of Belorussian Jews defying the nazis as well as anti-semitic countrymen and each other on occasion to survive during WWII. I don't know how close to the real story this is, but it definitely has an authentic/true feel as you are watching. It shows the story from different viewpoints, showing that the human character isn't all black and white but some very disturbing shades of grey. It depicts people trying to stay human in very inhuman circumstances. Showing how old prejudices must be pushed aside in order for a group of people, connected mainly by only a common religion, to survive. Some very good acting all around with effective use of action and violence to make points and drive the story forward rather than the fairly gratuitive violence in Inglourious Basterds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood dishonors victims of war in Russia","review":"So, here we are deep in the Russian forest, war, ice, winter, Jews, betrayal, the German Army, death, starvation, frostbite, illness, faith, murder, theft, heroism, sacrifice, loyalty, family, disease, brothers, revenge.There's enough here for a dozen movies but Hollywood cannot make even one that is rooted in the truth. Instead the movie makers have borrowed all their ideas for this movie from other movies. We see beautiful, crying women, men, brave but flawed, shouting and fighting. The predictable script carries us through every inch of the predictable action. We have seen all of these characters elsewhere, the young inexperienced intellectual, the brave child, the courageous but infirm old man, the hard-bitten commander, the selfish coward, the bold strong woman.And in case you were worried that all this stuff about the war between Russia and Germany could be a bit depressing, (all that death and misery), the movie has a happy ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible direction and acting","review":"Could not stand more than 20 minutes.

What I saw was an incredible, factual, and little known story. It kept a fairly fast pace and unlike many movies I never knew what was coming next. The war aspect was compelling and will likely satisfy people looking for that but it was the human element that stood out and made their story so special. One might not expect such a story to be heartwarming and inspirational but in the end that's precisely what this movie was.

It's not exactly feel-good, but it's not depressing either. It ends on a note of triumph rather than despair, and what makes it a great movie to me are the relationships, the bond between the brothers and the cooperation of the entire group to keep each other safe.On a personal note, my sister and I love this film because she is a big fan of Jamie Bell and we both adore Daniel Craig, and both actors turn out excellent performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Daniel Craig movie!","review":"In typical fashion, Daniel Craig was great in this one.

It is definitely a must buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great premise, no follow-up","review":"I was intrigued with the premise of the book long before I located a copy. Reading it, I was disappointed to find that there wasn't much more to it than that. It's written as a series of vignettes, starting with early American colonists encountering the Sims, and continuing forward through time to the present day, with Sims being used as medical test-subjects. I liked that approach at first, but now I'm wondering if a novel would have worked better. None of the characters are very well fleshed out (excuse the pun), and the alternate-reality world of the sims seems disappointingly similar to our own. I'd love to see a different writer work from the same starting point - the results could be fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different Turtledove book..","review":"Having read many Harry Turtledove books I found this one to be a different style than many of his other books. While alternate history, it is not focused as much on characters through a time continuum. It is a series of short stories where America is still inhabited by creatures that are no longer in our world - Homo Ergaster, sabre tooth tigers, mastadons, etc. There are hints of other differences but generally works on the behavior, social interaction, historical, and ethical considerations of these creatures (many on Homo Ergaster) and the world as it develops. Particular stories about slavery, animal testing, and the industrial revolution cause you to think about our relationship with the world. This book appeals to many genres - cryptozoology, science fiction, alternative history, and historical fiction. A very fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't deliver","review":"Turtledove grabs us by the throat with an interesting premise then drops us and leaves the room, never to return.

The illustrator shows an aerial view of the statue on Liberty Island, the ferry needed to reach the island, and New York City in the far background. He continues with pictures showing the construction of the statue to the impressive fire works celebration on the Fourth of July.

Eponine is truly awful. The rest of the cast is OK; if not the best possible at least they're not the worst possible. Lindsey Stafford Smith (Fantine) is better than Randy Graff. John Curl (Valjean) is better than Garry Morris, although he also seems to sing \\"Stars\\" (and is definitely not right for it). It sounds a lot like Roger Allam with him in \\"Confrontation\\". Adam Pinter (Enjolras) is no Andy Warlow or Michael Maguire, but still stirring and powerful. Christopher Smith (Marius) is also actually not bad, although we don't get to hear \\"Empty Chairs and Empty Tables\\". In fact, there are a LOT of great songs missing from this very short version. I recommend saving up for one of the 2- or 3-disc versions. However, if you don't pay too much for it, you might get a pleasant if unremarkable hour of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Emotional Eponine","review":"This recording is pretty horrible, but it does have Frances Ruffelle as Eponine. So what if her voice is not as pretty as Lea Salonga's? Her On My Own is much more emotional! Lea concentrates too much on making her singing \\"sound pretty\\". Frances doesn't care, she just sings her heart out! This may be the only reason to get the recording. Colm is better on others and the Marius is AWFUL. If you're a hard core Les Miz fan, you'll buy it just to own it."},{"rating":"1","title":"From a 'Les Miz' fan","review":"Well, I didn't really like the 'Castle on a Cloud' in this.

Colm is miscast to say the least. I would much prefer an operatic/Broadway tenor to this Irish person trying to milk the applause with his vibratissimo. Watching him on DVD of the two celebrations of Les Miz was off-putting as watching a politician begging for applause. Furthermore, Hugo makes it clear that Valjean is a large and powerful man. It is no accident or coincidence that Depardieu was cast in this film role. He has the persona depicted by Hugo. Wilkinson at 5 feet 8 inches does not. It's like asking a garden gnome to fill in for a Rodin. I often skip over his solo tracks because of the lingering disquieting images from the DVD. Wilkinson is not Valjean."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD purchase","review":"While the CD arrived promptly, there were scratches on the CD that caused the music to skip.

It is called the \\"DREAM CAST\\" for a reason.Les Mis is my favorite show of all time, and I have 4 different recordings of it. The 10th Anniversary cast is by FAR the best, and this one is BY FAR the worst.Terrence Mann is wonderful, but certainly not better than Philip Quast (who plays Javert in the 10th Anniversary). The Eponine on the Broadway recording is TERRIBLE. So if you want to hear \\"On My Own\\" or \\"A Little Fall of Rain\\" performed with any beauty or integrity, don't buy this version!The 10th Anniversary cast has more of the music (almost the entire show); every single performer is a standout and fabulous- if you are a true fan of this show, or want to become one, buy that recording instead. PLEASE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the full version, please","review":"Highlights are never worth it.

Get this if you're a big Les Mis fan; otherwise, stick to the TAC and the Complete Symphonic recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALMOST PERFECT CASTING , NOT COMPLETE ALBUM","review":"This Les Mis is almost perfect .

Now, having listened to all the official English-language casts and several of the foreign language ones, this one's pretty yucky. David Byrant's Marius pales dreadfully next to that of Michael Ball's rendition, as do Randy Graff and Terrance Mann's performances. The Thernardiers were simply unfunny and Colm Wilkinson and Frances Ruffelle sound the same as they do on the London cast. The only reason I really listen to this at all anymore is to hear Judy Kuhn's delightful Cosette. Get the London version, or if you're willing to shell out a few extra bucks, buy the Complete Recording. Both are ten times better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best One","review":"This version has much better singers than the movie.

SO I thought that this CD would give him the basics and maybe want to listen to the whole thing. I listened to it and thought that it sounded poorly made. It's almost like the music and the singers are not in sync in some of the songs. The voices and the music don't sound nearly as crisp in this version as it does in the full version. I wish I could get my money back for it and make my own mixed CD!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but missing some songs...","review":"The voices on this CD are incredible, especially Valjean and Javert. However, I didn't like that some of the important songs were missing, such as \\"The Robbery\\" and \\"Marius and Cosette\\". All in all, a very good recording of this show, but if you want the full show, I would go with the Symphonic Recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest CD of all TIME!!!","review":"I would have to rate this soundtrack 5 stars because of its wonderful singers and songs. Wilkinson is and probably will be the best Jean Valjean ever played. The Thenardiers were very well played. MME. Thenardier was quite good at oposing to her husband in \\"Master of the House\\". Javert did a spelnded job at being the antagonist. Marius was wonderful when he sang his duet with Epinone. Gaveroche had the best voice I have ever heard from a youngster. Same with Cossette. Epinone's voice was great. I have no idea how some people come up with the idea that she screeches. Her voice is beautiful. All in all, I would say this is a very good first soundtrack. I would definatly get it and start listening to it ASAP."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this music","review":"I first saw the Broadway show sometime in 1989. I saw it again in Los Angeles in '92.

Aside from that though, the soundtrack sounds great, although it cant compare to seeing the play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, although not the best.","review":"I have to agree that the London is the best one, although it is nice to have a change of the usual singers.

Get the TAC, rent the video too."},{"rating":"2","title":"An 'okay' album","review":"I love Les Miserables and I have four of the cast recordings. Of the four, I would place this in my bottom two primarily because of Frances Ruffelle. No person who claims to know anything about singing can honestly say that FRances sings well. Her rough voice is hard on the ears (the excuse commonly used is that it's \\"unique\\" -- puhleez!), plus she can NOT articulate. She just mumbles or keeps dragging the words that any listener would wonder whether she has forgotten that in musical theater (versus pop singing), it's all the more critical to COMMUNICATE to the audience; people should be able to understand what she's singing. As for her Tony Award, as one poster has already said, she was just lucky that Lea Salonga (or Kaho Shimada) weren't around yet; otherwise, she wouldn't have even been offered the part!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this [stinks]","review":"This CD is a disgrace to all people who love Les Mis.

But, I was in an amatuer revue not long ago, and part of the cast performed \\"At the End of the Day\\" and, I must say, sounded ten times better than this recording. This album is mostly a collection of power ballads set in the wrong time frame. If you want a good mix of newer and older, I suggest Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera."},{"rating":"1","title":"To the eponine here","review":"Could you please blow your nose first before singing your voice is too annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but there are better","review":"I like the quicker pace of the music here compared to the Original London Recording. The casting of other actors is also quite refreshing. The Complete Symphonic Recording and the 10th Anniversary Concert Recording are much better, though. Eponine's Kaho Shimada (CSR) and Lea Salonga(TAC recording), for instance, act waaaaaaaaaaaaay better than shrieky Frances Ruffelle, who repeats the whiny and lackluster performance she did on the OLC recording.This is not a bad CD to get if you're a big Les Miserables fan. If you can't afford to get all the recordings, however, stick to the CSR for its \\"completeness\\" and to the TAC recording for its \\"liveliness,\\" great actors and great performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"I agree","review":"It's excellent, but the 10th Anniversary version, with the DREAM cast and the thunderous applause from the audience, IS the BEST recording!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good material, bad singers","review":"I love Les Mis, but not this recording. Javert (terance mann) butchered his own songs but was decent in the big numbers. Fantine was completely devoid of emotion and didn't make up for it in voice quality. frances ruffele had emotion but it is possible to convey emotion and sound good at the same time (ie koho shimada) colm wilkinson isn't my favorite but he's very good. marius was awefull. cossette (judy kuhn) was very good. the orchestra seemed to synthesized. I would recommend the complete symphonic recording. the extra money is worth it to get better performances and the Full show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful for the most part","review":"This version is from the American cast, so \\"purists\\" enamoured with the London cast will be in for a little suprise. Colm practically is Valjean, and unargueably the best. Randy Graff is a little iffy as Fantine, but she's quite good altogether, and the other lead Terrace Mann kicks rear as Javert. Michael Ball will wow you as Enjolras, and rightly deserved the Tony he got for this role. Judy Kuhn takes the usually unnoticed role of Cosette and makes it a great supporting role with her dazzling voice. I at first could not stand Frances Rueffle's Eponine, but after a while, she sounded beautiful. So why only four stars? Two words: David Bryant. This Marius lacks any singing ability whatsoever, but can be ignored by skipping \\"Empty Chairs at Empty Tables\\". A plus for anyone even vaguely interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AS GOOD AS THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY CONCERT!!!","review":"Too bad, we cant describe Francese Rufelle's voice as a crystalline angelic voice. If only Lea was around 10 years ago, they would have picked Lea to perform the role of Eponine. Francese is just lucky that she was born earlier.

This is by far my favorite les mis soundtrack (even better than the I dreamed a dreamed and the London cast version). The only thing I have issue with, is that I want more and think it has been a disservice to the franchise, not to do a complete score recording of the original Broadway cast (one has to exist, right)The songs are powerful, the story unparallelled, and I doubt that anyone could listen to the CD and not find themselves resonating with a few of the characters.If you get the recent 2012 movie soundtrack, do yourself a favor and get this one as well and compare.WONDERFUL WONDERFUL WONDERFUL"},{"rating":"2","title":"Was ok","review":"I have better more powerful versions of this but it is very good.

I loved the show when I first saw it, but by the third time, I was bored, and I stopped listening. Yesterday, I hauled this CD set out and gave another listen. I was horrified. How could I ever have thought this crap was good? What an insult to a classic story. The melodies are dull, predictable, and constantly repeat themselves with no rhyme or reason, (they certainly are not leitmotives), the lyrics are symplistic, mundane, and corny, the performances are cloying, (especially Eponine, Fantine, and Valjean.) One long boring ballad after another. \\"God on High,\\" for example, is the most banal of prayers, sung melodramatically, accompanied by guitar-like arpeggios on something that sounds like a xylophone.

As it turns out, the concert songs were edited...these were not. If you can excuse songs devoted entirely to conversations between prostitutes and their customers, frequent \\"mild\\" bad words, quite a few inappropriate references, and a complete disregard for God's name....then you'll probably like this cd. As to the music-well, there are a few songs that are pretty, and others that are \\"inspiring\\" (especially \\"Look Down\\" and \\"Do You Hear the People Sing?\\")and then there are some that consist entirely of nearly spoken words set awkwardly to music.

The story is so sad and moving, I found myself crying in many parts. Eponine has to be my favorite character, I just love her voice and she harmonizes well with Marius and Cossette, in 'A Heart Full of Love'. I dislike Vanjean's voice quite a bit.

Spock, here portrayed as an older ambassador, is filled with wit, depth, kindness, and above all, humor. In fact, all of the scenes and dialogues are truly thoughtful and intelligently conceived. The story is finely plotted and timed. However, the ending is too abrupt. Over all this is an excellent story with excellent characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorest of the Double Helix novels","review":"The least the author could have done was to feature Spock, McCoy, and Crusher and WATCH Next Generation. We get 100 pages of Stiles before anything happens. The book is very forced, especially the capture of Stiles. The continuity with the other Double Helix books is all messed up. Diane Carey shouldn't be allowed to write any non-TOS books. It scares me to think that she will be writing three of the books in next summer's New Earth series. And they're letting her create her own series like Peter David's New Frontier!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The series is improving...","review":"I have to admit that outside of the Peter David book, this was the one book in the Double Helix series I was really looking foward to most of all. It's a return, in many ways, to much of Carey's old Trek lore in which we get new characters to know and love and see them interacting with the familiar characters that we know and love from the Trek universe. Her characterizations of everyone are well done and she really gives Eric Stiles an interesting story that's a pleasure to read. Hopefully, we'll see more of him in the future. Another point I liked is that fact that the nature and severity of the virus is increasing over the novels. I only hope the series continues to get better from here on out..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diane Carey Messed up This One!","review":"I read all six of the Double Helix books before reviewing this, and I still believe this is one of the worst yet! Basically Spock and Eric Stiles are the only character introduced in the first part. Now really, if you're going to write a book, at least include three or four characters. Plus, I found Eric Stiles annoying. I think Diane either rushed or didn't bother to actuallt contemplate about what she was writing. The content of this book almost makes it sound as though she was rushing through what could have been a great novel.If only Diane had enhanced the content and dialogue a little, it would have made a great book three, but instead, the content is sloppy, the plot is jumbled and at times hard to follow, the climax was a little sudden and forced, and the karate wife was a little much for me at the end. The ending was rushed. Diane Carey should have put a little more effort into this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Halfway Through...","review":"And I already want to die from boredom. First off, this series seems to be a bit bland. The plot stops just as it's getting interesting in the first two books. But THIS one is the worst yet! I bought the series to read about the plague, not about some \\"Lightcudder\\" (read the book, you'll find out) and his feelings. However, the plague seems to be curiously missing throughout most of the book, making me wonder whether John Ordover and Michael Jan Friedman read this book. Eric Stiles seems to be the main character. Also, Spock and McCoy seem to be missing from a lot of the book thus far, making me wonder why they and not Stiles are on the cover. There was a whole extraneous scene in the book about a repair on a ship. I'm about two inches from dropping the book and picking up the fourth one. I really only bought the series for the \\"New Frontier\\" bit. After this one, I think I'll never buy a Diane Carey book. EVER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Trek The Next Generation Double Helix Red Sector","review":"This is one of the better books in the series of the Double Helix. The book was full of Action, Romance, Evil, Royalty and great characters. There was plenty of action involving phaser duels between characters and between ships. It was like many of the other books in the series. The book had a good guy and a corrupt power holder. A catastrophic event happens and The Federation comes to the rescue once again but this time there is Romulans. There are characters from two of the most powerful species, The Federation and The Romulans. There is a great meaning behind the book. It shows that two people who come from different places can hold on two each other in times of need and that maybe there is a chance of peace in the galaxy. I would recommend this book to who ever is interested in a good Science Fiction book and whoever likes Star trek."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ryka is the best ever","review":"I have purchased Ryka shoes for about 20 years. These are the only shoes I will buy. They are always a perfect fit and are made for only women. Unlike other top name brands that are made for men and then sized to fit women. In all the years I have bought Ryka I have never had one problem. They always fit perfect. Never any blisters or sore feet trying to break them in. Once you go Ryka you will never go back to expensive, poor fitting shoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"great show !!","review":"This is a great find for old tv lovers. There are four episodes of the show.Ep. 1 Burt Lancaster is the guest. The skit where they count the feet is so funny.Ep. 2 The menu says Jimmy Durante and Tony Curtis. In the episode M & L are doing talk of the colgate town (a parody of the ed sullivan show) and Jimmy Durante is sitting beside Cary Grant (really Dean Martin). Janet Leigh is beside Groucho Marx. this would have been when she was married to Tony Curtis. George Raft is sitting beside Clark Gable. Then Tony Curtis is sitting beside Big Ben the golfer.Ep. 3 Marilyn Maxwell is the guest. The skit of Frankie and Johnny is great.

That's right, you pay to watch kids stretch for about 8 minutes. The kids then do about FOUR drills.

Let's be fair: cadogan (or everyman) makes great books, including about the QGA. But this entire \\"easy guide\\" series is a little misguided. The back cover says: \\"just enough detail and explanation to play an opening with confidence\\". Not true. The book starts with typical QGA positions. I went trough them: they have practically nothing in common. Each chapter starts with some other positions, then the author gets to the \\"theory\\", which is absolutely not exhaustive. I am glad I did not buy the \\"scheveningen\\" easy guide as well. Conclusion: if u know how to play the QGA already, maybe there's something for you in this book. For the rest: find something with more meat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evolution is a true journey","review":"This CD is one of the best releases I have heard thus far in the evergrowing market of Circuit DJ compilations. DJ Mike Duretto's ability to take you on what would be called an amazing journey is unsurpassed. The song selection and placement is exquisite and the mixing is as seamless as a tapestry. I highly recommend this masterpiece to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael who?","review":"I purchased this cd in August at Uncle Sam's records in South Beach, Miami under the advice of one of the clerks who work there. By this time I would normally be way over a dance compilation, but this cd has yet to leave the changer. Not too intense, but not weak by any means, and above all (and unfortunately uncommon with dance compilations)very beautiful music. I highly recommend this cd to anyone looking for more than fast beats, or spacey trance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Form over Function","review":"I bought this blender based on the reviews here, as well as its great-looking design. When I got the blender, only one of those factors came through.First thing I noticed: both blender jars leaked badly. After reseating the seal in the glass jar and tightening it as hard as possible, the leak was slightly reduced. The metal jar still poured out liquids from the base.Second thing I noticed: this blender cannot make a good smoothie. Even after a couple minutes of blending, there are chunks of ice and fruit which have been totally untouched by the blades (regardless of how little ice is put in the smoothie). For a blender of any price, the DeLonghi does a poor job making smoothies. For a blender that costs what the DeLonghi does, this performance is totally unjustifiable.But, hey, it does look really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragile Italian Design with far too many parts","review":"Like many say it has a nice design but functionally it is poor. The Glass Jar has 8 parts, the Steel Jar has 7 parts, and glass jar broke within 6 months of light use. I also second the fact that this unit is prone to leaking and as a professional chef I can tell you this is not worth the time or money as there are better products out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful...but thats about it.","review":"I too bought this for making smoothies. The angle of the blades causes too much air to be whipped into the mix. Most blends come out so frothy you have to wait several minutes to drink. Solid ingredients come out in chunks regardless of speed or time. Margaritas come out frosty but hot, (how is that even possible?) It is damn gorgeous though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Blender","review":"This is a great blender that is easy to care for and fun to use.It does a fine job of blending ingredients, including ice, to the consistency that you desire. The only negative thus far is the fact that it doesn't swirl the contents from top to bottom as I'd like, perhaps I have unrealistic expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought this book was interesting and very well written.","review":"I thought this book was intersting and very well written.

Horror does not suit everyone However and for some boys and girls can cause nightmares and fears of under the bed etc. Those fears are not a lasting-a- day fear they are fears that last for years until someone soothes them and convinces them the non-existency of monsters. I had that experience too. I'm not outgoing and do not like horror stories. I had a nightmare I was trapped and a monster was chasing me. I shall remember that for a long time. Kids, if you know these stories will not effect you fine, enjoy R.L.Stines spooky tales! But Parents be cautious of what your child reads. For if she\\\\he reads something she has a fear of or suddenly becomes a fear. She\\\\He will not forget that for quite some time.

I didn't buy the \\"I'm on a cloud\\" part they tried to stress for the main actress throughout the movie. Besides the movie fails to release strong emotions when they are supposed to flow and the characters have no real development or depth. You can't even call the main actress a romantic person.

Yet I give Queen credit for having slipped in the crucial information in such a way that I have it no importance and didn't remember it when it came time to name the culprit.This is one more of the somewhat satirical Hollywood mysteries and while not an accurate picture, it is highly amusing and challenging to me as to trying to equate the Hollywood characters with real life Hollywood people of the era."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite SATB Album!!!!","review":"First Song \\"Cascade\\" is probably their best ,most unpopular, song. A masterpiece, it starts off slow then budgies excellent tribal drums come rolling and pounding in. I imagine drops of crystal water falling from the sky and crashing in the sea, when listening to it. Siouxsie Sioux's signature soaring and swooping vocals have matured here. All the other songs are incredible as well making it a run through all album. The only weak spot is Circle, with terrible lyrics and an irritating repetitive loop. One of the three albums done w/John McGeoch, their best guitarist. An absolutely genius addition are the strings, adding even more eccentricity to the band. A masterpiece album by my favorite band. RIP SATB"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, unique, and exotic","review":"This is SATB's most experimental record. Cascade may be SATB's best song, which makes me wonder why it wasn't chosen to be a single. Cocoon and Obsession are leagues away from their rock style, but both are masterpieces of art.The only disappointments on this album are Circle, which is a pretentious and thoroughly pointless song that I've never warmed up to, and She's a Carnival, which is grating. Both songs are excessively repetative.Highly recommended. This is SATB's second-best album, in my opinion. Superstition is their finest. Juju is third. Scream is fourth.It's no surprise that SATB covered two Beatles songs, Helter Skelter and Dear Prudence. This is their most Beatles-esque album. Green Fingers even has a flute part that reminds me of the recorded used on their Magical Mystery Tour album. Both albums may have been made under the influence of similar chemicals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Perhaps I am being over-critical, but I cannot hide my disappointment in this release. Seeing that the track listing contained gems such as Cascade and Melt, I rushed home as fast as the wind would carry me... and put it on the stereo.I still have not got over the disappointment of this awful version of Melt (compared to Nocturne), in which they employ an absolutely sickening \\"second voice\\", uttering \\"melt\\" and \\".. she says .. \\". Kind of reminds me of the single version of Cocteau Twin's \\"From the flagstones\\", but that's another story.The versions of \\"Cascade\\" and \\"Painted Bird\\" are also very disappointing, esp. since \\"Cascade\\" is my favourite song off \\"Nocturne\\". Maybe these songs were just meant to be done live.As for the rest of the album, well, it just doesn't quite have the same haunting atmosphere of Siouxsie's real gems, such as \\"Juju\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is This Book Accurate?","review":"Like the previous reviewer, I also have some questions/concerns about Higham's accuracy. I've read at least 5 other books about Thalberg, Shearer & MGM, & several things here are new to me including allegations that the Thalberg Shearer marriage was shaky (I've always read the exact opposite previously), & that Thalberg had a tendency to scream at people when he was angry (I've previously read that his persona tended to be quite mild mannered). I'd be very interested to hear other Mayer/Thalberg/Shearer biographer's opinion of this book's accuracy. I also question the allegations that Walt Disney was a Nazi sympathizer amongst others.

Louis Kossuth was a very interesting personality, and there really is scant information in English available.

So far I hate it. Nothing but innane chatter."},{"rating":"1","title":"A MAJOR THRILLER? A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"I struggled to understand why this book was published. A self respecting author would have rounded up all copies of the final draft and burned them. Although the basic concept is intriguing, cardboard characters spouting wooden dialogue and enacting laughable situations for doubtful reasons is not my idea of a good time. Descriptions of unfolding action are as bad as you can possibly imagine. Upon finishing I tossed it in the trash instead of adding it to my library.Then I found the answer to my question: the only conceivable reason a publisher touched this dreck. The author was a speechwriter for Bill Clinton. (Now we know why the speeches are overlong, boring and smell of barely disguised incompetence.) Now we know.Oh. One more thing. There was a scriptish tone about this misbegotten project.

If all you want is a breezy read, this may be for you. But if you want some decent writing -- forget it.Those who praise the plot are wrong. The plot is terrible. The \\"hook\\" is the only thing this book has going for it. Supreme Court clerk lets decision leak, gets blackmailed and then tries to find way out. That's good. The execution doesn't do the hook justice. The plot meanders all over the place, dead end after dead end.The dialogue is so juvenile I practically had to scream \\"No! No! No one is that stupid.\\"I'm not a huge fan of Grisham, but I think that each of his books reads better than this one.

The competition is on its way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as bad as a blow to the kidneys","review":"Somewhat more entertaining than most legal thrillers, but much more immature, too. Nancy Drew comparisons are apt for the first half, although the second half, which focuses on paranoia, threats, two beatings, disintegrating friendships, and a suicide, is really not the sort of thing that would have happened to Nancy. Occasional lines are rather puerile: \\"Dang, I thought it was a big ol' game of Parcheezi,\\" said Ben. This novel is worth a look if you can get it second-hand or mass-market paperback, if for only the novelty of dorm life combined with blackmail. I really question whether the author has a future writing this kind of thing in an ongoing way, though, and I imagine the publishers lost money on the book given its unbelievably expensive in-your-face promotional push. I'm definitely not springing for another hardback from Meltzer any time soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and a quick read","review":"I picked this book off my bookshelf after not finding the latest Clancy novel. After only a few pages, I was hooked and couldn't put it down.The dialogue was especially funny to me, a 29-year-old male. I loved Ober's crazy ideas (especially his Mexican restaurant name, Tequila Mockingbird) along with Ben and Lisa's mock bickering.Meltzer keeps you guessing and, at one point, my list of suspects was up to about six or seven. He played the whole story out extremely well. Even when you find out who Rick's inside source is, you didn't know the truth.I've read some of the other reviews and will say that everyone's entitled to their opinion. But, personally, I don't think it deserves all of the pans that it's getting. Meltzer's first attempt into the legal thriller genre exceeded my expectations and will get me to read his other novels.If you like crisp, funny dialogue between young 20-somethings, I strongly recommend you read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the hype","review":"I bought this in an airport to read on the plane -- please don't compare it to Grisham. The dialogue is worse than running your fingernails down a blackboard. The plot is silly as well as unbelievable. The characters seem written to make you dislike them intensely. The cover illustration is nice though, and there were occassional passages where the reading was not painful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down - easy reading too!","review":"I love legal thriller novels and thought this book was one of the best I've read lately.

This could havebeen a good story but sigh, the story lacked a writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Lord","review":"Rarely have I read a book that contained dialogue this trite or characters this shallow. While I credit the author for devising an ingenious storyline, I simply could not get past the tedious dialogue or, as one of my predecessors noted, a sheer overabundance of meaningless \\"he said\\"s and \\"she asked\\"s. While I can blame the author's editor for the latter error, the first lies squarely with the author. These characters, particularly the protagonist's friends, spend their lives speaking a dialect that is too clever by half, and, after the first sixty pages, simply becomes annoying. Ultimately--weak ending aside--the prepossessing, two-dimensional characters who litter this book make this first effort a disappointment. (Note to the publisher: the description of our hero's \\"accidental\\" slip which causes his problems is a bit misleading, since a casual reading of that entire scene speaks loudly to the contrary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly & full of errors","review":"One might forgive the puerile, wholly implausible plot, if the book gave an accurate description of the life of a Supreme Court law clerk. Nothing of the sort. The number of inaccuracies and implausibilities is staggering. This guy has no clue what it's like to clerk for the big court, or about Washington life in general. For example, he thinks the State Department investigates death threats on Senators.

The premise was interesting - what happens when you say the wrong thing to the wrong person - but the dialogue, the plot development, and the ending were dissappointing. Grisham is much better at this type of book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended for the thinking reader","review":"I was intrigued by the premise of this book, but the flaws just cannot be masked.While writing a \\"regular guy and his buddies fight the insidious and powerful villains\\" book, Meltzer fails to let the reader connect with the main characters. Not for lack of effort though, as there is more than a little melodrama and an unecessary pull on the reader's heart-strings in an effort to make all the machinations seem somehow meaningful.Ultimately, the problem for this book is the main character's buddies themselves, who each have a particular talent, and oddly, each of them has a moment to come through with a deus ex machina resolution to a problem. This stretches the credulity of the tale beyond the point of pleasure.After reading this, I took the plunge on another Meltzer book, The Zero Game, which I found a great read. The Tenth Justice is definitely not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"implausib le","review":"About the only thing plausible in this book is the sense of place. The setting is Washington, DC, where I live, and most of the locations in the book are places the author has obviously been to or researched. The dialogue, however, is implausible, as is the behavior of the characters. These characters are supposed to be smart people, but they all talk, think, and act like kids. Though funny at times, the incessant junior-high-like insults and banter was mostly annoying. And it is just impossible to believe that people would make the decisions that the characters in this book make. For a better thriller involving lawyers, spying, and a young rookie getting caught up in a conspiracy, try Grisham's The Firm. If you want a realistic legal thriller, try something by Fairstein."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Does Brad Meltzer Know at Warner Books?","review":"This was one of the worst books I've ever read. The dialogue was trite, the characters were shallow and one dimensional. The premise of the book seemed interesting but a writer of Meltzer's inexperience couldn't carry it off. Reading used to be the last refuge for those of us who are not interested in Melrose Place, 90210, or Party of Five. Save your money.

As a consuming public, are we realy this naive?","review":"Finished the Tenth Justice and must say that I'm amazed this was ever published. Sophmoric dialogue, plot, storyline, and tone added up to a book that never even comes close to working. Save your money and your time and read something, anything, else. This is a real poor piece of writing and time. Hype, hype, and more hype.."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad it is almost good","review":"I was tempted to give this book 5 stars for its utter awfulness. About midway through the book, I realized the only reason I wanted to finish was in the slim chance that every single character should die a horrible death. It takes a pure type of talent to write a book this bad -- this is the \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" of awfulness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scott Turrow has nothing to worry about!!!!","review":"I am so glad I waited for the paperback version of this book. The dialogue was juvenile and I hardly cared for any of the characters. The only redeeming quality of the book is the plot. I don't think anyone had a better premise than Meltzer, but it's apparent in this book that he needs more writing experience (especially the dialogue) or maybe it's too much TV (Melrose Place watcher, I'd bet). I will give Mr. Meltzer one more read when his next book comes out..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I actually finished it","review":"The way I see it, the author is probably a roommate of someone with decision making power at the publishing house. If my high school son wrote this, I might be impressed that he could put together the plotline. But, I'd tell him his dialog was too juvenile, he sounded like a ten year old. I did like the concept of the story, but I spent most of the read irritated thinking another author or even I could have done a better job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe Gen-Xers like this stuff...","review":"Meltzer's writing is immature and the story is badly constructed. If this is how the Gen-X generation speak and behave, I fear for the future. Too bad, because I was intrigued by the Supreme Court plot line. I should have waited for the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Written for the screen?","review":"Meltzer's fairly improbable but highly entertaining novel about the blackmail of a Supreme Court clerk leaves one with the feeling of having just watched a surprisingly satisfying movie. The light dialogue is quick, as is the action, among characters who are developed just enough to be interesting. The unsuspecting reader is engaged to the very end with an ample share of plot twists. All in all, this reader will not be surprised in the least to learn of a film script in development. (In fact, this reader may have some casting suggestions...) I found this book to be an excellent diversion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darn Good Read","review":"The temptation by many of my fellow readers is to compare every book in this genre to Grisham. Why?

I think he has a promising future."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of my brain cells","review":"one of the worst novels i've read in a long time and i read EVERYTHING. the only reason i even finished it was i was annoyed i'd spent 7.99 on it. the four male characters all seemed like the same person with different names. the plot was lame. the writing sophmoric or possibly freshman-level in high school.they'll probably make it into a movie anyway but it's going to need a lot of work..."},{"rating":"2","title":"MELTZER'S BEST","review":"I've read all of Brad Meltzer's books and this was my favorite. I would stick him in with Baldacci and Grisham as far as style, but his niche is DC politics. I raced through this book and looked forward to every sitting.

The premise of this book is very interesting and provides some good (and I assume realistic) insight into the life of a clerk for the Supremes but the book is overly long, the writing juvenile, and the characters ridiculously unlikeable (and stupid).

The story seemed to drag on forever at a slow, plodding pace.

Yeah, that's the ticket.I found myself finishing this book only because I felt guilty about wasting 25 bucks on it.Want real legal suspense? Read _A Civil Action_ by Jonathan Harr.

Thus, I felt somewhat obligated to finish the book. If it were not for that, I would have put it down after the first 30 pages. The plot seemed contrived and implausible. The characters were not very well developed, with the sole exception of the protagonist (whom I found to be naive, selfish, spoiled and self-destructively impulsive). The dialogue was at times witty, at other times downright annoying. I was especially bothered by the repeated use throughout the book, by almost all the characters, of the comeback: \\"Funny!\\" or \\"You're so funny!\\" or \\"That's not funny!\\" However, in all fairness to the author, while I fault him for a lack of craft, I have to compliment him on his clear and crisp use of the English language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Believable","review":"This book was bad to say the least. You have a supreme court law clerk who is supposed to be amongst the brightest minds in the nation falling for a trick that a ten year old would see through. The dialogue of this book is tedious and mechanical.Every step of the book I knew or had a hunch for what was going to happen next. At no time did I ever feel any kind of intrigue or suspense. Maybe it was because I could not care less what happened to any of the characters.Basic plot: Moron law clerk gets tricked into revealing a pending supreme court decision. He gets black mailed by the same guy into having to reveal even more decisions.

If properly supported with character development, mood, setting, etc., I can see how the rest of the book could have been fun. Lacking these elements, however, the subsequent twists and turns sounded kind of like the bad movie that the characters often mocked. In all fairness, though, this is a first novel from a young writer. I'll give his next effort a try before I close the book on Brad Meltzer."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is too high for this work.","review":"One of the few books I have not finished. I struggled through the first few chapters and found the plot and characters purely unbelievable. In general, the book is very poorly written, and blessed with a simply stupid plot. A major problem is with the dialog...people do not talk as he writes, and there is far too much dialog to keep a reader on track. Hard to believe the author is a college graduate. The author should stick to lawyering and give up writing.

These four guys are pathetic.Everything else in the book suffers from the dialogue, and the book is dialogue-heavy. 'Nuff said.The other BIG problem I have with the story is that although the hero beds his female co-clerk, it (1) takes him forever to do so, (2) he never does it with her again. None of the roommates have a sex life either.

If not, save the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bored with Grisham?, Try Meltzer!!!","review":"I found the tenth justice to be the book I was hoping for with every Grisham(and never got). This is the first book I've ever read where I felt the characters spoke as they would in real life. As a warning, it may not appeal to or seem real to readers who are out of touch with the twenty-somethings of today(my mom would not evern finish it).

Although it purports to be a mystery, there is little or no suspense, perhaps because the characters are so shallow it's hard to care whether they live or die. I can only assume Mr. Meltzer thought it would directly to the screen-large or small-since there is no narrative or character development. Good premise; disappointing implementation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't want to put it down","review":"Supreme Court clerk gets conned into revealing a decision before it is announced.Gets revenge.

The book does do a good job of grabbing the reader and keeping them in the book, but then you get to the last 100-150 pages and the Author just falls apart by really reaching and grasping for straws to find a solution.This is my first reading of Brad Meltzer and it was not a good beginning. Lets hope it gets better with his other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating, Annoying and Unbelievable.","review":"The idea that a Supreme Court Clerk would be so careless with his responsibility is ridiculous. To add insult to injury the author continues to permit these careless mistakes to continue throughout the book.

It never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes! This be bad.","review":"This book reads as if it was written by a first-year law student--which it was.

And I surely cannot believe that his \\"hot\\" co-clerk decided to share a night of no-strings passion with him. I was rooting for the villain..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable","review":"[...]This book is the antithesis of a masterpiece. It is pure bubble-gum, Hardy Boys, average to below-average writing. Meltzer has a bad habit of acknowledging many experts at the beginning of his novels, thereby giving the impression that his books are authoritative, behind-the-scenes, fact-filled gems. In reality, his dialogue is laughable, there are little or no facts throughout, and suspension of disbelief gets harder and harder as one progresses through the novel.This might be acceptable if the writing wasn't so amateurish across the board. Rapidly switching POV's, characters exchanging inane, expository dialogue, and screenplay-type prose with little or no description make for painful reading.The Library Journal said it best, that it would keep YA (Young Adult) audiences entertained.

Brad Meltzer is apparently one of the hottest young things to happen to the tired genre of the legal thriller. If this, his first novel, is anything to go by there is some serious hyping going on. Even as summertime beach reading this novel doesn't make it. Cardboard cutout characters bumble their way through a papier-mache plot. It is nothing more than a lightweight attempt at writing a novel with one eye on the filmrights, ala John Grisham. Indeed, if this were a telemovie (a cinema film would be unthinkable surely) it would definitely be on at 4:30am on a Tuesday morning on the Fox network.One star for effort and another for it getting published."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Friends\\" meets \\"Harriet The Spy.\\"","review":"An awkwardly written, obvious, Generation X take on a thriller.

It is absolutely terrible. The story is implausible, formulaic, and you never care one itty-bitty bit about any of the characters.

The Protagonist, Ben Addision, is engaging, but his \\"holier than thou\\" mentality gets to you after a while. His nemisis, Rick, is never really explored or explained. To me, he seemed omnipotent.

However, his utter lack of any writing ability whatsoever makes this novel simply unbearable at times. The dialogue is ridiculous. I have never -- and I mean NEVER -- read a novel where the dialogue and characters were so unbelievable. The plotline could have made for a great novel, but the idiocy of the main characters ensures that the book goes nowhere. While reading, numerous times I was amazed at how little common sense any of the characters had. I mean, Ben screws up by telling something he shouldn't have, and then he goes and tells everyone about it??? Give me a break. Don't embarrass Grisham and Turow by comparing them to Brad Meltzer.

He is a Clerk for the US Supreme Court (we're reminded of the incredible feat countless times throughout the book) and he does some of the most moronic things that a non-top law school graduate would never do.

It virtually didn't leave my hand until I'd completed it. Great plot, wonderful dialogue, nice ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Meltzer's book is about the most juvenile, poorly written and plotted thriller I have ever read. The dialogue is stiff, the plot goes beyond suspension of disbelief, and the characters lack depth or even a hint of reality. If I could give it no stars I would. How this book got any raves boggles my mind. Other than the author's personal story of writing the book (being just out of law school, etc.), there is nothing about it that recommends it. It took me over four weeks to finish it because it was most definetely not a page-turner-- I could put it down and not care what was happening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Illegal Filler","review":"How worse can you get for a legal thriller without a single court-room scene? The plot was horrible, dialogue simple yet boring, characters and situations totally unbelieveable. Most rediculous of all are the \\"reviews\\" inside. This is a book that does not respect the readers at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was a teenage supreme court clerk","review":"This is one of those books that gives hope to aspiring novelists. \\"Man, if he can get this clumsy stuff published, why can't I?\\" The dialogue does not even come close to matching the characters as Meltzer wants you to imagine them. On several occasions when the plot loses it way (which is often) I fully expected the roommates to break out in the \\"Friends\\" theme song. You have to wonder if a writer (or maybe we should just call him a \\"typist\\") like Meltzer ever really met any \\"normal\\" people and/or actually listened to \\"regular\\" conversations. His writing certainly makes you wonder. The cute banter among the roomies really gets annoying ... like after the first 100 pages. This is a book that is really easy to put down ... I know this because I've done so frequently. As you read along you're reminded of the Peggy Lee song, \\"Is that all there is?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"More holes than a hunk of swiss cheese","review":"You'll spend the entire book wondering why \\"He just doesn't....\\" Of course if he had, all those trees wouldn't have died to make the pages of this atrocious effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY!!","review":"I gave this book a try on the strength of the number of Amazon reviewers who gave this book a 10. (I thought those who gave it a 1 were simply being pretentious). Boy was I wrong! This book proves that you don't have to be a writer to get a book published. It gives hope to all who would like to write a book but have no talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was Awful!!!","review":"I can't believe that this book was published. The characters were not interesting. The plot was not original. The writing was juvenile. I just can't believe that a book of this caliber got published. I've read books that are hard to follow and didn't make a whole lot of sense, but I would read those books again before I read another book by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is grossly over-rated.","review":"After all the hype, I bought this book expecting something as least as good as Grisham and hopefully better. What a letdown: cardboard characters, a tepid plot, wretched pacing and inane dialogue. Why it is getting a big push from the publisher is beyond me. I found it juvenile and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad .... Very Bad!!","review":"When I finished this book (and I am amazed that I did) - I came to the conclusion that it was written by a high school kid (or younger) - the content was extremely amateurish. Very disappointing book from this author and to compare him to the likes of John Grisham and Scott Turow is somewhat misleading. From the implausible storyline to the shallow and irritating characters - this book was simply too awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"My advice: Wait for his next book. Hopefully it'll be better","review":"I want to support new novelists. I live in Washington, D.C. and particularly love to read about my adopted and beloved city. I eagerly bought this highly praised first effort and settled down to be amused and dazzled. Instead, I was bored and horrified. The writing is embarrassingly poor. The dialogue is painful. The characters are unbelievable. I couldn't get past the first few chapters and skipped to the end just to learn what happened -- and found out, after reading it, that I didn't care. What WAS good about the book was the novelty of the plotline -- young Supreme Court clerk gets bamboozled and his life goes quickly south. It was new, it was different, and for that, we should be thankful"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor entry in derby of books written by lawyers","review":"Trivia. Dialogue waste of time, paper and adds little(or nothing) to the story. Not too bad an idea for a plot but draggy. Preppie talk. A book trying to cash in on \\"Friends\\" of TV style. In a league of its own--very minor effort. Meltzer needs to pass the bar and get on with making his income the old fashioned way-suin"},{"rating":"1","title":"Insufferable Bilge","review":"This review is largely intended for Tordie, whose review appears below. Jealous are we? I recently read Mein Kampf and thought that was shit too. I presume you'll be saying that I am jealous of Hitler's writing skills? Would you like it if somebody said that you enjoyed the book only because you're in love with Meltzer? I bet you wouldn't. Just how in the name of sweet Jesus do you know that us naysayers are jealous? How can you know that? Maybe we just thought that this was the most unpublishable piece of crap to come along since Absolute Power. I for one am stunned at just how bad Meltzer's book is. I didn't think there could be a lawyer book worse that Absolute Power, but I was certainly wrong.How about that cutesy-pooh little scene where we meet the cute, crazy, wacky, and funny gang? It just does not get any worse than this. Baldacci's work is Shakespeare compared to this embarrassing trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"God Almighty how can it get any worse!","review":"ONCE AGAIN, AMAZON IS CUTTING REVIEWS IN HALF.

Is the lesbo here yet?\\" \\"Actually, there are five types,\\" Ben said.It just does not get any worse than this. Baldacci's work is Shakespeare compared to this embarrassing trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks!","review":"The dialogue is so sophomoric. Hard to believe that supreme court law clerks would talk like this. Every cliche known to young people is used and the plot of the book gets pushed aside. Made it through half the book before I could read no more. Glad I got it at the library and did not waste my money on it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Book heading for the screen","review":"I don't know who owns the screen rights to this book, but it practically writes the screen play for them. The characters are attractive, interesting, and provide a peek into the high court through the eyes of the clerks. Enough red herrings to keep you guessing who the real traitor is until almost the final page. If this isn't made into a movie or tv series, somebody is missing out on the kind of entertainment mainstream america wants. I liked this book enough that I will follow up on others by Brad Meltzer. A great beach book with enough substance to entertain anytime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuppie Heaven","review":"I had high hopes for this book as I enjoy books about the government. I came away totally disappointed. If I could have gotten my money back I would have. This book is an exercise in how yuppies use the system to keep from having to be responsible for their actions. I liked the first 40-50 pages but as he kept calling this ex-classmate for favors and that one for favors to cover up his actions the author lost me completely. I would actually give this book zero stars if I could. I can only hope that the author improves in his following books because to me this one is a loser."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Friends\\" goes to the Supreme Court with Drew Carey.","review":"Readable. Friends goes to the SupremeCourt with Drew Carey's friends along forthe ride. Reminded me of Sidney Shelton'sbook where the heroine takes the deadcanary into the witness and then is firedfrom the d.a's office, but this is still a readablebook. You want to find out how , Ben, theclerk, is going to get out of this pickle"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham-type excitement but better","review":"By far one of the best books I have ever read. I picked it up in England last week and noticed that it isn't yet available in the states. When it gets here, RUN TO THE BOOK STORE!Meltzer combined a fascinating and fast moving plot with interesting characters and great dialogue. This book was more than a page turner -- it was a chapter turner. In addition to giving me a great plot, it has some great characters. If you are the type who likes legal thrillers, or the type who likes to read brilliant dialogue, or the type who likes to laugh, this book has all of it. Better read it before Hollywood turns it into something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meltzer captured me, but I was left wanting more","review":"Having already read Brad Meltzer's other two books, I picked up The Tenth Justice anticipating excellence. Mr. Meltzer did not let me down. As he has proved in all of his books, characterization is his strong point. While most authors of fast paced thrillers and the legal genre focus more on plots twists to engage us, Meltzer endeared me immediately to his characters. Ben, Nathan, Eric, and Ober could have been my friends or the group of guys living next door while I was in college. As was the case in Tenth Justice, I left this book caring about each of the characters and wondering what happened with them later in life.I was, however, a little disapointed in the ending. It seems to simply end, with no closure for any of these characters that I'd grown to love so much. I didn't expect a storybook ending, but felt a little dismayed at the outcome of my new friends. Still, a very good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Drivel - Ben and Our Gang!","review":"Ingnorance is truly bliss! As a recently retiredfederal law enforcement official I found thisbook to be terribly lacking of a solid technicalfoundation. I think the author has potential,however if one knows anything about howlaw enforcement and federal bureaucratsoperate, this was sad. Take away all ofthe unnecessary dialogue between thefriends and you have a book of about 100pages.

Some of the songs are ok but the story, acting, characters, etc are soooo bad. My daughter considers it one of her favorite movies but, hee hee, I bought it so I get to review it. If you have a tween who likes the Jonas Brothers, buy it for her but LEAVE THE ROOM when she starts to watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great New Disney Hit!","review":"Camp Rock is the new Disney summer teen musical & it rocks.The story centers on Mitchie- an ordinary girl who thinks she has to lie to fit in with the cool girls at an exclusive camp dedicated to talented young rockers. Over the course of the movie she learns from friends including a hunky young rockstar & enemies that all she needs to succeed is to be herself!It a great message for all young people but I thinks its the wonderful performance of Demi Lovato as Mitchie & Joe Jonas as the rockstar & the great musical numbers that everybody will really love!I should note that Nick & Kevin Jonas appear in the movie in smaller supporting roles and do very well. The Jonas Brothers perform a couple songs in the movie and they are great!I just saw the movie last nigh & can not wait to see it again!The DVD provides an alternate ending and tips from cast members on how to be a rock star. I am, sure the DVD will be worth owning!"},{"rating":"1","title":"never received, never heard from seller, no refund received either","review":"How can I submit a review for something I never received.

The story sucks. The acting and NO GOOD. I would never pay money for this. I would not even pay $0.01 for it. They could not even give this movie away its so bad.The songs suck and that Demi Lovato girl needs to shut up. Though the movie you will think why do you even talk? As for the Jonas Brothers. What the crap is the big deal? I see nothing amazing about um! They sing like they are forcing it out! As for acting? Well boys just keep trying to sing, acting is not for you.The rest of the cast is just as forgettable as the leads. I'll still trying to forget the leads. Everyone seems like they know how bad the movie is and just give up during the movie.The songs are forgettable and nothing stands out its just hard to sit through.If you want a good Rock Musical watch The American Mall!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Camp Rock... doesn't rock. At all.","review":"Camp Rock was an immense disappointment. I went into it expecting something a la High School Musical (a personal favorite of mine). Unfortunately, this isn't even in the same universe as High School Musical. Demi Lovato, the main character, seems like a nice girl. Who can't act. And can barely sing. Miley Cyrus could've done far more with the role- and that's saying a lot. The story failed to capture my interest, and the songs... ugh. Unlistenable garbage. Hold out for High School Musical 3 and let Camp Rock pass by you. If we're lucky, maybe the sequel will be the less we'll ever hear of these less-than-rock-ers."},{"rating":"1","title":"nope, sorry","review":"This tried so hard to be like \\"High School Musical\\" and it is really lacking the heart of those films, but this is your basic Disney fair and kids will think its cute. Joe Jonas was really sexy so that justifies a viewing lol"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Okay Disney movie-love it for the songs","review":"I am glad that both Camp Rock[Extended edition] and The Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus Best of Both World Concert 3D were released at the same time and they had some deal when you buy both. I bought both. On Camp Rock, the whole story line is okay and typical, there is always those group of girls who single out a girl who is sort of different from them. The girls on there weren't that great at acting,but I really enjoyed watching it for the music and songs by the Jonas Brothers and Demi Lovato. The other characters who sang on there were also good. I would't mind watching it again and that's what I like about most Disney movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean, Family Fun","review":"The Jonas Brothers and other Disney stars are everywhere you look these days. And if you missed the million-and-one showings of the movie on the Disney Channel, now's your chance to watch the movie.The film itself is typical for a DCOM movie. But, it has a sort of charm that manages to make you smile after a long day. The cast works well together, though there were some plot points that seemed overlooked, and others that they spent too much time going through. Apart from Joe, the rest of the Brothers don't have much of a part, and seem thrown in only as an afterthought.The music is similar to what you'd expect in \\"High School Musical\\". It's catchy and upbeat, and chances are you'll have at least one of the songs stuck in your head for a few days after the viewing.All in all, it's a delightful film. There isn't anything crude in it, and the lyrics are clean. I'd highly recommend it to anybody who just wants a sweet family-friendly popcorn flick to pass an evening. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Camp Rock ROCKS1","review":"This movie is filled with the loveable and teen sensation, Jonas Brothers, plus some rockin' music, and teen rivalry. I totally love this movie, I've seen it like 5 times. Im fourteen, and I must say, the Jonas Brothers are un-unloveable in this movie. Kevin Jonas is especially funny with his famous \\"group hug\\" and the famous \\"Can you make me a birdhouse?\\" line. I love the relationship with Mitchie (Demi Lovato) and Shane (Joe Jonas - adorable!). Shane seems to become less of a pain when Mitchie steps down to him in the kitchen when he barged in demanding his allergy list. Anyway, bottom line, this movie is totally better than High School Musical, and its my personal fave because of the Jonas Brothers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Camp Rock","review":"I have not yet received the DVD.I had ordered another DVD at the same time, but oly this one I haven't received."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Get It","review":"I didn't get to see the movie cause the person i bought it from never sent it to me. took my money and kept to movie. some of my friends said it was bad but i don't know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mean-spirited flick","review":"\\"Camp Rock\\" is more like \\"Camp Crude.\\" I hoped it would channel some of the energy and zest of High School Musical, but it was HSM's weak, mean-spirited shadow and lacked the Disney touch. A few examples: When the heroine reveals that she lied by glamorizing her parents to fit in, she never apologizes to the group she's deceived, no one steps forward to reassure her that bucks and bling aren't what's really important, and her Mom doesn't mind at all that her daughter is blisteringly ashamed of their family. Kids repeatedly call each other \\"jerk.\\" The bad girl is shallow and just plain mean, with none of the comic genius that Ashley Tisdale brought to the parallel role in HSM.The big dance numbers that played so well in HSM's expansive cafeteria and hallway scenes are here dampened by the confines of low-roofed camp mess halls, and there's not a song you'll be singing the next day.With so many better movies out there, this is one you don't need to own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Camp Rock","review":"I HAVE NOT RECEIVD THIS PRODUCT AND HAVE TOLD AND THE SELLER, GOTTA VOTTA.

Even the second person plural pronoun \\"sizlar\\" (you all) is left out. The material also shows some Turkish influence, such as the use of a verb for \\"to want\\" (\\"baliq istaysizmi?\\" \\"shirinlik xohlaysizmi?\\" are not spoken Uzbek).

It not only rocks, it has unique songs with unusual qualities, most notable of course are the bizarre vocals of the Aston twins. Taking the direction of the simplistic and under-developed \\"Promise,\\" \\"Immagrant\\" was one of the more unusual and cool-sounding records from my old 1980's lp collection.

I was disappointed because it does feel as if a developer sat down in front of a video camera and did a 1 tape shoot. Still, I love this concept and would like to have seen more time taken with each lesson. But, I am a visual leaner, so I appreciate having a DVD option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"I guess you get what you pay for, it was a bit borring for me to watch the lessons.

The first 30 or so pages comprise a solid introduction to the basics, but after that the book gets vague and difficult to follow. The directions for some of the practice problems were confusing.I understand that it is hard to write a slim volume on such a complex game, but I think some important intermediate steps were left out before the book started on more advanced material.It's cheap price makes it worth picking up if you aren't sure whether or not you will get into the game enough to make buying a more expensive book worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"REAL JAZZCAT","review":"This LIVE performance by Anita and her trio, John Poole, Al Plank and Al Obidinski is exceptional, one of her best works ever. I could go into great detail, but suffice to say, Basin Street West is truly a rare find in the elite jazz circle. I have almost all of her records through the years and many were never remastered to CD, which makes this 1964 recording an instant classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Performance . . .

There is almost no between-song banter. (Additionally, although Anita is famous for singing at a break-neck pace, I'm not so sure that this recording insn't playing back a tad too fast.

The band was really on fire, playing and singing for all they were worth. The set list is fantastic, nicely spanning their career to date, although light on their really early work; the songs follow each other in perfect order.

Suffice it to say that this is a pretty good collection of short films that's definitely worth your viewing. The two standouts are KALI MA, a robustly humorous and touching film about an East Indian-American mother's unconditional love for her son, and the superb Norwegian film BENNY'S GYM, that tells a beautifully compelling story of blossoming friendship between two pre-teen boys.Give these films a look. They're really a notch above most gay shorts I've seen"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boys Briefs 5 - A series of Boys Briefs","review":"I am really not into the films that are being put out for boys Briefs.

He has changed his style constantly over the years but the sound he was into in the late 1970s was amazing and like nothing I had ever heard. He played solo, with his guitar fed through fuzz, swell and an echoplex, along with an understated drum machine. The result was a swirl of building patterns of sound with the guitar echoes providing the rhythm while he played lead lines over the top. When I saw that a live album from this tour was to be released I had to buy it. The music is great, just as I remembered. Problem is that the sound quality is flat out terrible - it sounds as though it was recorded on a cassette recorder with a faulty drive motor. The sound is so bad that I can't recommend this album despite the great songs and performance. A major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS! Totally Censored version!","review":"Another example of a company putting out Mexican films which they know NOTHING about. This version has multiple scenes removed. They don't do it on purpose.. sadly, they don't even know what they have. So sad... Hey Xenon, take this note down.. \\"the whole point of a good DVD is to make certain the film is uncut\\". Unfortunate because the uncut version is a true testament to the eroticism of 70's Mexican drama. This version if just a daytime soap oprera! So find an old VHS version and see it they way it was intended to be seen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Laurel for the Master","review":"It's often said Chandler could not plot, but The Lady in the Lake gives the lie to that tale. The Lady in the Lake has the complexity of an Agatha Christie or Freeman Wills Crofts and for once Chandler manages to fully (well, almost) make sense of it all at the end. Here the plot revelations keep one turning pages, along with the writing. Characters are vivid as ever, and more plausibly presented than in The Big Sleep. Not as moving a story as Farewell, My Lovely, but beautifully plotted, The Lady in the Lake is a pinnacle of genuine detective fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A novel that makes you wonder what will happen next.","review":"This novel was well written and it keeps you wondering what will happen next. Its full of murders, suspense, and mistaken identities. This is one book that should be read by all. Keeping with the tough guy image of the Film Noire genre with the example of Lieutenant Degarmo the first time he meets Detective Marlowe \\"If I have to get tough, fellow, you'll know it\\". I recomend this easy to read and enjoyable book fully and give it 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book with many twists","review":"I personally thought this book wonderful. It's one of my all time favs. Just when you thought you had the whole story worked out, something else would happen to make you start thinking. It wasn't until the end that I discovered what really had happened. A great read for those who love this type of genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun introduction to classic detective stories","review":"I decided to give a classic detective series a try. Philip Marlowe was a hard boiled detective created by Raymond Chandler. Raymond Chandler is considered a major force is the development of private detective stories. Most of his novels were turned into movies.In The Lady in the Lady Philip is approached by a husband who is concerned about the disappearance of his wife. His wife has a shady side, which would hurt the man's business reputation, so he doesn't want to involve the police.Philip Marlowe then takes a roller coaster ride through murder, intrigue, threats, crooked police and so on. There were a couple twists along the way, but they were honest twists, the author didn't pull a rabbit out of the hat.The story is a page turner. I stayed up until 12:30 to finish it.If you enjoyed classic mysteries, then I think you'll enjoy The Lady in the Lake."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most exciting books I've ever read","review":"The Lady in the Lake is a great, fast-paced book that continues to reveal new secrets with every chapter. The conection between Arthurian Legend particularly The lady of the lake made the book more intersting. \\"The thing rolled over once more and an arm flapped up barley above the skin of the water and the arm ended in a bloated hand that was the hand of a frek.\\" (Pg. 51) This is very similar to the story of The Lady of the Lake. Simple details such as that one made this a highly addictive book."},{"rating":"2","title":"tough guy detective on a mission where nothing is as it seem","review":"Chandler brings back our detective Philip Marlowe from \\"The Big Sleep.\\" In this adventure is trying to solve the case of a missing wife. The case leeds our tough guy detective to the mountains where he is supposed to find the alleged corps, but insteads finds the corps of some other woman. Marlowe then must search the city harder to find clues. He uses every snitch and low life he can. When Marlowe gets closer to solving the case he shakes the witts of crooked cops and low life scum. \\" Police business is a hell of a problem. It's a good deal like politics...So we have to work with what we get-and we get things like this\\" Captian Webber to Marlowe, ch.27,page186."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Summer Read","review":"Chandler takes us through Marlowe to the edge where good and evil become relative prospects. Marlowe goes beyond his usual urban stomping grounds in this work to the summer-time get-away stops of his era. Filled with twists and turns as well as the gritty dialog that you expect from Chandler ... The Lady in the Lake ... is a good read that delivers what it promises."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book has x-ray eyes","review":"In this absolute literary classic, Philip Marlowe has been asked to look into the disappearance of the straying wife of a local businessman. His search to find her leads him through dead bodies, corrupt police, and wicked women. The amazing thing is that the book doesn't preach, it just sees-- Marlowe witnesses the world with a kind of fatalistic and dispassionate affection-- the things people do to each other; the things people do to themselves. The kind of writing style of which most writers can only dream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont bother!","review":"This saga was long winded and just droned on. Rolfe's inability to see Zoe as a young woman after she's shed her disguise is a bit far-fetched and the whole story is colored by the semi-rape love scenes. Not nearly up to the standard of her other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her Best","review":"Elizabeth Thornton writes great fiction. Obviously English-school trained where language arts are important. However, this is not one of her best. Too long, too long-winded, too detailed.Read other reviews for plot-lines as I am concerned only with writing styles. Actually, the two protagonists hardly caused a ripple in my reading hours, but I continue to look for her books as they are usually way above the rest! Sentence structure, interesting plots, mature writing style and romance without all the usual \\"thoughts\\" and clutter. I admire Elizabeth Thornton's style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete Course in Herbalism: Vol. II","review":"Thomas Deschauer is another grand-daddy of herbal medicine. He's right up there with Dr. Christopher and many others. His works (if you can find them) are often his own remedies written up in a recipe format along with those he collected from others. He gives credit to other doctors for their formulas. Many of the herbs listed in the book have old common names. You may have to cross-reference them with other herbal reference books to learn the proper botanical nomenclature, but it's worth the effort. A wonderful book for the herbalist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wailing Dog New On the Block","review":"Wailing Dog is as a new band presents a unique and particularly satisfying product. The lyrics are interesting and thoughtful. The music is inspiring and pleasant to the ear. Hopefully they will continue with their unique blend of guitar, cello and keyboard. It's a terrific experience!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A huge achievement!","review":"Ms. Smith's novel is a major work of crime fiction that goes way beyond the typical genre novel. Here you'll find deep characterization, a strong sense of place, powerful narrative drive and a compelling psycho-moral drama...qualities one finds only in the very best crime novels. Moreover, her heroine is a fascinatingly complex character. \\"Good Morning, Killer\\" is a huge achievement for this author, a fitting follow-up to her brilliant \\"North Of Montana\\" published a decade ago. Kudos to the author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Different","review":"While I certainly understand why this book would not appeal to the average pulp fiction reader, I really enjoyed it because the protagonist was *not* the stereotypical female we've all come to know in the various series that are out there. In fact, I was reminded of Lorraine Page of the short-lived series by Lynda La Plante. I appreciated the fact that Ana Gray was so completely irrational during the course of this story. Isn't anyone weary of the Kinsey Millhones who have such bland, acceptable, if not loveable, faults and are as original as a piece of white paper?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't impressed.","review":"As a rule I try to read as many authors of the crime genre as I can, whether they are new or established. This novel left me asking myself, \\"why did I buy this book?\\" It is rare for me to lose interest in a book or author, but this one has done just that. I must say, I was able to find a new talent that I enjoyed reading. I picked up \\"Waves of Deceit\\" by Marlene de Velasco and found her writing style to be quite refreshing and entertaining. She will definitely go far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Wonderful Ana Grey Story","review":"I was as riveted to this, April Smith's second police/FBI suspense thriller, as I was to NORTH OF MONTANA. Although this is not quite the tight masterpiece that NORTH OF MONTANA was, it has the same elements: compelling, appealing, full-bodied, believable characters; a riveting plot; a credible experience of the ambience and atmosphere of the \\"Southland,\\" as well as a cross-section of the types of people who live there; and, finally, a tragic plot element \\"as deep as a well and as wide as a church door\\"--the kind of tragedy you find in the great classics.This is a more vulnerable and flawed Ana Grey. She commits blunders of timing and judgment that had me smacking the palm of my hand to my forehead as she tries to juggle catching a serial rapist and a very difficult, intense love relationship.April Smith is a gifted, gifted writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jim in Atlanta","review":"Shockingly bad. The main character was so screwed up I could not imagine her solving the crime. How are we supposed to believe in her competence when she so clumsily and incompetently tries to cover up her own \\"crime?\\" Her relationship with the detective was only sketched in, and we are supposed to accept their grand passion? Perhaps worst of all, I saw the \\"surprise\\" resolution of the book coming about halfway through. Horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time and Money","review":"I had never picked up an April Smith novel before, but was intrigued by her lead character. The book had an excellent start, then went horribly wrong. Too many crimes, too many back stories, and a brilliant lead character who turned into a completely ignorant stereo-typical female-running-from-a-killer-in-high-heels victim. My first exposure to April Smith's work, will be my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going downhill","review":"I read April Smith's first book, North of Montana, and enjoyed it. This book continues with the character of FBI Special Agent Ana Grey but this one leaves a lot to be desired. I agree with the reviewers who thought her relationship with her boyfriend, Andrew was not believeable. He was cruel, a cheat and a liar and yet she falls all over him right to the end. If April Smith's intent was to make Ana a doormat, she surely succeeded. The characterization of Andrew is very poor since nothing came through that would make him in any way loveable. He was a Neanderthal and her attachment to him doesn't ring true. In addition, I though she left several plot lines from North of Montana hanging. Her relationship with Donnato was just dropped with no explanation and we don't know for sure what happened to her grandfather. The characters all through the book were wooden and the plot was a little fantastic. This was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware buying used.","review":"I bought this book used.

The metal leaves that hold the handle can be bent easily with a pair of needle nose pliers so the already existing divit to keep the handle upright are tighter as well. Construction is definitely 'cheap' but I like that so that if something happens to it replacing it is no big deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I barely got through this book.

After reading \\"Collide,\\" \\"Tempted,\\" \\"Broken\\" and a host of other truly great Megan Hart novels, I couldn't believe this drivel had her name attached to it. Its boring, uninspired prose is NOTHING like the insightful character development or lyricism of Hart's other works.

I've heard bits and pieces about it from various sources but I didn't have a clear picture of what it would be like. I'm happy to say this is one of the most entertaining series I've had the pleasure to watch in a while. It has a good mix of action and comedy which had me chuckling out loud quite often. The only thing I didn't like was the opening song which was too cheesy for me, but after that it was all great. The animation is decent and the background music for the action scenes were good enough. It's only the beginning but I'm definitely looking forward to what will happen next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Meet Akari & Co.","review":"In this video the viewer meets Akari Kanzaki and her friends during midterms, who all attend the Antarctic Training School in the year 4998.

Poor Akari not only fails all her tests, but she is the daughter of one of the most reknowned Cosmo Beauties of all time, Tomoe Mido! But if she practices hard, and with the help of her friends, there may be hope for her yet!This video contains episodes 1-4 of the series, rated PG-13 for mild language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soothing, Sweet & Soulful....","review":"Wow, Patrick Fitzsimmons has a really lovely voice and he has written some really wonderful songs on love, life, friendship and folly that are beautifully realized on this album. It's spare when appropriate and the piano, cello, violin and percussion jump in at all the right places. This is a thoughtful, soothing yet inspired album with real soft corners for hard times. Everyone should be listening to this album right now. If you like great acoustic folk rock with a hint of pop, this album is for you. You'll listen to it over and over because it just makes you feel so good. Favorites include \\"Come to Me,\\" \\"Forgiving You,\\" \\"Peter's Garden,\\" \\"Two Birds,\\" \\"Beautiful Jane,\\" \\"Old Blue Heart,\\" \\"Fare Thee Well\\" and \\"Gimme' More Love.\\" But really, every song is fantastic.

A beauty of Spanish + African ancestry, already incubating rabies, is pursued by a monk who was in his way to become a saint. Both the young woman and the monk fall for each other with a passion that challenges State and Church, the latter intent in destroying them through its instrument of terror, the Inquisition. They cannot win, of course, but they shake both structures. Her hair does not stop growing even after death.

If they had already proven that they could cover Beatles songs to sound as if it was actually their idea the whole time, the Banshees do it again in the span of an entire LP covering such disparate artists as Kraftwerk and Billie Holiday. While excellent covers, none of the tracks reach the dark and spectacular depths of the Banshees early work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Me too","review":"It's criminal and typical that Siouxie's cover of \\"Trust in Me\\" isn't well known. It's one of the all-time great covers.

But the shaded topics and colorful caricatures of bigger-than-life personalities sure ring loud with entertainment if nothing else. Vollbracht's writing is as vibrant as his pictures - witty and pointed with big splashes of color. His Elizabeth Taylor story is almost worth the price of the book.

And a few years back I saw a show in London at the Barbican on Diaghilev and the Ballet Russe that had original costumes, some sets, and prelimary drawings and sketches for their productions. Some of them were for their 1914 presentation of this opera with dance by Fokine.Yes, dance! They turned the opera into a ballet-opera!Well, this disk won't show you any dance, but you can hear the wonderful music and become familiar with what was so attractive to early twentieth century musicians, painters, and dancers of the avante-guard. This thoroughly tonal opera still had much that appealed to then very modern artists.The only thing this recording could have used that would make me rate it higher is a full libretto.

For those parenting skills that I know and use, it was nice to reinforce their value and hone them further. For those difficult areas that need improvement, I found the book to be a gift. It offers help in an easily disgestible format. The book is arranged like a reference book, which makes it easy to pick up and find information quickly and efficiently.

This book is about one girl named Sophie who wrote a letter to her father when he was away on a ship.She writes to her father about what she is doing in the house. This book is special because it has two stories-the story of Sophie and story of her father. One story is about Sophie which you can read, but her father's story you can see in the pictures. Sophie wants her father to come back. I like the book because it has a happy end.I like to read others' letters. I think people or kids should read the book because it is a good book to learn English, and if you don't know how to read you can understand if you look at the pictures.

The heroine was so uptight and just really...bitchy. She was so set on not staying with him, and what bothers me in romance books is when someone doesn't even tell the other person why they can't be with them. She pushed him away, she was so rude, and sometimes I just couldn't even tolerate her. Poor Matt kept trying, and sometimes I just wanted to shake some sense into him and make him stop being so nice to her. I thought he was being so considerate and sweet and caring, but in the book everybody was telling him he needed to work on how to talk to her.

Her choices of American heroines are safe, politically correct and generally right-wing. Many of those chosen have had business or social relationships with Ms. Hutchinson, giving the impression that she is shoring up her own base.

Once again, the original they have chosen to rip off is David Bowie. Gay Dad happened before except they were rather better and called Suede. But did it ever occur to the record company that manufactured this tinny, trite Bowie-clone, that a group can never properly emulate him because part of his brilliance is that his music revolves around THE INDIVIDUAL.

That is why David Bowie is a cultural icon and Gay Dad are lining the stock clearance bins of music stores everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a really listenable alternative to mass-produced pop","review":"Leisure Noise is one of those rare albums which border on pop but are still respectable to own and own up to owning. The tracks are melodic, but are also thoughtful. There is a high point and low point to this album which is very reminiscent of Manic Street Preachers or maybe Stereophonics, but the music itself has a feel very distinct of both those bands. It's a good listen that flows from beginning to end. Put it on, and just listen, and you'll note that there's not a song out of place. It's a complete package, and that's nice in a time where the manufacture of chart friendly singles are the mainstay of the music industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gay Dad Rule!","review":"\\"Leisure Noise\\" is a great album full of great guitar pop songs.

The first act sets the stage with a great Pre-Raphaelite look, as Francesca and Paolo meet and begin their doomed love. The music, highly melodic in the first and final acts, is charged with drama. In between, you have the brutal scenes of war, hate, violence--with Paolo's brothers, a nasty pair, contrasting nicely with the languid beauty of the two lovers' encounters. This is truly a case where the sets and costumes create a jewel-like setting for the sensual emotions displayed in Zandonai's music."},{"rating":"2","title":"great story, but not a romance","review":"Very interesting story, but it's not really a romance, so not sure why they push it as such.

This book has it all, a strong hero, Blue, and heroine, Iris, and a supportive cast of additional heroes and nasty baddies. The characters, with all their supernatural powers, seem like comic book creations but Liu gives them enough emotional angst to flesh them out and make you care about them.

This film in was shot in a small playhouse and edited to make it something slightly more than a theatrical, one-man play. Some might find the edited-in effects distracting, but I really enjoyed it. The crossfades of veteran's pictures and war footage added context to the dialogue and in some places are quite moving. The story is told completely from Douglas MacArthur's point of view and is a strong script. I continue to be amazed at Saderup's range and his ability to switch characters on-the-fly. It's borders on comical in places, but he keeps it serious. I think history buffs will enjoy this one even though it is nothing like your normal history-channel-movie-fair."},{"rating":"1","title":"No detail when it counts","review":"I purchased this manual because I needed some instruction on replacing the heater core.

While Lyle's contribution to the Pat Metheny Group is stellar, on this disc he really shines as a composer and performer with a much more balanced sense of interplay with his guests. I highly recommend this disc to any fan of Jarrett, PMG, Ralph Towner, or Bill Evans.

So rich in harmonies and changing moods from joy to sorrow and painting the canvas without borders has never happened to me before.

Everytime there was a scene that I thought was a bit corny, the movie would then flip the script & have a great dramatic scene to redeem itself.

Mother/Oh Mein Papa--what is that?? The Lord's Prayer--a waste of space; might be historically interesting as it constituted the band's entire first performance (improvised) some three years previous, but at this point it comes off as mightily forced nonsense.

Siouxsie and the Banshees try to extend their thematic aspirations, that serve only to collide and grate within the limits of the punk genre. The 14 minute rendition of 'The Lord's Prayer' is just awful and takes up half the album. The other tracks, otherwise dark and terrifying, are subject to questionable production: Siouxsie's voice is lost within a sluggish white noise haze. There are great tracks here, they are just made almost unlistenable. Christ, even the cover sleeve is horrible.Best Tracks: Placebo Effect, Playground Twist"},{"rating":"2","title":"Siouxsie's Best Album","review":"This album reflects an early period for the Banshees. It's a very dark and gothic cd, starting with the haunting bells at the beginning of Poppy Day, then smashing through the punkish Regal Zone, followed by the twisted, throbbing Placebo Effect and, my personal favorite, Premature Burial where she whines out that we all should join hands. Best of all, the cd ends with The Lord's Prayer, a song that has, through continuos listenings, forced my wife to snap this cd in-half out of rage. She says that the whole cd sounds like a graveyard---and she's right---this is coming from a woman who listens to Bob Seger and Country music. She simply fails to see the attraction. ---Werty"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extending The Boundaries","review":"The short intro Poppy Day sets the gothic tone for their 2nd album, extending the boundaries of The Banshees' unique punk strain. Here they prove that slow, melodic songs can be equally effective in creating a sense of menace. Playground Twist is classic early Siouxsie, but it gets even better on Mother/Oh Mein Papa, a successful experiment where the juxtaposed words of the lullaby medley create a sinister feel by the eerie buildup of the music. And it ends in a bang with The Lord's Prayer medley which includes phrases of \\"O Claire de la Lune/Mon ami Pierrot,\\" \\"Tomorrow belongs to me\\" (from Cabaret) and sundry other sources.

I like almost all things Italian, and Cooper's 'Italian' humor is so-so, but I found the language detracted from it.If the 'f' word doesn't bother you then like I stated, it's a so-so performance, but not all that great. This DVD is worth about $5 (certainly $10 max) for the quality of humor. As for Cooper's performance style, it's not what I really like, but you may if you like loud, opinionated ranting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charming story but........","review":"The author's wife dropped an email to me, suggesting that I might enjoy this book. I ordered it and read through it. This is a charming story and, although I mostly confine my dragon reading to McCaffrey and a few others, the story seemed fairly original to me.The problem with this book is that the author desperately needed an editor. Misuse of words (\\"heard of runner beast\\", \\"no bases in fact\\"), lack of punctuation, grammatical errors all marred the story. The dialogue is repetitive and doesn't ring true. It's a shame, because without these difficulties, this would be a really good read.I can't write a novel and applaud Mr. Adams for his effort, but in future, a good proof-reader and editor may come in handy to reduce the kind of errors that ruined the suspension of reality for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully done, moving portrait of two Healers","review":"I had the opportunity to view this film with friends who have met Masters Guo and Sha and are familiar with their work.

They are both medical doctors and great healers. Master Guo developed an incredible healing system called Body Space Medicine. I saw many people in his clinic in China who had recovered from cancer. Master Sha, a disciple of Master Guo, is an incredible master in his own right. His ability to give spiritual transmissions and downloads is phenomenal. One night I saw Master Sha give a healing to a very large woman who could barely walk. After the healing, she was walking almost normally. Master Sha gave several other very impressive healings that night. The new Soul Masters movie is a heart-touching story of the journey of these two masters. It is a very inspiring and informative movie. I highly recommend it to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Grace","review":"When I saw it first time , I was so touched by the compassionate kindness eminating from these two healers.

Stopdoing that. For my money, this is the absolute best album XTC ever made-- forget that they did it as the \\"Dukes.\\" It even tops \\"Skylarking\\" and \\"Black Sea,\\" two completely epochal XTC recordings. And why? Because it's fun! You have to be in a certain mood to listen to many of XTC's other albums, but this one can hit you any given time of the day anywhere. Sixteen songs, and all of them perfect in every way. The best of the best would be \\"You're My Drug,\\" \\"Little Lighthouse,\\" \\"25 O'Clock,\\" \\"Bike Ride To The Moon,\\" \\"The Mole From The Ministry,\\" and \\"Vanishing Girl.\\" Hell, they're all great. XTC's greatest album and one of my favorite albums of all time, no holds barred thank you very much.

I count 6 or 7 great tracks on here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psuedo Psychedellia","review":"The XTC Alter ego takes an exploration of the era of psychedellic music of the sixties. Much of the sounds heard especially the later tracks smack of the Beatles, Byrds and oddly enough The Beach Boys (Pale and Precious). Overall a lot of fun with the interruptions of narration which sneak past the listener before or after each track. Personal favorites: Vanishing Girl, Little Lighthouse, You're My Drug, Have You Seen Jackie? It's a shame they haven't produced another since this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A curiosity that will likely sit on the shelf","review":"As a fan of XTC I naturally sought this out after reading rave reviews everywhere I read of XTC - \\"brilliant! tongue in cheek! etc etc\\" It is indeed a brilliant rendering of psychedelic pop. Too good, in fact, as it quickly reminds one of how mediocre the genre actually was. Any of these tracks would be right at home on the NUGGETS box-set, that's how faithfully they've rendered them. I know this alone is enough to make many music fans take notice, but as I am not a fan of the NUGGETS set (I know there are more of you out there!) this does little for me. I grew tired of most of the tracks after one listening. If you're an XTC fan looking for more XTC, buy anything of their you don't already have before resorting to this. If you're a fan of psychedelia, specifically SAUCERFUL OF SECRETS-era Pink Floyd, then by all means purchase this record - it's exactly what you're looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete unadulterated drivel","review":"This may have seemed like a good idea at the time but the result is just awful -- 16 mock psychedelic songs with precious little humour. Stick to the real thing -- buy XTC's real albums, not this horror."},{"rating":"2","title":"XTC's Psych Out","review":"XTC released an EP and an album's worth of music as their psychedelic alter egos, the Dukes of Stratosphear, both appearing on this anthology. The masquerade apparently liberated their creative juices; what could have been a trite throwback actually turned out to be some of their most compelling music. Many of the songs are more than the mere sum of their creative influences: \\"Pale and Precious\\" is wonderfully moving in its own right regardless of its Pet Sounds pedigree just as \\"You're My Drug\\" and \\"Have You Seen Jackie\\" are adrenaline productions even if you've never heard the words \\"Syd Barrett.\\" Some of the cuts bely their 80s origins, but the whole package still comes across better than many \\"genuine\\" psychedelic collections, and is a recommended for those grown weary of the more overexposed 60s nuggets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk, don't bother","review":"I spent a good deal of time installing these locks, following the instructions to the letter, aligning them properly, etc. After being installed for 2 months and less than 300 miles, the catch rounded off and started allowing the hood to pop up.

The author doesn't waste alot of time on characterizations or background, he just keeps the excitement in the present and gives you enough detail so you can actually \\"learn\\" something about this dark and risky lifestyle. The dialogue between the agents is quick, clean, and intelligent. Donnie's dialogue and interactions with the various residents of the Florida Everglades emphasizes his quick wit and humor. But, how did he spend so much time in a waist deep swamp and not get bitten by anything larger than a mosquito?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who thought this one up?","review":"Is it me, or is this one strange idea for a book? Joe Pistone co-wrote \\"Donnie Brasco,\\" a true account of his own experiences as an FBI agent inside the Mafia. Okay. But now he's written a FICTIONAL account, something that never happened, and he's made himself the main character. Sounds like a money-making venture to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy in many aspects, dull story, poorly written","review":"It seems as though Joseph D. Pistone wishes to make himself the next James Bond by writing multiple novels all based on himself. Much like James Bond, some of these stories are great (My Life Undercover), and others, such as Deep Cover, are sloppy and dull. The setting in Deep Cover is in the Florida Everglades, and all of the native Floridians are, for lack of a better word, hicks: a complete 180 from the smart criminals he dealt with when infiltrating the mafia. It is unfair to expect it to be as good as the first book, but I still held Deep Cover to very high standards and was more than a little disappointed in the outcome. In my mind, Deep Cover is Die Another Day while My Life Undercover is Goldfinger."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tedious text.","review":"The promise of this book was great. It was so tedious to get past the first 150 pages that I almost gave up repeatedly. Finally, it improved and Dracula entered the scene.

A little of that went a long way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very very dark","review":"Fans of Chelsea Quinn Yarbro may not like this book as much as they did her Saint Germain titles. I didn't. I am not a fan of dark vampire novels, like Anne Rice's or this one.

It reminds me to \\"It came from the outerspace\\" creatures. The story goes about dirty plan of an american mob who want to take fortune from his passangers and put the blame on a mystical sea creature.

Everything about it is mediocre, from the acting, the monster costume, the dialogue, the quality of the film to the sound. The only redeeming feature in the movie is one that will greatly appeal to liberals because it indirectly justifies totalitarianism in Cuba by portraying some of the characters who are supposed to be Cuban in a really bad light.

Griffiths (who penned Creature from the Haunted Sea ) admitted that the monster in this movie cost 50 bucks. It consisted, he said , of a fur coat, some ping pong balls for eyes, and garden claws for hands.If you watch it in this shrugging context, and go in with lowered expectations ( that is, just to have fun ) this movie is an example of what Corman and his team did best at this time. Movies that second-billed on a drive in while you were trying to retrieve a jordan almond from the back of your date's throat.Its not the best or worst example of the lot (and the beginning shots of cubans photographed in heavy shadow almost ALWAYS puts me to sleep), but what the heck.

The design would work fine if a light weight metal alloy was used for the handle-gear-reel assembly, leaving the body to the cheap plastic, but that would probably put the price beyond what wholesale buyers are willing to put on the shelves at big box stores.

I don't want to waste money on another sub-par Suncast but I really want the storage. I think I'm going to have to go with the 2nd choice of Ames without the storage.One key annoying thing about Suncast in addition to poor quality: the handle is static and doesn't spin when you wind the hose up.

By the way, this is the second review that I've submitted on this book, and the other one was bad-Amazon.com didn't release it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent breakdown of proper body mechanics","review":"This book illustrates the proper body mechanics needed to skillfully throw an opponent rather than relying on strength. I practice both Bagua and Yoshin Ryu Jiujitsu and found it to be a great resource for throws of both arts. The black and white photos may not be the best, but as people come in various sizes the photos do not need to be the best. Practice is what will allow you to learn the correct technique. This book is just a guide, an excellent guide, but just a guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"the dark side","review":"Cartmell knows a lot about martial arts,,,,,but he does seem to know much about photography. He has both tori and uke wearing grey t-shirts and black pants. Furthermore nobody taught the photographer to open up the lens aperature to let a little light into the camera. All the photos are too dark. So the result is in most of the pictures, there is a mass of black where four legs ought to be, and some arms and hands, but you can't really tell which arms belong to whom.The book needs to reprinted on good paper, hire a photographer and make the book something to showcase Mr. Cartmells' vast knowledge. As it is, it's a good read, but the last 2/3 of the book are really pretty useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny and predictable!!!","review":"While the story was mostly entertaining and a quick read, the plot lacked depth. While I love a happy ending, this book tried to wrap up too many issues all in about 200 pages - just not enough dimension."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can easily put it down","review":"I found the characters lacked depth, and the events a little too predictible. The book didn't challenge my thoughts on handicapped people. The story was essentially boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow writing...","review":"As the wife of a spinal cord injured man, I was eager to read this novel. However, I was hugely disappointed with the simple way it brushed through the traumatic issues of rehab, grief, and acceptance -- on the entire family's part, not just the young man's. While I didn't expect a medical tome on the subject of SCI, in just a few pages everyone had adjusted beautifully -- thanks to some pretty lame comedy -- and lives happily ever. Very unrealistic. These characters are one-dimensional, each one straining blood vessels to be funny. Thumbs down."},{"rating":"2","title":"AND JEZEBEL LOVES GENE","review":"Perfectly representative of 80s music, Gene Loves Jezebel's \\"The House of Dolls\\" holds it's ground today as just good playful and meaningful rock and roll pop. The gushy and upbeat, \\"The Motion of Love\\" (a minor hit record), and back door romance of \\"Suspicion\\", would be standard rock love songs if not for GLJ's glittery and pounding treatment, both songs deliver an addictive melody with a relentless beat your mind won't feel guilty humming. The call and response falsetto vocal in \\"Every Door\\" lingers in an ocean of tic-toc percussion and jangly guitar. A bit like, The Alarm, a bit like, Pet Shop Boys, a bit like, Dream Syndicate, they represent 80s rock (not quite new wave), yet remain in a unique category of their own, call it hard playful pop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purple Smoke is not what you think","review":"This color is VERY light and is not what you're looking for if you want a bright purple.

I have purchased it for two libraries and my own collection. Lesser-known women are introduced to the reader. It is a great springboard for students of any age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Review of How the Kidney Works","review":"This book describes renal physiology and the regulation of water and electrolyte balance and then reviews various disorders of the above. The author takes a difficult subject and puts it into simple terms and gives excellent examples of the clinical implication of various renal physiologic mechanisms. There are several problems and solutions for each disorder, and these are also helpful in solidifying knowledge. The detail and physiology probably make this book most suitable for clinical and research fellows in nephrology but medical students and residents would find it useful as well. The price makes the book a real value given the amount of excellent information the book contains."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough and easy to read","review":"As a medical student with an interest in nephrology and acid-base disorders, this book provides a readable but rigorous discussion of the subject. Chapters are well-organized and do not have to be read in order - they are written to be independently referenced as the need arises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eternal Rain Fountain","review":"I LOVE IT! I bought 2 and I am glad I did because the first one developed mineral deposits in the rain spout holes. After some brisk cleaning, it was just like new. I have one at work and one at home. Every kid at school asks me if it is \\"real rain\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rain or Buzz?","review":"This thing is a cheap piece of plastic, and for the same price you can get the larger, nice rock fountain that i have owned and know for a fact works well. I can hardly hear the sound of the rain over the whirring of the motor. It has a nice design in terms of look and it's compact. I also enjoy the lights for ambiance. But for relaxation, this thing has brought me more grief in 3 days than it's worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice inexpensive fountain w beautiful lighting","review":"This is a very inexpensive fountain and I don't think it would be realistic to compare it to other much more expensive models. It is made out of plastic, but it can blend into to decors easily as long as it's not very close to the viewer. The lighting is quite beautiful and you can adjust the flow of water. For the price, I am quite happy with it and do not think it is much nosier than other more expensive models. The pumps are usually all the same or very familiar. However, it is very important to keep the water level up with distilled water. If you don't do this you get ruin the pump, make it run nosier because of wear, etc. I think it's a great fountain for an office or mood lighting in a bedroom. If you have expensive furniture, you may want to get something made out of slate or a better material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and NOT worth the money","review":"This is a cheap looking all plastic fountain. I should have read the other reviews before I bought it because it would have saved me the trouble of returning it. The hum of the pump is as loud as the wtaer noise which sort of defeats the \\"relaxing water sound.\\" Water does not flow through all of the holes all the time without a little help. Spend a little more and get something nicer, trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for...","review":"Probably should have bought something more 'significant' Fortunately since the cost was minimal, I wasn't out much money. I never used it...it made weird noises. After reading the instructions, which had a lot of material on the noise factor, I had my doubts it would be something that would sound relaxing. These doubts were confirmed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Like it","review":"I paid twenty dollars for this fountain, and I am happy with it. The only complaint I have is that the light is not bright enough. The light is rather dim, but I like the water fall effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"bought this for my wife as she loves the sound of rain. It didn't live up to that very well. she has had other HOmedics fountains in the past and loved them, but this one didn't work all that well and was constanly either running over or running out of water. Pump burned up in a short time too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful music","review":"A holiday gift. Heard this on the radio and just had to research through amazon and found it here for the best price on the internet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice approach, good ideas","review":"Nice approach for design. The structural methodology his really not easy but you don't need to control it to enjoy the book. I working on it! It's not so far away from intuituve approach and the texts help in that way. Covers really good circuits ideas and opens your mind for some new of your own. Great job, great reference book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth spending money on","review":"I'm a bit perplexed by the positive reviews here. A low budget is not a valid excuse to create junk, as many excellent low-budget movies have proved.One good thing about this movie is the big redneck-ish guy. Avoiding spoilers, let's just say he's the only well-developed character in the film and my opinion of him did a complete 180.There are pluses; some very convincing after-the-fact gore, some surprisingly well-written humor, the aformentioned well-done character, and there is one simply great moment when a survivor is snatched from a chair.Otherwise there's absolutely nothing here, even if the positive comments above seem like the makings of a good flick. The CGI is just utterly awful awful awful (repeat, rinse, repeat). Why bother if you're going to do it so badly? The alien creature design is pretty poor and they don't look strong enough to break a twig, let alone maul someone to the extent here.It has it's moments, but this is really just a throwaway."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Backward Glance","review":"Unfortunately, A Backward Glance was a disappointment. I love the way Edith Wharton writes, but in her autobiography she was dry. I only read only a quarter of the book and then put it down. It's hard to get through. I don't know if I can pick it up again. I would actually like to send it back, mainly because it was an expensive book; more than I usually pay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid software","review":"Once again I am disgusted with sony! I DON'T have windows, but I must if I am going to program this remote. Everything sony does is done just well enough to get it out to sell. If it doesn't work the way the consumer needs it to, well stupid you for buying it. As much as this remote would help with the 10 remotes that clutter my end table, I can't use it because sony doesn't have software for Mac users."},{"rating":"1","title":"how to spend your money on junk","review":"I find the remote almost totally useless for my modern tv setup, (even if all the other units are sony.

We were able to program only the basic (on/off and channel switching, etc.) and then needed to go back to the original remotes for everything else. If Sony doesn't make it easy to program SONY products, I can't imagine what it's like to try to program equipment from other manufacturers. It is actually easier to just use the original remotes - all 4 of them then to try to read the paled out screen of the universal and then to have to go back to the original remotes anyway to fine tune."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have to be an M.I.T. grad to program this thing!!","review":"My wife bought me the Sony commander for Christmas and, almost a month later, I still haven't got this thing figured out yet. I can't believe how complicated programming this remote is. The accompanying software isn't user friendly at all. X-press settings -- forget about it!! I owned the earlier version of this same remote which, unfortunately, fizzled out but it was much easier to program manually. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone and it's difficult to believe that this is an actual Sony product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total JUNK!","review":"Replacing an older RM-AV3000, I just got the RM-AX4000. Programming is not very intuitive. Finally got through it though. One of the steps is to press \\"learn\\", where one is directed to press (for example), the \\"play\\" button on a DVD remote. The normal operation is that one presses the button for a few seconds, and then \\"learning complete\\" appears. Sometimes, however, it takes ten or fifteen seconds, or (worse), one *immediately* receives a message that no signal has been received.After going through this half a dozen times, I called Sony and and spent 4.5 hours on hold. I finally found that if I darkened the room completely, things went better.Tonight, I noticed that if I select (for example) channel 2-4-0, I get channel 2-4-000, or if I select 2-3-1, I get 2-33-1. Just gave up!This thing is going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good product IF You have all Sony component","review":"I have all Sony product except an Onkyo receiver and Hd cable box.

I have been racing with them for eight years now and I absolutely refuse to wear any other goggles for practice or my meets. If you are going for serious competition goggles, these are it. However, they are not for everyone. They take some getting used to at first, and they are not for anyone who does not take this sport seriously. Once you are used to the goggles, it feels like they mold to your eye sockets. There is no padding, so they stick to your face very very well. And, most importantly, they never fall off on my starts."},{"rating":"2","title":"the BEST goggle ever!!!","review":"ive used these goggles for over 20 years now!!! when i was a teenager and they didnt have the internet (imagine that)... i would travel to a certain meet each year, even when i wasnt swimming, just to pick up a few pairs of these where i knew they were sold.i now use bungee straps because they are easier to loosen for practice, tighten for competition. but for those that arent able to tie the nosepiece string to the right length, HINT: tie it loose and then twist to shorten length before wearing. and as for the string cutting, remember the string should be inside the rubber nosepiece tube! i always pull the string knot inside the rubber tube as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"Maybe I just haven't gotten used to them but I feel that they were not worth the money. They are pretty uncomfortable as noted by some reviewers who gave it five stars, having to find ways to make it comfortable on the nose. I feel that comfort should be a big part of any type of accessories. Without the padding, they stuck to my face leaving unwanted marks and were uncomfortable during my whole swim. They can be and are a bit uncomfortable. If not assembled correctly leakage occurs and it is a pain to redo. Don't get to excited about these goggles, the lack of padding leaves them uncomfortable.Hopefully you found this review helpful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Not impressed with these goggles. With a piece of string to hold the eye pieces together, it cut my daugthers nose. Pass on this product and go with Speedo."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun suspense-thriller","review":"Unlike the other reviewer from San Francisco, I have to admit that I really enjoyed this book for the suspense novel it is. I've successfully handsold several copies to customers where I moonlight based on the synopsis of the protagonist showing up at work only to find that none of her coworkers claim to know her. What I enjoyed about it most was that half way through the book I was sure there could be no resolution to my satisfaction without involving the occult or some supernatural goofiness, but Klavan actually accounts for everything quite nicely and summed it all up to my satisfaction. It wasn't great literature but a fun summer read. Sometimes that's all you need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too disturbing","review":"I love Andrew Klavan, and this book is up to his usual dazzling standards of writing style. Not only that, but the construction is brilliant; I read a lot of thrillers, and yet I've never encountered anything quite like it. A real tour de force.Nevertheless, I'm afraid I can't recommend it, because it is so, so, so, so, SO disturbing. It has left me with images I wish I could scrub from my mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my Favorite Klavan...","review":"As a current fan of Klavan, I decided to take a look at some of his earlier works. Big mistake. This book is notable only for demonstrating how much the author has improved since writing this novel. I notice there are several good reviews here, so I recommend reading the first few chapters of the book before committing. I put this book down several times with no intention of finishing. I managed to finish the book by reading only the first sentence of every paragraph and felt I missed nothing. Lots of filler, it would have made a good half hour Twilight Zone episode."},{"rating":"1","title":"JeepersGollyGoshThatSmarts!","review":"I had to stop reading at page 11...

While reading this book; however, I became disgusted by the repeated references to sex, which didn't go with the book or were needed. If they did, then I'd be more understanding. The occurrences in this story were weak, as well as unbelievable, and I found myself falling asleep everytime I gave it another try. Yes, I finished the book, and I give it 2 stars only because the irony involved in the end fooled me and was very well executed. Other than that, uh...no."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste time with this.","review":"Unfortunately, I bought into the advertising and read this book. What a tremendous waste of time for the reader. The characters are not to be believed, the writing is stilted and the story is limp. I am surprised that this book ever made it to print. In some respects, this book gives hope to struggling writers who can probably get anything in to print."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much bad language","review":"Not only was it so confusing and not scary, reading bad words is not my kind of book.

We'd save it for the last leg of Highway 285 after leaving Poncha Pass. When Cottonwood and Crestone Peaks came into view, we knew we'd soon be at Villa Grove and the County Road GG turnoff.

He is certainly talking to the 'Everyman' where psychology may not be a prominant part in their lives, yet believes there are men and women out there looking to change internally. Explaining the Fisher King story from the Arthurian legends, Johnson demonstrates the stories ability of how man, or the masculine aspect of the psyche goes through transformation from a little boy holding on to mommy, to a man, and what it means to be a man, which is not in the traditional '50's 'man-of-the-house' type."},{"rating":"2","title":"a useful myth","review":"ive been interested in mythology since i was a kid but this is the first time, in my experience, that ive been able to apply the symbols of a myth to my own life. i think this is a great book for a man of any age. its been very useful to understand some of the masculine forces that are at work within and gives great explainations for why these forces urge us to make the decisions in life that we do. i think reading this book will help men so that they dont have to re-invent the wheel in there own life. not to mention that the grail myth is a great story in itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book to reread every year","review":"This book will let you change your life. Johnson has a way of opening you up to yourself, without telling you what to think."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least it's short","review":"This book doesn't speak to me at all. I agree with Robert A. Johnson that legends and myths, as well as great works of literature, correspond to the human condition--after all, that's what makes them resonate with generations of readers. However, I don't see the usefulness of picking one and elevating it to a grand statement and prescriptive account of the life journey of every man. His interpretation of the Parsifal myth lacks concrete examples from actual human experience. If you accept his premise, you might find great meaning here, but I didn't swallow it for a minute. As an atheist, I also found his emphasis on Christianity to be useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Track Spikes","review":"The only bad thing I have to say about these track spikes are the colors. You will look like a fairy. Aside from that, they're a great bang for your buck.To Sushil Premjani, spikes are meant for the track, not for any other surface (such as concrete, etc.). Also, all running spikes are meant to be extremely snug, so that it feels as if you don't even have shoes on.

I bought this DVD along with 2 ballet work out DVDs and I found this one really good to start with - it helped me to learn the basic technique which I could then apply to the work out DVDs.

However, as soon as I heard the CD I knew that Mack 10 made a great choice. Stand out tracks on this album are \\"Hate In Your Eyes\\", \\"No Dick\\", \\"B----, You Bad\\", \\"Connected\\", and \\"Thugs in the Club\\". Mack 10 sounds great spitting over Mannie Fresh beats. Dr. Dre also supplys the production for a track on the album. Aside from the usual Cash Money crew, XZIBIT, E-40, WC, Ice Cube, and Butch Cassidy all make appearances on this album.

I think this album makes it quite obvious that he needs Ice Cube as a mentor. There is one outstanding track on the album 'hate in yo eyes', I can't say i'm surprised he sees hate in peoples eyes if he subjects them to this kind of rap.Filled with fillers and guest appearances from utter nobodies (apart from Cube and WC on track 5) this album was a huge let down for me. I've enjoyed all of Mack 10's albums even the paper route, but this album has nothing to really get your teeth into and bounce along to like 'Foe Life' or 'From tha Streetz'. Cash Money have done Mack an injustice on this one and proves he didn't make the right choice in moving to the label last year.All in all I think this album will be a great disappointment to any Dedrick Rollinson fan out there, and I think it might lose any fans he has left, I know I'll be thinking twice about buying his next album if he ever brings another one out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CASH MONEY STILL FALLING INSTEAD OF BALLING","review":"YO THIS JOINT IS WACK.

Each subject has a storybook suggested to read and then there are tons of hands on activities offered to go along with the storybook. This book is along the same lines as Five in a Row. Terrific for lower elementary children."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Welles's best cinematic triumphs.","review":"I have yet to see such a dazzling display of cinematic genius in film that is better than \\"The Trial\\". The direction is beautiful. The plot is interesting but sometimes drags a bit. When I had purchased \\"The Trial\\" on video, I originally thought it was going to be a courtroom drama; but I was splendidly surprised when I saw what it really was. Anothony Perkins's performance in \\"The Trial\\" almost surpasses his ever-famous Norman Bates character. This film is a definite contender for \\"Citizen Kane\\" in my book, and just ahead of \\"Touch of Evil\\". The only problem with the film is the ending that sort of falls flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody Goofed!","review":"Somebody at the mastering plant was sleeping because the voice and picture are out of sync with one another, making this look like an English dub of a foreign movie. And yes I know Welles often post dubbed his films after shooting, but this DVD will have you thinking of SINGIN' IN THE RAIN instead of Kafka. Beware.(Laserlight Edition)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Purists beware...","review":"While an entertaining piece of cinema in and of itself, Orson's rendition of The Trial will leave a purist squirming for the duration of the film. Welle's takes many liberties with Kafka's novel. Some are decent, however in my opinion most were either too much or simply over the top."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorest of movies","review":"Admittedly, I'm no Einstein, (and am NO idiot) but this movie is truly an \\"enigma.\\" From the opening scene, to the finish, it's plot is dream-like. Anthony Perkins has never been a favorite of mine, but his lithe-like form appearing at random, and with no decernable plot, makes this a movie that you could easily leave it to do a house chore,....return to the continuing mysterious appearances of the scenes and the characters, who appear and then disappear without any obvious plot unfolding. One would know that with Orson Wells participation, that my description is fairly accurate. The mock trial is completely ridiculous, and past understanding, at least for me. IT'S A TERRIBLE MOVIE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Mind","review":"OK, I understand it's supposed to be some sort of very deep psychological and spiritual drama, and terribly intellectual and snob appeal. To me it is some combination of incomprehensible and offensive.Anthony Perkins plays Joseph K, who is the accused. Of what is he accused? Nobody says. There's almost nothing that makes sense, but the one theme that seems to come across is that women are constantly trying to seduce him, and their reasons for doing so are sinister.Orson Welles, who produced and directed the movie, plays The Advocate. If you have read and in any sense understood the book, you may appreciate the movie. Otherwise, forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty boring","review":"I first saw this movie long ago. I couldn't remember much about it, so I got it and watched it again. I must have walked out the first time, because while I remembered bits and pieces of the first part, the last part was like a new movie to me. I struggled to stay awake. My girlfriend went to bed. Film classic? Maybe, but I don't know why.Incidentally, it seems to me the late smash hit \\"Chicago\\" has the same essential plot line, except in \\"Chicago\\" the accused really did it, and \\"Chicago\\" is gloriously and necessarily pumped up with some fine song and dance."},{"rating":"2","title":"a powerful vision of Kafka's work","review":"I first saw this on a late night movie show on an obscure UHF station in the early eighties. I was very surprised to see anyone even tried to make a movie of this novel. It's amazing how effectively Welles adapts the very surreal masterpiece by Franz Kafka. Trying to present this in a standard, linear storyline is impossible so, instead, Welles does a superb job recreating the atmosphere of the novel with outstanding cinematography. The performances are excellent as well.The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is I don't know how comprehensible the storyline would be without reading the book. I read the book before seeing the movie so I'll never know the answer but it's something for a potential buyer to consider."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low rent DVD To be Avoided","review":"This movie is really fascinating if you're into Welles. But this DVD might as well be put out by a company called \\"Fly-by-Night Films.\\" The quality is junky with a jumpy picture, lousy image quality (It's all middle gray). The one in the orange case is also poor, but it's better than this one. It sells for around two bucks used for a good reason. Even if you just want this for the a low quality peep at this obscure movie, the other version is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two TRIAL DVDs are not the same quality!!","review":"There are two different DVD versions of Orson Welles' The Trial, both available on Amazon.

The title sounds like a mystery novel, or a horror novel, but it is neither. It is a collection of charming essays about the ins and outs of a small town cemetary. Who knew what the problems of running a cemetary could be? Who gets buried where? Are you sure that space is free? Who does the mowing; who takes care of the trees? What do you do about plastic flowers; and what is it like to be in charge of the final resting place of your friends and family. If you have ever wandered through a country cemetary looking at old names and dates and listening to the silence and the bird song, you will find this a delightful short read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming Chronicle of Shannon Applegates life","review":"This tells about life as a county cemetery sexton but so much more.

Shannon shares her own family losses I was especiallly touched by her relationship with her Dad.The tree trimmmers rang a bell, its what my husband does, very funnny. She shows such a soul searching , amusing .yet serious, thoughtful Philosophy on life and death."},{"rating":"2","title":"The kind of Trouble you want","review":"The first WS CD I heard was Lovehunter, probably around 1980 or thereabouts, and encouraged me to find more by the band. In my opinion, everything prior to the 1987 CD i.e. before Coverdale parted company with the 3 M's, demonstrates WS at their best and the Trouble album is probably my favourite. The title track is superb and they also do a really funky version of 'Day-Tripper' which for me is streets ahead of The Beatles own version. My recommendation is, if you've only heard the post- Marsden, Moody, Murray version of WS, then you really need to check this album out, not so much for the 'metal' guitars (because you won't find any!), but for the sheer quality of the song writing and the range of styles which the band showed it could do well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cards!","review":"Well, of course, I knew that Leanin' Tree cards would not disappoint, but you are smiling at the artwork before you even open the card with this adorable set.

I do think \\"They're only Chasing Safety\\" was better but this new album does come close, at first I was skeptical about the potential this album withheld but after listening to it thouroughly...I did like it! All the tracks are good and the production is amazing, the only thing that doesn't make this a 5 star CD for me is due to the sound of some of the singing and the way they went back to the older Underoath..I still think its better than the old Underoath but I'm not a huge fan of it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but not the greatest album","review":"I own this cd and I think the best song in the album is \\"In Regards To Myself Listen Listen\\", the first track, after that the other songs sound the same. Its harder than their past material, and I am not talking of \\"acts of depression\\" and \\"cries of the past\\" obviously. The pseudo break downs sound cool, but they get overdone, which make the songs sound very boring after awhile. I do not hate Underoath its just this CD, is really not as great as I imagined, and I think I am not the only one that thinks this about this cd. If you have ever heard of Norma Jean's most recent albums and Taking Back, this is how underoath sounds in this album. BAD!!! I just hope their next album, if there is going to be one, is way better than this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Suprise, Suprise","review":"Looks like someone in Underoath picked up an old Every Time I Die cd, because this album could easily have been written by ETID and nestled in between \\"Last Night in Time\\" and \\"Hot Damn!\\". Not one to break a pattern, Underoath continues to blatently copy other bands in similar genres and shapeshift themselves, passing off their plaguarism as a new product. If you turned this into your English teacher you would get a zero. Only Aaron's vocals and drumming redeem the band from being a complete failure, but in the add they lack any personallity and fail to innovate."},{"rating":"2","title":"best album you'll buy all year!","review":"this album is simply amazing and unique in sound. I'm a huge fan of underOATH's old stuff (act of depression, cries of the past,and even The Changing of Times) so when TOCS released it really through me off guard...i loved it, but it was different. This album brought back some of the old elements of music and singing that i was used to and it's GREAT!! I love how they've done the lyrics this time. Not so much centered on choruses but to get the point across as they did in the past. This cd is definetly a must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD","review":"This was an amazing CD. Each Song brought something to the table. if You were thinking about buying this CD or any of their other CD's.

If not, you won't.As far as those new to Underoath, its an edgier and artsier version of metalcore/hardcore/emocore in my opinion. Basically this album just grooves back and forth amongst hardcore, wild and desparate. A great sound in my opinion, and most importantly it doesn't disappoint the vast majority of their established fan base."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect gift","review":"This was a gift for my younger sister who is going away to college.

The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is due to the fact that he doesn't do enough on the British role -- which is more than substantial. Given the fact that British Imperialism was the King of the World -- and that the British used genocidal methods of population control, it just missed the boat a little bit. However, it is a good book despite this."},{"rating":"2","title":"War Against the Weak","review":"Exactly what I wanted on Eugenics in the US and Europe.Comprehensive and detailed.

That Hitler gained his ideas about ethnic cleansing from the American eugenics movement is not shocking to me, but no doubt would be to many people. This is a definitely a subject that needs to be publicized and discussed.The book itself was a bit ponderous, but the research was thorough and anyone who reads the books will be hard-pressed to disagree with the conclusions that Black draws."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting overview","review":"This book seems to be a fairly complete overview of the subject. Its one recurring flaw is that the text sometimes reads as if the author believes that he is the first to notice the connections between American (and European) Eugenics and the Nazis. I doubt if the author intended that, but that is still the impression sometimes left.This is a very readable book, and well-suited for undergraduate use."},{"rating":"1","title":"hum hum ? another guy who believes he knows how to sing ?","review":"Frankly, I thought at first that the people who reviewed this album had not listened to it, but I think I got it.6 people all giving 6 stars ?

A very strong feeling of already-heard ( early 90's ... ) but with no real character or creation.That is sad in a way because I think there's potential in Greg's voice and guitar.

Her Manon Lescaut is incredibly fascinating. Her first EMI-Recital triumphed, it has no equals! Two thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of Krautrock's Finest Moments","review":"This album, in retrospect, is probably the highlight of the Krautock movement. It exemplifies the aesthetic that electronic music could be beautiful without conventional signposts, while also showing that ugliness was the flip side of beauty. This is pure e-musik before the stain of money corrupted the movement. It takes the hardcore experimentation of Kluster and Cluster 1 and refines it, creating musical tone poems of great subtlety, depth and emotional power, all without conventional instruments, rhythm or melody.The only other release that competes for the title of the zenith of Krautrock might be Tangerine Dream's \\"Atem\\" -- but it's much more dependent on the aesthetic of contemporary classical, like Stockhausen and Webern. \\"Cluster II\\" is all the more startling because it is so totally original, trailblazing really.After 28 years it still sounds fresh -- but then, it's rarely been imitated and never been equalled, so why shouldn't it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely influential","review":"I got into the music of cluster through Julian Cope's book of course. However I was not expecting it at all to be like this. This is actually the kind of German rock that influenced everybody back in the 70's: Eno etc would follow these footsteps a few years later. This group really laid the foundations for ambient music in a way that I did not really expect. It is much different from the Kluster stuff that has not aged so well. However even if it is slightly pricey today it is worh the effort to look into."},{"rating":"2","title":"God Planted a tree","review":"Great Customer service, I received the book I requesed in great shape and in just a couple of days.Thank you"},{"rating":"2","title":"Halloween at its cutest","review":"Halloween is always fun when my family gets these cute trick or treaters to stuff full.

Seen in a braoder context, I could immediately relate to the hopes and aspirations of people in various corners of the third world as they seek to make a home in the West.Most interesting was to note how fragile human relationships are - majority of these 6 Cubans who finally make it to America find loving and living with people against all promises made to loved ones when departing. Since this documentary tracks the lives of these people across several years, it provides a rich historical context to measure the reality against the dreams that these immigrants had when departing for America.Thankfully, the movie stays away from any political overtones (as in Castro-bashing, or America/ CIA bashing)."},{"rating":"2","title":"history of my life","review":"as a rafter myself have to say this was a very good aproach to the time we spend goin out of cuba, in guantanamo bay and usa, dreams do come true."},{"rating":"2","title":"What disregards man","review":"\\"What disregards man does man good,\\" wrote Stafford in one of his better known and often anthologized poems, one about sightseers on the astonishing Oregon seacoast.I purchased this special edition of Northwest Review when it was new and required reading for Professor Glen Love's terrific course in Literature of the Pacific Northwest, at the University of Oregon.

Ms. Lindbergh has composed a series of memory-reflections (she consciously eschews hyphenations like that but I don't know how else to say it), connecting each to the next like a string of pearls. The prose is beautiful, the depth of detail always just right, the psychological observations and self-reflections are compelling, and though her book is more thematically focused, I would rank it with Arthur Miller's \\"Timebends\\" among brilliant autobiographical essays. A little-known gem of a book. And look at that cover photo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very poignant view of a complex and unique family","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Reeve Lindbergh has written about her parents, Charles and Anne Morrow Lindbergh, with empathy and love. I was very moved to read about the present problems with her mother, and about the shared experience she had with her mother when her own child died at the same age of her famous brother. I was also very moved to read about Charles Lindbergh as a loving father, and sad that he was also a bit of a tyrant with his wife and children. I remember reading another book about the Lindberghs where someone said of Charles Lindbergh; \\"You can't be a hero to the rest of the world and a mouse at home,\\" and I think that was a large part of what drove Reeve's father to be somewhat difficult as a parent. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Lindberghs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgic of family life","review":"What a tribute to Reeve and her siblings of the wonderful memoirs of parents, deep love and desire of normalcy for their children.

The terrible over-acting and absolutely ridiculous plot were so bad that I had to watch the whole thing because I haven't laughed that much in years. In fact, WHAT plot? WHAT acting? In fact, the two main characters were so bad (they played, um Tristan and Blair?) that I had to fast forward through their uncompelling love scene. Yikes.

It is horrifyingly shocking in some parts, sometimes heart-warming and never slow. The directing, writing and acting are a cut above movies in this genre (I think I've seen Brian White on TV a couple of times) and budget range.

Women are shown being verbally abused and basically made to look like complete doormats.

This way, you are also guaranteed of getting Henry Holiday's illustrations for 'The Hunting of the Snark', which are not in all 'Complete' collections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strongly recommend against buying this product","review":"This book stinks! I would not expect a book of this type to capture the intracacies of the various riffs and solos of the Dead's songs, but the basic melodies in most instances aren't even close.Most of the tablatures do nothing more than follow the lyrics. This is supposed to be a guide to playing the guitar notes and chords, not for singing along. Occasionally, as if by accident, the chords are correct. But listen to either the studio or live recordings of the selected songs, and the tabs provided don't even come close.There is no indication the Dead approved of or sanctioned this publication. It was simply issued by Warner Brothers with no background information at all.

Although there are some exceptions, these is a great collection of arias that Franco sang incredibly well. His is a voice that has a strong, baritonish middle and a high voice that cuts through the air as a blade. Highly reccomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voice of the century","review":"This is an amazing CD, full of thrilling singing. Corelli is my favorite ever singer (I am a young soprano). Apart from the sheer beauty of the sound, and the power throughout the range, AND the near perfect technique, you feel that he means every single word he is singing. I find this especially moving in the more verismo roles. The full recording with Stella of Andrea Chenier (from which the three arias on this CD were taken) is also really recommended. This CD contains not only all the Chenier arias, but the famous renditions of Di Quella Pira with the UNBELIEVABLE top C, and the very sexy (and incredibly difficult) diminuendo at the end of Celeste Aida. This CD is an ideal introduction to his voice. Once you have listened to this, you will be back for more! He makes all other tenors sound slightly lacking in testosterone. If you read these reviews from Milano, Franco - You are simply the greatest!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FRANCO CORELLI AT HIS BEST!","review":"This compilation of moments from various complete opera studio recordings gives a very good idea about the legendary tenor Franco Corelli. Unfortunately most of the complete sets have one or two singers who are not ideal, therefore only a few opera recordings with Corelli can be recommended as first-choice recordings. EMI here has put together most of Corelli's best moments! He is heard in his glorious prime! Endless breath, electrifying high notes and power, power, power characterise his singing. My only objection is that his stentorian voice can sometimes become tiring. If only, however, we had such a tenor today! Of all the roles here, his Pollione and Manrico impressed me the most but everything else is also amazing. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"franco corelli the best","review":"i am proud and happy to own any dvd or cd of the great franco corelli . in this cd he sings some famous arias so well that i dont want to hear any other tenor again . i have been a fan of mr corelli for many years . he is the best tenor of the 20th century . no one comes close to him not even mario delmonaco . it is sad today the state opera is in . these so called tenors are just awful . this is my opinion . god bless you dear prince of tenors you set the standards so high no one can come close ."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's back!

Stunning album!","review":"I'm a HUGE Ryan Adams fan and have waited until now (Sept 2010) to listen to this album...like many other fans, the year he came out with all three albums was quite impressive and a bit of overwhelming...esp if wanted to absorb and appreciate the genius behind Adams' songs. So, rather than forcing myself to listen to \\"29\\" when first came out I figured I'd wait until I was feeling deprived of new Ryan Adams material and voila!.This album is incredible esp seeing it was riding on the heels of Cold Roses and Jacksonville City Nights....It's the type of album that is already one of the top albums, in my opinion. Such variety and various layers in each song.Gotta love it.Gotta listen to it...over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of his worst","review":"I have been a fan of Ryan Adams since his Whiskeytown days, and, while I don't think any of his solo work has topped Pneumonia, I've enjoyed almost everything he's released. He puts out so much great material that I forgave him for his occassional lapses in self-indulgence (i.e. \\"Enemy Fire\\" on Gold) and gave him a mulligan for Rock 'N Roll because I figured his record company put him up to it. But it's hard to forgive Ryan for 29. I guess it's largely a question of taste since a number of reviewers gave him 4s and 5s and some even went so far as to call this his strongest CD, but I just don't see how 29 stacks up to his other work (Rock N Roll excluded). For me, there are only two decent tracks - Elizabeth... and Nightbirds. Two of the songs - Voices and The Sadness - are so bad that they made me cringe, 29 starts strong but ends terribly, and the other tracks just plod and meander along. In short, I would not recommend this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"A self indulgent man","review":"Each of Adams CDs is different and his fans give him such high marks for that.

Mission in Life is as good as everyone says it is, in fact it is perfect. This album demands you listen to it, and the songs and characters stay with you long after the music has stopped.

It has to be sent back to the manufacturer for any repairs. The warranty only covers the watch itself - not the band or clasp.Ultimately, after wearing it perhaps 20 different times, the band busted right where it attaches to the watch face.I called Skagen, and since the band isn't covered by warranty, I could ship it to them and pay approx $35 to have it fixed.I'm pretty bummed.

In that regard, this book was a disappointment, and I won't be buying the rest of the series.To be fair, the books are lavishly illustrated with drawings and black and white photos.

During our trip he crouched lower and lower towards the speaker, almost falling out of the seat. \\"What the eff is the drummer doing?\\" The song was Prophecy, which has a wild intro and one of the best endings of any thrash song ever, just a maniac unpredictable pounding section which seems to be changing all the time.

For the next 10 minutes my kids kept asking what happened to the mom. It was very disturbing!! I couldn't believe they did that. It took me about 10 minutes to pick my jaw up from off the floor and then I shut the movie off and suggested we watch something less violent. In this day and age can we try and preserve the innocence of children. I will never be watching any of the Babar movies again, I was so disturbed by this film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"atrocious","review":"This book is a shameful rip-off. It's a breathless sales job on VSS with no in-depth information about how to use it. It is extremely superficial, and unconsciounably badly-researched. There are blatant inaccuracies that should never have gotten by if the book had been reviewed by a moderately technical person. (One example from page 63: \\"Use Regular Expressions doesn't alow the String field to contain wild cards, and forces Visual SourceSafe to treat them as literal characters.\\" ??!! Any first-year programming student knows that regular expressions are the opposite of literal characters, they are a rich \\"wildcard\\" language that operate exactly opposite to the way the authors describe.)If you're the least bit technical, stay away from this awful book, it won't make you smarter, only angry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat Useful","review":"If you have a job in configuration management and start looking for books on SourceSafe you will find this is the only one. The book has some useful information but it becomes obvious that the publisher does not employ technical editors. There are several aside story sections in this book that could have been handled to help the user learn more but instead came across as the writers frustration with project management or cynical humor. Had any editor looked at these asides they surely would have edited them or removed them entirely. The publisher QUE used to be a producer of semi good technical books but WROX has passed them by in a big way. Hopefully Wrox will look at this product as viable to produce a book on but until then this is all there is."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOMEONE PLEASE WRITE A BOOK ON VSS","review":"I truly wish that someone would write a book on how to successfully implement version and file control with Visual SourceSafe.

This book is not helpful at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Entertained","review":"What a marvelous mix of entertainment and information on an issue I knew nothing about! Sutherland's journalistic approach takes amazing and colorful twists and turns as it lays out the inner-workings of the cookoff circuit where the players range from highly entertaining to overly competitive and crabby. I found myself dying to meet the queen of the cookoff, Diane Sparrow and wanting to cry over Cindy Shmuelling's bittersweet story. If you are interested in what makes people tick, this book is for you. As with all books worth their salt, I relished each new chapter and felt sad when it was over!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Distant Second","review":"I enjoy watching cooking contests on the Food Network, so I was eager to read this book. Unfortunately, the book does not capture the excitement of seeing the cooks in living color or touch your heart when they talk about their lives in their own words. You can't see the frustration on their faces when the cookies crumble or their radiant joy when they win. Reading that somebody smiled or the tears flowed just isn't the same. Most of all, you can't see the FOOD. Many of these cookoffs have been shown on the Food Network or Public Television, and the experience of reading about them is a distant second."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but the bad editing is distracting!","review":"Cookoff is pretty interesting, but did anyone proofread it? If you're at all aware of correct grammar, spelling, or usage, this book will drive you nuts. So far (I'm about halfway through) I've found proper names spelled two different ways in the same paragraph, common words that are misspelled, and turns of phrase that are just wrong (for example, someone is described as \\"flaunting\\" a convention).If you're not someone who notices these things, it's a good read. If you are, it'll set your teeth on edge. Maybe someone will bother to run the spell-checker on it for the paperback edition..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tasty!","review":"I love to cook, love to talk about cooking, love to read about cooking. I thought \\"Kitchen Confidential\\" was a hoot....but \\"Cookoff\\" is even better. \\"Cookoff\\" is equal parts cultural history, thriller, and comic inspiration. It took me into a world I know nothing about, but about which I had quite negative opinions. But the author introduced me to a broad assortment of imaginative folks, each with a good story, and some even with a recipe I might like to try myself. Sutherland explores interesting ideas about Americans and food, the underlying craving for recognition, sport, and money--she does this with a lot of heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a turkey","review":"I can't believe I read the whole thing. Are there two different versions of Cookoff? I don't see how anyone could call the author \\"sly\\". \\"Condescending\\" seems more accurate. Humorous? That's a laugh. I found boring stories about ordinary people using inferior processed food products brought to market by overly sensitive sponsors to create recipes that \\"reinforce the most slovenly American food habits-assembling instead of cooking\\".

If you know and like Tim's songs from the \\"middle period\\" Jayhawks (like Tampa to Tulsa) or enjoyed his singing on covers from live recordings or the current tour (such as Drivin' Wheel), you'll like this record. If you don't know Tim's style, or you aren't sure how you feel, you can sample a number of the tracks from this record online in various places (here, or his MySpace page for example). If you like the samples, you'll like this record. My only regret is that I didn't find it sooner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very strong debut","review":"I've been a fan of the Jayhawks for a long time and was saddened by the news that they were breaking up. As I read elsewhere, what the drummer was going to do was not the first thing on my mind; however, this CD came as a surprise because it has so many great songs. My favorite is \\"River Bends,\\" and it, not surprisingly, sounds the most like the Jayhawks. O'Reagan gets assists from almost everyone who's been a member of the Jayhawks in the past 10 years, but he doesn't need it. The songs and his inviting voice are what will make listeners come back to the CD. Whether you're a fan of the Jayhawks or of adult pop music, this is a very good disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Test of time","review":"I bought this a few years back, and immediately liked the album's easy grace and charm. Tim O'Reagan certainly has a way with a melody and his understated style lets the songs speak for themselves. What I didn't know when I bought the album was that it would become a constant companion for years to come. It picks me up when I'm glum, gives me something to rest with when I'm tired, adds to my joy when I'm happy. It sounds good in the car on the way to work, and fits nicely into an evening of cold beers and close friends. The album itself feels something like a friend, it's music that understands (I can't think of a better way to put it). Tim O'Reagan is a gifted artist and I can't wait for his next release whenever that may be (sure hope it's soon though!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, ethereal and atmospheric.","review":"Excellent orchestra and chorus and the voices perfectly suited to their roles.Excellent sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"kudos to the creatures","review":"the creatures offer sn eclectic sound snd instrumentation with thought provoking lyrics and Siouxie Sioux's distintive banshee wail.

This is a worthy addition to anybodys cd collection, especially those who are fan of the euphoria series.

For instance, while I write this review I am listening to Vol 4 \\"Pure\\" by Matt Darey. CD 2 is great, CD 1 is utterly amazing! Compared to this Dave Pearce cd, well, I can't compare the two, mere words cannot describe the difference. The strange thing is that they let Dave Pearce do 3 cd's.

It is about the extremely-poor formatting, which makes the book impossible to read. Some lines have words scrunched together and, since some of the book is in Spanish and Zapotec, it is hard to figure out. Some lines have only one word. Some letters are even backward! Since so much of the book is in other languages, the reader is reliant on the footnotes but, as they are at the back of the chapter, one has to spend a lot of time finding them. This is much more annoying in a Kindle than in a conventional book.

Then disaster strikes in the form of the Great San Francisco earthquake, and neither Grace nor Nate's life will ever be the same. Denise A. Agnew builds a triumph out of the tragedy of the 1906 earthquake. She fashions a hero from an ordinary man, a heroine worth fighting for, and a love which can survive anything.

Since it does not use a fan, the little heat that is generated remains slightly above and in front of the unit. Maybe I have a bad unit? Probably not, because I ordered 2 of them, and they both heat the same.

They kick on at preset times to take the chill off the room and then cut out about 2 AM.My 10X13 poorly insulated bedroom, which is the far corner of the home and miles away from the woodburner is the coldest room of the home.I had one of the oil-filled units set up there and replaced it with this one. I used it three nights and woke up at 1AM each night and turned off the unit because it made my room too stuffy.On a gut level, I'd say that it produces 2X the heat that the same wattage oil-filled does.

Therefore, it has a lifetime expentancy of exactly one year, if it is used sparingly: Some stupid thing will stop working, in this case, the only moving part, which is the \\"on\\" switch. (On my previous heater, it was also the on switch, which was NOT a moving part).I bought this item to save money and energy: I can heat up one room in my house while the rest stays fairly cool. But if every year (and it has been every year) one has to replace these heaters, and send to the landfill an otherwise perfectly good but unfixable appliance (and they are unfixable, I checked), we're not saving any planet here. Also, I'm certain that I did not save enough energy using this heater to justify its cost before it died.Stay away from any items with an \\"on\\" switch made in China, is my advice (which might mean we have to go back to wood fire heaters). Otherwise, just buy a $25 heater and expect to throw it away at the end of the season."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked good for the 2 months I used it last year, now it don't work.","review":"I bought this in January and it worked good for the two months we used it.

I kept the original box and put it back in it when we werent using it.

All three of them I've seen used died after a year. The thermostat part would still work but the heater wouldn't engage. They're sealed in a way conventional tools won't open so we couldn't fix it.

It takes a some time before you feel the heat, so it isn't instant, but it does take the chill off the room and make us comfortable.My daughter broke her leg and is now living in the family room since she can't climb steps yet, so we leave it going all the time and it keeps the room extra warm for her, if we leave the door closed.

Unfortunately, she doesn't. You find that the person who you think is the heroine, gets less than 10% of the story in the last 50 pages. I think what bothered me the most is that Ms Madden makes the rules of her \\"world\\" but then doesn't follow them....Danielle should not have been able to leave Kiernan, but does, Tane should not have been able to make Alice his life mate without the \\"hunger\\" but he does simply by feeling rage....only a few examples of many.My advice to Ms Madden and her editors -- rework the last half of this book.

Not bad for one of those lesser known '80's hair bands. Have always liked what I did manage to hear from these guys. Sorry to say that I have the original CD reissue, not the later pressing with the six added bonus cuts. Regardless, Hanoi freaking R-O-C-K-S! Tunes I got the most out of were the rocking \\"Tragedy\\", \\"Village Girl\\", \\"Lost In The City\\" {I'm almost sure I've seen a video for this song somewhere}, \\"First Timer\\" and \\"11th Street Kidzz\\".

Bangkok Shocks Saigon Shakes Hanoi Rocks is still a very very good debut album with Tragedy, Lost In The City and Cheyenne as highlights. Lyrically they aren't superior but Mike Monroe's vocals and powerful guitar playing by Andy McCoy are enough to create good feeling which is most important. This album has that glam/hard rock sound of the early 80's from which many bands such as Guns n' Roses was to take their inspirations. Again if compared to Hanoi Rocks' next album Oriental Beat this suffers from lack of truly big hits. Bangkok songs are constantly good but the best remains to be heard in next album(s)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hanoi's First","review":"For a first album this sure kicks. How impressive. From the first til now they are still kickin'. This album has such songs as \\"Tragedy\\" & \\"Walking With My Angel\\", wonderfully done. Their first effort is well worth a listen. They just kept getting better with each record. In my opinion they are the best band ever. For a bunch of 19 year old boys this is a killer record."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Civil Wars Greatest Generals","review":"B.H Lidell Hart has written a wonderful biography on William Tecumseh Sherman. Hart believed Sherman was the most relevant general of the Civil War and backed up his theory of the indirect approach with Sherman's campaigns. Sherman would maneuver the Confederates out of strong defensive positions and attack the enemies base of supplies, a perfect example of the indirect approach. B.H. Lidell Hart again proves why he is the Clausewitz of the 20th century and why Sherman is the greatest Union commander of the Civil War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Illuminating","review":"Although I have not studied the American Civil War extensively I have always wanted to know more of General Sherman. In the popular mind Sherman has the repute of being nothing more than the guy who rampaged through the South burning everything in his path. The facts are quite at odds with that perception. Not only did Sherman have a deep appreciation of Southern culture, he was also a grand strategist who possessed the ability to see the ramifications of his, and the Union's actions. The person who is presented here is one of deep thought, a classical education and deeply engrained values, who harbored no illusions as to the horrors of war. Since this book was written while there were still living veterans of the war, you are also presented with history that has much more immediacy to it. All in all it is well worth the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"not up to Liddel Hart's usual level","review":"I will start by saying Liddel Hart is my favorite military historian/author and I own half a dozen books by him, and regard them as gospel. However I felt that Liddel Hart was not as well versed in this area as he is in European History. He lets his ingrained contrariness run away with him. He wants to create a \\"great captain\\" where there is none. He also, I believe, wants to convince the reader of the genius of the \\"inderect approach\\" which he expounds in his excellent book \\"Strategy\\". However I think considering Sherman's campaign as indirect is like calling D-Day indirect because the allies invaded Normandy as opposed to Calais. ( I must admit that I am biased because I am a Lee fan) Like every other book by Liddel hart though, it is a very quick and pleasant read. I would recommend his book on Scipio as a great intro to his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tasty Tales & Spicy Stories","review":"Talk about long awaited!

Lady, Tramp, Jock, and Trusty were spotlight characters in the original. I was also confused. If Scamp is supposed to be a puppy why does he sound so much like Scott Wolf (HAHAHAHAHA!)

The new voice doesn't sound like Lady AT ALL! The voices for 2 of Scamp's sisters are horrible as well, only one of the 3 sisters has a proper voice.

There are definitely some great scenes in this movie and the underlying question of whether Scamp finally learns what it means to be a part of a family remains a secret until the end which kept my family guessing until the end. For me Scamp was my favorite character as he was fun loving and free, but also missing something in his life, which I believe we all are in some ways. With that in mind the writers do a great job to draw you into the movie making you want to find out what happens next.

There have been only two that I can recommend. The others are just marginally acceptable. LADY AND THE TRAMP II - SCAMP'S ADVENTURE is just unremarkable and in fact leaves the viewer wondering if Walt Disney, if he were still alive, would have permitted the lack of fair play and unforgiving nature of the Scamp character. This movie almost gives the viewer a message that good guys finish last. I did not have any high expectations before I saw this movie but to see a sense of fair play being slowly chipped away by the studio that was the icon of fair play left me empty. You have to remember that this DVD is aimed at our youngest viewers who are capable of comprehending its story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but not comparable to the original.","review":"My son has seen this once and has not shown interest in watching it again.

The soundtrack and songs were likely put together overnight by aging vaudeville composers and an \\"I wanna be me\\" adolescent girl. The music is absolutely laughable! The movie has no entertainment value to young children and would likely bore the heck out of the rebellious teens it strives to identify with.An embarrassment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute","review":"I like the original much better, but this is okay for a sequel. It's a little weird that Lady wasn't in the movie that much, and that Tramp's character was a little overbearing, but for the most part it's decent. The songs aren't that similar to the original, but I personally like them. Scamp and Angel are a really cute couple and I love both of their characters. The love part of the story is in my opinion the best part. However, the dog-catcher was a disappointment. He was just goofy and stupid and not a great antagonist. But most of the characters were good. The plot is simple and predictable.

A lot of the original characters return for this story along with the usual assortment of new characters, all with typically pre-programmed Disney personalities. At several points in the proceedings, the characters burst into song, none of which stand out in any way. And, of course, there are the obligatory \\"lessons\\" which are slopped through the story like a heavy dose of molasses. The overall result is an incredibly twee offering (even for Disney), which will probably bore anyone aged any older than five. On the positive side, the animation is really quite good, especially for a video release (bearing in mind that these have much smaller budgets than the Disney theatrical releases). Buy it for the littlies (they'll love it), but don't expect something that will also work well on a more mature level,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Severe inconsistancies with the original with a crappy plot to boot","review":"LATT 2 is about (you guessed it) Tramp's son Scamp, which is actually the good thing about this movie. Like other disney DTVs, LATT 2 sends an overly preachy message to kids about \\"fitting in\\", of course. But the inconsistancies with the original LATT are shocking. For example, Scamp is 6 months old in the sequel and is portrayed as the size of a 3 month old puppy. In the original film, Lady was an adult dog at 6 months old. What's with that, people??? Dogs have puppies at 5-6 months old. Read a book and study for once, disney!As for the plot, it's just a recreation of the original LATT's. This time Scamp digs out of the fence and meets a girl stray named Angel, and ends up bringing her home after a VERY familiar speggetti scene. The songs were horribly sappy and modern pop. The entire thing was crap. What more is there to say? 1 star at most for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I really like the original Lady and the Tramp, and this is a sad attempt to cash in on the fans of that movie.I'd suggest renting it first to see if you like it before investing.

Installation was a snap and all tested well... low beams and high. When I next had the opportunity to drive in darkness, I turned on the headlights and the driver side unit failed instantly. I got to work and checked that I indeed had no low or high beam on drivers side and when I turned headlights off... the passenger side bulb exploded and now I have debris in the housing. Needless to say, I am not at all impressed and more than a little annoyed. I certainly expected better of German manufacture. These bulbs are EXTREMELY HOT burning, so don't use them in a housing with a plastic lens or it will probably melt the lens. I will never buy this brand of bulb again.

On the contrary you should not purchase this book looking for a formula to understand the Constitution! Rather this book promotes one's thoughts and helps the reader develop an approach in which they ought and ought not read the Constitution. Interestingly enough, for Tribe to claim that he knows the manner in which we ought not read the Constitution presupposes that he knows how we ought to.

Another problem I that since I'm only beginning to research this topic, I'm also not fully into my vegan diet and certainly don't know enough about fasting to actually do one yet. I assumed the book would be about cleanses, or at least discuss the ins and outs of fasting. All-in-all, not a good book for beginners.

It's a well-played album of works that the composer wrote mostly a couple of decades ago. The most notable work is his horn concerto (he is a horn player). That is worth the price of the CD, but the other works are worthy and welcome. the \\"Four Two-Bit Contraptions\\" were written in the sixties and show the composer's humor (he is a fine cartoonist, too).It's a great retrospective of his works, but he is much maligned on CD and more are needed to truly show his talents.

I'm sure other reviewers have covered it song by song, etc. I'm just looking forward to jumping to nearly every song on the CD except maybe 'The Road To Hell Part I', which is the setup for Part II, which kicks ass, and I don't care for 'Tell Me There's A Heaven' - I know it's meaningful, but way too sentimental and syrupy for my taste - if you've heard any Harry Chapin songs aside from \\"Cat's in the Cradle\\" then you have the idea.

The small book still manages to be stuffed with filling, but of the wrong kind: intricate and tedious academic harmonic analyses and self-proclaimed 'controversial' findings with regard to the various editions of the symphony. Thus, despite its short length, the book overstays its welcome by failing to balance its technical minutiae with any larger musical issues such as where the symphony could proceed after Wagner or the sublime solution of Bruckner. All-in-all, it resembles an unfocussed and undigested doctoral thesis (which doubtless was its unfortunate genesis).

I upgraded to 2006 thinking I'd get a bunch of new features, and I'd be able to use it on my mac laptop instead of just my desktop PC.What a turd. This program was't ready for prime time, it isn't easy to use, it has a bunch of horrible user interface 'features', it was patently written without the involvement of an accountant, and there are tons of user restrictions that just don't make sense.The payroll service is probably the worst. I've been unable to get the payroll transactions from the online service into quickbooks for the past week because they're having some software bug issues that they can't identify.If I can find something else that isn't too expensive and that lets me input transactions easily enough, I'm switching tomorrow. Quickbooks is useless. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quickbooks does not register any old or pre-owned versions of their product","review":"Sad that such a user friendly program is blackballed from potential clients. This was the second QB I purchased for my 07 Mac and neither was a usable product. Shame on QB. They cannot even offer an older version to be purchased for perfectly running older computers. The product is awesome, they just have a capitalistic business philosophy.

Plus the banking doesn't work with Wells Fargo so that leave the 10 million of us banking with Wells fargo in the dark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it's supposed to be","review":"The QuickBooks for Mac version is a watered down version of the Windows version. It's little better than using an Excel spreadsheet. Also, despite claims by Intuit that it's compatible with the Windows version, it's not. Any feature in QB Windows database that is not in the Mac version needs to be stripped out before a company's file can be transferred. Along with the truly awful Intuit technical support, this version is just a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"It wont run off a file share!

The PC version is so much better and although Intuit claims they care about the Mac consumer, clearly this is not the case, think twice about purchasing this version.Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally on DVD","review":"Kill me again has never been released in digital formant in US. There is a Japanese Ld long time ago but very hard to get nowadays. So this MGM dvd release is a very good news. This movie is very under rated and didn't get wide release but remains a video favorite. The story has been done before and has been copied all over again on various B movie. About a seductive young woman who used a private detective to fake her death to get away with money she stole from her abusive boyfriend. The DVD is in full screen only and no 5.1 Dolby Digital but for this type of low budget movie probably we don't miss much as the Dolby 2.0 surround is quite good with occasional thunder can be heard from your rear speakers. I would have given it 5 stars if MGM give an English subtitle option (an option that has no longer available for all current MGM DVD releases, what a shame). Get this rare gem, you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect neo-noir from John Dahl","review":"The Bottom Line:Before he made the critically-acclaimed Red Rock West and The Last Seduction John Dahl made Kill Me Again, a fun little mystery with femme fatales, private investigators, and perfect genre performances by Val Kilmer and Joanne Whalley; if you like neo-noir, this is a perfect film to rent for an evening's entertainment.3/4"},{"rating":"2","title":"'80s Noir For Audience Which Likes A Mean Edge","review":"Hard-edged characters - male and female, including a sadistic killer - make this a tough film. Maybe I'm just mellowing and these type of low-lifes just don't appeal to me anymore, at least when comprise two- thirds of the main characters. Yet, it was an interesting film, worth seeing once.Yup, if you like nasty characters with a big mean streak in them, ones that have no ethics whatsoever and are proud of it, then'll you like this modern-day film noir very much. Val Kilmer, Joanne Whalley-Kilmer and Michael Madsen are not three people you want as friends, particularly the last two.The story has a few twists - big twists - near the end, and I have to give this film four stars for one thing alone: it flat-out entertains you for the full 95 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flattered Again","review":"John Dahl's done well to return to film noir at the tail of the excessive 80's. This is also one of Jo Ann Whalley's finest offerings, sexy and dangerous with killer eyes. Val Kilmer plays into her wiles with certain wariness. Between the desert landscape and Michael Madsen on the chase, your options are limited. At the outset danger lurks;like a million noir openings the dangerous woman shows up. From then on, there is much suspense and betrayals.The surprise ending continues to linger long after the penetrating dark eyes of Whalley burn. Scary, unpredictable turns and twists, and then escape? This is no recycling of 40's potboilers alone. These are desperate contemporary characters finely painted in noir paint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unsung Film Noir Classic","review":"It is a shame, in my opinion, that this movie never got enough attention when it was released. I consider it a fine example of film noir and possibly the best film noir movie to appear in the nineties. If you like well paced detective movies you will love this film. Joane Whalley-Kilmer plays one of the best evil women I have seen in some time. You gotta love to hate her in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"What kind of a freak...","review":"Any Joker story must undergo two tests: Is the Joker funny? And is he deadly?

This guide didn't help me at all. The extra information you buy guides for just wasn't there and I honestly could have just used my Ruby and Sapphire guide and it would have helped me MORE.

In this book we learn that her parents were horribly murdered and she was almost killed as well when she was a little girl. Raised by her Uncle Bobby, she is a little rough around the edges but still quite beautiful. Upon her release, she bumps into her old friend Felon, whom she always had a secret crush on.

It can't compare to The Zahir, Veronika Decides to Die, Eleven Minutes or The Fifth Mountain. But I still read most everything Paolo writes out of fascination with this author's oeuvre. I no longer view his spiritual philosophy as enlightening, and can see its flaws and peculiarities, but I read him because few writers integrate spirituality with story in the way he does, and I am always fascinated with how he weaves a tale. I read this book more to understand the man than because I was enjoying or getting much out of the story.

The only link that he depends upon is the Valkyries: a group of women that roam the desert on motorcycles and who may just have the answer to what Paulo is after. There are many surprises to unravel in the novel, and some passages will keep you thinking for a long time. The novel also expresses inner feelings and thoughts of the author and his central characters, including his wife. The personal accounts are strong and there are times when the suspense is hard to stand on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Valkyries","review":"The book was not properly cut: many of the pages were still stuck together.

He apparently said everything he had to say in the Alchemist. Rambling and self-absorbed, this tale of meeting a nomadic tribe of women on bikes failed to squeeze out even an ounce of anticipation or dramatic tension. It was like he thought just placing a few strange characters in this story was enough to create a plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Alchemist was good. Maybe Coelho's a one hit wonder?","review":"Every page I read, I found myself shaking my head. Raising my eyebrows, tryingto speed read, hoping there woudl be some redeeming quality to this book. There was none. I was actually frustrated that I had wasted my time on this. He is no Salman Rushdie- but you might say that is because the book is in translation. Well that would be incorrect Milan Kundera's books are a case in point. So then I found myself trying to justify the lack of engaging narrative or believable characters in this quite frankly rather boring book by saying his style is different and very simple. Like in The Alchemist. But in that book- even though it had ideas that refer to certain esoteric philosophies- they were stated in simple terms and in a highly engaging narrative. I have no clue what Coelho was doign in this book. But thing i felt throughout this book was disbelief that he could write something like this. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT read!","review":"This just may be my favorite book ever, and I read A LOT. I have read this book several times, and have given away at least 5 copies. I sold it from the shelves of my 'Angel Store' and my customers loved it too. Coelho writes with such a presence. He weaves the spritual story as the reader rides on the back of the words of the story. After writing this review, I think I will go and read it again. I think I just may be a Valkyrie. How about you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Cliche","review":"After enjoying The Alchemist, I was extremely disappointed to read such a poor book.

Not one single incident is to be believed and instead of penetrating is funny. He either overdosed on drugs or alcohol or was hallucinating. I couldn't stop laughing at what I know was meant to be a very serious book. If Coelho believes this actually happened to him, he's in bad shape and can't be taken seriously. The promising author of Veronica Decides to Die is quickly deteriorating. How sad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Has gems...would make more sense on acid","review":"There are some great insights into the human condition, much like in The Alchemist, but this story is bizarre to the point where its bizarreness detracts from the message being conveyed.In The Alchemist the storyline served as a vehicle to convey deeper human truths, and these truths were the point of the book. In The Valkyries, the storyline itself seemed like the point. It seemed like Coelho wanted the world to know the weird magic/drugs/psychedelic jaunts he's been on; it's 187 pages ripped out of his personal journal with no real point. The deeper human truths felt like a literary afterthought.If you haven't read The Alchemist, read that first. This book would have spoiled me on the author. I'd give it a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting after reading the Alchemist","review":"I wouldn't suggest this book, but it could be just where I am at on my path in life. I did not find it particularly interesting or inspiring. I kept reading though hoping it was going to get better.One interesting part to me though from the perspective that it was based on events from his actual life supposedly, kind of scary actually, he was into..I will call it the \\"dark side\\" of things before coming over to the \\"other side\\" and it tells about his experience and how it led to his path to the good side. Otherwise I did not get much from the book.Oh the most positive thing I took from the book which I never thought about before is when you look up and towards the horizon it changes your view of everything vs looking slightly down or straight ahead......I guess that applies literally and figuratively also as in positive uplifting thoughts vs negative thoughts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Coelho's finest","review":"This novel is so different from the Alchemist or the Pilgrimage.

It does not have all the buttons and do-dads that some mouses have, but I rarely use those so I don't miss them.

When the thing works, it's really good. It's got a nice size and weight that feels good in an average sized hand. The sensitivity and accuracy of the mouse pointer seem spot on.HOWEVER, the mouse frequently loses contact with the transmitter, which is ridiculous since they're barely 15\\" apart. I'm right handed and have the transmitter plugged in to the left side of my keyboard so it's never in the way. When the connection drops the mouse starts to lag and stutter, the buttons stop working, and the only fix is to unplug and replug the transmitter. This is a problem as the connection issue surfaces a couple times in a work day. I've tried plugging the transmitter into other USB outlets on the keyboard and iMac but it's always the same thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"logitech mouse","review":"I like the mouse so far.

It stores the USB adapter the way I wanted it to, and seems a little more solid than the others.

I wish there was a larger version of this mouse, not the receiver part, just the mouse part because it would fit my hand better but this mouse is still great.

This book is best read on the toilet because it will LITERALLY SCARE THE SHIT OUT OF YOU. Jason is a grade A murderer with no remorse for his victims. Uber Jason however is a ruthless slaughtering machine who destroys every single thing that could possibly give anyone pleasure.

My kids and I really enjoyed this book and even read ahead. Jesus doesn't make a cameo appearance but is discussed a lot. The main character is a young boy with a Jewish mother (deceased) but raised mainly Greek by his father during the Roman occupation. The boy's merchant father dies and the adventure is about he and his brothers trying to survive. The boy and his one brother look Greek but the 2nd brother favors their mother, an interesting way to weave the political conflicts. The boys show real grit and ingenuity with a little help from friends. There are wonderful lessons about humility, patience and perseverance. It's a great read for any young boy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Semi-Trailer on inter-steller highway with a bit if time-travel paradox thrown in","review":"Book 1 of 3 - (Star Rigger , Red Limit Highway & Paradox Alley) I finally have all 3 I finally tracked down all 3 - Wonderful"},{"rating":"2","title":"Knowlege...Good","review":"A well written book on the history of the Amish.

Andele, the photographer, is replaced by the False Angele, but the Tsar proves to be a young man who simply wants friendship, and the would-be assassin, instead of killing him, plays a tango on the gramophone, before the Tsar's official duties summon him again. Jan Latham-Konig in this 1984 recording directs a strong performance, though the dryly recorded orchestra is consigned to the background.

How could I have been so deaf to the merits of this superb recording - Case at his urgent best with songs about great characters and situations. The playing is very strong, some Ry Cooderish guitar, some Latin influences, but the style definitely Case and a couple of real classic songs - \\"Put Down the Gun\\", \\"Hidden Love\\" and \\"Poor Tom\\".

However, once I do I generally make my way through all the work of that particular author. Donna Leon and her Inspector Brunetti series is a case in point.Barbara Cleverly has woven a tale set in the British Raj in 1922. Detective Joe Sandilands, decent, smart, human and intuitive finds himself drawn into solving a mysterious set of murders right before his scheduled return to Blighty.. His disappointment is mitigated by the appearance of a deeply attractive woman who is there to inform and guide him through exquisite British social mazes which envelop the crimes.A very cool and compelling adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"An atmospheric mystery set in India during the British Raj","review":"In this pleasantly restrained murder mystery, a Scotland Yard detective comes to a British Army post in India to look into a series of deaths among officers' wives. The story conveys the inbred atmosphere of the time (the 1920's) and the place. Adventures and romances illuminate personal histories and reveal tensions under the surface of polite discourse. The story ends with an unexpected and very effective twist. The book is mercifully free of gruesome descriptions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pukka concept, disappointing execution","review":"Barbara Cleverly has done her research, all right; this mystery is chockfull of brand names, fashion details, and exotic flavors straight out of 1920s India. Her plot is solid, her setting is a winner, and her characters are only sometimes ripped off from Kipling. It's just too bad that Cleverly didn't bother to research the actual speech and behavior of the English in 1920s India, while she was at it. If you like to think of the past as being just like today, only in fancy dress, you'll love this book (and the clunky writing probably won't faze you, either). If anachronism grates on you, but you're still in the mood for plotty mysteries with a British-Empire setting, read Michael Pearce's Mamur Zapt series instead. *Please.*"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great buy!","review":"We bought this for our 2 1/2 year old son, and it has quickly become his favorite!

It offers a clear look into the world of publishing, therefore, demystifying the process for those of us just embarking on this sometimes frustrating journey. Insightful and uplifting, one cannot fail to come away without a great deal of encouragement. I, for one, found myself wondering, if F.

It is not Naruto or Dragon ball Z where the characters have god like powers and stamina. The charecters in this series are very mortal, their were times in this series where I was shocked by how visceral the story got. By real, I would say this is unlike any anime I have ever seen, it reminds me of classic books and movies I have read, the pacing is slow, it is more of a drama anime, or one that centralizes a conflict. Like Hemmingways for whom the bell tolls or spieldburgs saving private ryan you get to see a shocking conclussion that embeds itself in your mind.

It is from 1985, when Andre had formed the 5-piece Maastricht Salon Orchestra (MSO) and is the earliest work I have yet found. This CD contains, in their original salon music form, many of the pieces he now plays with his full orchestra. Since some of the music was meant for a 5-piece ensemble, the interpretations have a different sound and character that is delightful and charming.

Even though the writing wasn't very good, the fast -paced plot was readable, right up until the sales pitch for the Decalogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ed Wood of Millenium Literature","review":"This is by far the worst book I've ever read. I still really can't tell if this is written for children or if the author is just pulling our legs. We are beaten over the head with the obviouse constantly. I won't \\"give away\\" the ending but suffice it to say all the characters show up that you would expect to be present in an apocalyptic tale. The authors secret is to take a cliche, magnify it 100 fold and then beat you over the head with it. Still, I did finish the book because quite frankly I had to see how bad it could get. I was not dissappointed. If you've never watched a movie just because you couldn't believe it was so aweful then you may not see the beauty in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Is Great!!!","review":"This book is to recommended to the age of computer literate users who can fully understand this book.

This goes to the bottom of the list to join such similar ilk as \\"The Black Cipher\\" by Harrison and \\"Backslash\\" by Lovejoy. The only quality computer thriller of the season appears to be Neal Stephenson's \\"Cryptonomicon\\", which is part \\"The Gold Bug\\", part \\"Treasure Island\\", and simply wonderful throughout!

There is no EQ, nor smartsound presets.Pros: This little box outperformed my expectations. It sounds great, even though you have to use the factory preset and can't tweak the EQ manually. It has really good power; I can turn it on in the dining room and fill the entire downstairs with clean-sounding music. There is no significant distortion when you crank up the volume.Summation: To my mind, for the money you're paying, this product is extraordinary. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in this Phillips","review":"I still have an older Phillips unit that I use in my garage and it has great sound and is easy to use.

I am disappointed in this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"False description","review":"The description says \\"Built in iPod docking to easily connect and charge you iPod or Philips Go Gear MP3 player,\\" but don't fall for it. This unit doesn't work with the Philips GoGear Vibe. They don't dock together and there is no USB connection on the AZ1330D. On the Philips website, there is an FAQ for this boombox that implies there is a USB port -- but there's not. The description also claims there are eight adapters to work with different iPods, but there are only four included adapters. This is the first time I've ever known a description on Amazon to be misleading, but this one is patently false."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD player is useless...","review":"I bought this and it plays none of the CDs which I own.

There's also softer side, like \\"So Glad\\", \\"Family\\", and \\"If I Have to Die\\". \\"Say Once More\\" is same kind of song as you you can hear on the two first album. I found myself \\"That's the Day\\" and \\"First Love\\" too peaceful and meaningless. However, \\"All I Ever Have to Be\\" is amazing! \\"It's a Miracle\\" really is a powerful song! \\"Don't Give Up on Me\\" has great lyrics, like almost every song in this album.

This is #4 on my list."},{"rating":"2","title":"u gotta visit dis shack","review":"No, it ain't da Love Shack (that wuz in da eighties) But guitarslinger Link Wray hit a home run creatively on dis joint from da early seventies. He is most well known for the guitar instrumental \\"Rumble\\" from the early sixties. This record was apparently made in Wray's home studio and bears a lot of resemblence to the Stones' Exile On Main Street. A lot of debt to the country blues is emanated through the sounds in this record. Link's voice sounds like Paul Rodgers mixed with Axl Rose. If you like early seventies Stones or rootsy early seventies stuff like Delaney & Bonnie, u will probably dig this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Won't hear the likes of this one again","review":"Sadly, there aren't too many people who have reviewed this.

Talk about a hidden gem- I might go so far as to say it is the most underrated album (actually, 3 albums when originally released) of all time.While there are precious few reviews here, the people who did review did a pretty good job.

It's hard to write about historic figures -- whether it's Lincoln, Hitler, or whomever, they usally end up sounding wooden or cliched. Yet here, the author \\"gets into the head\\" of Stalin. Reading it I felt, yes, that must be exactly what Stalin thought and felt like.The rest of the book is fine too, but Stalin remains the \\"character\\" I remember most."},{"rating":"2","title":"Russian Masterpiece","review":"This is the last of the Solzhenitsyn tomes I am reading (read all the rest), and like all the other ones, he had the knack of infusing soul, pathos and some lightheartedness in his work.

After initial enthusiasm I increasingly felt oppressed by this claustrophobic book, which evokes an apophatic language of transcendence to articulate what I take to be Carson's difficulty in making contact with her own animal nature. The intellect is depicted as a point of departure, but it leads only to alienation. Humans pass through this book like the shades of the Odyssey who generate speech but not warmth. Sexuality estranges, never unites.It's a rather dismal view of life, and one that does not impress me. It strikes me as the work of a writer who would rather read of the rage of Achilles than stake her own heart in the bungled human comedy.Carson is the greatest translator of Sappho that one can imagine, and in matters of elegant expression she lacks nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Orange Moose","review":"My son LOVES the Backyardigans and we now have all five stuffed animals from Ty (we began withTasha).Easy-going and always ready for adventure, kindly Tyrone is an orange moose.

My son gets a kick out of Tyrone's yellow antlers, primarily because he thinks they look like hands!From a distance, the Ty Backyardigan beanie babies may look like they're made of rough, itchy fabric--but they are not.

As many of the people quotes on the inside cover of this cd say, he is the new voice of Broadway.The cd is a collection of his cabaret work leading up to this point. The title is \\"The Time It Takes\\" and the album reflects that title, using the music he has written in his carreer as a cabaret performer leading up to the recording of this cd. The styles and subjects vary, and while some arrangements are (as another reviewer put it) \\"schmaltzy,\\" the music itself is far from it. Anyone who has seen him live when it's just him and a piano can attest to the sincerity of his music.A definite must-have."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Got It All......","review":"Meredith Layton has done essentially a fine job with this toy.

Newley's strange mincing mannerisms render him absurd as the male lead. Keanu in this sense is in fairness the logical heir to the role but easily outdoes Newley in overall appeal.Charmwise-Sandy Dennis is roughly equal to Theron although her feyness is intense and unrelenting which I suppose played better then than now.If the latest version is perhaps a B or B-, this is a D charitably.

Susun is most definately a grandmother of herbalism to the next generations that follow the herbal ways.Susun is delightful in her writing and is also very public about everything she writes about. Truly teaching us about the herbs themselves and how to apply them.I got a bit confused on her way of describing dandelion in her french accent writing about the plant, but now that I have been exposed to a french teacher, I am more comfortable with understanding this section of the book and should re read it.But that is Susun's playful style and how the plants are in relation to her.If you practice herbalism in any degree, this is a must have book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some great lessons, but too much religion included","review":"I suffered through the first third of this book, wondering if there might be some pertinent information. It was just her personal belief system which she has interwoven with the use of herbs. While I will agree that I believe that we have gotten out of touch with our bodies as they pertain to the earth. I don't espouse bleeding into the earth during your period in order to do it! (she does, by the way) What I did glean was that a good way to learn about herbs would be to focus on just one herb-learn all about it, and what it can do. (don't sleep with it, as she suggests) I think just having it in your kitchen and garden and using it regularly would do. Starting on page 86 with Burdock, she walks you through harvesting and using the herb. This is useful and informative and I'm sure I will utilize it quite a bit. All in all, I suggest that unless you worship women and the earth-then skip the first half and go straight to using the herbs."},{"rating":"2","title":"a true wise woman","review":"susan's refreshing yet ancient way of interacting with the plant world, and facilitating healing, is a breath of fresh air. it provides plenty of science and facts on individual plants, but the most relevant part of her work is the wisdom of the spiral of life. it is risky, and evokes a core essence of knowing in regards to health and healing. anyone interested in herbs and healing should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to Basics","review":"This is a wonderful book filled with wisdom and love.

HOW WRONG I WAS! Ms Edwards makes the topic crunchingly relevant and digestable. The key concepts are clearly explained and related to recent events. I never knew how economics contirbutes to shaping our community.This book has left me with a sense of urgency regarding economics. Government policies matter, not just for short-term budget balancing, but for long term impacts on how we think and act.The autor's experience at the upper levels of the public service gives startling insight into why our politicians only seem able to create mind-numbingly similar 'solutions' to still unresolved problems.A first-rate read.

If you're Wallace Roney, the answer is--not much. This disc would more appropriately have been entitled, \\"I wish I were Miles Davis\\". I can just picture a young Roney practicing his horn surrounded by Miles posters and paraphenalia perfecting his imitative technique.There's nothing on this disc that you can't find, done much better, by Miles in any of his electric sessions. Granted, I don't write jazz reviews for the New York Times, but I am a serious collector and listener of jazz music and to my ear, there is nothing new here. I defy the average jazz fan to find a unique voice here.The technique is excellent to be sure, and the imitation is spot on, but if you want Champaign, why drink sparkling cider? Spend your CD dollar wisely, go to the Miles Davis section, and avoid [poor] imitations."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love Buck Howdy","review":"We discovered Buck Howdy when we borrowed a CD at the library.

It's very silly, and a tiny bit rude, which makes it even more fun. His lyrics are amusing, clever, and easy on adult ears.

If, however, you have no other access then this is, as I said, adequate. What I can say is that the product was perfectly packed.

Not to mention the singer's voice sounds similar to Conor Oberst's which I find to be very annoying. The lyrics and horrible as well.

And perhaps that's one of the reasons why it has always been claimed that the RAI orchestra is inferior. The German label Gebhardt has released a 24-bit remastered version of this recording that simply explodes with sound, especially from the orchestra. It is now the version to own.Wagner: Der Ring des NibelungenIf you already own the EMI version you'll appreciate the difference. EMI's sound is smoother, with less hiss, but dull and flat - all a result of their filtering. Gebhardt's sound is more raw, but far more realistic and alive. Furtwangler was the greatest interpreter of the Ring and this performance, even more than the 1950 La Scala Ring (which has also been remastered by Gebhardt), is his greatest on records."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stellar, historic cast also available as a download","review":"This is the same version available as an inexpensive download on i-Tunes, a historic recording made by Furtwängler in 1953 at the studios of the RAI (Italian Radio), with an absolutely stellar cast. Enjoy Martha Mödl as Brünnhilde, Ludwig Suthaus as Siegfried, Wolfgang Windgassen in the dual roles of Loge and Siegmund, Gustav Neidlinger as Alberich (Rheingold only), Ferdinand Franz as Wotan, and Josef Greindl tripling as Fasolt, Fafner in Siegfried, and Hagen. Furtwängler sensibility is evident throughout.

In the case of Carl, played by Jim Carrey, his loss of his girlfriend has him in a rut. He lacks initiative to see new things at work and at home so he says no to everything. His friends become really upset when he bows out on a friends rehearsal party. But have no fear, another friend who has gone native instructs him to go to a Yes! seminar. Carl does it, and it changes his life. Now we all know saying yes to everything may seem like we are opening up, but not every person has us in mind when they ask us for something. Some of the people that ask Carl for something truly benefits them both, but some of them put him in trouble. Seeing how he fixes things is half the fun.

Now I've read a lot of reveiws about the sexual content and after watching it (which I found to be very funny) I found that they left most of it to the viewers imagination.The launguage wasn't overdone, but it did fit into the certain dialogue, and the over all film was fairly well done.Now I was reading one reviewers comments that said that the film was predictable.

Carrey still makes me laugh and I really liked the concept of this film, very orginial. Even \\"deadpan\\" actress/singer Zooey Deschanel actually had some charm to her, really enjoyed her effortless chemistry with Carrey. Yes Man is fun and cute, check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"\\"Yes Man\\" is a movie in which Jim Carrey goes back to his roots of comedy. Although the movie never truly made me laugh out loud consistantly like \\"Ace Venture\\" or \\"Liar, Liar\\" I still found the movie to be funny. I think it hit the spot for comedy movies and I will watch it over and over again for its entertainment value.What I liked most of the movie is Zoe Deschanel. Yet again she made the character her own. Giving a quarkiness to her character in \\"Yes Man\\", as she usually does; which is a major part of her charm.The supporting actors do a solid job, although none do an excellent job. But they all add to the movie as a whole.Storyline wise the movie was your prototypical Jim Carrey comedy movie.

Not only that, but unlike Liar, liar, the script itself was terrible. There was nothing Carey could have done to salvage such bad material other than write it himself.

He lived his depressing life every day until one of his friends talked him into attending an inspirational seminar called Yes Man. In this seminar, Jim made a pact with himself that he would say yes to everything in his life, no matter how weird or dangerous the situation is. He started doing that, and his life changed very positively and got very interesting.The morale behind this film is that we should conquer our inner fears and say yes to things we really want to do deep inside but are afraid of. If you want to ask someone to marry you but you're afraid of rejection, go for it, at least you will know how she feels about you. If you never ask her, youl will stay all your life wondering what she would have answered.The humor in the movie is good. Its not Dumb and Dumber type of comedy that will throw you off your seat, but its descent."},{"rating":"2","title":"YES MAN IS A HIT.","review":"WHILE THE CONCEPT MAY BE THE SAME AS LIAR LIAR, THE THING THAT GETS ME TO KEEP WATCHING THIS FLICK IS THE CAST OF THE MOVIE. THEY REALLY GO TOE TO TOE WITH CARREY. THE OTHER THING THAT I LIKED WAS THE SPECIAL FEATURES. YOU GET A BEHIND THE SCENES LOOK, A FEW MUSIC VIDEOS FEATURING ZOOEY DECHANEL AND A FEW INTERVIEWS. THE ONLY KNOCK I HAVE IS THE MOVIE DOESNT HAVE AN AUDIO COMMENTARY BY THE ACTORS OR THE DIRECTOR. I WISH THEY WOULD OF DONE ONE BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE LOVE TO HEAR THE BACKSTORY OF THIS MOVIE. I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT THIS MOVIE WAS BASED OFF OF TRUE EVENTS, SOME GUY ONE DAY DECIDED TO SAY YES TO EVERYTHING AND I PERSONALLY WOULD OF LIKED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT.

Anyway, the cast does manage some funny moments here and there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carrey lite","review":"The concept of this movie is great--a guy who always says no to everything is convinced to change his life he must say yes to everything. This could have been mined for great comedic laughs especially given Jim Carrey is the lead actor here. Sadly, the script is terrible. The worse is the last 20 minutes where it devolves into some sort of pining woe-is-me before, of course, the happy ending.The cast is pretty decent and deserved better. Having said that the lead actress Zooey (yep, that's her name) Deschanel is not very appealing. She plays a character with her own quirks but it's so low key you'd think she's comatose at times. She also is very unbelievable when she tries for angry in a scene.No extras at all on this version of the DVD and, frankly, if you do make it through this movie without fast-forwarding any of it, Warner Bros. should give you a medal or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"This is one of Jim Carry's better comedies.

Lately he's been churning out the same character over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes man, a big no!","review":"Im not sure when it became apparent that Hollywood began confusing funny with cutesy but it seems to be what they do best these days and Yes Man is no different.What started out promisingly enough, in the tradition of Liar Liar, soon petered out to be something more annoying than actually funny. Sometimes a good romantic comedy is a welcome deviation from the gloom and doom laden flicks that are the norm these days.How about actually making one funny though instead of cute and sappy. Cute just isnt funny, just ask M. Mcconaghey (sp.), he wouldnt know funny if it hit him like a truck.If you actually prefer real funny over just cute then stick with \\"Fun with Dick and Jane\\" or the raunchier \\"Me, myself and Irene\\".\\"Yes Man\\" goes for a few chuckles at best, very few."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to stomach, but has its moments","review":"This trite, insipid waste of time has a number of moments worth following: Those surrounding the cult that Carey finds himself involved in (not the Carey's typically overdone, poorly written, poorly controlled character itself) give a few chuckles, and the female lead shines with a well-written, though still outlandish, and played in something close enough to a nuanced manner to shine next to the washed out and repetitive Carey character. The main character is essentially a rehash of the family friendly Carey from Liar Liar et al, but has a handful of adequately morally questionable moments to make the viewer wonder why he couldn't bring something a bit darker and different to bear.This film might be worth watching as the second or third movie on a long flight, as it was for me, but I'm extremely glad I didn't spend money on this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mind Numbing Dumb, Unfunny","review":"I checked out Amazon reviews just to see if anyone was going to give this sham of a movie 5 stars. As expected, some people did. Apparently there is a market for every piece of garbage that Hollywood produces.This is a movie that Jim Carrey will want to forget quickly. It's almost sad watching one of Hollywood's most talented comedians turn into a pale shadow of his former self, trying to force some laughs out of this miserable script. The plot is obviously an attempt to replicate Liar Liar along the same lines but whereas Liar Liar was clever and funny, Yes Man is dumb and unfunny. Watching Jim Carrey and Zooey Deschanel read those trite script lines is almost painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parents of children under 16: beware","review":"This movie is typical Jim Carrey nonsense. Call me a prude but I don't think it's necessary to include oral sex in a PG-13 movie. I watched this movie with my 13-yr-old and 16-yr-old and was totally embarrassed during the scene with Carl's neighbor, Tilly. My son fast forwarded it to the next scene.Some parents may not care. Some may not have the time to check. But I think it's totally unnecessary to include that kind of sexual practice in a PG-13 movie. Either it shouldn't be allowed or a new rating should be developed. There are hundreds of impressionable middle school students who watch these kinds of movies and think it's ok to behave in that way.

Zooey Deschanel - how can you not fall in love with this girl? Get the soundtrack with her singing - Yes Man - the title track to the movie - very cool.

They are also an interesting chapter in \\"The Garden Of Ediacara.\\" Unfortunately, this book appears to have more material in it about Mark McMenamin than it does about the subject matter. Is it truly necessary to show a photograph of a hotel in Namibia or the author's official Mexican fieldwork badge in order to discuss the first complex life forms? I don't think so. The reader truly has to pick and choose what paragraphs to read in order to learn about Ediacaran fossils as opposed to the author's travelogues. Much of the material is simply extraneous. Proper editing would have made this book much more interesting and pleasurable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Columbia Press let its guard down","review":"The Garden of Ediacara reads like a 295-page Valentine card written by Mark A. S. McMenamin to Mark A. S. McMenamin. I have never seen such egotistic indulgence in a work which claims to be a scientific treatise. Nor have I ever seen an author cite his own (rather ordinary) words in a chapter epigraph! Where the reader might have enjoyed a color photo of an Ediacaran animal, he or she is treated instead to a color photo of Mark A. S. McMenamin's identification card. This is like showing the reader your driver's license (by the way it happens to have a photograph of Mark A. S. McMenamin's face on it). Columbia Press really let its guard down and this thing will take its rightful place as an awkward sore, much like the writings of Wilhelm Reich of \\"orgone energy\\" fame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, good ideas and lousy execution.","review":"I have read the book nearly twice and each time close it with a deep sense of disappointment. The problem I have with the story is the personal observation and biographical material. I wanted to read about Ediacaran animals NOT the namibian airport, recalcitrant gatekeepers and inane diary entries about who the author had dinner with. Some of the book could have been taken up with more photos and perhaps professional sketches and not the crayon drawings from Mrs Thompson's second grade class.The ideas the author presents on the fauna are what made me get through the book at all. Those were great but occupy very little of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much extraneous material.","review":"Disappointing reading. There is some interesting information here, but it is mostly at the end.

Even if they're not by Apple, they're surprisingly bad for its price. I think the $2.50 ones would be of similar quality to these that are $12.95.Once you plug the headphones into your ipod you have to tamper with the connection (the end that's plugged into the ipod) to get optimal sound. And the optimal sound isn't when it's plugged in all the way like it should be. You have to put it about 2mm from all the way to get the optimal sound. But the thing is, if you move at all, the sound gets distorted because the connection is bad, resulting in either a scratchy sound, sound from only one side, or fluctuating volume. It's definitely not something I'll use unless I'm sitting down. Even then, the quality is nothing like the real apple headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!

I returned my HD 465 after receiving them as a gift and went to the HD 555.My opinion is that the HD 485 has similar sound with a better cup ( no fabric tensioned), but the best option is the HD 555 for Au$85 extra.The Sennheiser HD 555 has a large plug jack designed for the lounge amplifier rather than an iPod, so to use it on an ipod you have to plug the large jack into the adapter and end up with a double plug the same height as your iPod again.Another good thing about the HD555 is they are very comfortable over hours of listening, have a sleek look which is in contrast to the 80's design of the HD465/485s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Sennheiser, By Far","review":"This is the fourth or fifth Sennheiser earphones I have purchased, and the very first that did not please me. In fact, it might well be the worst pair of stereo phones I have ever encountered. The highs are nonexistant, and the lows are so heavy, the sound actually breaks up on truly low tones. No amount of correction could compensate, either. I know. I tried. The attenuation of the high frequencies actually starts at 800 Hertz. I am truly disppointed, and had I less confidence in this company, (previously), I might have retained the packaging, etc., and returned the phones.As it is, I am stuck with them.

It even pretends to care about being competitive in pricing by providing a link that asks customers to tell them of lower prices elsewhere.

So be prepared to have at least one spare if not 2. The LCD has a very good size and bright however I think that is the problem in leaving the battery empty. I am surprised at sony and their reputation not to address such important issue.The very positive aspect was when I returned to Amazon I was credited back with in 24 hours an excellent service by amazon my hats off to them for their support.Bottom line is do not spend $450.00 for this camera it is only good for one purpose and that is to Show Off."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have a camera phone, don't bother.....","review":"This camera is a pile of garbage.

Shots w/o flash looked comparable to my phone's -unnatural color, grainy, blurry. The flash (even with the anti-red-eye feature) gave all of my friends red-eyes. Video is okay, but randomly focuses in and out like it can't make up its mind??? Auto-focus is the worst ever. The most frustrating part is how misleading the LCD is (only nice feature) because the pics looked great on it -until you upload them on to your computer.

A touching and engrossing film, with something to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of those quirky, delightful movies","review":"This is one of those sleeper movies with a delightful, quirky plot carried by superb writing and excellent performances of top actors. The plot is bizarre enough to be completely believable. Built around an Admiral's demented scheme to have a sailor to be the first U.S. serviceman killed on Omaha Beach in the Normandy invasion, our reluctant, anti-war hero, James Garner, struggles to survive and love through a scheme that puts him at the very center of a dangerous world at war. Paddy Chayefsky's wild, funny screen writing vividly illuminates the lunacy of war. Much like Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing, when it's over they are all friends again and the viewer's delight comes from witnessing the experiences they have gone through together."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will be delighted.","review":"Having recently seen this film at the Local Heroes Film Festival in Edmonton, Alberta where it was screened by director Arthur Hiller as one of his personal favourites, viewers will be delighted as James Garner and Julie Andrews give two of their strongest performances ever in a wonderful script by the classic Paddy Chayefsky of \\"Marty\\" and \\"Network\\" fame - a \\"must see\\" for film fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Acting!","review":"This is an interesting movie with Julie Andrews and James Garner. Gives some insight to the probable goings on during WWII. Both main stars did a superb job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More dark humor than anti-war","review":"I saw this movie in the theatre when it came out, and I love it. My favorite line is in the beginning when they meet and Garner is directing the delivery of luxury food and liquor to his admiral's quarters, and admiral's driver Andrews (seeing all the luxury items) chews out Garner by accusing Americans of \\"enjoying\\" the war. Garner replies, \\"Let me tell YOU something: Americans would not be here if it weren't for 2,000 years of European barbarism!\\" It brought the theatre down in cheers and applause.This story is more dark humor than anti-war, and Paddy Chayefsky is the master of dark humor. In the \`70s, he co-wrote with Joan Rivers \\"Girl Most Likely To...\\", a dark humor about an ugly-duckling-turned-Cinderella co-ed played by Stockard Channing.If you haven't seen \\"Americanization of Emily\\", you must.

I fell asleep while watching it then. I bought the DVD as part of the Controversial Classics set, and was looking forward to seeing the parts I missed.This time, I fell asleep twice watching it; it took a total of three nights to see it all. I found it just as talky and heavy-handed as I did when I saw it back in college. Further, I didn't pick up on any chemistry between the leads, and found James Coburn's character loud and annoying. Finally, the great MGM hairstylist Sidney Guillaroff was way off the mark on this one. Almost all of the women had mid-60's hairdo's that were distracting, particularly Miss Andrews, whose distracting poofie 'do often changed from shot to shot within the same scene.I get it; war is bad.

It's a beautiful film, and I was deeply moved by it. The story weaves a number of threads into a whole that is heartfelt, touching, and both specific and universal. I found myself in tears a few times as I connected to the heartbreak of the girls and their struggle to find friendship and acceptance in a new country with a new culture. The direction is excellent, the two young girls are fantastic, and the film looks incredible. There is wonderful music as well, and it's a story that I believe will touch anyone who watches it.

In a way I found too many issues put together (the racial one, the discovery of hate and lust, the sexual education) but very well mixed up.

This book takes us back to a much simpler time when life was slower but there were still terrors.

As in most of Mr. Lansdale's books he does a wonderful job of mixing the mystery and terror with humor and heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Look Back","review":"I enjoyed The Bottoms so well that I thrilled to see another Joe Lansdale story set in East Texas. Underlying the unraveling of two murders that took place long ago, there is social history that is examined. As I read the book, I could remember the time and remember how attitudes were changing for many people, but staying the same for others. As typical of the time, Stanley went from still clinging to Santa Claus to learning about sex, murder, domestic violence and bigotry all in one summer. He struggled with knowing that events were against the law, but feeling in his heart that they were the right thing to do at the time. In every respect, this was a wonderful reading experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true model for the fan,","review":"This Vinyl model was well designed and sculpted.

Acrylic paints are you best bet on a model like this not your average model paint. Hairdryer can also be helpful since this is vinyl sometimes in packing the pieces get bent out of shape but because of vinyls properties it can be heated by an average hair dryer and bent back into shape. Also, gluing this kit together before painting is a must due to seams on the legs and arms. (You will see what I mean.)

As far as you do not move around they function perfectly even when you are several meters far from the sound source. If you do move, it does not matter how far you are, they produce a \\"hissing\\" noise from time to time, probably related to some particular position changes. I guess that it is impossible to eliminate this noise. Perhaps it is the price that you have to pay for getting free of cables. Anyway, I am happy with these headphones as I can listen to my musics at a reasonable volume without disturbing anyone and without needing to stay attached to my sound system by a cable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Than Expected","review":"Main problem is the wireless reception , even if you are very near you still hear some annoying noiseNothing like Wired headphones ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sennheiser RS 130 is OK","review":"I use headphones for my TV.

He's thrilled and so is she! If you're hard of hearing and need some help with the TV or Stereo, these both of these do a nice job! If your hearing is great and you're looking for great sound...stay with a corded headphone. Wireless headphones can't avoid some noise/signal degradation with today's technology. I compared the two...and I could not say there was any difference in sound quality...but then my ears are not the best in the world either. Maybe if your hearing is pretty good to begin with you would notice a significant difference. With moderate hearing loss, there is not point in spending more on the RS 130."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality, lots of static","review":"I have a home-theater system in the same room as this one.

I wanted these headphones as I workout in the wee hours of the morning and would like to watch TV at the same time without disturbing the kids. At low source volumes (TV sound volume) and me 20 feet away from it there is constant hissing and swishing sounds especially as my head moves while working out. Raising the TV volume reduces this, but then defeats the purpose of headphone completely (do not want to disturb the household!) Also i constantly lose reception every 10-15 min and get cut off and though sometimes it scans and reaquires. I often have to manually turn the headphones off and on.I would certainly stay away from Sennheiser headphones. They are not worth the top dollar I paid for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"When I first purchased the headphones, I was pleased with the sound quality and the fact that others did not have to suffer from a loud television when viewing shows with me.

I hope that they will honor the warranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Heaphones","review":"I received these headphones as gift and let me tell you, they have been great. I can now actually listen to the TV and let the little one sleep and not have to read everything in closed captioning. Once I figured out how to set the TV correctly, everything was great. There is occasional static depending on where I am sitting or laying, but I attribute that to the fact that the transmitter is set back in the cabinet since the cables are not long enough for better positioning.This thing is incredibly comfortable, I can wear for hours and they do no bother me at all, and it stays put. The volume knob is positioned to where, if you are resting your head on a pillow or the back of the couch, it gets turned, but that is my main complaint, and wouldn't return them because of it.Great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over rated, Had better sound and reception from $19 sets","review":"Having read other reviews I elected to purchase this wireless headphone.

The silver mess area on the outsides of the headphones are a straight shot to the speaker. So folks around you get to hear what you're listening to at the same volume as you!I've never left a review on Amazon before but this ridiculous design flaw made me want to inform others. I purchased these on Amazon and am amazed no one else posted this remark. Hopefully this helps someone else steer clear of these if they are concerned with private listening.Now on the upside, other than the issue described above, these headphones are pretty darn good. The wireless technology works great and they are comfortable to wear.Just wish they would have put some thought into the noise pollution given off by these headphones. I mean, ear bud style headphones give off less noise!Buyer beware...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Apartments","review":"I live in an apartment in the city and have a surround system I rarely use. If I turn the system up loud enough to drown out city noises, my neighbors complain, hence, the perfect solution is the Sennheiser wireless. I can watch movies, shows, music with the headphone on and take care of tasks in the kitchen, throw out the trash, etc. without missing a beat. I'm no audiophile so everything sounds very true and in tune to me, even the surround feature. In fact, my movie and TV watching experience is enhanced because I never miss whispered dialogue or subtle sound effects with these headphones. The headphones themselves are constructed in a way that they don't pinch your head and provide just enough pressure from a 90 degree angle to your ears that they are quite comfortable even for excessively prolonged wearing. I like these quite a bit and they certainly have enhanced my home entertainment experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Those in Dorms! - BEWARE","review":"I live in a college dormitory and purchased these for listen to music + didn't want to get a wired one to chain me to my computer.

The sound is better than most, the headset is comfortable and the price is reasonable. The only complaint I have is the range. I've tried walking around the house with it to test the range and the signal seems to get weak at about 20-25 feet-you still get sound and if you stand in one spot the signal will eventually catch up to you, but you can definitely tell that you've gone too far from the base. For our uses it is a fine- my wife normally uses to watch TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got noise if you're listening","review":"I use these headphones to listen to streaming audio through my computer. I have found that the noise (primarily hiss) is significant. I plug them into a Logitech surround sound unit and have to turn the volume all the way up on it, volume all the way up on my software volume control, and then turn down the volume on the headphones. If I don't, the hiss is intolerable. Additionally, I find the noise that the headphones pick up just walking a room away is large. I do not recommend them for walking around the house or going a significant distance from the base. With all the hiss they pick up I cannot call them audiophile quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy with wireless headphones.","review":"I had previously purchased a pair of Sony wireless headphones from BestBuy (for approx the same amount as these).

Not enough volume and hiss! The user guide indicates some TV,s will interfere with the transmitter and they are right. A constant easily heard hum when the TV is on. This is not present if the LCD TV is off. I have no hum in my 20 year old Radio Shack open ear headphones and they actually sound better the the Sennheiser's. I had worked in the audio industry for a good 12 years and Sennheiser made great headphones then and I think they still do. Just not this wireless model. The SRS surround sound feature very poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Wireless Headphones on the market for the price","review":"Sennheiser is known for high end audio. I own a Recording studio and I use these for many things including mixing and watching TV. Music is brought to life with these headphones. Right out of the box, I plug it all in and Listened to YESSONGS and Pink Floyd. WOW! These are the BEST wireless headphones ever. The Surround feature can be used with your Receiver if it has that feature. It enhances the Bass and the depth of the sound. I was blown away. They are very easy to hook up. These headphones have the volume and tuning right on the right headphone. They are also very comfortable to wear for long periods of time.

Even my wife, who rarely shows an interest in listening to music, kept them on while I was in the shower. I may even have to get her another set of earphones.Love Them !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"While I initially thought these headphones were acceptable, I can't take it any more. When I listen to music from the next room, the constant cut-outs whenever I tilt my head and ever-present hiss detract from my listening experience so much that I now refuse to use these headphones. They are OK if I am right next to the receiver, but I'd prefer to use wired 'phones for that, as the sound is far superior. I finally tossed them today, as I couldn't even listen to my new CD; more hiss and drop-outs than music. In my mind, it was money down the drain. I had another pair of wireless (900mHz) headphones previously with similar results. I thought the digital tuning on these would reduce the poor reception, but I couldn't tell any difference. From now on, I'll deal with the inconvenience of extension cords in preference to wireless headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad at all","review":"This product is not bad at all. I live in a one room apartment with my girlfriend, so we figured it would be a good investment for when one of us would want to listen to music.

I have them on right now and I can here noise from the TV that's on low volume about 12 feet behind me.- They are comfortable.That's my initial reaction.

For me the high price is worth the benefit I get from this product.A word of caution: I would say that the average user of headphones tends to listen at levels that are too loud.

Accessory Genie, the supplier didn't have a clue. I tried to reach Sennheiser but got the usual run around choosing options and leaving messages. Finally, Accessory Genie sent a replacement unit. It didn't work either and no power source was included. I finally reached Sennheiser. Ultimately we figured out that at least some of the remanufactured units have been repackaged without the power unit.

This Sennheiser wireless system provided a great solution. I put on the headphones and listen while she falls asleep hearing nothing. Set up was fairly easy, and I like that it's a rechargeable system. I just put them on the stand in the morning and they are ready again by the time I want to use them in the evening. I will say that you have to make sure they are making proper contact with the stand for them to charge, but that's made fairly easy to recognize by way of an LED indicator. One dislike is the layout of the control buttons -- specifically the volume control which resides on the back of the headphones and so when I would lie back against the pillow I would sometimes get an unwelcome change of volume. Frankly I just reversed the headphones to eliminate that problem and they are still quite comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"The product is very good, easy to use, comfortable and marvellous sound.

The other thing I love is that you can actually have a conversation or listed to monitors for the kids rooms while they are on.

Very sturdy product.THE BADThe design of the volume dial is right where your head leans back in a chair or pillow. I got these so I can watch TV withoutIt interferes with mobile phones quite easily. The iPhone charging next to the nightstand would send nasty sounds to the headphones and the headphone stand was on the other end of the room.The pads on the head and the ears are a soft fabric and after a few uses they need to be washed or they will smell like old socks. This is not sweat, this is normal absorption from the head and face after 10 - 15 uses.The volume can be heard through the ear pads so everyone next to you can hear what you are listening to.

After speaking with Sennheiser, I was told it may not be for me. Thus began the return, that has been horrible. Mine was purchased from Skybox via amazon. I will never buy from them again.

I went on for two more paragraphs complaining about it, then someone pointed out that I should RTFM.Sure enough, there it is, just hold the \\"Tune\\" button down for 5 seconds and the beeps are turned off.

I have a Sony XBR4 TV and tried with outputs from DirectTV/PS3/DVDs etc. I did not find it suites anything. May be it is good for just News and I am sure you do not want to spend 115$ for that. I returned it and the return was very easy and smooth.

You can get better sounding wired headphones for way cheaper.Spent $120 on these (and that's a lot for a pair of headphones). Honestly for $100+ I expected better sound quality, but hey it's RF.. Good things first - probably most comfortable headphones I've had so far. Very well thought out design. I like! Charging doc is stylish. Surround feature I found pretty useful - need ON for some sound; off for others. Too bad you can't adjust it on earphones directly (switch is on the dock).Bad: no dedicated bass/treble adjustment (but you can adjust from the source so that's ok). Sounds quality is pretty good but not great. I can definitely hear the difference vs my wired Sony headphones. Especially between the songs (or on pause) you head a bit of hissing.These are for watching movies/playing games w/o disturbing people in the next room, which is what I need them for anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"This is truely a great set of headphones.

The stand is stylish and futuristic, and it is really pretty superbly neat to be able to walk around listening to music without having any cords at all.But for a $100 pair of headphones, the fact that they are constantly hissing, clicking (rather loudly) and periodically beep during quiet bits as they channel-seek is incredibly annoying. It's not even constant, quiet hiss - the hiss will get louder and quieter at random intervals and when you turn your head...even if you are only two feet from the transmitter! Gah. I really don't use them at all unless there are no other headphones around because they are so bothersome.If this is the best wireless headphones can do, I'd stick with wires if I were you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"Ugh.I received these as a Christmas present and was so excited to use these, but they're a nightmare.

I have a pair of cheapy $30 wireless headphones from Radio Shack that work just fine, no hissing. I can't even walk out of my bedroom without these headphones crackling and hissing loudly in my ear. With my Radio Shack headphones, I could go down to the BASEMENT of my building without the headphones cutting out. Unfortunately, my mother bought these for me in October, so when Christmas came along, it was already past the day we could return them. So basically I have a pair of $130 headphones being used as a paperweight.

These are great! The range is great, I was away from the base unit about 30 ft and it was still clear as a bell. The 3d emulation is pretty cool but sometimes it over enhances the sound, but just trun it off, there is a dedicated switch on the headset. The other cool thing is that it runs on AAA batteries, and they charge by placing it on the base. Man its really great. I bought a 2nd one and they both tune into the same base. So far I can't find anything bad about it. Well the only thing bad about it is that the sound quality is not as good as the wired version, but I'm just watching TV and not listening to HD audio so it's ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"If you snagged the holiday pricing on this like I did then you made out like a bandit. Yes, Sennheiser is coming out with a newer and greater model to replace this, but so what! They sound amazing, the simulated surround sound is awesome, there's a bit of hiss here and there depending on your surroundings(I live in a small apt. with a lot of computers and equipment because I'm a giant nerd) but the only time I can hear it is in moments of absolute silence(in my case, the light hissing is less distracting then the general ambient noise in my apartment). They fit great, the controls are easy and the charging stand isn't that unattractive. My only negative is that the volume control is on the back of the headphone, so if I slouch on my couch and lean my head on a pillow the wrong way it can sometimes accidentally turn up or down the volume. One solution is to flip the red/black connectors on your receiver and sacrifice some comfort in order to be able to flip the headphones around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sennheiser wireless headphones - too $ for the poor reliability","review":"I bought these and for the first 4 months they worked terrific.

I endured this for about 7-8 months until one day the drop outs became worse and then they stopped working completely. Thank goodness for extended warrantees. If you buy these be sure to get an extended warranty. Such a shame something that started out sounding so wonderful only lasted a few months. These were handled with TLC - never touch by critters or children and never exposed to moisture, vibration, shock, etc. I'm having serious difficulty justifying the purchase of another set from them even though Sennheiser has been a big name in headphones for decades.

Replacement rechargeable batteries are easy to find.Cons: Slight head movements can sometimes cause some \\"hissing\\" or static even in the same room with the transmitter.

When I received it, I thought it was a copy of a copy of a copy. It's that poor. I called the publisher and unfortunately, this is the only version available.

Tobey McGuire was excellent and the others were too. It shows how connected some soldiers get to the war and their fellow soldiers. It also explores what happens at home and how they can't really understand what the soldiers go through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anything for an Oscar","review":"Having a friend who had to work some issues out from post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and is doing great after love and acceptance from family and friends plus receiving rehabilitation and counseling, Brothers was a great film.

The wife and kids seem to be happy all the time, they accepted it all very easily..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I loved this movie. It instantly became one of my top 5 ever. Some of the films most intense moments are some of the most intense I've ever seen. Tobey Maguire deserves an oscar for this. Some critics have been saying that this movie is more of a melodrama than the original, but I would greatly disagreee. Great acting from all involved (including the dad) and terrific writing. After I saw it, I couldn't stop thinking about it the rest of the week. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Brothers","review":"This movie simply ran out of steam when it should have been revving it up. It lost me at the point where Brother Tom kissed the wife, and then went ..... where? Really seemed like the screenwriters didn't know how to imbue the story with the kind of conflict and emotion it needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did NOT like this movie at all!","review":"I had really big expectations of this movie, based on the \\"explosive emotional\\" tv trailers and commercials....shoulda just stuck with that. Tobey was very robotic and unconvincing as a \\"loving Dad\\" BEFORE he was deployed again. There didn't seem to be any chemistry with him as a Dad. I felt overall the acting was forced and didn't evoke any real emotions. I am very sensitive to emotional movies and this really didn't do it for. (Hey, I cried in CARS when Lightning pushed The King over the finish line!). The movie had lots of cliche type cheese (so bring the Triscuits!). The movie was (for me) disconnected on many levels and cold heartless acting all around...except the little girl. The ending was a big let down too and it seemed that there could have been lots more to do with it then what was done. Golden Globe worthy? I think not."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great film","review":"This movie is great. There are moments of laughter and of tears. There was a time during the movie, in which I found it a bit hard to stomach. I do think that the movie does show what happens overseas and afterward rather accurately. To me, this is a must watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"decent","review":"This was a really good movie about two brothers-a military hero and a screw-up just released from prison. When the hero is shipped off to the Middle East, shot down, and presumed dead, the screw-up tries to redeem himself and act as a father figure to the family. This was a well-made film with superb acting and drama. The extras on the DVD were also good. If you like the stars (Tobey Maguire, Jake Gylenhaal, Natalie Portmann) and a good drama, then this is the movie for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miscast","review":"It's not only that Tobey Maguire was not up to playing a paranoid marine POW here. It's just so obvious Jake Gyllenhaal was born to play THAT role instead of the slacker brother. The major plot points are also handled in a bland awkward \\"TV movie-ish\\" way. I cringed at the sappy ending narration over an uplifting U2 power ballad. This guy is way damaged...why sugar coat it? Finally, the father-son relationship was barely covered at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotionally touching movie","review":"I especially enjoyed watching the two little girls woven into so much of the story.

It's almost a disrespect to the men and women who put their lives on the line. You'd expect a good intelligent movie would be made about the realities they face."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"The worse movie Ive seen in a while. The casting was completely wrong, there was absolutly no chemistry between any of the actors. The only believable character in the whole movie was the father in law.Toby Maguire; a Captain in the Military?? oh please, He looked like a 18 year old boot camp recruit and acted like it. The movie dragged on and on and on but rushed on other parts and that was due to very bad editing. This was probably a good book but certainly did not play well on camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, brother","review":"I am amazed with some of the reviews I've read stating the casting in this movie was spot on, now I don't mean to knock Tobey Maguire as an actor but in my mind he does not fit the description of his character one bit, that's the first thing I have a problem with in this film. The other thing is the plot of the film, this had the potential to be a really great movie if they had of made it more about Jake and Natalie's characters becoming more romantically involved without the audience knowing Maguire's character is still alive until much later into the film. Instead it became more about how Maguire's character deals with life after being tortured in Afghanistan. Anyway that's just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon reviewer Kathleen C. Fennessy is a phony!","review":"In her review of \\"Brothers\\" Kathleen C. Fennessy writes, \\"Back in New Mexico, Grace and Tommy grow closer, stopping just short of a full-blown affair (in [Danish director] Susanne Bier's original [Danish movie \\"Brdre\\" starring Connie Nielsen], they take the plunge).\\"No they don't! Just as in the American re-make, brother- and sister-in-law come close but they never actually have sex! They both love their fallen brother and husband and would have betrayed the soldier's love, making them both unworthy of his sacrafice in Afghanistan!

The story involving a very nasty incident in Afghanistan during the war against the Taliban and the subsequent subsequent return home of the hero is drama of the highest level. Jake Gyllenhall and Natalie Portman both give superb performances as the hero's brother and wife. The development of the brother's character from most irresponsible to fine upstanding citizen was excellently handled by Jake Gyllenhall as was Natalie Portman's as the wife.Tobey Maguire's performance of our hero's post traumatic stress disorder on his return home was a mesmerising 'tour de force'.Most highly reccommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cant get better than this!","review":"Other than the fact that the movie was very inexpensive, it also came a few days before the estimated arrival had stated.

The supporting cast is wonderful, too, as is the scenery. The music score is one of the best I've heard. This movie should have won Oscars for acting, photography, music, and play.

At last, Warner have got it right, not only with the correct Panavision ratio but a 5.1 Dolby Surround track. In the past, I have made do with a scratched region 2 copy that was cropped to 16.9 and mono sound. I can now watch this wonderful 60s Classic at my leisure as the Director intended. It has taken years but they say everything comes to those who wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Period Masterpiece","review":"This is one of the best films of all time. With traditional English folk songs woven throughout the film, it tastefully displays some of the mores of the Victorian era and stages a fine story from Thomas Hardy. The vain, and beauteous Bathsheba Everdene gets her comeuppance and you are rooting for Alan Bates's Gabriel Oak the whole time. I did not like Sgt Troy, a part played by Terence Stamp skillfully. One is not supposed to like him. He preens and prances throughout the film trying to get Bathsheba, even though he is in love (and trouble) with someone else. Farmer Boldwood does not fare very well, and his sad obsession with Bathsheba is heartrending.The scenery is spectacular, and the photography superb. Any Hardy fans should be well served, and it is a great film to watch again and again; particularly on a long, cold winter's evening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Far from the Madding Crowd 1967 - Julie, Julie, Julie.","review":"I have always been in love with Julie Christie. From Darling, Doctor Zhivago, Fahrenheit 451, McCabe and Mrs. Miller, Nashville, Shampoo etc. etc. all the way to the \\"shoulda-won-the-Oscar\\" gut-wrenching Away From Her. She is many, many adjectives (but always, at least, Luminous, Vulnerable, Edgy). She is all that and more here, surrounded by Terence Stamp, Peter Finch, Alan Bates and a bad, bad, bad Border Collie in this exquisite picture. Sure, Julie has her hands full but she also has her wits about her... she gets through.

As I recall, this film was not a box-officesuccess, despite the stellar cast. And since I have had this day's review-ing, I can see why. I kept thinking, Why is she attracted to that jackass of a sargeant?Why aren't the guys running out of the barn to rescue the hayricks, I mean, they are farmers first, partiers second. I can honestly say it bored me to death, andI was very glad to have to run an errand, and stop watching this BORING film!Buy it ONLY if you are A Hardy enthusiast, but otherwise, rent, or wait for TCM torun it again. I certainly would NOT waste the dineros to buy it!Sad to say, I give it a thumbs down. Gorgeous photoplay, but material bored thepants off me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic!","review":"Far from the Madding CrowdQuite underestimated at the time of its release, \\"Far from the Madding Crowd\\" has become a classic love story with a spectacular cast: Peter Finch, Terence Stamp and Alan Bates fall for the independent but passionate character that Julie Christe plays to be caught in a web of love going to the wrong person. A great novel by Thomas Hardy found its grand translation to cinema. A must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Far from what you'd expect....Brilliant film!","review":"This is perhaps one of the most underrated films of the century! I had little idea I was in for such a treat, thinking rather I might be in store for three hours of feigned Victorian probity and thoughtless inattention to one of Hardy's greatest works.Cinematic, bold, expressive, cohesive...are just a few of the adjectives you could easily heap on this 1967 masterpiece. It's a terrible shame the career-high performances of nearly the entire cast weren't appreciated by a wider audience. But, as several reviewers have rightly noted, the film was released at perhaps the most inopportune moment of the decade. One could also conclude that a film already great in length could not be helped (at least among the greater movie-goers of the day) with two interminably long overtures. Luckily, I had the convenience of the fast-forward button!"},{"rating":"2","title":"UNGUARDED - Amy Grant in a different perspective","review":"When UNGUARDED came out in 1985, it defenitely showed a different side to Amy. Many people were used to the praise & worship, I'd do anything for God because He rules type. \\"El Shaddai\\" and \\"Sing Your Praise To The Lord\\" were classic Amy hits. But coming from all the way from \\"Father's Eyes\\" to \\"Find A Way\\" must've took some thought and understanding. Right? I'd still recommend this CD to anyone who wants to buy it. All that matters is that it's not mainstream rock, it's Christian Rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like her other album better (MY Father's Eyes)","review":"This CD is okay, and the first 2 songs are good. But I really haven't listened to the album too many times. Since I am not familiar with the other songs, I get impatient, pull it out of the player, and put in \\"My Father's Eyes\\". I haven't given it a chance, and I would probably like it more if I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really is Unguarded!","review":"This is my absolutly favorite album!!! The first 10 seconds of this CD say that this isn't a praise & worship album! It's a totally Christian Rock album. \\"Love Of Another Kind\\" is my fave Amy song ever.

Page after page this book was loaded with errors that even the casual Motown fan can find. If you don't know anything about Motown, I can see how someone would enjoy it, but why learn about a company with wrong information?I would recommend the books by Berry Gordy (founder), Mary Wilson (Supreme), Martha Reeves (Vandellas), Jack Ashford (Funk Brothers), Diana Ross, Smokey Robinson, Peter Rivera (Rare Earth), and others first. This is where much of Mr. Posner gets his information from, before he confused many of the facts."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED this book!","review":"I am a longtime Motown fan and just adored this book because it pulled together so many different stories and brought back tons of memories, some great, and some not so great, about what had happened to my favorite label! This is the perfect book for someone who isn't that familiar with Motown, as it sets out the whole exciting story of the label and all our favorite singers, and for those of us who do know it better, it still is filled with some great new anecdotes. I read this book in two nights and was sorry it ended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Waste Of Your Money","review":"Posner's book is nothing more than rehashed stories and urban myths. When it comes to the music, he more often than not, gets it all wrong. This book is full of mistakes regarding when songs were released, who recorded them first, on and on and on...As bad as Tony Turner's book was, I'd recommend it any day over this trash. Hardly any of the label's singers appear to be happy about ever having recorded there. Diana Ross once again gets kicked around and blamed for everyone's lack of sustained sales and stardom. Big surprise there. And his recent appearance on the E! True Hollywood Story about Diana Ross - what happened, they couldn't get Mary Wilson to talk about how evil Ross is, so they carted out Mr. Posner who's never even met her?

For a general review, I'd give it a \\"ho-hum.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Off The Charts","review":"The genuine interesting story of Motown should be dedicated to the amazing catalogue of hit songs. Where this book falls off the charts for me is all the stuff about personal lives that adds nothing but sensationalism about world-famous people. Do we really need to know who screwed (in the real sense or otherwise) whom? It reads like one of TV's \\"inside reporting\\" jobs on celebrities, and maybe that's the wide audience the writer is trying to tap into. Motown was about the music. That, however, is just the starting platform of this book and quickly left behind. For me, the rest of the data is a Big Who Cares?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please look for a better book","review":"I have read this book and it is a waste of time. I found that Mr Posner does not have a clue about the people that he is writing about. He is using well known facts from other books and making it seem like he is giving us something new. Nothing in the book is fresh, so go to other sources to find out the information. In fact, I just saw him on the E online special about Diana Ross, talking as if he were an expert, but he has never interviewed any of the major players (Diana, Berry, Smokey etc.), so how is he an expert. If this were the case, I could write a book and make it seem like I know these people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Berry Gordy's To Be Loved instead","review":"I was doing some research on Motown and so read a few books on the company. Posner's book is almost a direct copy of Berry's. In fact after reading Borry Gordy's To Be Loved, Marvin Gaye's biography Divided Soul, and Motown's Golden years by Bill Dahl, I didn't learn a thing from Posner's Motown: Music, Sex, blah, blah blah.

He's criminally underrated, this isn't his best album. I can safely say it nowhere near touches Soul On Ice, but, that album came out ages ago. It's a new day, and for 2005 standards Ras is KILLING IT still! The beats are lovely, the personal tracks are a refreshing change. Welcome Home & Unconditional Love are really mellow and show a more sensitive side of Ras. Mystic sounds especially buttery singing on the latter, makes me wonder where the hell she's been hiding. Sensitive songs aside, Ras still spits pure fire. These songs may not be his best work, but lyrically he is still top 5, I don't care what anyone says. There are too many sick lines to even try and quote them. If you know Ras you don't need any samples to understand, and if you're a new jack.

They really are a great pair of headphones, especially for the price, probably the best you can find.As far as the fit, my head is huge and they fit me great, and I'm sure if you have a normal head they fit even better. They are very comfortable, and fit well over my large ears as well. The only downside is the extra-long cord length, but that can be solved with a rubber band. Also, these look pretty unique, and they appear quite big and clunky, so they definitely aren't particularly discrete. Basically, you will look pretty silly walking down the street in these, but there's nothing wrong with that."},{"rating":"2","title":"HD 485","review":"Excellent for small device sound reproduction.

These Headphones connected to any decice, TV, PC, etc... can give a detailed sound rich with Bass & Treble without the need for a preamp to boost them, you won't regret buying a pair of these"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not perfect...","review":"These headphones are pretty well built and the reason I give it 4 stars as there is hardly too much of a difference in sound quality between these and the cheaper PX-100's. The highs arent as airy and open as the lower end Grados I tried though the bass was much better. The supplied hook to park your headphones when not in use is good too. So my hunt for the perfect headphones in this price range continues..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too easily overdriven, not enough bass","review":"The first time I used these headphones I overdrove them, trying to get a satisfying amount of bass out of them. I overdrove them with a yamaha 50 watt/channel reciever via the headphone jack - with minor clipping only, no major distortion. They now crackle louder than my popcorn maker (the microwave oven) even when driven with my computer soundcard. They are great if you love the \\"treble control\\" at or near max. I know I should have purchased a studio monitor set of 'phones now. The SPL of these 'phones is great if you are driving them with a mp3/portable CD they may be fine. My 1981 set of Koss headphones ($24.95 at the time)are far superior. I have yet to obtain warranty coverage - and would advise anyone thinking of buying these that enjoy ANY music with a decent amount of bass, including classical music with demanding passages, avoid these headphones. 0 stars in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taken back to the store","review":"The music sounded distant, like there was something between my ear and the music, as if I was listening to music with my ear to a door. It was just too irritating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vastly disappointing","review":"I had heard mixed reviews about this author, mostly negative, but I don't like to pass judgment until I have read an author's work. Suffice to say, I could only force myself to read about twelve chapters (and I do mean force) before I couldn't take anymore. The characters were confusing and not at all interesting. Nor did the title live up to the book. There was nothing pleasurable about the story or the hero and heroine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to snuff","review":"I has looked forward to this book since reading the author's previous two books. I knew she was revisiting with characters introduced in the previous novels. However, I was very disappointed in this book.The story was never on the same level as the first two. The medical premise of the story was weak and a bit contrived, especially the \\"Cure\\" and the life and death struggle at the end. The humor was weak and uneven. Overall not the quality I had anticipated."},{"rating":"2","title":"DELIGHTFUL!","review":"Am definitely keeping this book & will read it again. Was laughing out loud (LOL) at the first \\"tea\\" and the events that took place. Excellent dialog, very subtle, dry humor at times along with slapstick comedy. Very sexy romances & the people are truly endearing. Actually was quite a page turner for me, started it at night & stayed up for hours reading it! What a treasure of a book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great.","review":"I liked it. Very good, but not off the charts . Not much more to say, so won't say more."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enchanting Pleasure to Read","review":"I don't have a lot of words like a lot of other reviewers but I do have to say that this was a totally enjoyable read.If you like to read for fun then this is a good book for you. Quite often I find myself skimming through the middle of books. You read the first chapters to get into the book, you read the last chapters to get to the good stuff and then in the middle you have to sort of skim.I didn't do any skimming in this book. I loved the heroine's quirkiness, with her hair always falling out of its bun. I loved the hero Quill who had problems with his \\"performance\\". They two were made for each other.The story never once bored me. I loved it.This is my first \\"Eloisa James\\" book, I'm going to look for some more."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enjoyable Read","review":"I really liked this book. I thought that Quill was sexy and remote but still sensual with a good sense of humor. Gabby could slip into some silliness, case in point her ability to fall inlove with anyone, but overall was a likeable heroine.The two best things in the book were the fun use of Shakespeare (I pine, I burn, I perish), and Gabbys voluptuous figure. I also appreciated that she was not the most graceful creature on the planet.Sexy and fun"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spooky Good","review":"I borrowed this movie from the library, thinking that I wouldn't like it much and saved it for last. I was pleasantly surprised. This movie was really fun. The first scene takes place in a graveyard where the book is found by a group of highschool misfits, setting the dark tone for the movie. From there, the book calls to certain students and brings out their dark sides. I really enjoyed the storyline and I was surprised to find that the acting was really good! Sometimes made for TV movies can have some pretty lame acting. There is some gore, but it's not over-the-top disgusting. This is not a slasher movie, but rather a good telling of a sinister story. I hope this review helps. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably 3 1/2 stars","review":"If you are looking at this title then you must be a fan of old chop-sockey films? If so this is a very fun and entertaining one. It isn't from the legendary Shaw Brothers, but the same era and genre. H.L. Pao was an independent director who put out a few good films,The story: Hidden somewhere in an old house lies the treasure of a secret society. The last surviving member of the society decides that the treasure is rightfully his. But a group of soldiers also know of and want the treasure. Both parties fight to the death for the gold.If you like this genre you should add this to your collection. However I wouldn't put this on as an introduction to Shaw Brother's era kung fu flicks for a first timer. The usually cheesy plot holes and over-all surreal nature of these films is hightened here. The dubbing isn't to bad 7 out of 10 and the picture quality is above average 8 out of 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Um CD bom de se ouvir","review":"Este cd i legal de se ouvir.

I saw this book on the E Channel during a show about Gilligan's Island and decided to read it. A brain tumor changed my mother-in-law into a completely different person. I wished I'd had Henny's book a long time ago. She offers practical advice for not only the caretaker (which I expected from the title) but also for the patient. A must-read if you're going through this, or knows someone who is. Thank you, Henny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heart warming but not realistic.","review":"I thought Care for the Caretaker was more about care for the patient. I was hoping to read more about her frustrations and fears and how she handled them. As a young partner of a young Parkinson's patient I also found the book unrealistic. I cannot stay home and read to my partner or do exercises with him. What Henny was able to do for Jim is very touching and wonderful.

Her candid recollections of her private life with Steve McQueen is heart-rendering and courageous as it is honest. This is no sugar-coated book. Adams reveals her own short comings, as well as her suffering as a result of Steve's childhood trauma and it's life-long effects throughout adulthood with his destructive behavior. I write this as a huge fan of Steve McQueen and with the greatest of respect. The book is very well written and is frankly, hard to put down. Anyone who has suffered multiple losses will relate to Adams and hopefully be inspired that she is a survivor who continues to record as a singer to this day. A \\"must read\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Painfully honest about a super cool man yet a horrible husband","review":"I have always been a fan of Steve Mcqueen ever since I can remember. I always had a certain image of my idols and unfourtunately once you read about them and how they were as parents and partners or as a human being then it shatters that image not that I only like bad boys. I am glad I read this book because it just shows you bad is cool and to be honest its probably more interesting reading about what they did, in Steve Mcqueen's case sleeping with whomever came to him while married telling his wife that he only loves her and just F**** the others, how understanding of her to stay with him as long as she did.She writes very honestly and I enjoyed the book alot, I had heard things about this cool man but to read it first hand from his first wife and certain details it was a surprize."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollow Sound, not enough bass","review":"I ordered the HD215 for DJing on a vinyl mixing console but was disappointed with the lack of bass response and overall bulkiness, though I was willing to let the latter pass for a good pair of DJ headphones.

The mid-range (vocals, etc) sounds excellent, the highs are a tad bright, and the bass response is non-existent. If you listen to rock, dance, hip-hop (basically, any type of music with pronounced bass), you will hate these phones.On the plus side, I guess they are comfortable. Sennheiser should take the headband from these and use it to replace the horrible headband on the 280 Pros, which sound great but are horribly uncomfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Early Father's Day Gift gone bust","review":"I am not an audiophile by any means, and was searching for higher end headphones for my husband who is.

Not sure whether or not they might be busted, but for the price tag there is no doubt they are being returned ASAP.Baffled by the more positive responses here, and I wish my review could be more technical, but there it is.

Unfortunately, as far as actual trading strategies are concerned, it is a complete failure. It will tell you in which areas a fund is active, but give you excactly zero detail about the strategies and tactics used by its managers. Even some rather bad books I have read at least contained one or two ideas that were worth investigating, but I couldn't gain anything at all from this book.

Her writing style is boring and usually outsourced to employees and there's nothing in it that you can't find in a thousand other news services.This book might have some of the same \\"virtues\\" were it not also hopelessly out of date. Most of these \\"superstars\\" are out of the investment business and a couple of them are in jail for ponzi schemes. THat might provide a little ironic shaudenfreud but it really doesn't.

I read through this whole book, and I am going to incorporate the principles into my preparation. It is all a head game, I am understanding. The author gets you to examine your thought patterns and self talk. Also, the book has you list the things you do well so you have those in your arsenal for performing. It is going to take time, but if I'm consistent, the results will pay off.The book is written from the perspective of classical or opera singers and theatre performers, so there is some lingo you might not recognize if you are not from that genre.

Rodrigo was blind and had a love affair with the Concerto form, and this is Batiz's dedication to the man and his many works in that form.I too disagree with the reviewer who said the recording was muddy.

It is sad to see what passes for gay literature these days. Save your money. This is one piece of pulpy fiction without much in the way of redeeming value. The sex scenes are not even gratifying.

I don't know how women can take out mascara with this product without irritation, but what I am sure to say... is that the make up easily goes off with a Chubs or a face little cloth, not with cotton balls.I bought this product again (the little jar) to try it... because I have used Estee L., Elizabeth A., Clinique, and other make up removers and all give me irritation."},{"rating":"2","title":"diaper rash","review":"Not only is this a great product for your skin, but also for children's skin!

I attempted to wash my hands and the water just beaded up and rolled off the skin. It leaves the skin looking and feeling greasy because it's literally coated with petroleum jelly.

Plus, it is soothing and does not irritate the face. Nostalgic, yes, and sort of floral but probably better smelling than some of the expensive items which stink so bad after a few hours you just want to wash it off.

The smell is sooooo strong and it does not subside for hours; in fact it seems to get stronger. This might be a good thing if you like the scent, unfortunately I cannot stand it. Its like a full frontal attack on my nostrils. To be fair, my husband loves this stuff (for this I give it one star). After reading the other reviews about how it makes you feel like a man, now I understand why. But all these guys should take up boxing or something; there has to be a better way. I actually got into a fight with my husband about him refusing to stop using this product. Bottom line, if you want to smell very strongly of old man, go for it. Otherwise, for the love of God, please choose something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase","review":"Great product! I use it both as a facial cleanser and also as a workout product.

I eliminate a lot of liquid that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only one of the best makeup removers on the market","review":"Stage makeup and body paint are both part of my craft and easily wiped away with Albolene. It is equally effective removing everyday makeup. Over time I have even noticed that the skin around my eyes and mouth has remained soft and smooth because of the mineral oil ingredient. I often leave a dab on my lips before going to bed at night to keep them moisturized.Albolene is reasonably priced for the effectiveness and quantity which lasts a couple of months at least with daily use. There are no perfumes or ingredients that would irritate most sensitive skin (like mine) and the moisture properties are a great bonus. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another solid entry in this series","review":"I haven't read this series in order (read #1 & #2 and then skipped around) and this book seems to fall somewhere midway through the series. Despite that I'm wasn't too terribly confused. Eve Dallas is a police officer somewhere in the future where things aren't all that different from today. She is beautiful but very haunted, still somewhat emotionally stunted and married to a hunky rich guy named Rourke. In this story she is investigating a case where a family man has been horribly dismembered and the killer seems to be playing a game and leaving Eve clues. After digging around a little Eve realizes the victim has ties to her husband (who has a shady past). More people, all tied to Rourke, are murdered, secrets are revealed, McNab makes his first appearance and we learn more about Rourke's past. A solid entry in this reliable series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eve was too one-dimensional in this book","review":"I really liked the plot, even if it was a bit easy to figure the development. In this book I got annoyed with Eve. She seemed very narrow minded, more than usual. I think I'm getting a bit tired of all her stubbornness, it's like everything always revolves around her. In her fights with Roarke, especially the first, I think she crossed the line repeatedly. That man is a saint.I loved the Irish part of the story and especially it was great to learn about Roarke's past and see the humanity of him. I hope that the author in the following books will show a touch of humanity in Eve's too, because I think that to reduce her to her troubled past means doing a disservice to the character and to the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story!","review":"I liked this book because I just generally like J.D.

Anyway, I highly recommend the book and can't wait to read another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vengeance","review":"This book is well written. I do not enjoy reviews that give too much of the storyline away, suffice I should say this book does not let me down from the previous Lieutenant Eve Dallas series. However, it will stand-alone, you do not have to read any other book in this series to know what is going on with it. I would not spoil it for you if I were to tell you that the murders start off extremely grisly and get very personal to the investigator. You gotta' love this book because, Lt. Eve will not stop until the killer is found. The suspense kept me going till the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good In Death book","review":"What can I really say beyond that this fits into an \\"In Death\\" fan's expectations. It's enjoyable as it really expands on Summerset's character, and you learn a bit more of Roarke's past, but other than that it is pretty much a run of the mill In Death book. It's nothing truly special, but it's an enjoyable weekend read - the mystery itself isn't overly complicated, and you know the motive, if not the exact perpetrator, early on, so there isn't a huge amount of suspense. It's a good read though, I'd recommend to any fan of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wickedly Good!","review":"This series is additive! This is the third time I've read Vengeance and I still love it.The plot is intriguing, and laced with religious vengeance. As with other J.D. Robb books, the suspense and conflict are first rate. And, the romance/sex is hot. Jeez, as women all of us would flutter and possibly faint if Roarke turned his considerable charm on us.If you haven't read the 'in Death' series, you're denying yourself hours of entertainment and enjoyment. Take the advice I was given, though, and read them in order so you meet the main characters as they come into play and develop into first rate characters.Thank you Ms. Robb!Shelley Dawn, author ofSweet, Sweet JessieandDark Nights"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great as usual","review":"Has everything.

It's like a mix between the Bad News Bears and The Karate Kid. You must see the obese bad guy, the resurrected Bruce Lee (played by a white guy, I think).

Anyway, as I get older, I wouldn't trade my original copy of this movie with my kids remakes for anything in the world. To this day, we take this stuff out and watch it every Christmas.

As I read the excellently written tale I had this image of a beautiful woman in the right place at the right time. I was right. Unless your very attractive to get everyone helping you and it's the 90's when CPA's didn't have their own bookkeeping businesses and payroll companies also had no interest in bookkeeping, today is a different story.

I am so glad they did, because this book is so helpful. I have read many, many books to teach you this or help you get started at that, and they are usually so general and vaque that they don't really offer much in terms of real world applications. With this book, you could get started tomorrow (assuming you know bookkeeping, of course). It is honest and chock full of really great ideas and advice. I can't believe she is sharing this with all of us- it feels like talking to a good friend who is willing to tell you all the advantages and pitfalls of her line of work. It is not written as an inspirational book but it ends up being one because it really makes it clear that this dream of owning your own business and being successful can become a reality- at least if you follow the great advice in this book.

Most of the studies cited and approaches used have all been questioned scientifically in the past, there is reasonable doubt for me at least that this book contains any truth and merely moulds societies present gender structure views in a way that is hard to disprove, something any first year Psych student will know is true of socio-biology and evolution theories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, Right.","review":"After reading this, read Angier's \\"Woman\\" to find the real biological nature of women.To quote Barbara Ehrenreich, \\"Basing your answer on the [sexual] behavior of women in recent times is a little like studying giraffes in a zoo and concluding they can't run.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Edgy?

This film is one of the few I've watched that was disappointing.The main character goes to a beach house alone for vacation. She meets the various neighbors and voyueristically watches them.

Even if you already know her story, you will still probably enjoy it as I did. I especially liked the French accents and the way they refer to her as she was called in her native tongue: Jehanne. They also did a good job in choosing an actress that fits the historical descriptions of Saint Joan. Most importantly, unlike so many modern books and films, this one does not try to explain her life apart from God and her supernatural Voices.

Morality is not the sort of topic where one expects to the THE answer. However, I do require a speaker/writer to at least propose their answers, so I may compare and contrast them to my own views.I recommend this book if you prefer an open-ended discussion with no suggested or implied solutions.For new managers with their first inkling they might have a few misconceptions about what they've just gotten into, I recommend \\"Becoming a Manger: How New Managers Master the Challenges of Leadership\\" by Linda Hill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can be tough to get by with at times","review":"This book is a good start for linear algebra; it touches upon the basics at first to make sure you have the required skills before moving onwards.

Sadly Kylie has distanced herself from IMPOSSIBLE PRINCESS, her 1997 album that was never really fully realized in my opinion, as the great album it is. As a result of her dismissal of that album, this is likely one of the last times you will hear these songs live, from that album. She sings favorites from the album such as \\"Some Kind of Bliss\\", \\"Breathe\\", \\"Did It Again\\", \\"Drunk\\", \\"Limbo\\", \\"Too Far\\", \\"Breathe\\", \\"Say Hey\\" and \\"Cowboy Style\\". She also sings from her back catalog, songs like \\"Locomotion\\", \\"Confide In Me\\", \\"I Should Be So Lucky\\", \\"Better The Devin You Know\\" and more.

A devout Catholic, Messiaen was purportedly commited to preservation of medieval sacred music -- which led me to pick up this album -- and yet all I find is that composed some of the most minimalistic modern 'music' that I've ever heard. According to musical theorists, there is a beauty in the mathematical algorithms that he exercises on his keyboard, but in no way does that beauty extend into a melodic piece. This is not sacred gregorianesque music, this is not heavenly plainsong, this is not glorious baroque. If Messiaen truly did intend this to be sacred music, all I can say is that he and I genuflect in different ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"it is the best and so ain't amy grant","review":"i liked amy grant for a while and i jus tlike to say that this compellationkills all others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing a few hits but still a good album","review":"I have been a Amy Grant Fan ever since I saw her singing baby baby on a Disney special.

The length is perfect for kayaks, and you can connect two straps together to get a longer strap if needed. I transported a Queen size mattress and box spring on top of my SUV and used these straps, connected together.

I didn't like the hero when he was in Libby's London Merchant, and my feelings didn't change. I couldn't get a good feeling for why he and the heroine fell in love. The thing I disliked most was the graphic description of the rape and ultimate murder of the heroine's sister. I don't think I am particularly squeamish, and I can handle Kelly's descriptions of war-time trauma, but after I read about the assault, it kept haunting me. I think it would have been sufficient to leave more up to imagination. As it was, it was very disturbing.

In North America alone, there are millions of practicing pagans. Our beliefs are of no less value than any other religion. I'm sirprised that Wicca isn't even covered in these books; as Wicca is officially a santified religion in the United States.Paganism is an Earth-centered spirituality and focuses on love and reverence for All Life and our Mother Earth. It deserves recognition. How will my children feel, as we read through books on religions of the world, when even the most obscure religions are covered, but not their own?I don't care what religion you follow or what preconceptions/misconceptions you have about paganism.

A remake of about a hundred other films. The ensemble cast is smart and fun but with little to show for their good efforts because the direction is insipid and the script is a dead-end street. So what is the one and only one reason? Penelope Ann Miller. Yes, she's been in her share of bad films. But she has yet to give a bad performance and this film is no exception.

I absolutely, positively, unequivocally and without reservation 100% guarantee that the one I got does not and will not swivel. It cannot. It was not designed to swivel.

I would consider it to be mostly grunge with some indie rock tendencies.Both singer-guitarists Jerry DiRenzo and Ian James are full of angst and emotion, and when combined with the hard hitting, pulsating rhythms of drummer Keith Nealy and the creative, raw bass lines of Dave Motamed, the band delivers one kick-ass record!If you're a fan of grunge or alternative rock in general, then this album is for you.

They are just a little more frightening than Beck's, but still aren't very scary.

The Berlin Philharmonic, as usual, plays exquisitely well under Tennstedt's direction. There are other recordings of Wagner pieces out there that are equally as good as this, but this recording is the one that I would recommend the most. The performance of \\"Entrance of the Gods into Valhalla\\" is especially earth-shattering, while the Act I prelude to Lohengrin is absolute musical beauty at its best. If you're a Wagner lover or are just being introduced to his great music, this recording is definitely worth listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"unreliable","review":"This item did not reliably wake me up.

Rudy had a lot more from where these tracks came from. They need to release some of his other material on compact disc far as his individual albums go.

I still like it though. Good mix up beat rocking tunes and mellow tunes that will reach your heart. Lyrics are a creative yet clear in what they are trying to communicate. The title track, is power rocker with an 80's sound, but you can hear the 70's power ballad influences in it. If you are a Whiteheart fan, this is a must have CD.

The story line was very intriging in addition to thecreative narration style. However in terms of being able to relate to specific charaters, the book was very much lacking. This may however have to do with the time period Mary Shelley wrote the book in, as a work of romantism it is very good. I expected the book to be heavily feminist but i found myself pleasntly surprised that it wasn't overly feministic. I didn't expec great things more the book and didn't get anything spectacular.

But that silly and obvious ending with those cheap CGI...why, why?! I just don't get how a talented director like the De Palma did not object to that childish/ET and unoriginal ending that instead of awe it leaves you embarassed. Shame on Hollywood, that had two shots at the martian exploration theme (Red Planet, another waste, perhaps slightly better than this), and none of them delivered.Review update: the 'Face of Mars', even BEFORE this movie was made, everyone knows that is just a big hill; the 'Face' was seen only because low picture resolution with 70s technology and the shadows created with sun lighting at a certain martian hour. That killed the movie for me. And this movie pretends to be serious sci-fi? Go and read some past century news you movie story writers..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uggh!","review":"Ughh! I feel sorry for all of the amazing talent involved in this film. Every one of the actors, the director & composer are capable of solid work and it does not show one bit. It painful to watch as cliche after cliche is SLOWLY marched before you to wonder over. There are so many holes in this story's logic. The main violation is the script, but I feel the direction for this was just off as well. Disney's ridiculous RocketMan, about a trip to Mars, is a much better film (and that's as silly as a film can get)."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS is not an action movie","review":"M2M is the most disappointing movie I have ever seen. The screenplay is horrible. The special effects were very good but even that was ruined by lack of music during the action sequences. The ending was stupid too.

The only thing this movie has to offer is the part where one of the astronauts gets twisted into pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gaggingly awful","review":"Truly this must be a contender for one of the worst films of all time. I've seen it 3 times, and I still can't believe how unbelievably horrible it is. I won't dignify the film by attempting to summarize it again - others have done this well enough already. What astonishes me is how some people actually give this disaster 4 or 5 stars. I feel it my beholden duty to try and bring down the average. I would give it 0 stars if there was such a category but there isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not purchase this film unless you enjoy throwing away $$$","review":"This \\"film\\" was a waste of resources in Hollywood. Though it had some very nice (ILM generated) special effects, they still could not pull the film out of the 'wish I'd never seen it' category. The first crew had a bad experience and only Don Cheadle (Boogie Nights, Out of Sight) is left marooned on Mars. A rescue team goes up over a year later (if I remember correctly) to try to salvage the mission. Only Gary Sinise (Forrest Gump, Ransom) could unlock the secrets of the Universe with M&M's! With almost a supporting role in the poorly directed film, M&M/MARS (! ) must have really dropped a load of cash to have that happen.

From a high-tech sci-fi standpoint, the movie definitely comes up short but this film is more realistic than say STAR WARS. Ostensibly, something like a mission to Mars could happen in the near future with real people, not aliens from a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. Now, I love Star Wars and have seen all of the series at least twice, but Mission to Mars at least had humans using their brains, brawn and wit to find solutions, not something supernatural. The ending was syrupy but it was still spellbinding to think Earth could have been seeded by the dying denizens of Mars. So what's with my title? You don't see many African-Americans in action or sci-fi films geared toward a white audience. When you do, invariably, they are usually the first to bite the dust. In Mission to Mars, not only does he survive, but get rescued and GOES HOME IN ONE PIECE!

From other great sci-fi movies such as the masterpiece 2001, and its sequel 2010, The Abyss and The Close Encounters.. When I decided to watch this movie I thougth that a scifi movie with great actors (Sinise & Robbins) can't be bad. But it was bad. It had an empty screenplay and stupid scenes & characters such as the histerical housewife astronaut (Connie Nielsen). All the \\"epic clichés\\" were used. Sucks.. I just added 2 stars because of the ILM's and Dream Quest Image's special effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"duuuummmmb","review":"This movie cant decide if it's a horror movie (at the beginning) or a 2001 remake (near the end).

Avoid this movie if you enjoy sci-fi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Science/Fiction!","review":"Chardboard characters, hokey sci/fi elements and laughable dialogue are the only things this film has to offer. And the worse thing is the movie insults the viewer's intelligence. As with all De Palma films this one has a memorable suspense sequence, that is the tornado attack, and that's about as good as it gets, everything goes downhill from there, and that's only 20 min. into the film. With a pace that drags and a plot that we couldn't care less, the film becomes a 'waiting cycle' for the humans to meet the aliens. And not even the ending pays off, with an alien that looks so awful, that we begin to wonder who thought of this. Some amusing elements, such as De Palma's ode to '2001', by choosing the space suits similar to those of that Sci-Fi classic. The cast is also nothing short of boring, but it's not really their fault, they didn't have the right material. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 3!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth adding to you collection","review":"The script could have been better and at times the pace of the movie is slow but overall this is a highly enjoyable sci-fi movie. If your DVD collection includes the Matrix, 13th Floor, Starship Trooper etc. you will want to pick this up. Interesting extras on the DVD and really not as bad as people have made it out to be. Worth the investment for the special effects alone (if you like that kind of thing)."},{"rating":"2","title":"De Palma is at it again","review":"Brian De Palma's newest film also brings new techniques in the field of directing. One of Hollywood's most unique directors, De Palma not only shows us the story but also allows us to experience it. His graceful camera movements simulates wieghtlessness allowing the audience to experience and feel the movie without ever leaving the theatre.

But this movie was just plain awful. It made me wonder if Robbins and Sinise had hit on hard times.It started off feeling like it was going one direction, and then they ran out of time and money, so had to tag on a bad, stock ending with some special effects to keep audiences interested.Character development fell so flat that I was not even phased when, for no particularly good reason, one of the main characters dies in front of his wife!

It's not that \\"Mission to Mars\\" is badly plotted, it's just that the plot doesn't become clear until ten minutes before the movie ends! And then we don't care, because we've already turned it off!Made thirty years too late, \\"Mission to Mars\\" is a poor man's \\"2001\\" just go sub Strauss for Van Halen. The actual idea for the film is quite good, but simply mangled in a difficult plot structure, bad script, and lack of purpose.

What a waste of time (should have read the book I had with me). I found the gratuitous advertising by sponsors (Kawasaki on the side of a spacecraft, Dr. Pepper space drinks) to be intrusive. At least on TV I can switch channels if I don't want to see an ad. The dialogue was akin to the worst of the made for TV movies-- simplistic, silly, predictable and full of cliches.

Bad acting, bad plot, bad story, bad ending. Some scenes try to pull on heart-strings, but only end up turning my gut. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad the writers did not crash on Mars","review":"I won't waste my time trashing this movie with a long review. You will have more fun reading all the reviews on this site telling you how stupid it was. Here are some samples: a man lives in a tarp on the surface of Mars, Dr. Pepper is plugged throughout, a face comes to life on the planet, professional astronauts on an urgent rescue mission are more interested in dancing to Van Halen (no wonder they crash the ship)...Dumb plot, dumb action, dumb effects, and I am dumb for having paid to watch it. This is Hollywood at its worst. You will wish the actors had all been taken away by aliens, never to return, after seeing this stupid flick. Get some popcorn, throw this movie in the fire and watch it burn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite as good as Plan 9 From Outer Space","review":"Sadly this movie doesn't qualify in any category, not even \\"worst sci-fi movie of all time.\\" At least Plan 9 contained scenes to make you laugh; this movie just makes you cringe from start to finish. It combines bad plot with wooden dialog, bad acting, tired direction, and an overall story-line that is riddled with cringe-making errors and stupidities. This is the kind of movie stoned teenage drop-outs would make if someone was foolish enough to give them the resources. Even the title is flat. My own party-game (dreamed up in order to survive the movie, which my children wanted to watch until they too gave up in disgust) was to invent better titles referencing older sci-fi classics. My favorite: The Day The Bowel Movement Stood Still. Runner up: Clueless Encounters of the Turd Kind.In short, avoid this movie unless you want to know up-close how it must feel to have an aneurism."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"Worst thing I've seen for a long time. Moronic scenario from beginning to end (that poor I don't remember his name who can't go to Mars because his wife chose the wrong moment to die, and who finishes as the first man transformed into dog-food for martians, ...). No rythm, weak special effects, poor acting, and I don't even remember the music (most probably the same as in every \\"grand spectacle\\" american movie). After seing that yesterday, I had to watch 2001, as a medicine. Very effective !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great actors, bad acting, bad script, BAD, BAD, BAD","review":"Yipes, I feel as thought a part of my life was stolen by this awful film. How can you put so many great actors in a movie and make them look so bad? I dont know. This movie made me want to watch it to the end just to see how bad it was going to be. The metallic \\"alien\\" at the end had me laughing out loud. This could have been a great movie if it was done by a Lucas or a Spielberg, or even myself. To put it harshly I would rather sit through Yentl, Mary Rielly, Ishtar and and a five day insurance seminar than be subjected to this film again. Luckily I never had to pay to see it.

Do NOT under any circumstance agree to buy or see this movie, unless you want to watch simply for the pure enjoyment of ridiculing this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alien Guys with Big Heads","review":"This film is unbelievable. It brings the audience all the way to the end of the film and then the filmmakers really don't have an ending. You essentially get another ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE type ending, which has been used too many times now. After seeing MISSION TO MARS I can now appreciate a film like EVENT HORIZON which chose a graphically violent alternative but dared to be different and challenge the viewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"The special FX didn't make up for the weak storyline and the poor acting. The alien encounter is laughable to say the least. Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A beautiful bad movie","review":"I'd give this movie one star, but it is so nice to look at, that I have to give it two. Rather than reiterate what others have said in their reviews, I'll just offer this piece of advice... Turn down the sound, pop in a nice classical CD and watch the movie starting with the first scene on Mars. This should make the movie watchable. Of particular note is the spacewalk scene which you will really enjoy if you can't hear the dialogue and don't realize how utterly absurd it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood is insulting our intellegence","review":"If you thought that INDEPENDANCE DAY was a serious, dramatic look at a cosmic interaction, then you should buy this movie. If MEN IN BLACK seemed deep and THE PHANTOM MENACE was simply ingenious to you, then this film will make you giddy. By all means, fans of ARMAGEDDON and all those other disasters movies will cheer, and special effects buffs will be just slap-happy, but anyone with a single working brain cell will want to go on a killing spree after having to see any of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a silly movie","review":"Well, this one ranks probably as the worst movie I've seen this year, stupid plot, bad directingt...

They manage to contradict all of Newton's Laws of motion and yet still create a film that is so mind numbingly boring and badly constructed that it defies belief. How a movie like this can get made now is beyond me. It's trash like this that is stopping mankind's real journey to Mars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ed Wood is back!","review":"This movie is really one of a kind. You could almost think this is a tribute to ol' Ed Wood. All SF effects are terribly underdone, badly computer animated or totally cut out of the movie.

The ending of the movie leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth.."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie that 40,000 feet couldn't help...","review":"I saw this movie on a trip to Japan. The batteries in my walkman died and my extra batteries were in my suitcase which was checked. The laptop batteries just died as well, so I had no other choice but to watch this movie. That being said, I would have rather poked my out with a hot poker than watch this movie.It starts out with the astronaut cliches that were done much better on The Right Stuff and then there was the requisite accident and Tim Robbins waving and saying, \\"No, no please don't rescue me. I want out of this movie now.\\". Then there were the other scenes and a scene reminiscent of the scene from 2001, but not as good.One would think that a movie with Tim Robbins and Gary Sinise couldn't be bad, but man....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid","review":"The movie was absolutely mind-numbing torture. Not only was the dialogue contrived, but the movie lacked suspense (mostly I think due to the cheese organ music that almost put me to sleep...not even 50's sci-fi movies have music that bad). It also lacked intelligence, dimensionality, and well anything else you can think of going bad in a movie. I must say I was surprised that a movie could be so bad in this era, but then again, it *is* a mainstream movie. No one said Kubric owned the license on \\"serious\\" space movies but unlike the DMV, they should be more selective who they give licenses to."},{"rating":"1","title":"quite simply, the worst film i have ever seen.","review":"i will make it as clear as possible. If you have 25 dollars to spend, you'd be better off paying someone to kick you in the face. throughout the film, there were moments when i questioned my own existence, wondering how i could be genetically connected to the makers of this film, the most uncreative morons God ever created. If i have saved one person from buying this movie, i will have insured a safe place in heaven. If you want a real compelling sci-fi movie, get 2001."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in Cliche","review":"It's really a shame that this movie, which, given the talent pool, might have been good, disappoints. We don't yet have a good manned-mission-to-Mars movie, and it would be good to have one, since the possibility we'll eventually have such a mission is still there. I think the movie has some bright spots: Gary Sinese is good and the whole middle sequence involving the rescue mission--in between Earth and Mars--is actually exciting and well-executed. There bright spots, and the movie probably does not deserve the horrendous reviews. And, it is nowhere near so-bad-it's-good territory, but it certainly fails. It is just so hopelessly derivative. The dialogue cliches are painful but, more importantly, we have such a clear amalgam of aspects of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Close Encounters, and The Abyss, that the movie comes off as having no fresh ideas. You just hate to see talent like this wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Loved The Ending","review":"I loved the ending of Mission to Mars so that I could break the DVD in half. I do not think I have seen such a slow-moving and boring movie in my life.Gary Sinise and Tim Robbins should have their SAG cards ripped away from them for starring in this piece of tripe.Bad dialogue, bad cinematography, extremely slow moving plot and over acting make this definately one of the all time worst movies EVER."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was not released, it escaped","review":"One of the worst movies of all time. Bad script, bad dialogue, bad acting. The only thing good was \\"the end\\"-no more suffering."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Waste of Time","review":"I thought that this was going to be one of the best movies that I had seen in a long time. With talent like Tim Robbins, Gary Sinise, and Brian De Palma, you couldn't think that things could go so wrong. What there was in the special effects department were done well, but other than that I absolutely hated this movie. The story was so choppy and seemed drawn out. The pivotal and really dramatic scenes were hokey as well. I love De Palma's work. Snake Eyes was at least a well done movie. This on the other hand was a total waste of time and money to even produce such a thing. What were these people thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good grief","review":"Wow, this was a bad movie. I didn't actually think that there could be a sci-fi movie with with such a cool premise that could turn out to be so horrifically bad. Slow from beginning to end, no real character development, and a conclusion that just makes one want to giggle at the absurdity. (Think 2001: A Space Odyssey on a bad drug trip.) If you have the urge to watch a Gary Sinise space movie, watch Apollo 13 again instead. You'll thank yourself for it in the long run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even worse than Red Planet","review":"The best sequence in the movie is the sandstorm. Everything else stunk. It tries to be thrilling by sequences such as the breached hull, but you always feel bored and never excited. The special effects are good up to a point, so why did the alien look less realistic than an episode of Transformers? One to avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTHING HERE","review":"People wanna see masterpieces where there is nothing !! THis MISSION TO MARS is just another bad movie. The only thing that surprised me was Tim Robbins acting on it, he normally doesn't act in bad pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"2001: A Space Odyssey - the complete idiots guide","review":"It's hard for me to watch actors whom I otherwise respect, saddled with such a terrible screenplay. In a general sense, all the elements of \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" are present, repackaged into an ultra-simplified story. The movie takes forever to establish the characters with their attendant humaness and personalities... but the personalities do not play into the story at all; it's just filler. The physics ofweightless vacuum were just plain embarrassing -- giving sciencefiction a black eye. I haven't seen a movie this bad in a very long time. I almost didn't finish watching it.

Mission to Mars is not an action film, it's an event film. The film only gets 4 stars, because the ending is very much like the end of Close Encounters (see MTM, I don't want to give away the story).I cared about the astronauts, Mars seemed real and the craft design was as real as what Kubrick did 30 years before.The realism is like Apollo 13 with a Close Encounters and The Abyss style of ending.Excellent DTS sound on DVD. Bythe way I saw the film in Sony Dynamic Digital and there's only one scene on the Space Station where the camara rotates around all the actors that 8 channels made a difference over 6 channels at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"MISSION TO NOWHERE!....FAST!","review":"This has got to be one of the WORST movies to come out in a long time. I thought when I saw the other Mars movie \\"Red Planet\\" it wouldn't get any worse than that....and it did.The screenplay is amateurish, DePalma has a big budget movie and absolutely fails, yet he only had $300,000 for \\"Halloween\\" and scored big time.The movie goes right to the planet, with no intrigue, tension or adventure.The acting is absolutely weak, Gary Sinise has more eye liner on him then his female counter part, and the special effects are fair to midland.The plot is stupid, (I won't give it away), but they steal from \\"The Abyss\\", \\"2001\\", etc.....and completely fail.An absolute waste of Hollywoods money, how this even got to first stages of being made are beyond my imagination.DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE, DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY, GO OUT WITH YOUR GIRL AND HAVE A CAFE LATTE OR A SUNDAE, AND HAVE SOME HUMAN CONVERSATION."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Abyss Goes to Mars","review":"OK: Start with \\"The Abyss\\". Replace the bottom of the ocean with Mars. Throw in some elements from \\"2001\\" and \\"Close Encounters\\". What you'd end up with would still be better than \\"Mission to Mars\\". To make it as awful, you'd need to make sure that no one associated with the movie knows anything about Newtonian physics or the difference between a base pair and a chromosome.OK, fine. The movie has great visual effects. They obviously spent a lot of money on them. But would it have broken the bank to hire a decent science consultant?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie.....EVER","review":"This movie lacked everything including a story, original special effects, good acting and the ability to keep me awake.

I did not see any strings holding the spaceship up. The only thing that I found negative is the VHS version has 20 plus minutes of commercials on the front end.

I don't know how such a dull movie could attract so many talented actors, (Don Cheadle, Gary Sinise, Tim Robbins and the incandescent Connie Nielson). I suppose on script, the premise is interesting. There is - what looks to be a face on Mars. I wish there was a more fascinating movie that would better imagine the mystery behind the face. But Mission to Mars is full of cliches - 'rescue one our own.' It ends just when things pick up a bit.The first hour of the movie could have just been prefaced in 5 minutes and then there would have been time for more interesting events to take place."},{"rating":"1","title":"To bad the plot was not as good as the effects.","review":"The special effects were out of this world as well as the acting (although Jerry O'Connell did have a little problem with the dramatic crying scene at the end, \\"don't get me wrong, I think he's a sweetheart\\"), it's just too bad there was no plot. This movie, considering it's budget, had great potential, but it was all show and no substance. It FIRST, begins when a space mission to Mars is lost under mysterious circumstances and another team is sent to find out what happend. THEN, (and this is the part I dont \\"get\\") once on the planet the plot 180's into something about aliens and human origin or something like that. It's just such a shame that the script was so shallow.

We almost got thrown out of the theatre.The situations are hokey, and not even sorta real. Anything that aproaches being technically correct, has something that seriously flaws it (like the presurized fabric greenhouse on Mars, that is blowing in the wind). The micro-meteorite hit is always a possibility, but no astronaut in his right mind would try to fix it without putting on a helmet first.The pacing was too slow. Each problem was neatly solved before moving on to the next challenge. With a big long space in between to reflect on what happned.The characters were wooden, and one-dimensional stereotypes. I'm surprised the actors (who I would have thought were mostly big enough not to get cuaght dead in a film this bad) could keep a straight face through the whole thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seeing is believing - it really is a stinker!","review":"After watching this movie, I was compelled to write a review. I found the other reviews quite entertaining to read! I don't understand how anyone could watch this and think it was worthy of even 1 star. It was supposed to be a suspenseful drama about a space mission to Mars set in the future. Instead, it sounds like the first screen test each of these fine actors must have made years ago. The acting is just unbelievably bad. (After the movie, my 6 year old son asked me if the movie was a comedy!!) I suppose everyone should watch the movie and judge for themselves. I just must tell you my favorite part: When the rescue crew gets close to Mars, they get some photos of the surface and are scanning them for signs of life. Jerry O'Connells' character gets very excited because he can only see 3 graves. He takes that to mean the fourth guy survived. If he saw 4 graves, would he have turned around and gone home? Duh, 4 dead guys can't bury themselves!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Science Fiction At Its Worse","review":"This has to be one of the worst sci-fi movie to have been released in the last decade.

Good actors like Tim Robbins, Gary Sinise, Don Cheadle, and Kim Delaney star in this turkey of a spaceship's crew trapped on Mars, so another ship has to go save them. The plot is a recycled cross between Alien and the Abyss, except it is neither scary nor tense nor funny. The actors have to recite the stupidest dialogue imaginable, and even the special effects can't save this. $90 Million ! What a waste !

I suspect this because this DVD is animorphic, so I am just praying to God they don't take advantage of the ability to program a section of an animorphic DVD to prevent skipping AGAIN.

I had pre-ordered this movie after all the hype I had heard about it and I was sadly disappointed after watching it. They seemed to have combined 2001 and the Lost in Space movie story together. Needless to say this did not work well and at the end I felt like I was watching an easy to explain version of 2001. The beauty of 2001 of course was that no explanation was given and the audience was left to figure out the ending on their own which even today viewers have different opinions of what the ending meant. Mission to Mars tried to explain everything so an elementary school child would understand it. I felt insulted by this and therefore I would strongly suggest either renting this DVD or missing it altogether. Get the new 2001 I am sure you will enjoy it more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hokey, pokey","review":"There's two ways to view M2M: either as a serious drama about a rescue mission to Mars; or as a space comedy. The special effects may be excellent, but the plot and acting are dubious. There's no creativity in the story. The opening is a rip-off of Apollo 13, and the talking computer is reminiscent of 2001: Space Odyssey. I was so taken back by how horrible this movie was I almost turned it off midway through. But I couldn't help but find myself laughing out loud. If I were to rate the movie as a drama, I would give it zero stars. If I were to rate it as a comedy, I'd give it about four stars, hence the two star rating I give it overall.

You can't make a movie by scanning the past month of alt.paranet posts.Anyway, Gary Sinise is an incredible actor, but with a bad script and bad acting all around him...well, the effect is comical to say the least.

All I can say is \\"WOW.\\" Hard to believe this was ever really shown in a movie theater.REALLY slow pacing (which actually gets SLOWER as the movie goes on); really poorly written dialogue (full of cliches and \\"captain obvious\\" descriptions of what is going on); very erratic quality of special effects; pretentious/overblown/self-important attitude tacked onto a storyline that could have been written by an 8 year old. And the music. Oh the music. Really bizarre, often inappropriate to the situation.Poor Tim Robbins and Gary Sinise. They are great actors who probably cringe when they see this come on late night t.v.."},{"rating":"1","title":"They seeded us...not","review":"\\"Mission to Mars\\" must be *the* most boring movie ever made. Not even The Face On Mars and a holographic space alien can save it. Even its competitor \\"Red Planet\\" (hardly a five star production) comes across as more of an action thriller compared to this uneventful and far too long mission impossible.Besides, it's just not true that aliens from Elsewhere seeded us. That's one of the Devil's deceptions to keep people from reading their King James Bibles.Kidding...:DWeirdly, I managed to sit out \\"Mission to the Radish Planet\\" twice. I must be possessed or something. If you absolutely must choose between \\"Mission\\" and \\"Red Planet\\", I recommend the latter. Sort of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Competent boredom","review":"The movie starts at a barbeque, which really set my interest down quite a few pegs. Then we go to Mars and experience an accident and some impressive sfx. You think that \\"well, maybe there is something interesting here after all\\". But no, we are quickly transported back to boredom with talk, talk, talk and some astonishingly un-suspenseful suspense. Technical mumbo-jumbo is then turned into new-age mumbo-jumbo as we, together with the wide-eyed crew, experience even more impressive sfx in some supposed \\"profound statement\\". And isn't it strange that the ones that are killed by this alien force and non-americans. Well, to sum it up, don't waste your money on this. You will do better with \\"Event horizon\\". Not that it is a good movie, but at least it's fun sci-fi."},{"rating":"1","title":"It would get better reviews if it were marketed as a comedy","review":"Oh my lord, this movie sucked. The best part was the music - most movies try to create a mood with music - make a love scene more romantic, to add mystery etc - this movie smacks you on the head with its music. It is hard enough to believe in this movie without the over the top music. Unlike other reviewers, I thought the acting was fine, but no acting can overcome such a horrible script.This movie will make you think - about what could have possibly made such good actors agree to make such a cheesy film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than Galaxy Quest","review":"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life. It has absolutely no character development whatsoever and makes no sense. I love sci/fi movies but this one is not worth the time to even think about."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Sucks !","review":"Well just 2 words can describe this movie - it sucks ! The story sucks ! The acting sucks ! And some decent special effects can't save the movie. Wonders why is the movie made in the first place with such a script ! The audience really feels being taken for a ride, believe me. The final was a anti-climax, its not anything we come to expect, it like you would feel \\"hmm just like that ? you mean I sit here for 2 stupid hours just for you to tell me that ? Its not help by some bad acting, cos u can really tell that its \\"acting\\". From the one expression stone face of the guy who lost his wife & the so unreal space couple.

Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie just isn't good.","review":"I'll be brief... I love space stuff, so I had to see this movie. I was very disappointed. You might think it has good acting, but it is surprisingly bad considering the actors involved. There was never much emotion during what would be extremely emotional circumstances. There are also huge technical problems, which make the movie extremely fake. The ending is a bit thought provoking, but it is still weak. What if other Earthlings want to go Home too? Also, I knew the ending was not going to show what Home is like..and it doesn't...which disappointed me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and Entertaining","review":"If you like sci-fi movies, then this is a must see!

Great acting, and even though I won't give away the plot, you will be glad you watched. No, you won't have time to go to the bathroom. You will be stuck to your comfy chair thru the entire movie. Watch it. You won't ever forget the experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finally sat down and watched this....","review":"Granted this is an older movie. But the CGI are horrible even for that period, the science dead wrong even for the data available back then, and the dialogue horrible for any period. Anyone who thought this is some hidden gem needs to spend more time learning science and less time watching lame movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who could have approved this screenplay before production?","review":"I tried my best to enjoy this movie, and to its credit the special effects and cinematography are quite good. However, the dialogue is sophmoric, the characters are written superficially, and the music is terrible. My wife and I began laughing at sections of the film where the characters deliver just plain bad dialogue, or when the music bizarrely rises to a triumphal climax when the characters do mundane actions such as climbing a hill or opening a door. Likewise, the sequencing of scenes with wildly varying emotional tones provides the audience with no sense of continuity (e.g. the bizarre Van Halen dancing scene between 2 other grim scenes)A bare minimum of quality control on the screenplay combined with a new sountrack composer would have gone a long way towards making this an average sci-fi story with a large movie budget."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected better....","review":"I have to say I expected better from Brian De Palma and the cast.In all honesty I found this movie to be a bore. Gary Sinise and Tim Robbins,who are usually wonderful,just seem to be going through the motions. They are acting without life. Don Cheadle and Jerry O'Connell,along with the last 20 minutes or so, are the only good things about this film.I give credit to the premise of this story,but the writing and acting fall short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"It has the stars, Sinise and Robbins and it has great special effects but Mission to Mars does not have the substance to become a great scifi classic. It has no zing, no intrigue and awe like Krubrick's classic 2001:A Space Odyssey. It has the feel that it was slapped together quickly while there was interest in the Mars face. Don't go out of your way to see the movie, it will be on Fox soon. If you want to see a great Tim Robbins movie check out Arlington Road!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MISSION TO TICKET WINDOW FOR REFUND IS MORE LIKE IT","review":"Boy was this movie a letdown...here I am waiting for a spring sci fi flick to hold me off til may..thinking..\\"Hey Gary Sinise and Tim Robbins dont make many bad movies\\"...after this I realized not everyone is perfect....not much really happens in the movie..this movie should have been called road trip..2020. They spend the whole time getting there. They get there and its a big letdown ending. C'mon..--the tear??!!. This could have been so much more"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie no matter what the pessimists say!","review":"I thought that this was a good movie! I know, I know I'm not jumping on the gripe bandwagon like everyone else, but I thought that it was a good family movie that had some very uplifiting moments, as well as some tradgedy to it. This is by no means a Star Wars or an instant classic, but it gives us a chance to show a somewhat believable side to the sci-fi genre, while at the same time showcasing some of Hollywood's top special effects technology. Grab the kids, get some popcorn, and definetely get a big t.v. with a good surround system, cause this one's a keeper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2001: A Space Travesty","review":"Brain DePalma's film about an expedition to the red planet is one of the most staggeringly inept pieces of Hollywood flash-trash ever made. There are good points: the SFX is impressive, and Gary Sinise is his usual commanding self, but the whole thing gets totaly ruined by the Close Encounters rip-off ending. It starts off looking like it's gonna be a cool, action-packed sci fi adventure with all the trademark DePlama camera techs, but then we start to get the warning signs that something is very wrong; the cringe-worthy dialouge (\\"Let's light this candle!\\"), the \\"seen it before\\" action heroics and echoes of 2001 played badly. It had such great potential. But this is awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this serious?","review":"Pathetic, disappointing, and even embarrassing. These are just some of the many negative adjectives that come to mind when critiquing this film. The FX were not bad, but even great computer enhanced images could not make up for an incredibly weak script. I don't know who wrote this painful material, but I believe they are still in grade school. And worse than that, what foolish producer accepted this script as a film-worthy movie anyway? Did he actually think money would be made or an Oscar won with this \\"blockbuster\\"? When I went to see this film in the theatre, I don't think I was ever let down more than when this sorry sack of hot air began rolling. From the beginning interest was quickly lost...The only part even worthy of my interest was the evolution morph at the end of the film. And that part was shown, coincidently, in its entirety on the movie trailer. Do yourself a favor, Do not buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"why de-evolve???","review":"So...the martians escape to earth in pods and become single-celled organisms? Isn't this like having to go through puberty again - on purpose? How believable is that? I feel sorry for the actors who must have been low on cash to take part in this movie. Very slow, not much plot, definitely not worth the money. Just watch the preview or read the back of the dvd case to find out everything you need to know, then go play cards with your kids. Anyone want my copy for free?"},{"rating":"1","title":"not for me","review":"The acting is just okay. The special effects are fine. Much of the story-line is unbelievable. For example, when the hurricane force starts-up on Mars, they just stand there and watch it...that's not normal...at least back away. And when the ship was hit by meteors and they saw all the damage, there would have to be other sensors that tell them the fuel tanks have been hit (it's supposed to be 2020; if they can go to Mars, then they have the technology). Although there isn't much swearing, they do take God's name in vain several times, which is completely unnecessary. And the worst was near the end (at which time I turned it off): They teach people that aliens and evolution populated the earth...both are lies. God created all things, and for His pleasure they are and were created. Only God is worthy to receive glory and honor and power. Revelation 4:11.Here is a much better \\"Mars\\" movie:Red Planet"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Sci-Fi Flick EVER!","review":"Do not for one moment give credence to any review above a one! I just saw this flick on Netflix and wasted nearly 2 hours of my life. Terrible acting, implausible scenarios, and one of the most annoying soundtracks ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops!","review":"OK here's the deal. I bought this movie because I love sci-fi - always have. I expected at least an \\"average\\" sci-fi adventure out of this but ended up with CHEESE. I'm sorry folks but this is one of the cheesiest sci-fi movies I've ever seen. The acting is just BARELY acceptable, the story is about ten minutes long with about an hour and a half of filler. Seriously, no offense to the actors or the seller on Amazon but WOW, what a belly flop."},{"rating":"1","title":"B Grade Acting destroys the World","review":"I recently rented this movie, and couldn't get through more than the first half an hour. It's truly a tragic thing to see such talented actors as Tim Robbins dragged down to the level of Canadian hack Peter Outerbridge (seen here as a Russian astronaut). The film was a huge disappointed, but it was obvious that the actors spent a great deal of time working out and buffing up for their roles. If only as much time had been spent on developing characters. What was DePalma thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Standard SF movie...","review":"This is your standard space travel action movie, filled with the usual cliches, future space technologies and philosophies of the origin / future of mankind.

As for Tim, I've never particularly watched a film featuring him that I didn't like. Brian de Palma is also a great director. But this movie is a shame to the science-fiction genre. The dialogues are so numb, the plot so stupid. For God's sake, the dancing scene in the ship is annoying, forced to the audience, embarassing. A sad experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete disappointment","review":"With the caliber of talent assembled here (Brian De Palma, Gary Sinise, Tim Robbins, Don Cheadle, etc.), one would think that \\"Mission To Mars\\" would be several cuts above your usual space opera. Wrong! With plot twists you can see coming for miles, along with every space/life cliche you can think of (and a few you wish the screenwriters had forgotten), Kraft dialogue--it's the cheesiest!--and a ending that will have you covering your face in embarrassment, \\"Mission\\" makes you wonder just how much money the studio waved in the director's and actors' faces to get them to make this farce. Not even a so-bad-it's-funny movie. You have been warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm... not up to my standards.","review":"I saw mission to mars in the movies and I must say that I really wanted to like this movie. But exiting the movie it just felt as if I just wasted my money seing it. The movie felt as if it was only half finished and not completed yet. Go buy 2001, 2010 instead or perhaps Contact with Jodie Foster wich is a way better film than mission to mars."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie was fantastic!","review":"A clever and complex combined with amazing special effects make this movie a must see!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Something Was Missing","review":"As a lover of science fiction for years, this movie left me a little disappointed. It had the potential to be a spectacular movie, but the lack of imagination from the writer left you with the feeling that something was missing, there should have been more. The talent of the actors was wasted on what could only be called stupid and boring dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one is realy bad","review":"Starting with positiv aspects, the scpecial effects are good (not the makeup) and i laughed a few times (in disbelieve). But now the bad ones: Dull screenplay. There are so many scenes you excpect in this genre and they simply dont show up (rocketlaunches or landings etc.). Dialogs you wont believe. Good actors gone bad. Most of them seem to tell themselves \\"Its only for the money\\" repeatedly throughout the movie. The most stupid looking makeups i've seen so far (just to mention the africanmericans glued beard). Last and the least the embarassing the crying Alien (which looks bad enough without the tears). And all this by a director who nearly made me sleep with Mission Impossible. This isnt bad, its worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm glad I only rented it.","review":"I am a real DVD fan and enjoy a wide variety of videos. I keep my own file of videos so I can rate them for myself. This one I'm afraid didn't make the top of my list. In fact of over 200 videos in my private list this one is third from the bottom. It was so hard to watch I actually fast forwarded through much of it. The direction was the big failure here. I'm sorry for the great actors that had to suffer through having their names associated with this video. Save yourself the trouble and don't even rent it. The dialog is bad.

Perhaps the best recommendation for any book is that I would read a sequel if there were one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"Loved it. No other explanation necessary. I have read the Mercy series as well as Alpha/ Omega, and the rest of the current Mercy's contemporary series and I liked this just as well. It is unusual to find a hero and heroine that are not angst ridden teens or hormone driven twenty- somethings! I loved that Tier had already BEEN through a war and was looking for a home. It is a different place to start a story and I loved it more with every page. Wonderful, and character interaction was good as well. Try this book!

I enjoyed that so much that I had to go back and read this too.Seraph and others like her are Travelers, people with special witch-like abilities to fight evil and darkness. They are hated and feared by the population they protect. However, their ancestors unleashed this problem. So they should and do try to keep it under control.She marries a Solsenti, a \\"regular\\" person who nevertheless has one of the Travelers' abilities. It is Owl, the Bard. Their family gets involved in the worst case of evil unleashed on the land for hundreds of years. No more so that I don't give it away..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"This book is set in a universe filled with magic, where magic is (like Mideaval Europe) mainly mistrusted and magicians often killed by mistrustful villagers. The beginning of the book introduces two main characters (soldier Tier & mage Seraph), neither of whom wants to spend their life doing what their societies think they should. Rejecting what they are supposed to do with their lives, they marry and attempt to spend the rest of their lives as simple farmers. Well, fate has other plans in store.This is an ejoyable book. There is a bit of a glitch (writing wise) in the middle, where the the book changes focus and hops around several new characters' point of view for awhile. Still, the overall book hangs together and the primary characters' plots come to a satisfactory conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Say What?","review":"I must have missed something.

After all who can resist a mystery series in which the main protagonist runs a museum, studies bones and leads caving expeditions?

On top of that, she's worried about the possible upcoming merger of departments at the university; as a non-tenured faculty member, she could be job hunting soon. In the midst of all this, Lindsay's brother shows up unexpectedly with a truck load of her grandfather's leftover property - crates from a shed in his backyard, a shed of which no one was aware. If Lindsay didn't have enough on her plate, they find a skeleton in one of the crates, and then artifacts are discovered to be missing...and Lindsay seems to be the main suspect."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Background Music to a Cult Classic","review":"This DVD, the first of two releases of soundtrack music from the TV series \\"Forever Knight\\", will be a delight to fans of that series and perhaps to others looking for an unusual collection.Composer and performer Fred Molle captured the haunting qualities of \\"Forever Knight\\" in his eclectic mixture of subtle classical music mixed with jazz and even traditional Celtic strains, punctuated by heavy overtone effects that remind the listener of the danger inherent in the plots of the show. Lori Yates provides the soulful vocals for a number of songs captured from various episodes. Nigel Bennett, who played the vampire LaCroix, contributes a selection of voice-overs from his radio talks in the series.

Why isn't Alex Proyas doing the commentary? That's simple too, he wants nothing to do with this box set and Miramax in all their wisdom failed to ask him if he would do it before they sent out the promo material.Now I ask you ... is this box set still worth the price of admission with the hour and a half Crow chronicles missing and the audio commentary by Alex Proyas, the film's director not on here?

It's truly beautiful. The action is also great.

I picked it up on blu-ray wondering if it was great as I'd remembered. It sure is! An incredible, pitch black action film starring the late great Brandon Lee gets a solid blu-ray treatment at a low price. If Brandon Lee had not been tragically killed during the making of the film, The Crow would have propelled him to stardom as great as his father's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't bother with sequels","review":"The sequels ruin this great work; dark, dramatic, and strangely hopeful.

Wile watching this you minght start to feel the pain and heart wrenching sadness Erik Draven (Brandon Lee may he rest in peace)has for the lost of his soon to be wife. After I saw \\"the crow\\" I don't watch other movies in the same state of mind I used to because most of them can't compaire to the unmatchable story line \\"the crow\\" has.This movie is great. It has wonderful action and it's a heart breaking love story at the same time. The ending puts my hairs on end and I have to force back the tears somethimes. A wonderful movie that has made itself quite a strong fan base. So you should just pick this up sit back and be ready to get your Adrenaline flowing and your tears jerked from you eyeballs. Enjoy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is my favorite movie of all time it has a mix of Sadness,action and small,very small bits of comedy.

Just amazing! Not quite reference but the sound...oh boy, for DTS 5.1, it just destroys many others. I highly recommend this purchase! :)On another note (rant), it could've used some updated blu-ray extras, but then again, almost all new blu-rays have the DVD standard def extras on them anyway, which could mean they don't care about extras that much, but it's also because they're now using VC-1 codec and AAC audio that HD-DVD used, instead of MPEG-2 and uncompressed PCM audio, so that's all they can fit on 1 disc. If you remember, there were no extras, period, on earlier blu-rays, unless it appeared on a 2nd disc.

It moves me so deeply.But over all, see this film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brandon Lee's Best","review":"An enduring triumph for Lee, one that underscores the tragedy of his untimely death.

Scenes with dark areas, stood out with clarity, even with scenes that had too much Red satuation were reduce to give a clearer picture.DTS and Dolby Digital 5.1 were a added bonus to a great movie as it was met to be heard.

Brandon Lee (son of martial arts superstar and legend Bruce Lee), plays rock musician \\"ERIC DRAVEN\\" who after a year of his death, rises from the grave to extract revenge on the inner city hoodlums who murdered him and his fiance. It is A REAL SHAME that this film will ALWAYS be remembered NOT for its story content and GREAT PLOT, but as the last film Brandon Lee made in his very short life. Lee was ACCIDENTALLY shot to death during the making of the film, when a mystery man exchanged the dummy rounds in a gun with live ammunition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fitting tribute to the deceased Lee","review":"When I first heard of Brandon Lee's death, I shivered. Father and son both cut down in their physical primes. Then when I heard that his final movie, \\"The Crow\\", was being released without him, I had flashbacks of \\"Game of Death\\", the horrible \\"final\\" movie that was released after Bruce Lee's untimely death in 1973. But when I went to see this movie, I must say I was impressed. The movie itself was beautifully directed,and the acting was above average. But Brandon stands out as Eric Draven,and you can see the vast amount of talent in this young man. I only wonder if that reservoir would have been tapped even further had he lived. this movie was a fitting tribute to Brandon, although seeing him at the brink of superstardom onscreen and knowing that it will never be achieved is a bit depressing"},{"rating":"1","title":"lacking translation","review":"I'll keep this short. A previoulsy viewed video copy is better than this dvd. First off there are absoultely no extras what-so-ever. The laserdisc I have of this film is in THX, and has a interview with Brandon Lee at the end of it. This dvd is in dolby digital, just like that laserdisc, but is missing all of the other cool things. Sorry, but this dvd was a rush job, it is obvious that Disney/Miramax just wanted to get the film out on dvd without putting any real effort into the translation. The picture is far too dark at times and the sound is not as punched up as the laserdisc. This would have been a great dvd if the effort to make it so was there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait","review":"I loved this movie.

The first disc (feature film) freezes the PS3 (black screen only). I had to unplug the power of the PS3. The second disc (special features) loads up and it is poor quality on my HDTV (looks like standard video).I tried disc 1 this time on my PC and it tries to load this old DVD player off the disc.

The story and visuals are paked with emotion. The music is stand alone. Some of the best by NIN, Thrill Kill Kult, STP, Violen Femmes, and the CURE. This movie Changed many lives. Even today I still see people mimicing \\"The Crow\\".However much like Nosferatu or brazil, its birth was amazing, original, and new. Today the film, with the skills of the late 80's, is lacking continuity, general acting abilities, and just plain keeping attention. The ideas are amazing, the script is not. This movie was very important in the 90's. Today it's locked away in the archieves of the past. Showing us once again that nothing will last forever...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lee Shines In \\"The Crow\\"","review":"I'm a late comer to this flick. It flew under my radar despite it's fervent cult following. I'm glad I've finally seen it because it is terrific. My best analogy is it reminds me of \\"Blade Runner\\" crossed with John Woo but director Alex Proyas offers enough original fluorishes that the movie stands on it's own. The action is breakneck and there's a stunning goth look to the whole venture. The selling point is the presence of Brandon Lee who tragically died in an on set accident. Lee distinguishes himself from his father, Bruce Lee, and his work here suggests greater things if he had lived. Not classic stuff but better than average fantasy fare."},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite!!","review":"This movie is one of my all time favorites!!

It has the look of Batman and Batman Returns, and has the feel of all the gothic literature/films that have been seen. Brandon Lee's (sadly) final performance is a treat: he is the one and only \\"Eric Draven\\", and all the others are just copycats of him. Pacing and direction of this film is compelling, while the wicked art direction stands out. Action sequences are a must-see, and the script is purely well-written. ***** out of *****."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent movie","review":"This is a great film despite what some say, and I doubt the fact that Lee died in the making contributed to its success. It was my favorite movie long before I even knew he was killed in it. The music is great, Nine Inch Nails, among others.

Jamal is able to combine seriousness with elegance. He does not flaunt technical skill and focuses on creative melodies. Like Thelonious Monk, he has created his own world and pushes the boundaries of jazz into new territory but unlike the Thelonious Monk, who was very focused on ideas, Jamal retains a clear sense of elegance and grace. The instruments play widely apart from eachother but are clearly tied together without a single note out of place. On songs like Chaperon, Jamal goes solo and beings to sound classical showing once again the incredibly thin lines between jazz and classical music. The percussion section is incredibly rhythmic and acts perfectly as the band's epicenter. In much the same way that the Beatles give credit to Chuck Berry, Miles Davis gives credit to Ahmad Jamal."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Experimental Work!","review":"I tried listening to it several times but could not \\"find a handle on it\\".

We will always be happy, he argued, if we learn to desire that things should be exactly as they are. After attaining his freedom, Epictetus spent his entire career teaching philosophy and advising a daily regimen of self-examination. His pupil Arrianus later collected and published the master's lecture notes; the Enchiridion, or Manual, is a distillation of Epictetus' teachings and an instructional manual for a tranquil life. Full of practical advice, this work offers guidelines for those seeking contentment as well as for those who have already made some progress in that direction.

If you are a perfectly healthy man then there should NOT be any problem. But if you have already got tuberculosis in the past or other bacterial disease then by stopping yourself from ejaculating you are forcing the bacteria from urine to the epididymis which has almost NO blood circulation and consequently NO defence. So if you get a harmless infection on your epididymis after practicing the finger lock, go straight to see your urologist and ask him about genital tuberculosis or syphilis infection.

Take a moment and ask yourself what do you want- health problems or orgasms!In order to use this book you should have an excellent knowledge/experience in Qi Gong, Acupuncture or at least Taoistic Yoga. Otherwise you will play with fire!

Also, though I sympathized with some of the situations the character got herself in, I did not actually like her as a character -- she appeared spoiled, sheltered, and made really terrible mistakes in her life that I expected her to learn from by the end of the book.

Julie Doucet proves herself to have a purely emotional agenda that lacks even the basic notion of rationality and proves just how stupid single-minded and self-righteous intellectuals are capable of being.Good for the laughs at taking things the wrong way and other forms of profound misunderstanding of human motivations.

What an improvement! Installation was fairly easy with provided instructions to route new air lines and fit shocks with appropriate spacers. Shocks are stock height and allow for air pressure from 5-70 psi. I currently have them pumped to 10 psi and the suspension responds well without bottoming out and feeling every bump in the road. The bike seems higher, but likely because my old shocks were shot.The people at Powersport Superstore responded quickly to my concerns about fitment and the product was quickly shipped. I am very pleased with the price and shipping cost. Surprising how many companies don't consider Hawaii one of the United States. Powersport Superstore got it right on both!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The highlight is Anievas and de Burgos in Concertos 1 and 4","review":"Most people will uby this bargain two-fer for the most popular works: Rachmaninov's Concertos #2 and #3, along with the Pagnini Rhapsody, far outstrip the other two concertos in public favor. But Anievas is too well-ammnered in all three works, and his conductors, Alzman and Ceccato, are equally uninspired.Where this set takes off is in the lesser known concertos, #1 and #4, where Anievas, an American who emerged in the pack of young pianists in the Sixties, becomes inspired by Fruhbeck de Burgos, who does wonders with the orchestral part. These are also the best-sounding recordings here. Between them, conductor and pianist find a gentler, more lyrical way to perform these hard-to-pull-off concertos, and they succeed by not trying to knock your socks off. Highly recommended, but you may want to skip the rest unless you like reticent Rachmaninov playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beauty and skill","review":"My first choice for the Rachmaninov concertos was Ashkenazy and Previn--technically perfect playing, I would say, but I found it rather lifeless. Great clarity in the recording, but a bit thin sounding.This Anievas set, on the other hand, is full of passion. I cannot say for certain that it is as note-perfect as Ashkenazy, but it is amazing, all the same. The difference to me is the passion and fire that just gives absolute life to the music.The quality of the recording is not as crystalline as the Ashkenazy set, but neither is it remote as the Ashkenazy set. Very enjoyable, an excellent purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Line 'em up!","review":"My almost two year old daughter plays with these endlessly. She lines them up in window sills and tables.

Perhaps Amazon needs to review the reviewing process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weakest of all the Churchill witicism books","review":"Lovely cover as noted by another reviewer, but I concur, that's about it. I've read all the Churchill witticism books on the market and this was by far the weakest. Rather than just simple wicked wit, the book is laden with British Colloquialisms and history that will be utterly lost on the American reader. There is also a smattering of (oddly) untranslated French quotations which require a trip to the internet in order to understand. There are a couple of laugh out loud anecdotes but overall, too many short historical stories which provide (too much) background, are rather bland and cause Churchill's wit to be nearly lost in the process. An OK book but nothing more. If you're a Churchill completist, buy it for the few stories that aren't in the other wit and wisdom books. Otherwise, save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"we can save the world","review":"This book is so fascinating, if u even have the slightest interest in mushrooms, or any type of fungi then this is the book to get.

I studied under Dr Dan Stuntz at UW in the early 70's and one of the authors referred to in Mycelium Running was my lab partner. This book brings back the enthusiasm and joy of mushroom hunting as well as the curiosity and desire to tinker with propagation. The author clearly values species of psylocibe above all, but the book is also full of discussions about (other) edible and medicinal mushrooms and how to grow them. I found especially fascinating the description of mycoremediation and the thought-provoking part about mycoremediation of old weapons and toxic soils. This is information one can only hope gets disseminated broadly.Well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed for the job","review":"I bought a refurbished Roomba a few years ago. Having never seen one before I foolishly thought that one wheel had a spring to automatically adjust hight but not the other seemed only strange. After finding a spring on the carpet lead me to believe it wasn't by design. I looked deeper in the wheel well and could see where this spring should be. I tried to take it apart using my trusy #0 phillips pocket screwdriver. I almost took it apart but one screw resisted and started to strip. I ordered this driver because I liked it's length and correct size (Phillips #1). Was able to take apart the roomba without any pesky screws resisting. Replaced the spring it it's proper place. The roomba also works a bit better, less getting cought on the carpets edge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull production","review":"I find this production completely faceless and at the end boring. One only has to wonder how, after the cinema has been in existence for around 100 years and capable of producing real works of art and at least some good entertaining films, there are films done now being so stillborn. It does not entice any feelings, as far as I can judge, and may be good only to while away the time. It's certainly more beneficial for an individual to invest that leisure time into reading the book, that way it can be understood why it had become famous. If Great Gatsby were represented only by this picture, no one would care for it after couple of months following its release in movie theaters. This one will collect the dust in movie rental stores in the near future, I am convinced..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toby Stephens is HOT!","review":"I have grown old, and I have loved Robert Redford in the role of Gatsby for years, but Toby Stephens (who is the actress Maggie Smith's son, by the way) is a close second in my opinion. Mira Sorvino may not have been the best choice for the part, but Paul Rudd puts forth an admirable performance. If you like Stephens in this role, check him out in Masterpiece Theater's Jane Eyre as Mr. Rochester. In both Jane Eyre and in this one, a person cannot remove their eyes from him. He dominates the screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's no Robert Redford","review":"After reading the novel The Great Gatsby for school I went out and rented the 1974 version of the movie. I absolutely adored it. It showed the characters personalities as they were in the book. After that we watched the 2001 version in school and I found it to be almost unbearable. The acting was poor exspecially on the part of Toby Stephens (Gatsby). He seemed like more of a mix of Joey from friends and Boy George than a love struck man. While the hit and run scene did prove to be rather entertaining, over all I feel that this movie is just a waste of time and you would be much better off watching the 1974 version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gatsby: Good not great","review":"This film was beautiful to watch but I must say I was not impressed with the story; Toby Stephens and Mira Sorvino are excellent actors but I was not satisfied with how this was pieced together. I would rent this -- not buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop where you are! Do NOT watch this movie!!!!","review":"Where to begin?! I had such hope due to the cast, but, oh my. The stiff dialogue, the completely invented storylines (I kept imagining the writer saying \\"ok, the book is a masterpiece, but wait till they get a load of what I can do with it.....\\") The horrible cheap and ugly costumes, and the cufflinks, my heavens, the cufflinks.About 20 minutes in, my high school students held a revolt and begged me to turn it off lest it permanently taint their enjoyment of Fitzgerald's work. I think Brandon said it best, \\"it's like bad Titanic meets a flapper Soap Opera...no, a Spanish TV flapper Soap Opera.\\"Horrible, horrible, horrible. The only redeeming quality is that any student who watches this mess instead of reading the book will fail any and all quizzes. Stick to Francis Ford Coppala's 1974 version with Redford and Farrow. Nelson Riddle music, Ralph Lauren costumes, Cartier jewelry and an acurate plotline...that's more like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"Almost none of the glamor of the Jazz Age is captured in this lukewarm adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's masterpiece. Miro Sorvino is a fine actress, but she's terribly miscast as Daisy Fay Buchanan in this mediocre offering from A&E. The Redford/Farrow version is superior by far."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"This was actually a fairly faithful adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's book. Many of the lines will sound very familiar. Whether or not that faithfulness is a good thing depends on your perspective. After all, Fitzgerald was writing a novel, not a screenplay, and some of the scenes don't transfer as powerfully to film.For example, at the end Nick tells Gatsby, \\"They're a rotten crowd...You're worth the whole damn bunch put together.\\" This is an important and powerful moment in the book, but it appears stiff and strange in the movie.The acting performances were tremendous. Rudd was perfect as Nick. When I first saw Toby Stephens, he didn't strike me as a good fit for Gatsby, but he had won me over by the end of the movie.The DVD also comes with an A&E; bio on F. Scott Fitzgerald."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Acting! Fitzgerald is rolling in his grave!!!!!!!!","review":"Being A huge fan of F.Scott Fitzgerald I was excited to see a new film of \\"The Great Gatsby\\". I have to say I was sorely dissapointed. Toby Stephens as Gatsby is an absolute Abomination in this role. He says his lines like hes reading them for the first time. He's ruins Gatsby's famous catch phrase \\"Old Sport\\" with a constipated and snide delivery. In the book and in Robert Redford's marvelous performance of Gatsby you see Gatsby's charm and likeability. Despite Gatsby's flaws you can sympatize with him. Toby Stephens plays Gatsby as a spoiled conceited and completely unlikeable man. His smile is snake like and insincere. He also doesn't capture Gatsby's humble roots. It's a completely one dimensional performance. You better learn how to wait tables Toby!!! Don't even get me started on Mira Sorviono,the bad screen play and akward directing style! Im to mad to write another word now! THIS IS THE \\"GIGLI\\" OF FITZGERALD MOVIES!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinko Production","review":"Hard to believe Fitzgerald could be so badly done. The talented Mira Sorvino is miscast. Hairstyles are modernized right out of the period in which this story takes place. Robert Evans' production with Redfield/Farrow was much superior. He was able to mostly stick to the original dialogue and that production had an other-worldly look about it that this new one lacks.

I've always been interested in what really happened to Amelia Earhart, but always just assumed that her plane crashed into the ocean. This book, however, completely opened my eyes to a new hypothosis: that Amelia and her navigator managed to land on an island and send out radio signals for help. The information presented in this book isn't just wild guesses and conspiracy theories - the authors make a point of backing up their thoughts with cold, hard evidence. I was hooked from the first page and got so engrossed that I ended up not doing my work at my job just so that I could finish a few more chapters. The book also has a wicked sense of humor and debunks the myth that scientists are just stodgy old guys. I'd reccomend this book to anyone with even an ounce of curosity. I'm holding my breath until Dr. Tom King and the other authors put out another book on Amelia. I can't wait to see what they find!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Orange Sound Is Very Sour","review":"All i can say is, as 7M3 fan i was very dissappointed with their third effort. Orange Ave. sounds too much like the band went a totally different direction then the previous albums. I understand bands need to grow and expand but come on! This album along with their new look is just to Pop. Songs like Peel and Hang On just plane suck! However, i do like the mid 70's sound of SouthWestern State and of course Over The Shoulder has good original 7 sound. Again, i was dissappointed in this album but, that won't change my mind about the talent of this band. I have faith that 7 will go back to their sound. The sound they started with. American Standard and their BEST ever Rock Crown."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fine album","review":"In their 3rd album, 7M3 do what they are good at, making music that doesn't sound like any of their other songs.

If you would likie a good album to listen to, then this is the album to pick up. It grows on anyone with catchy songs and some great music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get \\"Rock Crown\\" Instead","review":"I agree with many others that this album lacks the emotion and honesty of \\"Rock Crown.\\" There are no songs on this disc that seem as real emotionally as \\"Lucky\\" from their previous album. What this band tried to do is gain more commercial and radio support with radio friendly tunes such as the totally Matchbox 20ish \\"Over Your Shoulder.\\" Yes, this song is nice on the ears initially, but it is not the Seven Mary Three that I believe most true fans want to hear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grits","review":"After carefully reviewing this critically acclaimed album, I concluded that this album was truck-stop music.

This album is pitiful compared to the other two. It wouldn't be a bad album for just any other old band but for 7m3, it's a crying shame. One guy nailed my thoughts exactly by saying their change in styles was absurd. This album sounds like they should be in a Country category.

Ross's voice is outstanding on the slow paced \\"Southwestern State\\" and Ross and Pollack show how far they have come as guitar players and musicians on \\"Joliet\\". \\"Flagship Eleanor\\" is also and overlooked gem.You're never going to hear \\"American Standard\\" from 7M3 again and that's a good thing because they are so much better than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than horrific....","review":"Orange Ave. is better than horrific, but less than bad, if you catch my drift. :) This album is an awkward, dis-jointed record from beginning to end. From what was written about the album by Jason Ross, there was a lot of turmoil in the band during the recording, and as a result, they put out a pretty bad stinker. With that said, I gave it 2 stars because there are actually a few good songs, \\"Hang On\\" is my favorite song on the CD. \\"Flagship Eleanor\\" is also good, and \\"Peel\\" is a very good song. I wasn't big on the first and only release \\"Over Your Shoulder\\", and never will be. All in all, I'd give it 2.5 stars out of 5, but certainly not 3, so I'll stick with 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets better with time, like fine wine...","review":"You have heard it before, they sound like PEARL JAM, well, to anyone who says that, they haven't given the band a good listen.

The love story was based on her dead sister, so what? Another love interest? It didn't play well. The Crow, a normally trench coated avenger wore a trnchcoat in this for all of five minutes, and the educated evil police force was a serious stretch.All in all, I watched it because it was a Crow movie, a comic movie and hey, it had Kirsten Dunst, but it was far from something I'd spend serious time watching again though I do own it.

It did justice (unlike City of angels) the first, but not upstaging it, it stood out on its own nicely. overall a movie worth watching. ****"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hopfully not the last crow film","review":"The first time I heard about this film was at the start of 2001.I had low expectations of this movie because of the second film which in its own right wasn't as bad as eveyone said it was.I want to floriday on holiday and rented this movie sraight away and was it worth staying in for?Answer= YesIt is different from the previous two films which is pretty good.There is more of a story and it sow s that it isn't only guys with long hair that can be the crow.The down point and only down pont is that there isn't enough action but when there is action it is pretty cool.Overall i would say buy it and buy the next crow installment called The Crow Lazerus."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 3rd","review":"Like I said in my Crow Wicked Prayer review (Check that out) This film and City Of Angels were adds of honour to the first Crow film (Although the fourth one went right down the drain and dishonoured the first one) The Crow: Salvation really brings everything together. Eric Mabius did great, Kirsten Dunst was good too. But, the music could've been a leetle better. The rock music lacks dark (In my opinion) 'After The Flesh' was a very good dark-rock-theme (played while the big shoot-out at Top Dollar's in Crow 1)Of course this movie or City Of Angels doesn't surpass the first Crow film. Nothing ever will.^_^..............................................................The Future Critic (Although not confirmed yet, my mom and dad want me to be a lawyer),Penny-----------------------------------------------------------------ERIC DRAVEN: Your job will be to tell them, death is coming for them.... Tonight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"What's up with everyone yes the Original Crow is a classic a totally excellent movie but if you like it i can't see how you don't like the second. One As they are very similar in alot of respects. The third Crow \\"Salvation\\" stays true to the original storyline but offers a lot of new ideas and themes. To other reviewers even if you think \\"Salvation\\" and \\"City of Angels\\" aren't as good as the first crow movie they are still excellent movies in their own rights. I think that this movie is defiantly better than the second movie and almost as good as the original Excellent go out and buy this movie if you are a Crow fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie-A must see.","review":"The studios really dropped the ball not releasing this one in the theaters. It is a much better movie than City of Angels. And takes a very different approach, instead of portraying a decadent dead world, it breathes some much needed life into the movie. Nor does it tread the same ground the first two did, Being more of a mystery than a staight out vengence killing spree. There are even a plot twist towards the end that is VERY well done and will leave you guessing as to what is \\"Real\\" and what isn't. Further down, you'll note someone questioning how \\"Everyone knew about the crow\\", but throughout the movie you'll hear occasionally people saying \\"I'd read about this kind of thing happening\\", so apparently people do have knowledge of the dead arising which explains how they know about the crow. This is a MUST see movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, at least it's better than City of Angels","review":"After being wowed with the first Crow film, and totally disappointed with the second installment, City of Angels, I honestly didn't expect much from this direct to video release and third entry in the Crow series. While it is better than the second installment, its not by much. Eric Mabius isn't half bad, maybe with a better script we could have seen his talent shine, and the same goes for Kirsten Dunst who is sadly wasted in her role. Jodi Lynn O'Keefe, William Atherton, Fred Ward, and Dale Midkiff round out the cast, and all of whom try to make the best out of a bad situation, but its pretty clear why this went direct to video. The problem with the last two Crow films is the story is missing the raw emotional feel the first had, not to mention there is no other director that could helm any Crow movie the way Alex Proyas did. All in all, Salvation may be worth checking out, but don't expect much from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is an insult to the franchise","review":"Ok, City of Angels was no gem, and the franchise is strictly limited to the original Brandon Lee vehicle, but Salvation is an absolute nightmare. The acting is dismal and the storyline is even worse. Anyone who claims that the \\"mystery\\" angle is refreshing, is simply trying to justify the rental price they paid. It could have been refreshing,had the \\"mystery\\" itself been original. Unfortunatley there's nothing innovative going on here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grave","review":"Poor Brandon Lee must be spinning in his grave... his last film role is a classic, but then they decide to go ahead and build off the work that he did, and release two very crappy sequels. City of Angels was horrible, but this was even worse. Poor acting, poor directing, did I mention poor acting? Not worth the rental price, let alone purchase price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not very good...","review":"I read and liked the comic books, loved the first Crow, hated the second, and just had to see this one. Thankfully I only rented it. Almost the exact same story and characterization as the first movie (many of the characters even resemble their counterparts from the original), mediocre at best acting, a bad, unoriginal script (there are many scenes almost identical to the original movie with similar dialogue!), and very poor execution (no pun intended). I always thought the Crow was supposed to be more about Justice and love than plain old vengeance. Without giving too much away, this was just a bloodfest which does not fit into the whole idea of the Crow. See it if you must but don't waste your money buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies ever made","review":"The third installment of the popular \\"Crow\\" movies has turned out to be a sour disappointment. This is one of the worst films ever made. A terrible script and terrible acting can't do much justice. The plot seems a bit recycled and unoriginal: Dead guy resurrects to avenge terrible misdeed, only this time the situation is horribly undramatic and too rushed. No interesting characters, bad dialogue, no lessons learned... Thumbs down, please do not confuse this movie with the original classic starring Brandon Lee."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Star is really being *too* kind..","review":"I hate to say it, but this has to be the worst movie I have ever seen. I loved the first Crow, I even \\"liked\\" the second one.. but this one is pure junk. It should be called \\"The Crow: Quest for more money\\" - because there is not an ounce of real acting in this entire film. From the first few minutes on, it becomes apparent that the main character is out of a bad B-movie. My advice is to save your money... the acting and ...writing in this film are so absurd, it's not even worth renting."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE DONT BUY THIS","review":"What an uninspired mess. Visually Eric Morbius is just boring to look at as the Crow. Character motivation is nowhere to be seen. We know who the main villian is minutes into the movie. Even the way the Crow goes about exacting his vengence is boring and insipid. I regret buying it and plan to just sell this copy on Ebay in order to make some money back"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent work of art","review":"This book was wonderful. I love hearing about the history of my tribe (Siletz). Also, the author included information about my great-great-great grandfather Charlie Depoe. I learned about my own family from this book. I cried to see a picture of my ancestor for the first time ever. I thank you E.A. Schwartz for putting together such a comprehensive piece of what is essentially a very important, yet small piece of history for many American Indians. I waited patiently for years for this story to be told. Now I can pass this piece of history on to my children and all of their children. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"BFS Goes to the Movies","review":"This record isn't quite as good as some of the other stuff Bowling for Soup has done, but the fun, playful vibe still shows through. Many songs are covers, and I have to say I prefer their original stuff, but it's not bad. If you're new to BFS, you ought to listen to Hangover You Didn't Deserve or Drunk Enough To Dance first. One complaint I have is that the color of the print on the insert doesn't contrast enough with the background- it's extremely difficult to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Not That Good","review":"This CD didn't impress me.

I did not realize this when i bought it. Compared to drunk enough to dance and a hangover you dont deserve I have to say its a flop. I just ordered the great burrito incident hopefully i like it better than this one. I also thinking about getting one of thier other albums but i'll wait and see how i like the burrito one."},{"rating":"1","title":"And so goodnight...","review":"While it's very nice to have a final 'episode' to Angela Thirkell's long running chronicle this book misses too many marks to be be entirely satisfying. The change of author comes through all too clearly with a cloying sweetness evident throughout with none of the original acerbity to offset it. The sharpness of Thirkell's social commentary is also missing. I feel sure,for example, that although she may have planned the final outcome for her young characters Ludo and Lavinia she would also have had much to say on the changed world that made them a suitable match. A pleasant read but not an excellent one"},{"rating":"1","title":"too convoluted!!!!","review":"wasted my time-------------too many characters; no character development... read michael connelly instead!! all his books are page turners!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just your ordinary PI...","review":"Nick Merchant, former San Francisco cop, is in the business of finding heirs. Along with his former girlfriend Alex Moreno, they are on their most lucrative and dangerous job yet. When Gerald Jacobs is found dead in upstate New York, Nick and Alex have a week to find the three heirs to Jacobs' 22 million dollar fortune, as they try to elude the competition out to get them. Although you don't get the chance to really know what makes Nick and Alex human, THE HEIR HUNTER is a fast-paced page-turner, and a refreshingly original twist on the PI genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"heir hunter gripping","review":"If you're tired of the same old detective stories, you're ready for Larsgaard's Heir Hunter. Nick Merchant, the protagonist is anything but cliche. His brand of investigative work has not been explored in fiction before, and I found the concept quite interesting. This business of searching for heirs in order to recover a percentage of the estate involves some curious moral dilemmas, and Nick Merchant grapples with these issues in a very human way. At no point in the novel does Nick transform into a stereotype. Both he and his job are complex, and Larsgaard does a nice job in creating a character that seems to do the right things, without being arrogant. Nick is likable and the story is gripping from beginning to end. If you enjoy suspense, this novel, which braids several interesting storylines into one unforgettable tale, is something that you should experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Premise But...","review":"Nicholas Merchant is a sort of private detective, who finds the relatives of wealthy individuals who leave no immediate relatives and no will. One case in particular, involving an old man with a multi-million dollar estate leads to government cover-ups and Nazi millions in secret Swiss Accounts. While the story seemed rather derivative (Nazi hidden treasure), I also had a difficult time keeping all the villians straigh. And quite frankly, the secret that was being protected just didn't seem that big. I would read a sequel because the writing was good and the premise sound but hopefully the plot would improve on another outing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking for the Leftovers","review":"This is a potboiler where the pot really boils. The subject of heir hunting is a new one. The story is tightly written and moves along at a fabulous pace. The sentences are simple and the grammar is good. This is excellent writing, indeed. The plot was well researched, e.g. the author gives a perfect description of the town of Geneva. There is nothing sloppy here. The story itself is fabulous and it is developed extremely well. The international conspiracy does make sense and is interesting: Such cases of hiding German assets after 1945 do exist, and so do the characters who disappear into the woodwork with the loot. Small correction: Hitler would not have appointed anybody that young, and such a recent member of the Party, to such a high position. And why is just about everybody over 6 feet tall? I recommend this book not just as a good mystery, but as a true work of literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author wrote many of the reviews himself, I think.","review":"I found the book rather amateur and the characters one-dimensional. There were way too many names and situations to follow at one time, and I often times felt like putting the book down and forgetting about it. The premise is interesting, but the book isn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, tradional, book on real-time systems","review":"This book covers real-time systems in a 'traditional', theoretical, way. The book focuses on hard real-time scheduling, and more recent issues - such as the use of time-triggered systems - are given no coverage. It does cover issues like RMA, etc, clearly. Further examples from real applications would be a real bonus: almost all the examples are of an abstract nature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake","review":"I'm an TSAR customer since a long time ago.

It is full of twists and turns. Is Kingdom Come a cult? Who are the bad guys? What are they up to? I was thrilled with everything EXCEPT the ending. It doesn't end at all. It's a cliffhanger in the tradition of the 1930s movie serials. Is there a sequel? If not, I would not recommend the book to anyone because the ending is SO frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just 'My Patch' to look forward to","review":"So I picked up the album on account I had the song 'My Patch' stuck in my head from playing the video game Little Big Planet. I am happy to report that the rest of the album has that quirky, playful, energetic feel to it across the board. While other Amazon reviewers have described Jim Noir's sound as a mix of Paul McCartney and Beach Boys, I would add that there are other songs in this album that reflect influences from such groups as Super Furry Animals and Blur to name two (check out 'I me You I'm Your' for the former and 'Turbulent Weather' for the latter). If you like Jims work here you may as well pick up his self titled 2008 release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing, depressing, depressing!","review":"Jane Hamilton is a wonderful writer.

We past her rundown house. We sit next to her in high school math. We watch her struggle. We may be the one who always looks away. Or we may be Ruth, unsophisticated, confused, and desperate for love. The point is that she's there. She's everywhere. None of us may have ever given her the time of day, but Ruth has feelings too. Ruth has opinions, friends, goals, and Ruth is living life, just like the rest of us. Give Ruth a chance. See her for who she is. She doesn't want your pity; she doesn't want your scorn. Ruth just wants to be accepted for who she is: Ruth. Be careful when you read this novel. It will creep into you, and Ruth and her friends will become a part of your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I gained from reading this book:","review":"Will never again take for granted what I've got in my since reading this book. Also, I feel a little more understanding of the \\"slow\\" girl with scars on her arms and neck that assembles sandwiches at my neighborhood 'Subway' store, and why her kids are there at the store all evening while she works for minimum wage. There really are people that never have an opportunity to better themselves or they don't have the mental ability to recognize an opportunity if it does present itself. Ruth married the only guy she thought could ever love her. She had only her verbally abusive mother in her life and was so vunerable when she met Ruby. Having children just seemed like the natural thing to do, even if her husband was a complete imbecile. Ruth didn't know any better than the choices she made. Aunt Sid should have kidnapped her the moment she graduated high school! If you're self-centered, shallow or heartless, then this book isn't for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and a chore to read.","review":"I was under the influence of Oprah's Book Club List, unfortunately. It's a chore for me to pick this book up and finish it. The only book in my life that I could not finish was \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" and I tried twice!!! The writing style I had a hard time with...it is not difficult reading but it does not roll off your tongue (sort of speak). Too much rereading paragraphs because I've drifted off to thinking about unimportant things like \\" maybe I should cut my finger nails\\". It is a poor read!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must 'Listen'.","review":"I listened to this book on tape while fighting traffic during rush hour. Although I prefer to read, my sister-in-law gave me the set of audio cassettes, among others. Mare Winningham, a fine actress, reads the novel with a marvelous Southern cadence. I was immediately caught up in the life of Ruth, as I heard her tell her story. Ruth is in all of us, in our insecurities, our connections with family and trying to live up (or down) to others' preconceived opinions of us. Ruth finished her story as I sat parked in the garage, I just couldn't bear not to hear the end. I highly recommend a 'listen' of the Book of Ruth."},{"rating":"2","title":"disturbing yet satisfying","review":"While The Book of Ruth is not one of my favorite books- I can definitly say that it held my attention and left an impression on my mind. The whole time I was reading it- I couldn't stop thinking about how one person (Ruth) can be THAT ignorant! I had to keep reading to find out if she would ever \\"wake up\\" and get a grip on her life, family, existence! I've recommended \\"Ruth\\" to several of my friends and they have all had mixed reviews. In my opinion- if you like that sort of story/plot- definitly read \\"The Liars Club\\".Like RUTH- it is very well written- and quite a remarkable story.

As is my settled stomach, my peaceful countenance, 5 hours of my time and my willingess to trust Oprah, good titles and acclaimed writers. I can't leave this book uncanned! It stinks like a neglected vase of flowers. And to think, a scholarly seemingly coy Jehovah's witness promised me I'd love it. The world is so cold. Hate is such a strong word, yes. But also so very appropriate in the case of The Book of Ruth. Blasphemous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Dumb Uninteresting Ruth","review":"I read the book in its entirely because it was an Oprah selection -- my first mistake -- and I kept THINKING that Ruth would finally GET IT. As Ruth struggled early on, I was right there cheering her on, but what a massive disappointment for a reader to discover the character never changes and will probably go on to make the same old stupid mistakes. There was nothing heroic about Ruth. She whined and shivered and settled for a dimwitted alcoholic with rotten teeth who couldn't hold down a job. She was still making excuses for him in the end; however, she flip-flops over it because, guess what, the woman seldom holds a thought for more than two seconds because she is as dimwitted as her husband. It's as if Hamilton tried to think of the crummiest, dullest traits in the world to give her characters and guess who won? Ruth! Ruth survives her ordeal, but she is not a survivor. And because there is no substance to her, the reader doesn't care.

It is an example of painting a picture of a life with words, that's why I gave it 2 stars. The fact that it wasn't a life worth writing about is why I recommend you look elsewhere.This is as depressing and pointless of a story as I have ever read. I suppose if you are looking for a reason to wear black and cry in the corner it would be a decent read, but I found nothing of value in it. There are no lessons learned, and nothing of substance to be found in this story.It is a shame to see such literary ability focus on something so meaningless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable but Dark","review":"Well written tale that no matter how shallow the rut gets, it's still a rut.

It is boring and delves into the monotony of the protagonist, Ruth's life. I kept reading, waiting for something to happen because the author did a good job of foreshadowing something that happens to the characters in the book. In my humble opinion, the story did not represent hope at all and the main character does not emerge \\"a butterfly\\" like some other reviewers have posted. She remains in a life of monotonous boredom and is only saved from the abuse she participates in because of pain and sorrow brought on from abuse. This read was a complete waste of time and has left me feeling depleted and empty, not uplifted and full of hope like I had anticipated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, hum","review":"I read it a few years back.

We both hated it. There is no way the reader can accept the self-consciously literary narrator as Ruth, who tells us repeatedly how stupid and illiterate she is. Likewise I found Hamilton's attempts to empathize with her characters both shallow and condescending. The only reason I finished this book was to discover what horrible thing had happened, as was referred to on the first page...the answer wasn't worth it. Hamilton has used every literary device at her disposal, and she is clearly a skilled writer. Unfortunately, her dislike or disrespect for her characters distances the reader, and the literary skill is wasted"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine line between love and hate","review":"The Book of Ruth is a beautifully simple story which penetrates the layers of love and hate that make up relationships. It severs as a display of what humans will do for love and how delicately thin the line is between love and hate. Through the eyes of a young, confused girl the details of daily life are soothing in their predictability until the \\"big even\\" happens and takes her to a place she always wanted to be"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-written but lacks any redeeming quality to the story","review":"What most disturbed me about this book is that the main character, Ruth, seemed not terribly upset about the horrific murder of her mother. In fact, the last few pages implied that she was set free by the murderer! While her mother was blindly devoted to the gifted brother, at Ruth's expense, she was not as bad towards her daughter as to deserve her indifference. The author writes well and has created authentic characters and their lives. One of her themes is \\"the meanness\\" that people are born with and have to overpower. She illustrates this beautifully in the relationships between men and women, parents and children. Still, I missed the \\"hope\\" that many reviewers found at the end of the book. I felt I had been in the presence of real evil in the last few pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most depressing book I've ever read","review":"This book is well-written, but it contains the most difficult, depressing subject matter I have ever encountered in a fiction work (and I've read a few). By the time I got finished reading it, I actually felt like I'd lived in some story that would be on the news. I haven't read any of Oprah's book recommendations since. (Sorry Oprah.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotionally riveting ! A love/hate relationship you can feel","review":"I have to say that I probably would not have read this book if it wasn't for Oprah Winfrey. The books that I usually read are mysteries with romance. I call them easy reading books. Jane Hamilton had me feeling everything Ruth was feeling from the moment I started reading the first page. It touched all my emotions. The characters - May, Ruby, Ruth, and Justy come to life so vividly. I felt like I could touch them and hold them, even strangle them for their stupidity. This book did start out slow but it worked into a chilling climax. I'm glad I didn't put it back on the shelf. All I can say is thank you Oprah for opening my eyes. Thank you Jane Hamilton for making me feel grateful for all the blessings I have in my life"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a chore to get through!","review":"I have read many of Oprah's picks and have enjoyed them. This surely was the exception. The characters were not \\"real\\" to me. They didn't grab my attention and I didn't care enough about them to be interested in the book. I finished it but it certainly was a chore. It was not the book I hoped it would be."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one of the worst books I've ever read.","review":"The pace of this book was as slow as molasses in winter. I kept reading, thinking it was going to get better and then the stupid thing ended with probably the worst ending I've ever read. The author should be force-fed Prozac. Come on Oprah, give me a break! I only read it because of your recommendation. This was the one and only Oprah recommended book I subjected myself to."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this book.","review":"This book is a very depressing read. When you do finally finish, you are left with a feeling you should expect more than this ending. This book is so unrealistic - except in the graphic descriptions of the actual abuse. Throughout the book, you are waiting for something - anything - to happen that will give this book significance - perhaps good or worthy advise for abused women, but, only disparagement and disheartening narratives and messages to are to be found. Do not waste your money on this book to fulfill Oprah's self-(financial)-serving recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!","review":"Boring, boring, the story doesn't seem to go anywhere. It was listed on my book club books. I shouldn't have bothered."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS BOOK!!","review":"I have recommended this book to several friends. I simply found it enchanting and have re-read it again and again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depresssssing!","review":"I have now read 2 books recommended by Oprah. Does she only recommend books that leave you so sad. I felt this book was way off the mark. Did no one in the school system or even her Aunt Sid who was only 40 miles away care one iota? Ruth seems to love being the victim and even when everything goes wrong, she still doesn't get it. No one can be that clueless. If Oprah only recommends these types of stories than I am out of the running"},{"rating":"2","title":"Depressing but with a glimmer of hope","review":"This book is the story of how it sometimes takes catastrophe to dislodge people from their ruts and force them to redefine themselves. It also takes a very long, hard look at the relationships--familial and romantic--that all women experience in their lives and how they can be so forceful--for good or ill. Yes, this book is difficult (emotionally) to read, because we readers can stand on the sidelines and shout advice, but the characters don't hear us any more than the real people who come through our lives and break our hearts by following destructive paths. In the end, the characters have to deal with the consequences of how they've lived their lives. The good news is that for some, it's not too late to turn a new corner. In that respect, this book is a story of hope and redemption."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read it!","review":"Funny writing at the beginning, then it got slow in the middle.

I seldom start a book and not finish it so I did read all of this book hoping that something would redeem it! Nothing did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The book of Ruth","review":"I REALLY disliked this book. The Book of Nothing. I found the characters to be very shallow, the story to be very shallow and at the end of the day you really didn't care what happened to anyone. I feel that this book WAS a waste of time and if Oprah had not picked it, I don't believe it would have been significant in any way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like the book","review":"I belong to a book club, only one person was able to finish the book and she only like the endng. I thought it was boring, it did not hold my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much beating around the bush and pruning it as well.","review":"The story is so typical of modern female authors...PREDICTABLE! What is up with this style of writing? I can't understand why female authors have to digress and 'emote' everything until the actual meaning of the text is lost. If you are looking for a 'typical modern' book, or feel that \\"Oprah's Book Club Knows Best\\" then this is an appropriate book. If however, you feel that life is worth digging a little deeper and depth of insight is a treasure, then I recommend looking elsewhere for inspiration. Jane Hamilton is admirable but lacks originality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"If you are at all prone to depression or suicide do NOT read this book. It is well written and well crafted, but to what end?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Dark, Too Pointless, and Much Too Long","review":"Had I not been on vacation, with nothing other than this handy to read, I would have dropped it and left it for dead.I am tired of being dragged into the \\"Oprah\\" choices only to find they are always about below average, under privileged, tragic souls. Is Oprah not aware there are strong, healthy people out there, who not only lead productive useful lives, but raise productive children who also contribute to society, without benefit of abuse and mistreatment?I read painfully about the horrible lives these poor mentally challenged people endured, always with a sense of impending doom. Quite frankly, all but two of the characters (Ruth & Ruby) are individuals who have made messes of their own lives and are the very sort of folks I have worked hard to insure I do not have to live near and certainly do not want my children growing up around. I would ask you then, why would I or any one else want to read about these dregs of society?"},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOK OF RUTH","review":"Sorry Oprah, this was a flop. The whole time you're reading about Ruth, you wonder what the point of the book is. I have to admit that I had sympathy for the girl, but when you find out what the point actually is, you are mortified. If the book had focused more on her getting her life back together and finding actual real happiness, that would have been a good story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An irritating book with frustrating characters.","review":"For the first few chapters, the small town characters were genuinely interesting. I felt sympathy for both Ruth and her prodigy brother. While the family dysfunction was refreshingly honest, the book rapidly declined once Matt left and Ruby was introduced. The romance between Ruth and Ruby was unconvincing and Ruby's character was pathetically tedious. Ruth herself does not stay true to character, oscillating between personality extremes throughout the book. The author can't seem to decide if she is a strong, resourceful heroine and or a mentally challenged weakling. The violent ending is both infuriating and emotionally implausible. All in all, a disappointing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A truly depressing slice of life.","review":"While the ending is ever-so-slightly upbeat, this sad tale of underachieving losers is pretty bad. I wonder why the author wasted her time. I certainly question why on earth I wasted mine in reading this dreary saga."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated this book. Waste of time","review":"I can't believe I'm wasting any more time thinking about this horrible book. If you enjoy this book, you need to stop watching Oprah and get your own opinions besides hers. Its terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hit like a Sledgehammer; instant pain then a dull ache","review":"I didn't see the attraction of this book. Perhaps because it was so highly recommended to me, I expected too much, or at least more. No offense to Jane Hamilton, but I felt only lackluster empathy for her dangerously benign characters, none of whom for which I had a modicum of repect or pity. With the Biblically-allusive title, I expected to discover some redeeming quality in the titled-character, but, instead, I found only a cavernous soul in a box-car of a life. The murder-by-decapitation twist was not only unexpected but resemblent of a poor, fictionalized Vincent Bugliosi novel. I have to say, I was tragically disappointed in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why would anyone want to marry the village idiot?","review":"And then breed? Oprah is clearly working through her abusive childhood with this one. This book proves the idea that well-written doesn't necessarily mean good. Excellent prose drove me on when the characters and plot could no longer do so. Books about women participating in their own degradation is something I would have hoped we could have moved beyond by now"},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunning but grim tale.","review":"Once I started this book, I couldn't put it down. However, once I finished it, I wish I hadn't read it. Jane Hamilton makes this family of dysfunctional characters so tangible, so understandable that I was able to empathize with some very unsavory behaviour. While it's so tempting and so easy to categorize the world according to what is right and what is wrong, Ms. Hamilton plops us right in that grey region where moral sensibility fights with human compassion. I cannot get the characters of Ruth, her mother, and her husband, Ruby, out of my mind...and I wish I could. I haven't been so disturbed by a book in years. Ms. Hamilton is a brilliant writer, but I hope she picks less grim subjects for future examination. My only criticism of the book is the character of Ruth's aunt. I didn't really believe her motivation and her desire to help Ruth. All in all, this is a brilliant piece of writing that I cannot recommend---it is just too bleak"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and overwrought","review":"The popularity of this book is probably what happens when talk show hosts start telling people what to read -- and people are misguided enough to listen. This book was too long by half. The language and voice were not convincing, and the characters, despite an excess of description and plot, still managed to be one dimensional. The narrator's constant victimization is wearing rather than sympathetic. If you want to read a book that sets out to accomplish the same task, but accomplishes it with brevity, grace, and power, read Ellen Foster by Kaye Gibbons"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Nobility of the Soul at Odds With Circumstance\\"...","review":"Roethke describes madness as nobility of the soul at odds with circumstance. I think this message lies at the core of this book. Ruth's hope and quiet determination give meaning to a life fraught with cruelty and pain. The unconditional love she receives from her aunt helps provide her with an outlet for her feelings and a sense of self-worth that ultimately gives Ruth a source of resilience and belief in a future she can forge through her own strengths."},{"rating":"2","title":"reality hurts","review":"\\"The Book of Ruth\\" describes the life of a woman who loves someone with all her heart and soul, but then loses this love before she even has a chance to consummate it. Then she carries this loss around with her like an albatross, never rejoicing in life's joyful monumental events but instead knocks down any uprising of happiness and joy she encounters as she carries on her life marrying again and having children. She takes this loss out on Ruth, her only daughter, both physically and especially mentally, while she places her son Matt on a pedestal he feels is unwarranted. Matt escapes to college, and Ruth, the dumb one who has not a speck of self-confidence due to her mothers constant disparaging, is resigned to continue to live with her mother and submit to her mothers derilect treatment of herself. A well written dose of some peoples reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Moving","review":"a very cool teacher of mine recently recommended this book to me, so i bought it, read 150 pages the first day, and finished within the next 2 days. i'm not bragging here, this book just has a way of grabbing you. i'm not fond of oprah and her book club deal, so when i saw her \\"stamp of approval\\" on the cover i thought to myself ohh i'm screwed. but nonetheless, the book is like a tearful journal of this woman who is humble and seemingly becomes smarter and more confident of herself as she continues to tell her story. but this isn't her journal. it's her life. don't be fooled- this book isn't just for women. throughout ruth's story, you realize how much she has been robbed of even when she is unaware due to so much abuse. maybe you'll see some of ruth in your own self."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was too violent and full of hatred.","review":"This book was very disturbing! The language was quite harsh, as was the emotional and physical abuse. In one particular case, the violence came to a head and was so full of evil and hatred that it was hard for me to forget. If you are of a sensitive nature, do not read. If not, then you have been desensitized to harsh brutality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful,Heart-wrenching,vivid..but not for the empathetic","review":"Read it. Right now! Go on......Stop reading this, and read the book!!!!.........But not if you're an extremely empathetic person; then this book will rip your heart out, stomp on it,and give it back to you. Of coarse, if you aren't empatheic it will do the same thing. Now stop reading this review,and READ THE BOOK!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soul riveting","review":"A sad story about a girl woman who suffers low self esteem derived from a long suffering childhood of verbal sometimes physical abuse at the hand of her well meaning mother. She is the strong one (only she doesn't know it) who shows unconditional love for a pathetic man whom she only sees the good in when no one else can. Sometimes we all get trapped in these type situations."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing American story.","review":"Jane Hamilton has shared with us the very real story of a woman we all know. The clarity with which she spins her characterizations and sense of story are the essence of this book. The details of Ruth's surroundings became at once familiar to me in a mid-American sort of way, and I found myself at times ashamed at the presumptive nature of my thoughts and reactions in relation to her state of existence. Perhaps I am an exception, but I had not anticipated the events at the climax of this story. However, I found Ruth to be a character worthy of emulation in many ways. She solidifies our hope that the human spirit will prevail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"This book is not a nice, relaxing read. It is not uplifting. I read the book after the Oprah review aired and now I wish I could see it again to find out what it was people liked about it. I am so relieved to read reviews on this page that agree with me. Not all, but some. How about a \\"0 stars\\" option? I have learned that Oprah and I do NOT have the same taste in books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Strong Always Survive","review":"Ruth is a strong woman living what some may take as a weak exterior. Her character is deeper than words could ever express and on many occasions brought me to tears. This book is an exceptional depiction of the effects our environment, our families have on us."},{"rating":"1","title":"unconvincing...","review":"I thought the narration was good, but unconvincing that Ruth was supposed to be mentally deficient...the way she narrates proves that she wasn't as stupid as she and others thought she was. I also find it interesting that Oprah's book picks are usually stories about lower class families surrounded by violence, abuse, and sexual frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the last two chapters first...","review":"When I was in high school I read Catcher in the Rye. My teacher at the time told me to read the last chapters first and then read the book like normal. Well, where was he for this book? I recommend reading the last few chapters first and then go beginning to end. I was truly disappointed by this book! The end took such a crazy...never in your life would you have guessed it twist that I felt cheated! I missed several important clues during my reading of the book because I didn't see their significance until the end and it was too late. I felt it was an ok book but would have been greatly enhanced if I had known what was at the end. I do not think reading the last few chapters will ruin the book but enhance it"},{"rating":"1","title":"GRIM, but gripping","review":"I could not like Ruth, no matter how hard I tried. She deserved all that she got. In all my favorite books I can empathize with the main character. This is a depressing, disappointing (nothing ever got better for Ruth) but well-written novel. I really expected more"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book. Weak ending.","review":"The fact that I am still thinking about this book a fews daysafter finishing it must mean something. I read through most of theposted reviews and agree with many who said it was a \\"beautifully written book.\\" Indeed it was. For such a simple minded woman, Ruth came up with some beautiful, profound observations on life. I felt for her; I rooted for her; I just wish I had been able to witness more of her recovery. I agree with the reviewer who said she wanted to shake Ruth. Me too! She had such potential, seen only by Miss Finch and Aunt Sid. In the end, I'm somewhat ambivalent about the book as a whole. I enjoyed the telling of Ruth's story, but I felt the ending was not satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Ms. Hamilton!","review":"This book got under my skin and will stay there. The prose is wonderful. I kept jotting down my favorite passages, especially the ones about 'Is that all there is?' concerning work down at the Trim'N Tidy. I compare this to Winter Birds by Jim Grimsley"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one I've ever recommended to anyone","review":"I found this book to be boring and unbelievable. Esecially the ending, which I found felt very contrived. Even though I have had not trouble reading books of this nature in the past, I found myself disturbed by this one because horrible things were happening to a woman that I couldn't feel compassion for. I would find myself drifing off through most of it so when something caught my attention I had lost the context it was happening in. I would have to hear lots of amazing things before I would try this author again."},{"rating":"2","title":"deep, poetic & thought provoking.","review":"The words of this book were so poetic and beautiful. The story itself was dark but very interesting and thought provoking. I could see a little bit of myself in Ruth as I'm sure anyone who has ever been misunderstood and/or rejected could. I found myself relating to Ruth, feeling sorry for her and being frustrated with her. All the charactors were interesting and unique. This is not a \\"light read\\" so if your into Harlequin Romances don't bother with The Book of Ruth, it's only for serious readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trailer Trash Are People Too","review":"It is a sad truth in today's society that many of us who read books look down on those who don't. Hamilton's Ruth belongs to the set most people would classify as \\"trailer trash.\\" But Hamilton shows us how any person can bloom with love and guidance. There is a sophistication of understanding and compassion in Ruth that many of the educated would do well to emulate. The story is well-told, touching, and believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different but eye opening","review":"This was my first book by Jane Hamilton. I enjoyed they way she told the story and each detail about the characters. There were times I wanted to go into the book and just shake Ruth to make her wake up and open her eyes.

Dejasay's ideas may be original, but they are terribly organized. This guy has the worst grammar in the game.

I purchased this DVD without reading the details first. Instead of showing a \\"History\\" of Pro Football, 1/4th of this DVD focuses on a few, self-proclaimed stars of modern day (Keyshawn Johnson, Randy Moss, etc). Another 1/4 focuses on a few \\"football families\\" (Grieses, the Mannings, and the Dorsetts). I found the coaching section the best...at least the DVD showed some old footage of some of the best.

While we all know that 1993 was not conducive to most party rock bands, Pariah still managed to drop a kick-butt melodic rock record.This album is definitely a take on the hollywood scene of a few years past, hwoever, these guys put a southern Texas spin on their sound. This record is just a solid hard rocking effort the whole way through. It doesn't make you think they should have rivaled Poison, Warrant or Bon Jovi, but it is more than worth a listen. My favorite tracks are \\"Anesthesia\\", \\"Do You Know How to Rock\\" and \\"Make Believe (Jesus Freak)\\", but the rest is decent enough as well.If you dig bands like L.A. Guns, Ratt and Britny Fox, you'll wanna definitely check these guys out. The album is dirt cheap(and I mean that literally) so it won't break the bank vault, and you'll get some rocking 80's influenced tunes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PARIAH ROCKS!!!","review":"This Texas based band is one of the best things to come out of the Central Texas region since Stevie Ray Vaughn. The albumn has eveything you could ever want to hear in a single ablumn. It can hit you hard and heavy or be slow and mellow. Highlights to this albumn would be Powerless, Junkmail, Letter to Myslef, Jesus Freak and Sick Kid. They've got the perfect blend of modern day heavy metal and the 80's glam rock. One of the top ten albumns in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great dictionary value","review":"This is a great dictionary for the value.

I also enjoy the \\"Word History\\", \\"Useage\\" and synonym features.I am not sure what makes it \\"Encyclopedic.\\" Putting the new words in the front is not particularly helpful--when does one know to look in the front?I suppose that is a cost saving measure over redoing the entire text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, self affirming, comforting, and informative book.","review":"This book will reassure you that you are not alone in your pain, other people do experience what you are going through.

It's in full screen format, and the only thing that makes it not a TV movie is the brief scenes of nudity. This movie could have been edited a little better in that you spend half the movie developing the main character...which could have taken easily 10-15 minutes instead. The emphasis of gay sex here and there they could have done away with. But above all, they should have put more of the budget into scenes with zombies in it. It's a great premise for a zombie movie, but it's just disappointing with what they did with it. If you're looking for rare movies to add to your zombie movie collection...you should seriously skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"please dont buy","review":"John Saxon is a good actor, as for the rest of this movie it was no good.

Im sure you get my point this is not like those at all. And I dont really consider it worth the $$$ it cost. Please dont waste your $ as if you are a zombie film fan you will be very disssapointed, very. 2 stars I gave it only because the acting is pretty good.

You have the obligatory \\"welcome back, Commander\\" introductions by the crew and not much of a plot to hang the special effects. It's a yawner. But in \\"Matter of Life and Death\\" the series really starts to pick up dramatically. A subtle love triangle develops when Dr. Russell's long-lost husband Lee shows up inexplicably on a planet \\"billions of miles\\" from Jupiter, where he was lost in space. It's interesting to watch the real life husband and wife team of Landau and Bain play off a Martin Landau look-alike (Richard Johnson) for the role of Lee Russell.

In 'Not the End of the World', he makes a pretty good meal of the media as well!. His humor is really 'in-your-face' - not passive beach reading as one reviewer believes - and, if you look below the (excellent) storyline, you'll see some remarkably accurate social observations about life in general.Try and get his other books -'One Fine Day in the Middle of the Night', 'Quite Ugly one Morning' and 'Boiling a Frog' - they're also excellent reads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it -- Top class thriller meets pop culture","review":"I bought this book in London in 1999 for my long flight back to Sydney. Well, I arrived exhausted and even more jet-lagged than usual because I couldn't put it down!Brookmyre melds a fantastically twisted thriller with an amused outsider view of LA pop culture and fervent religious fanaticism. Smart, fun, perceptive, great characters -- a great all-rounder. This is a really enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Scotsman Trying to Play It Like He Knows Los Angeles","review":"From referring to Santa Monica as \\"Santa M\\" repeatedly to having his main character claim that he grew up in Los Angeles, Brookmyre is miles away from any reality of Los Angeles. His thinks-he's-so-brilliant quips and cliches are tired and show him to be a dull imitator of greats like Irvine Welsh. The absolte funniest/worst part of the book was his made up translation of an ancient document found on the island of Crete, containing gems such as \\"Often have I wondered, watching the rhytons being filled in sacrifice from a quaking beast's throat, would we do the same were it a cold, clear water that issued forth, and not this liquid jewel, this decorative prize?\\"In the end, Brookmyre's approach is too casual and cocky to be convincing and his prose is sub-par.

Trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly good SINGLE HB4/9006 bulb - but wrong photo.","review":"Nothing wrong with this bulb - works fine and it is the Hella model/item number listed in the heading. However, as of this moment, the photo shows a twin-pack of \\"xenon blue\\" Hella bulbs \\"Made in Germany\\". The actual item that arrived was a single conventional halogen bulb in a yellow cardboard box made by Hella \\"in India\\".

During installation, one of the bulb housing fell off, so I use silicon glue to stick it back on. For 80W, these pieces of crap are dimmer than my old PIAA 51W bulbs. Amazon is so nice, they refunded me in full. I recommend KENSUN HID light kit also from Amazon, oh my, big difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed...","review":"I bought these to give a slight boost to my headlights on back roads. The filaments are poorly positioned and give a spotty beam pattern. Nor did they appear any brighter than the bulbs I replaced in my 2002 Tahoe.Stick with a well engineered lamp like the Philips Vision Plus or Sylvania ExtraVision and you will be fine.Note: To those of you that put HID lighting in halogen style headlamps in order to look cool and blind oncoming traffic...STOP THAT!

I was wrong. This lock is way over priced at $40 or so and a similar lock with a thicker cable for probably 1/3 of the price or less can be had from Onguard or Kryptonite.This is a typical key cable lock that gives minimal security. I purchased it to at least lock the bikes to our rack so they could not easily be lifted, all of course when we travel with our bikes and keep them in view. This lock is not meant for security as a cable cutter will easily cut through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Cable Lock","review":"The lock is as described.

What a major disappointment. I can't believe this is the same group of individuals. There's none of the smart pop hooks of Navy Blues - just sloppy grunge. I could barely make it through one listen. It's nice to know that Sloan has evolved but wish I hadn't wasted the money finding that out."},{"rating":"2","title":"They Weren't Just R's","review":"I'm going on record as being astounded that Sloan's debut has only been reviewed three times. This is a runner up for my list of discs to take to a desert island! You may not love it as much as me but know this: I played it to death and every subsequent Sloan release, for me, is not the same. [First Frank Black solo did the same thing, so maybe it is just me.]You should start with Take It In or Sugartune, great all-time power-pop.Finally, in a clarification of good lyrics, can I be the first on the entire Internet [I've checked, even at Sloan dot com] to note the great play on words of the first song, \\"Overwhelmed\\", an all time jilted-nerd peon, which glorified rejection, way before Dashboard Confessional, though closer to Wonder Years in sitcomishness?The line is\\"She rolled her eyes, her beautiful eyes\\"which later reappears, kind of like Shakespeare:\\"She rolled her R's, her beautiful arse\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Can-Rock Classic","review":"Although this may not be Sloan's best album (most would suggest Twice Removed) it is an excellent collection of songs. Fans of My Bloody Valentine would appreciate this album as it is full of nicely distorted guitar work with light vocal harmonies on top. This album is similar to other sloan albums in that it contains excellently crafted songs but is quite different from other Sloan albums in style. Heavier, grunge-noise symphony replaces their later pop-rock anthem-esque stylings. Definetly an album that's enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paris Hilton? A Remake Of House Of Wax? Horror Film Indeed!","review":"Dreadful, just dreadful. Look how low we have sunk. We went from Vincent Price and Charles Bronson to Chad Michael Murray and Paris Hilton.

Watching her walking between two co-stars in HOUSE OF WAX, I was able to make that observation because the movie has little else to offer most of the time.The production values for a lame slasher film are excellent...but HOUSE OF WAX still plays like a lame slasher film. There's just nothing new here. It feels so by-the-numbers that I felt like I've seen this movie a hundred times before. When it was called FRIDAY THE 13th or the unnecessary remakes of THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE or...take your pick.There are moments but they're few and far between. The rest is just formula.When this movie came out, the producers actually marketed it to appeal to anyone who would want to see Paris Hilton brutally killed--which was pretty much the entire English-speaking population of the Planet Earth.Now that's hot."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least Paris Hilton dies!","review":"Its not that bad - and Paris Hilton does die well in it - we all cheered when she did!

It is better than people have been letting on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you people joking?","review":"I rented this movie based upon the fact that so many people think it's the greatest thing since sliced bread! I guess a person can enjoy it if you simply want to sit down and not use the brain God gave you at all! Most of the time, I go for the suspense thrillers like What Lies Beneath, The Sixth Sense, The Others, ect. House of Wax is simply a slasher flick with really good special effects. This movie left much to be desired for me personally, but hey it's your call."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and Not Scary","review":"I found myself pausing the movie and walking away quite a bit.

And if I were Paris Hilton I would steer clear of being on the same film as Elisha Cuthbert before people wake up and realize that despite all of the hype that Paris Hilton is an ugly racist coked out anorexic moron who's education goes no higher than a ged.

I ordered this used from who knows where and had hoped it would arrive \\"like new\\" as the seller described, but for like 4 dollars what could I expect? It wasn't too bad but the case smelled and looked like it came from a chain-smokers house, and the DVD had crap all over it. When the mail came I was so excited. . .but, oh well. Will not be buying used again because obviously saying \\"like new\\" is just a ploy to sell things that may not be what they seem. If you want to get this on Blu-Ray, which I highly recommend for its beautiful transfer and visually popping visuals is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hate It!!!!","review":"I hate this movie because they had some horrible acting in this movie and what was up with the melting house.

I mean, poor thing, is he even being paid or is he awaiting to befreed from slavery! I mean how obvious is the racism in Hollywood.Every single actor in the actual cast is listed in the credits except for him! I mean, whoever views the trailor and wants to petition against the exploitation of actors of color should post a message back. The racism is quite clear in 2005. I saw his name in the credits that are listed in fine print underneath the trailer image, but he is not receiving recognition- yet the no talent Paris Hilton bimbo has her name in bold letters on the trailer. He is a seasoned actor, her only work is as a porn harlot."},{"rating":"2","title":"movie wasnt that bad","review":"The first thing people need to remeber is that this was NOT intended to be a remake of The House Of Wax, but more of a remake of the movie Tourist Trap! So I went into the not expecting to much and I was not dissapointed at all. I mean it was far from the best horror film ive seen, but it was far from the worst. The Paris Hilton death scene is not to be missed. All in all its not a bad movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"scary","review":"wicked they need to make an updated version but nonetheless classic scary movie highly recommend go hurry rent it awesome"},{"rating":"2","title":"Special effects","review":"The story is a bit slow going, though you know based on the title, just what to expect.

The special effects are also great."},{"rating":"1","title":"House of Boredom","review":"SOME SPOILERS IF YOU HAVENT SEEN MOVIE ----------------How many times has a movie exactly like this been done? People not acting like they would in real life (I know it's a movie, but still)! Acting was pretty bad. I wound up forwarding most of the movie since they don't even get to the House until far into the movie. The plot and story were both unbelievable.Why make a whole town of wax, wouldn't it melt and the town was \\"hard\\" to get to so no one knew about the killings for years. whatever. dumb ending too that provides no satisfaction"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's all the Wax?","review":"Okay, let me tell you all that this movie is nearly a lie to the title. There is ALMOST NO death scenes with characters in the movie that involve getting Waxed alive(The 50's movie even had more, and look, the lower class generations could do better). I spotted about 2 scenes, that's it.Not only that, but all the characters are annoying and idiodic, Paris Hilton is by far the worst. The best part of the movie is her death scene(Spoiler:Spear through the head). And if you didn't cover up that spoiler I put in parenthesis, then I'm going to tell you that would be THE BEST reason to watch the film.Overall, I think this is for Slasher-Film-Nerds, that love horrible and cliche horror films.I'm thinking about making a remake soon that will be SO MUCH BETTER than this piece of Non-Waxed piece of crap with a spear in it.-Jacob(Son of this users account)"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"The begining was not good, when they try and introduce the characters and tell there story. There were some parts where I chuckled, not because there was a joke being told. But after that when the action started I quite enjoyed it. The killings were gruesome and cool. The end with the House of Wax melting down was really cool to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"I actually would rate this movie somewhere around 3.5 not the 4 stars I ended up giving it. It wasn't the greatest in the world, but it was definitely entertaining in a sick, twisted sort of way. Most other reviewers have commented on the whole Paris Hilton thing, and I would have to agree with many of them that her death was one of the highlights of the movie. That being said, however, I think one of the most entertaining members of the cast has been seriously overlooked, Brian Van Holt. Don't recognize the name? Then try this, the wonderful sadistic killer of the film. He's a great character actor, and just goes so over the top with his performance as Bo that I think he kind of steals the show from the rest of the cast.It's worth at least a viewing if you're into the horror genre at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Few Scary Moments but by and large a stupid film","review":"This film is not without a few scary moments but the acting is so poor (honestly Paris Hilton was terrible) and some of the location scenes so Hollywood backlot that the best parts of the film were shot in low light. The ending was cheap and predicable but the wax casting room was creepy. Several points didn't made any sense and the plot line was very weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am more disapionted than anything","review":"The story line behind this film was actually pretty interesting, the problem is that the abysmal acting and characters just ruined it for me.//SPOILER//The town was built by two crazy brothers killing people and encasing them in wax, and as always a group of teens stumbles across it and that is where things start. Maybe if it had simply had better actors I would have enjoyed it, but as it stood, I found myself wanting these people to die, but not liking the villains enough to want to go for them. It was a lose lose situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Violent and Gory","review":"Most people only bother to visit this site and write a product review when they loved the item. However, I wanted to give a warning to potential viewers. I wish someone had warned me before I spent my money! This movie is incredibly violent and gory. It doesn't give you a chance to turn away before something sickening happens. I'd love to be able to erase those images from my memory, now. I almost lost my lunch upon watching it. If that is your thing, you'll love this movie. If you're into suspense/thrillers and \\"atmospheric creepiness\\" like I am, be forewarned that you probably won't like this movie. I thought it would be like the Twilight Zone episode \\"The After Hours\\" (with the mannequins in the department store after closing time) and nothing could be further from the truth!!!! I thought \\"House of Wax\\" was awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"House of wax","review":"Paris Hilton is in this but don't let that atuomatically stop you from seeing this film, because it was very good. I borrowed it from blockbuster but halfway through it stoped working. Next day i went and bought the movie from walmsrt because i really enjoyed it so far and wanted to see the rest and I knew i would buy it sooner or later. Everything about the film is good, from the deaths to the acting. Don't listen to people who say this movie is crap because it's the same people no doubt who would think the remake of Psycho was great, and anybody who thinks that should be considered mental and dangerous. House of wax is a good remake, a rare find in deed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent horror movie!","review":"This movie scared the crap out of me and my girlfriend. Literaly. It has all the aspects of a good horror. It had the usual dumb characters, and bad acting. One thing I liked, was the style of the kills. They came fast, and unexspected. Like the part where the spear goes threw the car and kills Paris. That was totaly unexspected. I like that style of killing, I hate the old fashioned way, where the killer sneaks up behind the person and kills them, that's so predictable. One thing I loved about this movie is, yes, you get to see the hot, sexy Paris Hilton, in her bra and underwear. Very hot! Than you get to see her die, because even thou she is hot, she is dumb. So you get both good things. If you want a good movie to watch this Holloween. Buy this. And get a girl/boy to snuggle with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would give 0 stars if I could...","review":"I just finished watching this movie and I can't think of anything good to say about it. The attempted theme seems to be \\"good twin vs. bad twin\\" but no payoff is offered regarding the theme. I admit I prefer supernatural horror to gore-fest films but even gore can be carried off well with good plotting. The murder scenes in this film bordered upon ridiculous nor was it possible to sympathise or empathise with any of the victims since they exhibited the intelligence and survival skills of bread mold.THe final confrontation is disappointing, unless you like watching an actor and an actress wade, dig, and crawl through melting wax for about 10 minutes. Nor are any of the conflicts introduced in the begining of the story resolved in any way.I much prefer \\"Waxwork\\" as an example of museum horror. It's campy but still chilling and also a little intriguing."},{"rating":"1","title":"house of nuts","review":"so what else can u expect in a third grade horror flick..i've seen movies like FRIDAY THE 13 th..kinda stuff and this movie is in no way diferent than those moviesthe common story for a horror movie (or a movie with a serial killer ) :a bunch of teenagers hang out for a vacation sort of thing..with girls in their skimpy cloths kissing the boys and the killer starts killing one by one and one or two from the group manage to outsmart the killer and finally kills him..so this is the story line of the so called HOUSE OF WAX followin the trend of the JASON movies here there r these twin bros who kills their victims and displays them as a wax statue..this movie has some gruesome murder scenes which looks disgusting rather than terrific. so after much hype what parris hilton is doin in this movie ..after all she is just another chick who kisses her boyfriend ,strips and die awfully (the most horrible death in the movie).HOUSE OF WAX ..nuttin new"},{"rating":"2","title":"House Of Paris","review":"I loved house of wax i cant wait to get it i asked for it for christmas!Anyway Paris is in house of wax so heres some news about her-Her Album-tracklistTurn It UpComin' DownAll The Boys Are Chasin' Me f/Fat Joe & NellyThis Type Of GirlCall MeSpun (On The Scene)My MistakeSeductionAloudSo HotWhat You Do To MeZoned OutScrewedother songsBette Davis Eyesher first single of her cd is going to be \\"Turn it Up\\"!cant wait for more about her album it may be out Jan.06!Yes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where do I start...","review":"House of Wax is such a horrible remake of a classic film that it makes the also abysmal remakes of Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Amityville Horror look like Oscar nominees.

She's a dumbass and a complete idiot as it is but the fact that she's in horror movies makes me want to vomit! At least her character dies in the movie...MAKE THAT HAPPEN TO HER IN REAL LIFE!!!

It is boring, capricious, with terrible taste, without a credible script and where the special effects are just the only merits. There is a homage to What ever happened to baby Jane? with Victor Buono and Bette Davis in the middle of the film.The film is just a sum of previous related movies as Halloween and the Fall of Usher and there is not point of comparing with the other version directed by Andre de Toth. At least in this other work, there was a script, the presence of Vincent Price and a master film maker.Please, don't waste your time in that mediocre film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generally way bad. But some stuff is cool. SPOILERS.","review":"Paris Hilton dies, of course, in HOUSE OF WAX, and that's the reason I bought my ticket. I saw the movie at a midnight screening, which seemed appropriate, and I had fun watching it. The acting is cardboard, the plot is ridiculous, and the film bears no resemblence at all to Vincent Price's classic.Chad Michael Murray and Elisha Cuthbert take center stage as twins who find themselves trapped in a ghost town of wax figurines, stalked by a killer. The movie is generally silly. Still, there are several kickass moments in the movie. When Jared Padalecki is shaved and placed in a wax shower, for instance, the film is appropriately gruesome and fun. When the entire set comes tumbling down around the characters, that part is the best. And, as I said, Paris Hilton's death scene is reason enough to buy the ticket."},{"rating":"2","title":"HAI!!!!","review":"This movie is so good, I just had to buy it.

But, since that story has been told so many times ---and so much better in films like \\"Wrong Turn\\"--- you'll be disappointed by this gooey mess. It should be called \\"The Louisiana Paraffin Massacre\\". And, as has been pointed out by others, the makers of \\"Tourist Trap\\" ought to be hopping mad at this treatment of their idea. The film is NOT scary; it offers up some gore and ghastly effects (all done very well), but they're no substitute for fear. Plot, logic and sympathetic characters have all been eliminated. Think about it: a tourist attraction wax museum in a tiny town that isn't even on a map? And, the museum itself is made entirely of wax?

However, all is not what it seems in this quiet town that exists in the shadow of its wax museum...The acting is pretty good, with Elisha Cuthbert (who is gorgeous!), Paris Hilton (!), and the rest of the cast doing a good job.The plot and the setting are interesting, while the dialogues are just average.In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will provide for an evening's entertainment, as long as you're in that kind of a mood."},{"rating":"1","title":"The set was better then the actors","review":"Ive always like wax museums, it was better then any actors in this snore fest.

The best part of a DVD, in my opinion, is the director's commentary track. I love being told the bloopers, when the sunlight doesn't match from one scene to the next, and blurbs about the actors - especially their improvs to the dialogue. I had just listened to \\"The Whole Nine Yards\\" - another Bruce Willis movie - and that commentary was great. \\"The Kid's\\" commentary was very irritating because Spencer Breslin is just too young to do a commentary! Jon Turteltaub would just start telling a juicy tidbit and then Spencer Breslin would interrupt him! Jon Turteltaub even tried to gently admonish him for doing this! So basically, the commentary included practically nothing about Bruce Willis, which is the reason that most people watched the movie for - and by extension were listening to for!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely silly, typical DISNEY production","review":"I must recognize the fact that Willis gave his best and proved once and for all that he really can act in any time of movie. BUt this movie is boring, a chep Disney's catalogue product, with the same infernal soundtrack as always, a \\"funny\\"kid developed to catch the audience's emotion and all the custumary cliches from this studio.

I dont advise \\"The kid\\" to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry but I can't agree","review":"This story has been done dozens of times over the centuries -- the hardened, cynical adult looks back over their life and has an epiphany. Stories like this and Dicken's \\"Christmas Carol\\" seem to me to drag the audience through a lot only to get them to an ending which we all know -- bad guy turns good. I much prefer the twist versions of the story, like \\"Harold and Maude\\" and \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\", wherein the protagonist is a more likeable character who comes to see how much they are liked and valued by others in the world.

All of his makeovers only involve the exterior of his clients which is about as deep as Willis cares to get. He bullies his assistant (played by the delightful Lily Tomlin) and is indifferent to the girl who is in love with him. Suddenly he begins to see a red airplane in the sky about the same time a young boy appears in his condo. The boy turns out to be a younger version of himself who is not too pleased to see how he has grown up (no dog, no family, and he's not a pilot.) Willis is rude to the boy as first but begins to see that perhaps he has a few things to teach him. He begins to bond with the boy and becomes an altogether nicer person. There are a lot of loose ends in the movie and a lot of things are never explained but it is pleasant entertainment with likeable actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"This movie made me review my childhood and to see things in a different way.

When this movie first came out I didn't want to see it in the theatres. I don't think the trailer for this movie really did it justice. But a couple years later as a rental, I thought 'wow'. It resonates more with adults than children because you really have to be a grown up to understand or ask the questions: 'what would your nine-year old self think of the person you are today?

Pre-empting ALL future bands? Give me a break.)This stuff is neither the be-all, end-all of music, nor is it even very worthwhile on an artistic level. Many of these out-of-tune songs sound like they were written in five minutes by a very disturbed individual (which, it turns out, Cobain was).Not an album to remember. I also laugh at all the kids that were crying a river and holding all-night vigils over Cobain's suicide, as if he were their spiritual leader or something, or as if his lyrics really MEANT something important. (What the heck do half of them even mean, anyway? Damned if I can figure them out.) Cobain's decision to kill himself was tragic, but jeez, come on, people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nirvana isn't great; They're iffy","review":"The lack of production on this thing is really what kills it. \\"PennyRoyal Tea\\" and \\"Dumb\\" could've sounded more cohesive had they been produced as well as their Unplugged counterparts. \\"All Apologies\\" \\"Rape Me\\" and \\"HSB\\" are classics, but the rest isn't worth listening to. \\"Scentless Apprentice\\" is among Cobain's worst songs. So is the feedback squealer \\"RFUS\\". God, I hate all the praise critics heap on this band, and especially this album. Nevermind was the bands ONLY solid studio release. The rest is iffy. Yeah, that what Nirvana is; they're iffy. Sixteen Stone has better songs than the best material on In Utero, and Bush were trying to copy Nirvana's style!

Nirvana i think is a band that used that to convey The way they thaught of themselves and the world ,that nothing really matters. And that i dea that nothing reallly matters, life sucks, anti government, punk rock type stuffs is why i am giving 1 star because chanses are no one will read my review, and if you do, take my recomendation and buy this cd. 1 more thing i have the cd nirvana and its a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hardwoody, of Morgans Ferry","review":"Nirvana demonstrated their passion for what they did.

It blows away Nevermind by a million miles. The guitars are heavier, dirtier, and less calculated. Kurdt really disliked the production to Nevermind and wanted a less polished album. Well that is exactly what they got. The album is nearly perfect but beautifully flawed. In Utero starts out with the tuneful Serve the Servants and then flies right into their heaviest song Scentless Apprentice, which is one of my favorites. Rape Me is an absolute classic and I always enjoy playing it on my guitar. Another awesome track Frances Farmer describes how well Nevermind could have been if it was less produced. Nevermind is still a great album, but it does not come close to In Utero.

I loved Nirvana's first album, Bleach. In Utero was the first album that truly revisited the roots of true Nirvana music. The off-beat tunes on this album will push some away, but the poppy and stirring chords will keep most listening. My favorite song on In Utero was All Apologies, not because of the incredibly moving lyrics, even though they are spectacular, but rather the vibe the song gives off. Kurt had obviously been contemplating suicide before this song was written because it seems to be a farewell, an epitaph if you will, to all of his fans and people he loved who had not yet betrayed him yet, although this does leave a short list. I realize this theory does not sound very Cobain-esque, but maybe he couldn't help himself and maybe he just wanted us to realize that he still loved the music, he just couldn't take the people within the business any longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"last effort/ best effort","review":"ahhh..the last studio recording from nirvana, kinda makes you wanna cry doesnt it? this was perhaps their finest piece. kurt cobain really knew how to be emotional, but at the same time agressive. the real stand out tracks here are : all apologies, dumb, rape me, serve the servants, and frances farmer wil have her revenge on seattle. i know we will all miss kurt and he will live on through the music forever (as corny as that may sound, it is true)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"I got away from Nirvana for a while but am back listening to them with a vengeance.

They could have done another pop album similar to nevermind or they could create a album that they would be proud of. They obiviously chose the latter and they recieve praise from their true fans. This album is incredible, because they held to their artistic conscious and also it has amazing melodies and introspective lyrics. Honestly this album has a great variety of tunes from the harder songs like tourette's to the softer all apologies, nirvana truly came into their own with this album.

Other great songs include \\"Dumb\\", \\"Milk It\\", \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\", and the heart wrenching \\"All Apologies\\".

Key tracks are: Serve the Servants, Scentless Apprentice, Heart Shaped Box, Rape Me & All Apologies.

In Utero has minimal clever melodies and is basted in shrieks, feedback and painful jabbing noises. It's doctored with intentionally sloppy production, a high as a kite Raw Power Iggy Pop would have rejected. In Utero is depressing.

You all are bragging about the lyrics and how deep they are, but they bore me to tears. Whine and complain about how awful life is. Tell me something I don't already know.

This music won't lift you up !"},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD was rather stupid","review":"I'm 14 (using my mom's account) and this cd was dumb! maybe if i was high i would like it more but i didn't like it very much. I'll stick to Linkin Park and Papa Roach! And yes i do own this cd. (Nirvana-In Utero) I might b the only one puttin it down but when u get this cd u will put it down unless tha is ur a druggy cause it's mainly tha kind of music.....Hope you like my review. 100% true. Lata.............I'm out"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best record Nirvana ever made","review":"Although this was not as commercial as 'Nevermind' 'In Utero'was a huge songwriting leap from 'Nevermind' and generally, shall we say,more angry than it's predecessor.Cobain's ability to draw in the listener was still there as was his hatred for the MTV audience he despised.In utero was basically a record about his life, Never had a star like Cobain laid himself so bare.For example Heart shaped box was about his love for his wife, 'Serve the Servants' was about how his father had let him down,'All apologies' was about the dissapointment he had for himself and in 'Dumb' it talked about getting high (a subject Cobain knew all to well).The bottom line is that if you don't already have this album then buy it otherwise you'll really be missing out."},{"rating":"2","title":"verse chorus verse","review":"I'd put this above Nevermind because it's more raw which is what Cobain was more about. At first I gave it 3 stars but it's grown on me more lately. Cobain was a smart musician. Too bad his bandmates didn't share his same artistic ideals."},{"rating":"2","title":"great, but couldve been even greater","review":"I like this cd for different reasons then what i liked about nevermind. all of the songs on nevermind are good and easy to listen to, but while there are some not so good songs on In Utero there are some GREAT songs on In Utero.serve the servants, heart-shaped box, dumb, pennyroyal tea and all apologies are all good reasons to give thius album 5 stars, but the sound quality isnt too great when it coulve been improved, and there are afew songs that i just dont like (milk it, tourettes)so in short this is a great album that u shoud buy if u like nirvana, but this couldve been 5 stars with better sound quality and better song writing"},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Must Have A Grunge Album","review":"Here's what separates Nirvana and In Utero from its many imitators: humor, intelligence, and groove. Oh sure there's yelling (\\"Turette's\\") and whining (\\"Pennyroyal Tea\\") but without the other elements, this album would be a drag. Eminently quotable, very song is a grab bag of references and Hemingway-quality insight. Dig this from the song \\"Dumb\\": \\"I think I'm dumb ... or maybe just happy.\\" Has there any been any more profound line in the 90's? Nope. And there's more, besides! Takes awhile to get used to the guitar sonics, but worth the trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great recording!","review":"Rape me and All apologies are two of nirvana's best songs, and they alone make this album worth buying. I just want to correct one of the other reviewers in saying that without Nirvana, Offspring would not exist. Nirvana released their debut album \\"Bleach\\" in 1990, and The Offspring released their debut album \\"The Offspring,\\" in 1989. Besides, they are two completely different styles of rock music, Nirvana being grunge and Offspring being punk-pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nirvana's true studio sound!","review":"This cd truely shows that Kurt, Nova, and Dave are meant to be with each other. Everything is so great. It has that live sound but it's studio recorded. Buy it. If you thought Nevermind was a great cd because of all the hits just listen to this one. It has true emotion. Kurt is at his best, as usual. Thanks Kurt."},{"rating":"2","title":"NIRVANA","review":"If u love nirvana u should check this band out all their influences include nirvana their name is cannibal garden their site is http://www.cannibalgarden.cjb.net/ you should spread the word around about them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Nirvana album","review":"First of all, MasterShake, you're an dumba$$. Pardon my language. Puddle of Mudd was way after Nirvana's time. Hell, Kurt probably could've babysat for them around that time. Not taking anything away from Puddle of Mudd but Nirvana is, was, and will always be better. I've read your other reviews too saying that Alice in Chains is a rip off of Godsmack and once again... AIC was before Godsmack's time. Now i don't know if you wrote the review to be an a$$ but that's the kind of stuff we don't need on the boards. You give your honest opinion and know your facts before you post. Anyways, In Utero IS the best Nirvana album beating out the commercialized Nevermind. Nevermind is also a great album but In Utero's grungy and gritty sound of guitars and the thunderous drums on songs like \\"Serve the Servants\\" and \\"Heart Shaped Box\\" make In Utero one of the best albums of the 90's."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of the GREATEST Cd's Off All Time","review":"Everyone who likes good music should buy this cd. Kurt Cobain was the greatest musician who ever lived and you can see his soul,love,and pain in this record.Great recording of 12 increadible songs.I recommended this cd to anyone who likes rock and not the hair band non sence of the 80's! If you want a cd with passionate lyrics and gut renching rock! Then Buy this cd NOW!! **KURT Cobain Rest In Peace**"},{"rating":"2","title":"far better than nevermind","review":"When I first listened to this album I was surprised how unpleasant and harsh some of the songs were compared to their big hit album, Nevermind. But over time I've come to appreciate this CD what it is, a collection of some good punk/grunge songs, and a reaction against the commercial success of their second and most famous album. How typical that the radio songs on this album are the worst, even though they're just the kind of Top 40 ear candy people wanted from Nirvana's third major release. This CD takes some getting used to, but it's definitely worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful.","review":"Kurt really shows his songwriting talent on this one. It has a Darker tone than Nevermind but is more emotional and beautiful at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"First thing first, Nirvana was and still is maybe the best Grunge band ever!!!My favourite Nirvana in order(1-10)1.

A little uneven in places and kind of odd sometimes, it is nevertheless a classic album and a must have for any Nirvana fan. If you want to get into Nirvana, get this and Nevermind. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Nirvana!!","review":"I bought this and discovered it's not Nirvana, it's some whiny band from seattle who do a bad MTV-version of Mudhoney. I also can't see why they need an \\"explicit\\" version and a \\"clean\\" version when you can't understand a single word. Two thumbs aiming downwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Click Click Boom!!!","review":"I wouldn't let these greasy unwashed no talneted f$@&s pump gas into my car. Cobain reminds me of Lars Ulrich in that he wanted everyone to feel sorry for him. MTV sure helped them fill their bank accounts. The only thing I regret is that when Cobain offed himself in his garage was that his junky wife wasn't there to follow his example."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a sorry excuse for music","review":"Hey, fan from Fetcham, England.... I'll take Britney Spears or the Spice girls any day over this convoluted self-indulgent piece of trash. The only reason I gave it one star is because I couldn't give it no stars. I mean, I guess the cover of the CD is descent, and \\"All Apologies\\" is ok, but the rest is just awful. Thankfully, we are finally getting out of the trendy angry-depressing music that Nirvana introduced to the mainstream. If Dave Grohl would have been at the helm rather than Kobain, Nirvana would have been a good band. But if that sorry piece of scum was still alive, you wouldn't hear \\"Nirvana's the best band of the 1990s.\\" You'd here, \\"Ahhh, Nirvana's just another Soundgarden,\\" which they are, except Soundgarden's better. This CD is just plum awful. Please don't buy it. It is deconstructive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nirvana=Teenage fixated sh*t","review":"I don't know why SOOOO many teens these days think it's so cool to like Nirvana , like what are they one drugs? , yeah they probably are or maybe they think Kurt Kobain is so cool . Kurt Kobian was an idiot and shot heroine in his veins too much he f*cked himself over. The guy had a total problem and therefore he ain't cool at all. The music is a bunch of annoying sounds which I personally can't stand , I listened to this album at a party , whoa it sucked. Nirvana really suck"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong fans wrongly believe could do no wrong...","review":"Everyone says Cobain's a genius. OK, Prove it. Where's the proof that he supposedly is of above average intelligence? Just because you wrongly believe he could do no wrong (wow! See? I can do a play on words like Kurt! I must be a genius too!) doesn't mean he's worthy of the god-like status his suicide catipulted him to. The In Utero production is horribly muddy, and yes, after rethinking it, Kurt chickened out at the last minute and called up Albini to try to fix it, but Albini couldn't re-engineer anything he engineer in the first place. The songs are OK, but the most pretentious thing is to try to be unpretentious, so I guess Nirvana is the most stuck up hick group in the west. Whatever. Nevermind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only I know true pain... Starbucks got my caramel latte order wrong and gave me a mocha!","review":"If In Utero doesn't make you wanna score some heroin, shoot up, read Hunter S. Thompson, and hobnob with Johnny Depp, then you're not good enough to be listening to it. Only a select few of us have the privilege of being in pain. Only we, the people of Seattle know true destitution; we lost the pure embryonic genius of our own Kurdt Kobane over a decade ago. F*ck off, rest of the country! He's ours!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"In Bloom\\" is the best Nirvana album","review":"I am sort of puzzled by the last reviewer... \\"there's no rapping\\". Hmm... what kind of person doesn't know that Nirvana is a GRUNGE group not a RAP or ROCK/RAP group. Anyway, this album is by far my favorite by this band. These songs stick out to me when i look at the track list... \\"All Apologies\\", \\"Radio Friendly Unit Shifter\\", \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\", and \\"Rape Me\\". But, I love every song on this album. This album is worth the money same goes with the other Nirvana albums. And remember people... NIRVANA IS NOT A RAP GROUP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nirvana's best album by a landslide","review":"Nirvana's IN UTERO proves that if Nirvana continued to make records, they would up there with the greats. They only had four albums to prove their talent, and IN UTERO is the only one that shows it 100%. With Kurt Cobain, music lost the only true lyricist along with a few others that could truly write lyrics and songs that penetrated deep into the human soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"In Utero","review":"After four years owning this album, I still can't get used to it. I'm not sure if it's the walls of feedback and really lame solos or if it's just Cobain's bad screaming. Maybe it's a combination of all three. There are a few standout tracks such as Serve The Servants, Rape Me, Heart Shaped Box, Dumb, Pennyroyal Tea, and All Appologies.Less than half the album is worth listening to. If the other seven tracks were equally as good as the five mentioned above, I think we'd have a decent album on our hands and I could write a good review for it. But unfortunately, the rest just seems to be repetative screaming and feedback...and even though I grew up with grunge, I still can't get used to the drivel on this record. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw and Haunting","review":"The most raw, powerful and honest CD I have ever listened to. I listened to it with headphones yesterday, and the voice and lyrics were absolutely haunting; full of pleading and pain. The fact that it is less refined than nevermind gives it raw energy and power. Some of the songs are meloncholy and slow, while others scream out rage. The over-all effect is startling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Nirvana","review":"I long for music like this now that the Seattle music scene is all but dead. While Nevermind was broke barriers, it was still meant for the masses. In Utero was more typical of Nirvana's earlier music (Incesticide, Bleach), and every track is great. Pure adrenaline pumping music, with bits of soft delight mixed in (Dumb, All Apologies). Dumb has to be one of Cobain's greatest songs. If you like this, also buy Incesticide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nirvana = Best Band Ever","review":"In this album, Cobain displays his most admirable presentations of the way he feels, especially in \\"Heart Shaped Box.\\" Although it wasn't as moving and weird as Nevermind, it still is a must for all Nirvana fans, end of story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The sound of a soul in torment","review":"Kurt Cobain hated fame, but did nothing to avoid it. He was trapped by his own heroin-fuelled self-pity and his damaged childhood. He lived in pain from a psychosomatic stomach complaint and was married to Courtney Love - which must have been a pretty extreme experience.This album is the loudest suicide note in history. When Kurt wanted to call the album 'I Hate Myself and I Want to Die', he meant it.I bought this incredible prolonged howl of despair when it first came out, and Kurt's suicide just seemed inevitable. An amazing artistic statement, but like a Van Gogh or a Tchaikovsky Symphony, the product of an undoubtedly disturbed mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT VERY GOOD","review":"This is definitely close to one of THE WORST nirvana albums out there. This is NO Nevermind which was the god of all Nirvana albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"In Utero","review":"In Utero is Nirvana's follow up to their highly success debut Nevermind. Quality wise In Utero is about the same as Nevermind, a fair album from a fair band. Highlights include: Heart Shaped Box, and Rape Me.

With a mixture of embarrassingly pretentious lyrics, and horrendously bad playing, anyone with some amount of reasoning will be able see that this isn't the masterpiece the reading material in your local grocery store magazine rack says it is. The online rhyming dictionary can make better plays on words than Cobain does. But then again, nobody slurs their words together with that heroin-induced drawl better than \\"Kurdt\\" does."},{"rating":"1","title":"I still want negative stars!","review":"I could tell you it sucks, or I could read too much into this album like most of the braindead nirvana fans out there. Cobain was not a genius and this album is not art. Get a copy of Bleach, and then buy up some MetallicA. There's more to life than 3 chords and flat singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"POP","review":"The people who give this album good reviews show that they know nothing about the nature of music. Even someone that has a rudimentary knowledge of scales will see just how poor and simple this album is. If you like Nirvana, you have no right to critisize todays mainstream pop. It's no different. Please, someone tell me how this is so great and innovative? Power chord changes, incredibly simplistic and repetative bass lines, etc. What am I missing? You wanna see some real guitar playing? Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, Slash, Randy Rhoads, Zakk Wylde, Leo Kottke, and Tuck Andress to name a few."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another 90's depress me album.","review":"This is just another run of the mill massively overrated 90's depress me, dead classic.

Alice in Chains came out way before Godsmack did, and just for the record Godsmack sis horrible. Nirvana came out nearly 8 years before Puddle of Mudd which isn't Grunge. Grunge died when Kurt died. But back to the album, this is the greatest Grunge CD ever, not one song on this CD is sub- par. Nirvana is the greatest Grunge band ever period, all who think otherwise can check out their CD sales numbers, then check back with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forever in debt to your priceless advice...","review":"In Utero is sincerity and genuine emotion in its most raw form reflected in amazing melodies with Kurts unique guitar styles and unforgettable voice singing lyrics so deep and personal you can't help but agree that Nirvana lives on. The diversity shown on this album is unbelievable, you can listen to every single track without skipping once...if you do then your missing out! As a teenager who is into alternative music, people often automatically think that listening to Nirvana means that I am burning up with teenage angst, lock myself in my room and listen to that shallow nu-metal american ****. However, this is totally not true, Nirvana are a true inspiration for anyone, regardless of their age, gender or race. I'm not in awe of the suicide image but i hold sooo much respect for the amazing music Nirvana created. Kurts a worthy legend and will always live on, in his words...peace, love and empathy."},{"rating":"2","title":"two thumbs way way up","review":"a fantastic cd, and i highly recommend it to anyone that likes good guitar riffs, haunting lyrics, and blistering vocals. at points it veers into mindless noise, but it fits perfectly. 2 thumbs way way up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUSICAL EMBODIMENT OF TOURETTES SYNDROME","review":"With hindsight this album was actually Kurt Cobain's suicide note. The sinister, often brutal production techniques of Steve Albini worked in total harmony (something of a paradox I know)with Cobain's lyrics of helplessness and hatred for the human race. Anybody who has witnessed the final seconds of \\"Rape Me\\" or \\"Scentless Apprentice\\"'s chorus must admit to having a slight inkling that not all was well inside Mr. Cobain's head."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Best Records Of The 90's","review":"This is by far the best Nirvana album. I love how stripped down the production is; some will say that it's a little sloppy, but to me, it wouldn't be the same if it was a polished production. Kurt Cobain's vocals on this album are affecting and effective, especially on \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" [my favorite Nirvana song] and \\"All Apologies\\". Add that to the stellar songwriting and Dave Grohl's amazing skills behind the kit, and the result is a great rock album that stands the test of time years after its release. A must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than 'Nevermind'","review":"Personally, I prefer this to their megahit, 'Nevermind'. It is much rawer, less accessible and everything Kurt Cobain wanted it to be. The only exception to that I suppose would be that it was still a hugely successful album. Not as much so as 'Nevermind', but it still has sold 5 million copies, which is nothing to sneeze at."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have.","review":"If you like your grunge dirtied up and sludgy, and your lyrics meaningful, just buy this...really it should be in your house right now.

The keyboard parts fit in the songs better on Puritanical, but the songs on this one are really great. They didn't use too many clean vocals on this one either. All the tracks on this are as chilling sounding as Emperor's IX Equalibrium, and that's a great symphonic metal album. Don't pass this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brutal Pack of Norwegians","review":"Dimmu Borgir hailed from Norway as the most savage and skilled by their blending of the brutality of black metal,opera beauty with melancholy and the products of industrial metal.The organ playing in ''reptile'' sounds haunting and may be the best to listen to with others that have power.The things that Cradle of Filth have done before and Emperor can be here with organ playing but Dimmu Borgir will take you on a blast of winter for your choice with mindlessness like Satyricon had a review on hit parader.A special guest appearance is made on this album by Simon of Borknagar then to me this music doesn't appear as Satanic or evil.The songs might be boring and long for some to listen to but this is a good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is metal!","review":"This is a great album. Every song is good.It's black metal , and the syntehsizers give a great \\"atmospheric\\" sound. Shagrath's vocals are very good. The instrumental is great.

Everyone should own this cookbook. Put together very well, lot's of recipes and cute stories and copies of menues from days gone by. I have made over 50 of the recipes and all have just been wonderful. My favorite is the biscuits and chocolate gravy. Definately buy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rave Review from Breakfast Fans","review":"As one who starts every day with breakfast, it is a treat to come across a real book dedicated to the meal. Not to say every breakfast is fancy in our household, so finding a recipe for crunchy granola with flavor but not cups of oil has made it a standard for us. And, the Galisteo Inn's Cornmeal Scones may soon eclipse my husband's favorite buttermilk biscuits on weekends. Thanks for the tip on freezing unbaked scones- I've been giving frozen morsels to lazier friends for their Sunday morning enjoyment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book was highly rated, and we love a good breakfast. I was soooo disappointed when I realized three of the pages had been torn out. The price was quite low, but it still should have been noted. I returned it, but as many books as I buy, I've never had this happen. Seller should have checked."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for the everyday family breakfast","review":"While this book would be perfect for someone who owns a B&B, its just not practical for weekday mornings for a family of 2! It is very informative, if just a bit snobbish; With the exception of several pictures all together in the middle of the book, it is just black on white, with very small print. Also, unless you have at least a bit of experience, I can imagine it would be frustrating and time intensive. Its probably not the thing for you if you like a \\"coffee-table\\" cookbook that allows you to salivate just by looking at the pictures, making it much more likely that you'll try them out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breakfast any time of day works for me...","review":"This book is filled with great recipes that make your smile as you eat.

We tried replacing the batteries, etc., and could not get it to work again. Now he just has a \\"hard\\" stuffed animal. I probably should have taken it back, but since I had ordered it online, I was unsure if I would have problems. My son was very disappointed,as he wanted this toy badly. Since the price has dratically dropped, I debated getting him another one, but after a review from another consumer, I am hesitant.Maybe Disney ought to rethink and get involved with their defective toys. It doesn't matter where it was purchased, it comes from Disney."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sing on Simba","review":"Lion King (Singing Simba) is a really enjoyable toy that your child will enjoy playing with over and over again. He's simply a delight that I even enjoy playing with. I highly recommend this singing Simba, my 3 year old son just loves to hear Simba singing the lion king song. It's makes a perfect Christmas gift for children 4 and under."},{"rating":"2","title":"So you wanna see how it all went down???","review":"Mr. & Mrs. Smith had me entranced and I think it was more because of all that has transpired between Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt. I did not see this film in the movie theater. I watched it on DVD and I could see how in the beginning of the movie, they were cold and distant from one another, as where by the end of the movie, they seemed to be very much connected. I like to see the Director's cut.However, I thought the premise of the movie was cute, especially in the high speed chase on the freeway and they were having a get to know you better discussion and everything seemed all new as they were shooting at other agents. This movie has comedy, action, adventure and romance.Vince Vaughn is hilarious in this film, from what I understand he did a lot of adlibbing in this film...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally! A movie worth watching!","review":"A movie that had a lot of humor and action combined! This is a movie recomended for EVERYONE (over the age of 13 of course). Four stars...why?

The last third, or so, really drags...lest I forget though, Vince Vaughn is a total hoot in it, providing much needed comic relief and entertainment value...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Standard Hollywood Fare","review":"If you like your movies to be full of whizz-bang escapism, no major storyline or ponderables then this is the movie for you. Plenty of guns, action, comedy, good looking stars, and Vince Vaughn adds his usual spark of comedy. But in the grand scheme of movie making it is pretty much a throw away item, a good example of the current Hollywood movie making standards. Turn on and dis-engage brain."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"I really like this movie. My husband and I have watched it 4 or 5 times so far. It was just as funny the last time as the first. Only thing, my husband really laughs almost TOO much when they are fighting in the house. I might have to watch my back. TONS of action, very much the same flavor of Bourne Supremacy, but with a twist of romance. \\"Ask us the sex question\\". My favorite line in the movie.You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEMISTRY LEFT IN THE ACTOR'S TRAILER","review":"Unbeknownst to each other, Mr and Mrs Smith (Brad and Jolie) are assassins, very good assassins. They met \\"on the job\\", fell in love, and got married but kept their murderous alter egos secret from each other. Now, however, they don't like each other very much. When they both have the same \\"job\\" to do, their animosity turns into violence toward each other. MR AND MRS SMITH had good potential as a story but instead devolves into is a slick but pedestrian and superficial shoot-em-up. And you know what? I didn't sense any on-film chemistry between Brad and Jolie. They must have left their passion for each other in the actor's trailer before the shoots. MR AND MRS SMITH reminds me a little of THE WAR OF THE ROSES, a much better film about marital conflict that gets physical, although, of course, the plot lines are not that similar. Brad is always cool, but I don't get all the fuss over Jolie: she bored me as did the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"STUPID STUPID STUPID","review":"Ok first of all there are so many things wrong with this movie. Lets start with the idea of the movie. HORRIBLE. You dont have crazy killers liveing in the same house. Dumb ok. Ok then we have the catch phrases. Like when they are fighting, Brad says whos your dady. Then Angelina kicks him out of jelousy and totally steals his catch phrase, she just adds a now to it. Then they blow up there house cause there dumb. The worst part was when they were in that gunfight full of people. They got those super body armors. Not one of those F***ing idiots thought about shooting them in the head. COME ON MAN, its a no brainer. Shot them in the head and POOOOOOOOOOOOOOOFFFFF, problem done. Thats why i give this movie 1 bullet wound out of 5.(P.S. if you want action and greatness, i suggest the pest.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrated review","review":"Amazon seems to be mixing together reviews of this product and the regular, unrated version of it, so I will say right off the bat that my review is for the Unrated DVD edition of this movie. So please don't vote it unhelpful just because Amazon put it in the wrong place!Basically, the unrated disc is a waste of money. For one, \\"unrated\\" only refers to less than a minute of previously cut footage from the big love scene. But for some reason, the people who cut this version of the movie actually cut OUT scenes from the original DVD -- scenes that actually added to the plot, whereas none of the restored scenes do. This is quite aggravating. In addition, none of the extras make this DVD worth owning. They should have made this cut of the movie available on the original DVD release instead of giving it its own release. This was an obvious ploy to make more money, and I'm quite sorry that I fell for it. Here's hoping my review keeps you from doing the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unrated Differences","review":"The Unrated Collector's Edition is for anyone who saw the original in theaters and wished that there had been just a little less rushing. The Unrated edition adds more than ten minutes of extra footage -- mostly adding a couple of minutes to each of the big fight sequences (most noticeably, the car chase scene, where some extra dialogue is added). The second disc includes many behind-the-scenes bits on the cinematography and direction, as well as script development. Not a bad choice for those who don't own another version, and true fans of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"nada after all the hype","review":"I was expecting a lot more out of this film after seeing the previews.It was really a stupid film based on a silly storyline. Special effects with nothing to hold them and most definitely no real bystanders standing by in scenes. There weren't any police or security guards or everyday people standing by when the Smiths were shooting up everything everywhere. It's a romantic dream that only Pitt and Jolie would share. I was impressed with Jolie in Taking Lives & have now went back to my original opinion of her starring in surface movies where the acting is at a minimum. Same with Pitt. The special effects and shoot-em up scenes were continually one after the other and the cute lines fell flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad version of 'prizzi's honor'","review":"this movie is so bad that i simply couldn't finish it. why this movie would be remade to renew the old 'prizzi's honor' is beyond my wits. this movie was just dumb and childish. totally ridiculous and shallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real silly movie! Too much action & too little plot!","review":"A real silly movie! Reminds me of the Spy vs. Spy cartoon in MAD Magazine. I saw it on Cable and switched channels half-way through. There's such a thing as TOO MUCH ACTION in a movie, and on top of it, it had very little plot! I wouldn't have paid a dime to see it at the show or to rent the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another True Lies? NOT!","review":"This poor attempt at re-creating the magic of True Lies fails miserably. Both Brad Pitt & Angelina Jolie are extremely stiff in their roles as the stereotypical upper-middle class couple in appearance that are secretly government operatives. Of course their next sanctions are each other. Their attempts at murdering each other is way below the caliber of The War of the Roses and Vince Vaughn plays a poor version of Tom Arnold's character from True Lies. The special effects pale compare to any of the Charlies Angel's films or even True Lies which is about 15 years old. Better to wait for this one to come to cable than to waste your money on it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing Actors - Pitt and Jolie Hold This One Together","review":"This movie is 100 percent enjoyable entertainment. It's a Pitt and Jolie masterpiece; but there's surely nothing challenging about the plot beyond watching both these superstars strut their amazing and magnetic screen stuff. But, it's nevertheless enough to entertain with breathless random. I liked this movie because of the crazy twists in the plot and the witty and camp style of the alluring dialogue. This is a good Saturday night movie with just enough chick flick appeal melded with high quality testosterone. I'd watch it again, just to see Pitt and Jolie together. They are as masterful in their creative roles as the Movie plot is preposterous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb and dumber","review":"Two bankable stars. One, beautiful, with full pouty lips, and the other one, Angela Jolie. And, yet, the movie she and Brad Pitt made together just didn't click. Once again, a director, Doug Liman in this case, takes a so-so script with high-budget stars and covers up its failiings with lots of explosions, gun fire, car chases, and dead bodies by the score. The banter between Brad and Angela was contrived and only occasionally witty. The fight scenes were utterly fake and the ending was straight out of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid but with less realism. Fortunately, I went into this movie with low expectations and, much to my relief, they were met."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR AND THE BAD MOVIE","review":"POOR AND BAD MOVIE..DONT BUY THIS ...BUY CSI , 24 HOURS , MAGNUM PI AND OTHER MUCH BETTER STUFF ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth it","review":"Definatly not worth seeing. I think the only reason this movie made any money at the box office was because of the rumored realationship between Angelina & Brad. I can't beleive Brad Pitt even did this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty people....but not much else.","review":"Beautiful people to watch, lots of action and violence (if that's what you enjoy), but a disappointing screenplay and a somewhat incoherent plot. As two married assassins who are ignorant about each other's profession, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are a good match, with lots of chemistry (obviously!), but this film doesn't do much for either of them. The story had great potential, but wasn't written nearly as well as it could have been. Despite Angelina's outstanding beauty, my husband walked out in the middle of the movie! I stuck it out to the bitter end, but was very disappointed with the ending. If you like a film with some substance, don't waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly, unrealistic, shallow!","review":"This movie actually kept me interested up until the two main characters blew each others cover, after that it got sillier and sillier by the second.

Overall: BORING and BADDDDDD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland, bland, bland","review":"Jolie and Pitt look great, but have zero chemistry in this insipid, overlong action-comedy.

Not fun, just dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Disappointment","review":"A Brad Pitt fan, I looked forward to this movie.After viewing it, it was one of the few movies I put in my discard pile.The plot was very thin, the special effects and noise were too much, and the overall impact was utter disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"why can't this be released once","review":"what is with these unrated and newly found clips releases, I'm not going to buy another copy of this movie for a ending that was left on the floor and now a studio wants to release another version...Can I trade my old version for this one?

Certainly not the story. Two killers married to each other, keeping their respective careers a secret until one day they're contracted to hit the same target. Then trying to figure out if the one is trying to take out the other. All fluff and eye candy. And the ending that has moments akin to Butch and Sundance..........well it's just silly."},{"rating":"2","title":"My all time favorite","review":"Personally I like dark comedies. Up until Mr. And Mrs. Smith, My all time favorite was Grosse Pointe Blank. But when this movie came out, I said to myself \\"THIS MOVIE ROCKS!!!\\" it's dark but not so dark that it puts people to sleep. This movie has outstanding Action sequences, great humorous lines, a good looking actor, and the most beautiful actress of all time. You can't go wrong with these factors plus a soundtrack with nothing but love songs and the director of \\"The Bourne Identity\\". This movie is at the very least a must see."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen.I usually will see a movie to it's end good or bad, but this one I just could not sit through.Jolie, in this role, is not believable in any stretch of the imagination. She just does not come across as tough enough to fight her way out of a paper bag. Pitt on the other hand handles the part in his usuall way of handleing this kind of role. The inconsistency in this production was the only thing that made it somewhat laughable. Of course I have to remind myself of the fact that there is a magic formula in Hollywood. All you have to do is put two sexy superstar actors together in the same movie and the rest will take care of itself good or bad. I say no thanks. Nothing to do? Watch paint dry rather than view this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I received this video and it looked okay. No visible scratches on the back or anything recognizably wrong. However, there are spots in the dvd that will pause and not play without skipping the scene.

The face is still there and the lower legs, altho skinny. The rest is matronly and tightly corsetted. The plot is dated and clumsy, the action also. Much is made of the use of computers, but it is obvious that they are add-ons - not really integrated into the story.The magnificent DVD \\"So Close\\" exemplifies modern high tech action in which computers are fully integrated into the story.

Now if i say any more you will find out what happens. if you want to know how it ends GET the movie......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply a rip off","review":"This movie is terrible. I am insulted that I paid real money to see this. When you have two actors as great as Brad and Angelina, a movie should not possibly be able to go wrong but this one did.

Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A-Team Fan gets given the last 10 minutes.","review":"What is it with some directors and editors? This had the makings of a great movie.. action, comedy, decent story and good characters... then with 10 minutes of the movie remaining, the director & producer went home and left the rest up to a fan of the A-Team. Both characters out in the open, 50000 bullets, outnumbered 20-1 and ... well, I really do not want to spoil the ending for you :) I mean, come on ! .. a 12 year old could have written a better finish.However, forgetting the ending for a moment, this was a good movie and I do recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Perfection!","review":"This is the third version that I have purchased of this movie, and I am glad to support it with my copious amounts of money! I did know at the time of my second purchase (wide screen instead of full) that the movie came in Unrated edition, but I could not find it (too young to know about Amazon at the time) but I recently remembered that this edition existed, and alas, here it is! This movie is so much better than the original, but a few lines here or there do change, and a couple scenes are a bit different. All of that aside, this movie is much better than the original version and I am so glad that I purchased it. It includes bloopers, and a ton of deleted scenes (if you are as into special features as I am) which were entertaining, along with other bonus material. It was a great buy and I would recommend it to anyone that has not seen the movie, or to people that already own it but in PG-13 format."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. and Mrs Pitt","review":"A fun, action comedy, that displays the extraordinary chemistry between these two great actors.

Don't miss this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sure Cure for Insomnia","review":"Unless you just like to look at pretty people, this movie has nothing to offer. It is boring beyond belief. There is no story line!! Well, something might develop in the second half because we just walked away. I couldn't believe that this had as high a rating as it does. What I saw was meaningless, unrealistic and just plain stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this movie serious or what?","review":"Mr. and Mrs. Smith has all the elements of a summer blockbuster. Pitt and Jolie are beautiful people with great chemistry and there is a lot of action. Unfortunately, there is no plot or no common sense to this movie. I didn't know how to take it. Is it supposed to be a realistic spy story? Is it a cartoonish shootout? I just don't know. How can a couple that love each other try and kill each other then make love in the next scene? Hard to care about the characters when the act in 2 total opposite directions. How can I take the plot seriously when Pitt and Jolie single handedly kill 100 armed killers by themselves? There is no bad guy, there is no plot. Just a lot of violence and confusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old story","review":"Dreadful from the beginning.

Far too much unstylish gun plays, and the fist fight between Pitt and Jolie was not so stimulating. They are supposed to be the world's top assasins, and they fought more like amateurs. Don't even want to compare those fight scenes to some of the better Hong Kong action thrillers or even James Bond or Charlie's Angels had more graceful looking action choregraphy. The massive explsion of the house, and the highway chase scene were relatively impressive. They should have done more high-tech stunts like the one when Jolie escapes from the window of a high rise building. Perhaps the director didn't want to put his stars through any heavy-duty stunts since it's not a serious action movie to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mighty FART","review":"I have finally figured out a way to defeat Al-Qaeda.

Make up your own mind... and rent another movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is the Pitts!","review":"It is a shame that a great talent like Brad Pitt is teamed up in a mumble dialogue with Angelina Jole. This movie has absolutely no plot or story line. The action scenes are just noise and have no sequencing that even resembles a believeable scenario. After watching Brad in \\"Troy\\", it was hard to believe this is the same actor. His movie partner is an actress? They tried to base this movie as a comedy, but nobody is laughing.

Brad Pitt was even worse than Angelina Jolie, which is really saying something. The action sequences were so ridiculous that I couldn't even sit back and just enjoy the \\"fluff\\".

There is never a dull moment. I strongly recommend this must have movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just fun stuff!","review":"For simple fun, you can't beat an actioner about a husband and wife trying - for most of the film, anyway - to kill each other in the most creative ways. Jolie and Pitt have real chemistry, regardless of what the tabloids might tell you, and Mr. And Mrs. Smith allows Pitt to flex his considerable comedic muscle. This is the best civil-war-under-the-same-roof flick since The War Of The Roses; it's light, fast, funny and visually appealing - and the combatants survive both each other and one of the campiest, most over-the-top shootouts I've ever seen. Suspend disbelief, and this film is a very satisfying fun-fest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectttttttttttttttttttt","review":"This movies is a classic in its own right...

Then it tries to make up for that in the second half by adding action, sexual tension, and explosions.If you can get over the fact that two gorgeous people who are married and live together just can't seem to find anything interesting to do with each other, and that they can hide being assassins, then you may enjoy this. Of course, you would have to excuse the completely lame and implausible ending.I can think of better action movies to spend my time on than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Dud","review":"With two of the biggest stars in Hollywood today headlining the movie, I expected much much more.

There is zero chemistry between them and the dialogiue is horrible. Then after that big boy to swallow they are supposed to want to kill each other.. ZZZZZZZ. I am sorry but this movie SUCKS!!. Everything about Hollywood I hate is in this film. Brad's best role was the stoner in \\"true Romance.\\" He is dull and boring to watch, and if it wasn't for his good looks he would be nowhere.

Pitt seemed to just be walking through the part...Jolie was stiff and not believable. We wanted to love this movie, but, sadly, it was just a waste of our time and money.

There's nothing but a lack of plot and I'm so bored by this movie that I just stopped watching it and didn't see the ending. This has to be one of the first movies's I've seen that I didn't care to see the ending. Anybody that gave this movie 4 stars only gave it because of Brad Pitt or seeing Angelina Jolie. Well, that and some action. I'm a fan of action movies and movies with lots of violence, but you gotta have a decent plot to go with it to make it a great and enjoyable movie. Be smart and don't see this movie or if you do see it, rent it before buying it and you'll be happy that you saved the money. If you want to see some really cool movies, check out Heist, Gone in Sixty Seconds, and Swordfish. Now those are some good action movies with great plots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Bad!","review":"This movie is just plain bad! The action tries to make up for a horrible script full of holes! It means to be exciting and fast-paced, but i found myself dozing off only to be awakened by a loud noise. I went in thinking this movie was to be taken seriously and possible. None of this stuff could happen. Do yourself a favor and never ever see this movie!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So stupid and cheesy!","review":"I knew this movie would be cutesy, but I didn't it expect it to completely insult the viewers' intelligence. Bad story, bad script and bad acting. Even Vince Vaughn, the very best part of this film, can't save this mess.Want to see a truly funny and clever dysfunctional marriage film? Watch \\"The War of the Roses\\". WAAAAY smarter with much better acting.Really, I'm surprised the critics didn't totally trash this one. It's really, REALLY bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the 10 Worst Movies Ever Made","review":"This movie is billed as a romantic comedy action film. It's not romantic, it's not funny, and if action means gratuitous violence, then it has that. One of the worst pieces films I have ever seen.It probably goes without saying, but neither Brad Pitt or Angelina Jolie can actually act. If spouting your lines in an expressionless monotone is acting, then anyone can be an actor nowadays.Nothing in the movie is plausible and if this film doesn't insult your intelligence, then you don't have any. My wife and I turned it off about 3/4 of the way into the movie because we just didn't care what happens to the two main characters. Hopefully, they are killed off."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hate It When....","review":"I HATE IT when studios call their Double Dip attempt an \\"Unrated\\" cut. If you are calling a movie unrated, it should be because you replaced things you cut that had to be cut to make a certain rating. If the rating didnt change, then you shouldnt use \\"Unrated\\". They are killing that term. It used to mean something, now it just means \\"Buy this other version for 4 more dollars\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sparks fly","review":"What an incredibly boring movie this would have been without the electricity between Brad and Angelina. This is a pretty typical shoot-'em-up spy caper, with some amusing bits in the therapist's office as the two go for marriage counseling. But the sparks fly the minute these two get into the same room together. Otherwise quite predictable--definitely for an evening of very, very light entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"They should have named it Mumbles......What a no plot, unrealistic, mindless waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. & Mrs. Smith","review":"Be sure to have paramedics standing by when you watch this movie, because by its end, your viewing environment will have been converted into a near vacuum which will leave you gasping for oxygen.To paraphrase my opening statement,....This movie sucks! The so called comedy was below my humor threshold. It was too predictable, and some of the so called action scenes were just too unbelievable. You would be better off watching a TV \\"test pattern.\\"I've seen both Brad and Angelina in better movies. This, however, is one vehicle that should be recalled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brang, Brang...Please Shut It Down","review":"\\"Brangelina\\" shooting big guns at each other didn't do it for me, no matter how beautiful they (the stars or the guns) are. My wife said it reminded her of \\"The War of the Roses\\" with Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner, which I enjoyed. Other than the very basic premise of hubby and wife trying to kill each other, I couldn't see much in common between that clever and entertaining film and this very predictable star and firepower vehicle. Maybe it was intended as a date movie for dual markets--big guns for the guys and tabloid stars for the girls. It's appeal escaped me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too fantastical a fantasy","review":"Some spots of witty dialog save this movie. But unless you enjoy fight movies with no attachment whatsoever to reality, this one will be hard to swallow. Angelina's well known emaciation really shows here--- she looks as if she has muscle wastage, so it's hard to believe she could knock out legions of professional assassins in hand to hand combat. The usual trailer-load of bodies is left behind but Brangelina, of course, are barely scratched. The last fight sequence was 10 minutes of 20 men shooting at them with face to face semi-auto rapid fire, but Brangelina ducked, somersaulted, & spun effortlessly away from every bullet to sashay away into the sunset. It was so ridiculous what measured enjoyment I had from the beginning of the film was completely lost. A weak plot and a slightly disturbing view of marriage all add up to a so-so rental. I wanted escapist fantasy, but this was so absurd I felt the writers, producers and fight choreographers were just plain lazy."},{"rating":"2","title":"How can anyone find the Smiths lacking?","review":"Mr. & Mrs. Smith is Fight Club if Edward Norton were really, really, really sexy, and female. No, seriously. Some of the shots I recognized as being set up exactly like Fight Club. Like Angelina Jolie brushes her teeth as Brad Pitt examines his fingernails in the bathroom? And they talk? Uh-huh. There was definitely joke running through the entire film, as at one point, one of the characters wears a Fight Club t-shirt.But anyways-- Fight Club minus philosophy, plus fights, about triple the laughs, and absolutely no mindblowing cult ending. And more guns. Many, many, many more guns.So, I guess-- not really like Fight Club at all. A gorgeous, romantic, scathingly witty, deadpan, feel-good, action (big gun AND hand to hand) spy thriller.Just how did they manage this?I have no idea.A must-see."},{"rating":"1","title":"El Stinko!","review":"This attempt at a movie does not even rate one star. This is the dumbest, most assinine movie ever offered to the viewing public. Could not attempt watching this \\"THING\\" to the end. Made it half way and gave up.

It is a below average action flick that tries unsuccessfully to be funny. The only thing that made it a blockbuster was the off-screen affair between Pitt and Jolie."},{"rating":"1","title":"It went on and on...","review":"...I thought it would never end. The movie is somewhat entertaining in places but the scene where they are trying to kill each other bothered me. Domestic violence is not funny. At one point he is putting the boots to her, then a few minutes later they are in each others' arms. Some may say that it is just a movie but in our crime-ridden city we don't need to glorify the life of a hitman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart, funny, and yes, SEXY","review":"Never has an actor and actress have more chemistry and Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Their chemistry and an entertaining script give readers more than just eye candy. I haven't enjoyed a Brad Pitt movie in years-might be as far back as 'Seven'. Going in to see this film, I wasn't expecting funny. This movie is indeed that.The movie starts off with two assasins attending marriage couseling. (That in itself is a hoot) and quickly escalates to bond action freezy when the husband and wife are ordered to off each other. Any more than that will totally be giving the story away--but this movie is a definite must-see."},{"rating":"2","title":"A whole lot of fun.","review":"Will this movie win Oscars for its screenplay or story? No.But is this movie one of the best guilty pleasures of the year and a great popcorn movie? Yes!While Mr and Mrs Smith wasnt an unforgettable movie, it was still a tremendous ride.The chemistry that destroyed a marriage is fun to see and they worked great together. There are numerous laughs to be had throughout by both characters. Plus, Angelina looks pretty darn good in this flick...The action scenes arent anything you havent seen before like the 2 vs 100 shootout or the typical car chase scene. But what makes them work is the comedy thrown in during these so called serious life and death shootouts. Its adds a light and quirky sense of humour to most every scene.Combined, this movie doesnt add a whole lot of new stuff or break any new ground. But in the end the sum of its parts equals out to be a thoroughly enjoyable action/comedy with two of the biggest stars out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review for the Blu-Ray","review":"I think this is a great movie. Just FYI, the Blu-ray only contains the theatrical release and not the uncut/unrated version that all these other reviews are describing. I kind of think it's ridiculous that both versions were not included in this Blu-ray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been much better","review":"Definitely some nice chemistry between the stars and certainly some good dialogue but overall, an unfortunately boring movie.There are one or two scenes that are well written, there is some cleverness in some scenes and Vince Vaughn is fun whenever he is on screen, but there's not a lot more to this movie. The entire movie is based on one premise, and the one unfortunate consequence of that premise. No side plots to entertain you or distract you. The boring and plodding dialogue far outweighs the witty dialogue.Finally, just as I have no idea how to end this review, the writers had no idea how to end the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is everyone serious? This movie was garbage!","review":"I can't believe the reviews I'm reading about this movie, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! Boring plot, ridiculous action and corny dialogue!

I like Brad Pitt as an actor and I admire Angelina Jolie as a person. But this movie had to have some of the worst dialogue ever written. The story was totally unbelievable and just plain dumb. The best I can describe the story is as a poor very cheap imitation of True Lies."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie I have seen","review":"One of the worst movies. Some reviewers say that it is simply funny movie which doesn't ask you to think. I like some funny relaxing movies. But this one is cheap, plot is straight and again cheap. Joli's performance is becoming cheaper and cheaper since she got Oscar for supporting actress nomination. Such kind of movies worsen the taste of the audience, denigrade it - so, in years the Americans will watch only dummy movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Dumb Movie","review":"If this is an example of the projects America's highest paid actors are choosing, I have some serious concerns.

This movie was like a bad video game. I am annoyed that I wasted two hours on this movie. I kept expecting something clever or interesting happen and it never did. Even the moments of interest in the movie rated only three stars. There was absolutely no attempt to develop the characters and, although something interesting probably could have been done with the main premise, it was not. Instead of trying to develop any suspense, the director chose to have yet another ridiculous shoot-out. This movie was a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"The joke wears thin","review":"Any movie that relies on a single \\"punchline\\" or a \\"One trick pony\\" for a full 2 hours usually wears thin and this is no exception.By about 55 minutes my wife and I were saying to each other..... \\"OK, this has gotten old already\\".I have to admit though we liked Brad Pitt in this movie which was surprising since we have never thought much of anything he has done since Interview with a Vampire.He is one of those popular actord who you always wonder why he is such a press magnet since most of his films have been medicore."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHA-","review":"ya see here dat this move...well just seems to weird.but who cares.i might as well watch my own mom and dad run in circles callin each other bad names and trying to whack each other with a vase.If ur an adult,plz go see batman begins.or just see madagascar or herbie fully loaded.trust me...ull be happy u followed my decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch With Ear Plugs","review":"Mr. and Mrs. Smith is lovely to watch.

Entertaining","review":"Depends on what you are up to when you are watching this movie. If you want to stare at the eye candies of actors and actresses... and if you are looking for action movies, this is the ultimate big ticket. Funny movie in its dark, humorous way, bringing the everyday husband and wives struggles to the widescreen in subtle ways. We don't really think we know our husband/wife well because we are too busy in our daily lives, right? Couple therapies... nowadays it probably becomes more common in our society.But in any ways, it is an entertaining, fun, humorous movie to watch to unwind a day. If you are looking for something to critique about, argue about, appreciate about ... or wanting to sink into deep/emotional thinking of the movie, you will be very disappointed by this one. But hey... we all need movies like this that is fun and witty to watch once a while, right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated to the xxxtreme","review":"Everyone I talked to seemed to really like this film. I may be more likely to dislike it because I was so skeptical from the start that I would only watch it when it came on cable. Overall, the film was boring, not very funny, and even the acting fell flat.In the end, this represents what I think are actually the worst movies: the lower level of mediocrity. It wasn't bad enough to make it campy and funny, and it wasn't good enough to truly entertain me.

On any other band, the slight southern theme of this album might seem contrived or cheesy, but Rasputina has the substance and cheek to pull it off. The songs are full of achingly clever lyrics and masterful voice and cello work. Eerie and rocking at the same time, this should wear well on fans of goth and rock stuff, and anything in between.

The plot is interesting, the cast is good, but the story is so sad that in the end I came away wishing I hadn't watched it--and sent the movie back for a refund. It's one of those films that makes you care about the fate of individuals, then starts killing them off, one by one. Yes, that may be historically accurate, but that's not why I watch movies. I want some satisfying escapism, not a reminder that war is hell and anyone could die at any moment. If you want some very fine British WWII films, I recommend \\"British War Cinema\\" or any of the other fine films made during that era for the purpose of showing the war and raising morale. Skip this one--it's depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trust","review":"Trust is a great movie. Every parent with a tween or teen daughter or son should watch this.

But that's something you can watch on a regular talk show or Dateline special.But I like to watch movies for escapism or to see things that go beyond the ordinary life. I wanted to see the father find the a-hole and kick the crap out of him. If I wanted to see a movie which was only about family members crying and arguing, I could've turned on Dr. Phil.Don't get me wrong. It's still a well made movie. The acting's good.

(she still talks to him).Really? No, really?This was a .99 rental on Amazon Instant Video and I stopped the movie right there.It was just impossible for me to believe that in the age of 'To Catch a Predator' and extensive media coverage of situations like this that a modern teenage girl wouldn't have run for dear life, or at the very least realized that the guy was a creep and ditched him.Giving it 2 stars because of the great acting in the 30 minutes that I watched."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"A Must See!\\".......What?!?","review":"I don't know what quality and content those who rated this movie a \\"must see\\" are used to, but this movie drags on and on, without resolving any of the irritating frustrations it develops in its own plot. By the end of the movie, absolutely nothing, except for a very precious relationship, is resolved. I don't know where all the surprise twists and three steps for one are that have been mentioned, but I definitely didn't see them in this movie. There was one surprise card in the whole movie, and they played it twice!!!! The film quality was fine, and there are some real emotions strung throughout the movie, but they aren't developed enough. Scenes cut right when emotions surge and everyone is going in different directions throughout the whole movie. The subject matter is without a doubt vital, but this movie doesn't do it real justice for the way a young girl would truly feel immediately after going through a circumstance like this.

At about 15 months, I watched it with her and started doing the signs for eat, drink, more, etc., when she was in her high chair.

(You can only imagine how proud I was of him.)He was doing this on his own. His signs are not perfect, but close enough that we know what he means.He loves to watch the children on this video.It keeps him engaged.He also wants to watch it over and over again.The video may not be perfect, but it definitely has its benifits.Best of all, my son loves it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"My 3yr old daughter met a little boy @ the playground that was deaf & became very interested in signing.

Videos like this one help keep him interested in signing even as his spoken vocabulary continues to soar.This video's high points are the number of signs presented, the variety of signs presented, and the diversity of people presenting the signs - they show people of different ethnicities as well as people of all ages. The one drawback of this wonderful video is that the adults presenting the signs seem automated. They don't show a lot of facial expressions, which we know is a very important part of signing.I think this video is a great addition to any signer's video library. It will certainly boost your signing vocabulary as well as your child's and it will definitely keep him or her interested in signing even after he/she begins to speak."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best! A Great Video for ANY child","review":"The more I read about this topic (sign language for kids), the more I've discovered that introducing signs to your child is a great idea. And I do not have a hearing-impared child, but it's clear that my children (ages 2 & almost 5)get a great kick out of watching this video! We use the signs for \\"eat & drink,\\" \\"girl and boy,\\" \\"please & thank you\\" and lots of others, just for the pure fun of it. While my kids are not infants anymore and already have a good verbal language base, I read recently about the great benefits of using signs with kids as they are developing those skills, which helps them express themselves. Having seen many a frustrated toddler who can't explain what he wants, I think that's a great idea, and I, for one, am all for it. I recommend this tape to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but we need more","review":"I have this and the Signing Time series 1. I prefer this as there is no fluff, such as singing. The words are repeated several times and the signs are at the same time. Different people show the signs and it's just very straight forward.My only complaint is were are the rest of the DVD's? Once these words are learned, one must turn elsewhere to continue learning more words. I'm almost tempted to make my own DVD's to fill the need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as bad as people are making it out to be","review":"If you've had some experience with martial arts and know how to punch and kick, you'll probably enjoy this more than the other kickboxing videos. Kathy Smith is great at making workout videos, but would you trust her to land a punch on you that would do any damage? Nope. Wimpy punches and kicks are annoying.It's true the backup people in theses 2 workouts don't really know as much as the lead instructor, but if you follow the lead instructor you will get a great workout. Also the butt exercises in the 2nd workout, really get you in shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not that bad","review":"This video is not as awful as some of the reviews make it out to be. Yes it is low budget, and sometimes the cues and voiceover is a little off, but overall the workout is a solid one, especially for people that are new to working out or haven't worked out in a while. I had the original Kick Butt workout on VHS tape when I was senior in high school trying to lose weight to join the Air Force. I did this workout 3 days along with running and I lost 15 pounds in about 2 1/2 months. This workout is functional and does what is supposed to do, its just not pretty."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT's to bad for words....","review":"I recently received 14 workout videos and this one is the worst out of them all. first off there is a guy that doesn't speak English that well. He is guiding you through your workout.. He doesn't count off the exercise he is on, the warm up is not long enough and he switches to the next exercise with no warning. ON top of him talking there is a women talking over him telling you what to do after he has switched to the next exercise. If you look at the soap opera actor in the back he is not doing the exercises correctly. I ended up stopping the video and putting in one that proves to be more professional and user friendly.. IF you want a good kickboxing workout try Kathy Smith kickboxing workout or any of The Firm Videos... They have many different workouts on one DVD..Making it more bang for your buck.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this dvd!","review":"This is the worst kickboxing workout I have ever done. The instructor hardly speaks English and he is difficult to follow. The moves are not very creative and their is no cool down.

Do not even consider buying this dvd!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading cover","review":"I thought the covergirl would be the centerpiece of the film...How wrong I was.

This is 1st rate jazz, and Wanda de Sah, even sing liek Austrid Gilberto, but she sing more in key, then out.

The film is set several years later and the whole country and its residents were quite changed. In the book, Brad Bishop is still in the Navy, Rita doesn't write for the radio, and of course, Addie is very \\"present\\" in the story while she isn't visible in the film. The concise character arcs, witty dialogue and rich, layered characters are all from director Joe Mankiewicz.

SURE, THE GUILLOTINE BIT GETS A BIT OLD, BUT I STILL WONDER HOW HE DOES THAT. THE BAND, AS IS ALL OF ALICE'S BANDS, REALLY PLAYED THEIR AS*&S OFF. THE DRUM SOLO WAS SOMEWHAT UNIQUE, SOMETHING I NEVER SAW A DRUMMER DO, BUT I WON'T TELL YOU, SO YOU WILL HAVE TO GET THIS DVD. THE SOUND AND PICTURE WAS SUBURB.

Be prepared for a lot of new Alice on this. Personally I really like the newer stuff and Brutal Planet is a kick ass CD in it's own right.The performance and stage show are great. You can check out the track listening to get an idea of the songs. Basically the first half is an interwoven new song/old song. The second half is pretty much older standard songs which you'd expect.Some things to look out for are Vincents daughter who plays the nurse - a guide to parenting by Alice Cooper. It also has a few non standard songs on there like It's Hot Tonight.The only thing that lets this DVD down is the mix of vocals which is atrocious. You can barely hear Alice over the band - maybe having a bad night? Doesn't sound like it, but who knows.I'd buy this just for the fact it's a great show - however Theatre of Death is much better sound wise and I enjoyed it more than this one mainly because of the song selection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Alice....","review":"Great show - great theatrics. The 16:9 widescreen version is quite good. Unfortunately - the DTS and Dolby digital soundtracks are 5.0. That is such a waste - no bass. If your surround receiver allows - select DD-2.0 and listen to it in DTS Neo-mode or Pro Logic. It will expand the soundfield and sound much better. If your an Alice fan - buy this... The bonus CD is a nice addition for the road."},{"rating":"2","title":"This DVD ROCKS my Brutal Planet!","review":"This DVD is one of the BEST live shows I have seen, and I've seen about 30 by now. This has great sound (It is only in 5.0, insted 5.1, so it could have more bass), and also has great video quality. Plus the show is excellent. \\"Alice\\" or should I say Vincent has a great band this time out. Some of the other reviews complain of these guys playng the old songs, but I think they do a wonderful job at it, and you can't get a much better drummer than Eric Singer. Ryan Roxie is fun to watch too. I think this whole band sounds great together. The set list is good and covers alot of the hits, everyone will think he missed some, but you just try to make the most people happy in the alotted time.

One, they do a mini-medley of Devil's Food/Black Widow ending in a loooooong drum solo. I don't know anyone who'd rather watch the drum solo than have seen full versions of these two AC classics played out in full. It just left me scratching my head asking why?? Who knows, maybe Alice needed to run backstage for 5 minutes to take a dump. Also, they cover The Who's My Generation. Why?? I'd rather have seen another AC tune instead. And like the other guy, I'd like to have seen the snake too. Still, this DVD/vid is a smart purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alice Cooper Brutally Live","review":"Talk about live or memorex. Nowhere near as good as the live show, but it does give you a different perspective and some awesome close ups of Alice. An absolute genius in the music, lyrics, and show production.

Most important thing to remind folks is that it's a very strong rose smell. Now I don't usually buy a lot of items with strong perfume, so it may not smell as strong with other people. But the first spray was definitely a tad overpowering. It doesn't smell bad. It's just strong. As far as its effectiveness, I've worn it to work and the only thing that bothered me is that I could still smell the strong rosy odor even after a few hours. I don't like that. I wish it was a bit more subtle. That's the reason why I haven't tried this while going to the gym. I'm a little hesitant because I'm afraid that the rosy odor would bother me (and other people).

The Weleda Wild Rose Deoderant WORKS. It smells nice going on and does a great job keeping me smelling nice - no matter what the weather or what I had for dinner the night before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it could have been","review":"I purchased this because I've had good results from Weleda's products and decided to try this deodorant.Well, it keeps you from smelling bad for a day. That's about it.If you like the fragrance of roses, however, and are looking for a natural deodorant with this essence, you will be disappointed. The rose smell is mixed with lemon and the result is comparable to a supermarket furniture polish.If you are looking for a gentle floral, I suggest Aubrey Organics Calendula. If you like citrus, Weleda makes a nice citrus deodorant. This product just seems to miss the mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Deodorant","review":"This deodorant keeps me feeling fresh all day. It is NOT an antiperspirant, therefore it will not keep you from sweating. What it WILL do, is kill the bacteria on your skin that thrive off the sweat, creating body odor. This has a pleasant, not overpowering smell. Since using this I have watched the dark skin under my arms return to a normal color. I have also suffered from severe acne and cysts under my arms, and those have also disappeared since I left behind my traditional antiperspirant."},{"rating":"1","title":"So strong it gave me a head ache","review":"Do not buy this product, at least not until you find it in a store and try the fragrance. The smell is VERY strong and overwhelming. Contains a lot of alcohol and fragrance; not just natural ingredients. On top of it all, you can not return it because it is classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases and cannot be returned to Amazon.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didnt work for me","review":"I purchased this product as I am looking for a more natural deodorant. This product didn't work for me. It might be okay as a body spray..but not as a deodorant. I had my hubby asking me why I smell like rubbing alcohol (not good). It also burns pretty bad if you apply it after shaving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works better than traditional antiperpirants!","review":"I was really amazed by how much I loved this product. I'd been trying different brands of natural deodorants and nothing seemed to work. Finally, I decided to spend a little more than what I'm used to on a deodorant and it was worth every penny! Traditional antiperspirants/deodorants tend to build up defeating the purpose of wearing a deodorant in the first place: to feel clean. The scent also lasts very long which is unusual because natural deodorants tend to fade very quickly, making me feel self-conscious. With Weleda, that doesn't happen, the smell kind of lingers on in a very pleasant way, without being overpowering. I purposely try to get a little on my hair in the mornings because I love the rose scent so much. The only drawback would be the bees being too attracted to the floral aroma, which I can forsee happening in the outdoors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally one that works!","review":"I went through many stinky days searching for a natural deodorant that worked and this one ended my search! The reviews are spot on. A few notes on this product; it is expensive, it will sting if you spray it on right after you shave your underarms, the scent is quite strong (but dissipates quickly)But for the pro of it working, and working really well it's definitely worth it! Buy the large size, the small will only last you just over a month or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contains toxins I didn't expect","review":"Lately I've learned not to assume that a product is safe just because it's sold in a health food store. I recently discovered the Skin Deep Database, where you can look up products and ingredients to find out if they contain toxins. I'd used this deodorant for two years. Even though it only kept me smelling fresh for a few hours, I figured it was better/safer than the drugstore brand I had been using. Wrong! When I looked it up on the Skin Deep Database, I found out that this deodorant rates a 4 on the toxin scale, which is the \\"caution\\" range. I switched to Lafe's spray deodorant, which is a 0 on the toxin scale, and it works MUCH better without any toxins. Lafe's keeps me and my husband smelling good from morning to bed time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the scent","review":"I really love the scent of this deodorant. It doesn't work quite as well as some other natural deodorants I've tried, but it comes close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weleda Deodorant Spray","review":"The product arrived in very short time and was in perfect condition. My spouse still enjoys using it, and we will definitely consider ordering again from this vendor"},{"rating":"1","title":"GROSS","review":"I THINK THIS DEODORANT IS PRETTY STINKY AND COULD HAVE BEEN MADE A LITTLE BETTER SMELL. I HAD TO THROW IT AWAY BECAUSE IT JUST WREAKED AND HAD NO PLEASANT SMELL TO IT :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product!","review":"I absolutely love this deoderant. Works so much better than other natural ones in the summer. I use other Weleda products and am always amazed by how well they work. This one finally did the job. They even have a travel size, so you can take it with you on the go. I'm very impressed. I gave it a 4 because it does smell a bit strong when you first put it on, but it is a nice floral scent to me. It smells kinda like perfume without the added chemicals and synthetic fragrances. Lasts a long time, especially compared to other natural ones that I have tried and needed to keep reapplying. I will definitely be buying a bottle of this as my deoderant from now on! I plan to try the other scents, as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ineffective and Smells like old lady perfume","review":"I had high hopes for this after reading a number of good reviews on here. The other reviewers must have low expectations. Seriously. This does not stop odor. It is just a really strong smelling body spray. Even after discovering that it didn't work I might have used it as a body spray except for the fact that it smells like a 90 year old lady's perfume. Very strong floral/baby powderish smell. It gave me a headache. I suggest avalon organics grapefruit and geranium spray if you are looking for something effective (you may have to reapply it once or twice if it is warm weather or if you are a heavy sweater but at least it does work). That is what I will be going back to. I tried this because I just wanted to try something different and there were glowing reviews. Big old waste of money :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, I do not like the smell","review":"I am not sure about the other varieties, but I do not like how Wild Rose smells, it does have a sort of baby powder/alchohol smell to it However, it does seem to work.

Recomended and just plain fun to look through."},{"rating":"2","title":"....back in time.","review":"This wonderful compilation of clothing and accessories available at Sears in the 1930's makes me want to go back in time. The book is very well thought out. Showing the clothing year by year was a great idea. We own a 1939 Packard automobile and enjoy wearing vintage clothing when we participate in antique car tours. I bought the book to get ideas for making a dress or two that would depict the era. This book gave me more than I expected.

It is focused primarily for the women's wear but the men's wear pages are worth their weight in gold for the vintage clothing afficionado. This type of book is helpful for collectors, re-enactors, film costuming and plays. It helps get the \\"look\\" of the period right. Style in this era was found in everyday life for middle America in the way people dressed and is a stunning contrast to today's sloth and slovenly life-styles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful and enjoyable reference","review":"This is the first book from this series I obtained. It is a useful reference tool not only for the major pieces of clothing but also how accessories were used and placed. (It's not always easy to figure out those crazy 30s hats!). The descriptions, being authentic to the time, are delightful as well. My only complaint, which is really more wishful thinking, is that the book could be a bit longer. However, no major clothing/accessory category was left out."},{"rating":"2","title":"so far so good","review":"only had this two days now, but pleased so far.

These leaks ranged from a few drops to flooding the countertop, but alway from the top reservoir.When they work, they're great, but I've had it with this design issue.

I'm experiencing the same issue with the carafe spilling as the other reviewers have. For a $150 coffee pot, I'm very disappointed in the poor quality of the carafe. I'm glad I did some research before I ordered another carafe, considering another reviewer did the same and got a new carafe with the same problems. The quality of the coffee is fantastic, but it's really annoying to have to poor a cup of coffee out over the sink because the pot drips all over the place."},{"rating":"1","title":"carafe on Bunn leaks","review":"Carafe leaks cant make a full pot and it leaks all the way around top when you poor a cup.

We know it's not intended for that purpose, but previous experience with making tea using a coffee maker with good results led us to repeat the process. The Bunn requires running the water through the brewing process twice or else the tea is too weak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inconsistent Results","review":"I purchased this item wanting a coffee maker that would make coffee hot enough to go into my thermos so I can take it to work. I followed the setup directions and tried to use it. The coffee is inconsistent in flavor at best. I use Starbuck's ground coffee and it is fine in the Mr. Coffee I own, just not as hot as I would like. In the Bunn it is weak one time and too strong the next. I notified the seller and they sent me a second with the same results. It seems like the water goes through so fast it does not have time to extract the coffee flavor leaving it weak and tasteless.I will be sending it back.UPDATE: I have been using this for sometime now and as long as you grind the coffee very fine and use a few more grounds than one might like,it makes great coffee. Always very hot. I purchased a Kitchenaid bean grinder which works superbly and makes a very consistent fine ground coffee for use in the bunn coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carafe Leaks DO NOT BUY","review":"Bunn nomally makes a good product.

The first few pots made me think I'd made a mistake. I made probably 5-6 pots that were thin and bitter, with a couple of filter-basket overflows.I switched to the rgular grind Kirkland (Costco) coffee and filled the filter just past half and got a really good pot of coffee. Since then, every pot has been great!I have ordered the (free) slow-flow head to see if I can use my usual fine-grind and flavored coffees.A really good coffee maker, but it might take you a few tries till you get the knack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh Hours Later","review":"I actually purchased this Coffee Brewer for my husband-but it has been a greater product for me.

I've owned many different brands of coffee makers in my life time and this one is by far the best. Great tasting coffee in just 3 minutes, easy to clean and a 3 year warranty. The stainless steel insulated carafe keeps the coffee hot well past 2 hours. I will never buy another brand of coffee maker other that a Bunn!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"The good part is the coffee maker produces 10 tasty cups in 3 minutes as advertised and the thermal pot is nice. However, there are two very poorly engineered \\"features\\" of this machine. First, there are no markings on the machine or pot to tell the user how many cups (5 oz each) of water the user is adding. I took an old plastic container and marked it off with a sharpie for 4, 6, 8 and 10 cups. (Of course, 10 cups is a full pot so that one's easy.) Second, if you don't position the filter holder just right - and it seems like it's been pushed in tight - you get hot water and grounds all over the machine and your counter. Being an engineer, sloppy engineering really irritates me, but I think these \\"features\\" will annoy and disappoint most users.

I knew I needed something without alot of plastic that gets heated up. I also had to have a thermal carafe cause I like to space out my drinks. Problem is unless you want to spend well over $200 for a stainless steel commercial system you have no other choice than this Bunn.It was a little more than I wanted to spend but if you want quality it costs more. The payback is the years of faithful service and a solid company behind it. Long story short, it's a great unit... in your office pantry. If you have a wife that is particular about the kitchen then forget it. It just looks too industrial. I did see the filters in walmart for a buck. And it does keep the coffee warm a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bunn ThermoFresh","review":"Excellent coffee maker like all Bunn products. The only drawback; I would like for the coffee to stay hotter longer. However I seldom heat the thermos with hot water before useing as is recommended (seems like a waste of water).

We are very pleased with coffee brewed (morning pot - French Roast-Papua New Guinea). We grind 2/3 cup of beans and add 30 ounces of water. Even though we have made more per pot, the overflow of the \\"Bunn\\" filter dumped too many grounds into the pot. Bunn should be adding another 3/4 inch to the filter height for ten cup results. Plan to try a mesh filter but to date the 30 ounces is enough for my wife and myself. Have heard that mesh filters tend to allow more oil from the beans into the coffee; better for taste but worse for the heart? Only reasons for 4 stars instead of 5 is (1) filter height and (2) slight guilt on heating water continually for 2 or 3 pots per day. On the latter point, isn't that what all our tank hot water heaters do anyway? Bottom line we are very happy with results."},{"rating":"2","title":"bunn coffeemaker","review":"great product. i go through about 1 coffeemaker per year.

(Before the Bunn, I had a Cuisinart model that ground its own beans and was awful to clean.) Bunn has great customer service as well.

Simply put, I recommend this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing purchase","review":"We have had Bunn coffee makers for the last 20 years. We bought this because of the stainless steel carafe rather than glass thinking it would be more durable. The carafe has no markings for the amount of cups you are making.

If we had been aware of this we would have chosen a different model. Not happy with our purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Coffee!","review":"We love strong coffee and this coffee maker does the job. We used to make coffee the old fashion way (boiling grounds in a pot and filtering it) but often we don't have time. This coffee maker brews a full pot in 3 minutes.The downsides are (1) the filter overflows and we get grounds in the pot (even when we fill the filter 1/4 of the way) and (2) In order to have a pot brew in 3 minutes the coffee maker needs to be plugged in and on. The container in the rear of the machine constantly keeps the water warm.

About six months ago it started leaking severely every time we made coffee with it. Finally I took the thing apart. There is a plastic tray that connects to the top of the water tank. The heat from the tank over a period of years has caused part of the plastic tray to break down and disintegrate. Checking the internet I discovered that there are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Bunn customers with the same problem. See [...] or Google on \\"Bunn coffee maker leak\\". After 3 to 6 years you can expect this machine to leak. At that point it will be basically unusable and Bunn apparently doesn't sell replacement parts. When you pay this much for a coffee maker you expect it incorporate a better design and last much longer. It appears that Bunn has known about this problem for a long time and has chosen to do nothing about it. My advice is to spend your money on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Coffee","review":"This coffee maker while fast, brews terrible coffee. I've tried every combination: more coffee, finer grind, distilled water and I finally am giving up and getting a different coffee maker. This was a replacement for a Braun coffee maker that made excellent coffee and so the bar was probably set rather high but for the price of this unit it should be able to make a decent cup of coffee and it does not.

We have had it 4yrs without 1 problem & you get rid of paper filters which we always seemed to run out of or they always let grinds into the pot . Unless you are in a office or need 4 pots a day it's very over priced. Look at the problems people have had. Leaks, grinds in your pot, ect. My father asked for a new Bunn for xmas then asked me about my Capresso. He assumed it cost alot more than it did. Not only great coffee but attractive as well.

I have had three of the BT-10, they last about 14 to 16 months and then the tank heater fails. Bunn replaces it but the hassle is not worth it any longer. The problem is the heating unit, made in China, is on all the time and burns out with predictable regularity. It needs to have an auto shut off of the heating tank or an American made heating unit that will last. Another company should learn its lesson about China."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks!","review":"We purchased our Bunn about four years ago. It makes good coffee; however, a $5 stove-top coffee maker from the thrift shop can do that!The carafe leaks. No matter how we hold it, it leaks a puddle of coffee every time we pour. We called Bunn and they told us that the seal was \\"dirty\\" with coffee oil residue. I cleaned it well per instructions and it *still* leaked. I sent it back to Bunn and they sent me another; that one leaked worse. I received yet another one (it might have been the original) and it leaked also (or, still).You can get a $15 unit from K-Mart that makes a good cup of coffee if you don't mind leaks... all in all, the cheaper one is by far the better deal, IMO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dribbles more than a point guard...","review":"This would be a perfect coffee maker if the pot didn't leak - NO gush - NO HEMORRAGE coffee each and EVERY time you try to pour a cup.

Recently, the old brewer finally started to leak out the bottom, which forced me to buy a new one.

The temperature coming out of the brew head is at best 187 degrees. The mildly pressurized brewing system is supposed to increase turbidity and produce better extraction from the grounds but it kicks the grounds out of the basket and into the coffee pot. You can only use 8 tablespoons of coffee per pot. If you have a lot of coffee drinkers prepare to spend your morning making several small pots.I emailed Bunn customer service and they originally said that the water coming out of the brew head should be between 190 and 205 and they asked me to check the temp again. I was checking the temp from the brew head already and the highest reading I have had is 187. I emailed them again and they changed their story. They said only the water in the boiler needs to be between 190 and 205, the water coming out of the brew head should be cooler than 190 because the air has already begun cooling it.Bad Product/Customer Service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good features, bad coffee!","review":"I spent a lot of time trying to find the \\"best\\" coffee maker. I finally settled on a BUNN and liked the features of the BTX-B.Unfortunately, my wife and I like our coffee strong and this coffee maker cannot make a good strong cup of coffee. While the 3 minute brew cycle is neat, a timer can take care of that. And the 3 minute brew ensures that the coffee does not come out strong.The thermo carafe is awesome! and it's handy to have instant hot water in the kitchen for cooking/tea and other uses. But since I bought this unit for a coffee maker I expect good coffee.It's tricky to get water into the top, to get even a remotely strong cup of coffee you need a LOT of coffee (so it's expensive) and inevitably when you make a full pot the grinds overflow the oversized basket sides so some grinds end up in your coffee.Good idea - good machine - bad coffee.

Ugh.3) The water is not heated sufficiently before being drawn through.4) The lid on the pitcher is laughable-- it dribbles, no matter what setting you use.5) The base does not warm the coffee--the coffee is supposed to remain hot in the insulated cannister. Right. It no worky.Test it yourself. Fill the pitcher and try to pour something. Dribble, dribble, puddle, slip, fall. Workers comp.

With the concern of wasted energy I am surprised there is no timer clock and method for starting a brew automatically. Coffee in 3 minutes is misleading because it takes about 10 minutes more to bring cold water up to temperature if the heater element is left off to save energy. Also I wonder about the health safety of leaving cold water in the internal tank and mold forming.The thermal carafe is designed better than a previous brand carafe we had, for the coffee is fairly hot in the morning after a brew the night before.The overall construction is solid with stainless steel carafe and heater tank but the outside is too hot to the touch in one area directly under top tank section."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I wish I had read the reviews before buying this for my husband's birthday.

The reviews that I found were not the best, but I guess I had to consider the source. There were supposedly problems with the carafe leaking and not keeping the coffee hot. Also, a few people had stated that the Bunn did not produce hot coffee. None of these are factual.First of all, a good coffee maker will not allow the water to rise above 182 degrees (F). The carafe will not leak if it is washed (per the instructions) at least once a month (ours gets washed a lot more than that)and it will keep the brew reasonably hot for hours. We have extremely \\"hard\\" water and have to remove the calcium buildup after three or four months of heavy use (using the supplied tool), but that is to be expected.To sum it up, we haven't found a better coffee maker during our lifetime and I am 69 years old.I would recommend it to my best friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for what it's made for","review":"I read many good reviews for this coffee maker, but one thing that kept coming up is that it made weak coffee, we bought the BTX-B and we too found it made weak coffee. It is fast, but maybe it's too fast, the coffee doesn't really have time to brew, we experimented with the strength and found it takes almost two times the coffee we used in our old coffee maker (a cheap Mr. Coffee). I think if this is used in an office or a household that drinks coffee all day, this may be the machine for you. But for the morning coffee drinker, the heater is on 24/7 and uses a lot of power and it uses twice as much coffee, an expensive appliance to own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please reconsider...","review":"I always purchase Bunn coffee makers.

Rather pitiful.2) The carafe leaks unbelievably. No joke, if you don't pour over the sink you will be spending time cleaning up.

The only minor complaint is the shape of the carafe makes it hard to get the last of the liquid out of it. Since it is also the pitcher you use to add water, it is noticed every time you use it.

You have to put a pitcher of water in, close the top, wait for 3 min. until that water goes in the reservoir, put in another pitcher of water, close the lid and wait for this water to go to the reservoir. You are to put an empty pitcher in the position so that any excess water from the reservoir is to drip into the pitcher. You must do this BEFORE you plug in/turn on the machine. Once THIS is done, you turn it on and you wait for the water to heat up. The manual said it takes 15 min. and it will start brewing.

The film budget presented as thin, and some of the actors looked out of place performing action genre.I did find myself entertained with some clever scenes though, in particular some diversionary tactics used by the escaped convict during a few shootouts.This isn't an Australian film I would recommend watching, as it reminds me of many bad Aussie films from the 1970s and 1980s.

Many months later, I can still summarize it no better. This is an album with a diversity of sounds. At moments, I hear what sounds like Steve Laury influence; at other moments, I am reminded of Art Porter; and at still others, I feel I must be hearing pure Eric Essix. One track that makes me feel this way is \\"Smiles.\\" There is something very special about that tune. Sometimes feeling flows from music, and sometimes music flows from feeling. \\"Smiles\\" seems like a case of the latter. I don't know how to distill my reactions any further. This release is VERY worth acquiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cutest ever","review":"I got this for my 2 yr old and he loves it.

He also has a Furnis (Mike) doll which he has never really taken to. I think that's because the Furnis doll looks like an older child. So, I decided my son should be given the chance to play with a baby doll. I like the idea behind Waldorf dolls. I really wanted something simple and soft with no interactive features. This doll is great. So soft and great for a little boy that wants to practice being a dad. I purchased the tan doll with brown hair. My son has dark brown hair and olive toned skin and it's a great match."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad, sentimental, a gril friend book for women of a certain age","review":"A girl friend recommended this book to me because, like the women in the book, Seasons of Sun and Rain, I also have a long time group of girl friends that travel together. While these friends are \\"only\\" 50 (and we are all in our upper 60's), the themes of long time friendship remains the same. While one of the group is experiencing early onset Alzheimer's, and the rest of the group is trying to come to terms w/this, another one in the group (spoiler alert) is asked to help her exit when the time comes. If there is any plot at all, it concerns the decision that has to be made. Mostly this book is a retrospective of their trip w/flashbacks on how and when they became friends. I found it sad, moving, sentimental and an engrossing read. I also saw myself in the woman experiencing Alzheimer's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short-lived","review":"The idea of Freeleash hands-free is GREAT!

Some minor inconsistencies in information about when a maker or company marked their products. I enjoyed the extensive list of little known makers and their style points in the back of the book. If your looking to see the makers marks in a book; well... be satisfied with the history and folklore and construction. The omission of showing historical documentation of the maker marks of the makers reviewed is a glaring one. Cowboy Spurs... is informative and chock full of biographical tidbits on the best of the best custom and production spur makers.

Have you EVER looked at a calender in your life? THERE IS NOT MORE THAN SIX WEEKS IN A MONTH!!! Also, that is wrong, anyway. There were locked away for three years, four months, and sixteen days (page 18 of Petals on the Wind) Since when is that span of time considered three years, five months and six weeks (which, in the real world, is called three years, six months and two weeks)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Christmas Climax at Foxworth Hall","review":"I never dreamed V.C. Andrews could write another book as wonderfully eerie as Audrina's disfunctional family, but Cathy in Petals on the Wind is so real! Although she feels a need for such revenge, I loved the Christmas Climax at Foxworth Hall when her mother is confronted and even Bart Winslow sides with Cathy! I feel that Bart was the dark, handsome man Cathy always dreamed of...I didn't like her marriage to Julian at all...and thought it inappropriate for her to marry her guardian, Paul. In the end, I'm glad it seems that she and Chris and her two sons, Jory and Bart will lead a normal life of happiness. I felt Cathy's revenge on the invalid grandmother was a bit gruesome and harsh, but the book is the most exciting one I've ever read... full of unexpected outcomes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite interesting","review":"I must say that this novel was quite good. I absolutely love Flowers in the Attic since it's a tragic tale that I truly hope no person would suffer. Petals on the Wind did a great job of describing some of the real consequences that happens to people when they are mistreated during their childhood. Childhood traumas, especially that of Catherine's, is something that I'm glad VC Andrews was able to explain in truth. VC Andrews did such a good job in describing each character that I too felt as if i were part of the novel. For example, I couldn't help but pitty Carrie, I wanted to tell Chris to just grow up, I desperatly wanted to yell at Cathy to just get her revenge over with, and I really wanted to kill Julian (he was really annoying). But hey, that just shows that Andrews knows how to get her readers involved.This is a book that should not be missed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Left me like the last book....strangely quiet and not relieved.","review":"Petals on the Wind kept me intrigued until the end. I won't review the story's plot because that will give up too much of the story but I will say that everything I wanted to happen did. The only compliant I had is that Chris didn't get his happy ending described in more detail in the end and I don't think I can go through the trauma of reading it in the next book. I was always rooting for him, even if he was her brother. Just read this book if you still felt trapped in the attic by the first one. You won't regret it. It wears true to humanity, even if it isn't how we would want things in reality to be. People are definitely shades of gray..."},{"rating":"2","title":"great revenge","review":"Cathy's revenge was great.At first it was a bit boring.Cathy's love life was a disaster.But when Cathy starts planning how to make grandmother and mother pay, revenge couldn't taste better.Great story,great ending and hoping Cathy still continues to torture Corrine untill death comes her way.It's just as good as Flowers in the Attic."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazingggg!","review":"Oh my!

However they are not equipped to deal with the \\"real world\\". As Cathy gets older, she is obviously more affected by the loss of her father then she knows, because she seeks out and seduces men (especially older ones) left and right! Poor Christopher hangs on to his \\"sinful\\" lust for his sister and refuses to find another girl, even though he is quite a catch. And Carrie slowly wastes away, living in Cathy's shadow, thinking (probably rightly so) that no man will ever look at her as long as her sexy sister is around. If any kids ever needed a psychiatrist, it's these three! This book isn't that great, I would say that \\"Flowers in the Attic\\" is the only book in the series worth reading, because the other ones get deeper and deeper into soap opera territory."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!!!","review":"This book is a HORRIBLE read!!!!

I cant even finish it im half way through and its going to the used bookstore as a trade so i can hopefully get something better!! Dont waste your time!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I read this book because I wanted to know what happened after Flowers in the Attic, which was a good read. This book, however, was a disappointment. 70 percent of it was Cathy having sex with someone (which she does a lot of in this book, with more than a few partners) or starting to have foreplay and then slapping him in the face and storming out. This book was bad. I'm glad I checked it out from the library and didn't buy it. I really do not care enough about Cathy's sex life enough to read about it in every chapter of a book. Not to mention her incessant self-doubt, worrying, and wimpy questioning of herself on whether or not she is the \\"Devil's issue.\\" Get over it! And the revenge against the mother came much too late in the book. Furthermore, I was really turned off by the way Cathy is constantly telling the reader how beautiful she thinks she is. If you are looking for a good sequel full of interesting plot, substance and content, this one is not it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I CANNOT believe VC Andrews wrote this!","review":"Please tell me it's a lie! This is the most immoral book I've ever read. Cathy is simply sick. She had to have been mentally ill to do the things she did in this book. She went way to far. Sleeping with your MOTHER'S HUSBAND is NOT the way to get revenge. BEATING YOUR GRANDMOTHER despite her earlier cruelty is NOT the way to get revenge. All it took to get revenge was to tell the people who she was, make her sick mama go as broke as a bag lady and maybe Bart Winslow would break up the marriage as the real Corrine was revealed. That was all it took to stir a controversial uproar. And after the last paragraph, I'm too afraid to know what happens in the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Petals in the wind","review":"Great read especially towards the end.

Peter's post-Plimsouls solo work has seen highs and lows but anyway you look at it, Six Pack Of Love isn't a very good record. My major complaint is the record's unfocused artistic vision and lack of true inspiration. Stylistically, this hodge-podge mix of songs is all over the map...Beatleish pop rock, blues, novelty songs, folk, etc. And even that would be ok if any of it felt truly inspired. But despite the frantic efforts of producer Mitchell Froom to dress it up, there's not much on Six Pack Of Love that inspires any emotion in the listener. This is just music for music's sake and it feels pretty empty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atmospheric acid without the drugs","review":"Although it's arguable that the Banshees EVER made an 'perfect' album, this one would probably come closest to it. It's somewhat overproduced, with a distinctly Indian sound to it, but in a year (1991) of underwhelming albums by overwhelming artists, well worth a try. 'Little Sister' and 'The Ghost in You' are particularly moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't believe the bad hype...","review":"Purists slagged this album, mostly due to its (and I agree with this) overproduction. But what they neglected to admit was that some of the band's best writing and melodiousnous came through with flying colours.Hell, Siouxsie/The Banshees was nothing if not a singles band. Disagree? Pick up both \\"Once Upon A Time/Twice Upon A Time\\" titles, and disregard most of the albums the singles came from. \\"Little Sister\\", \\"The Ghost In You\\", \\"Shadowtime\\", \\"Kiss Them For Me\\", and \\"Cry\\" need take no truck from earlier brilliant singles such as \\"Christine\\", \\"Slowdive\\", \\"Cities In Dust\\", etc.It's overproduced, and \\"Softly\\" just goes on far too long after its expiration date. Other than that, it's well worth owning in conjunction with those earlier singles compilations I mentioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Critics are worthless.","review":"The poor taste and judgment of so many critics is never more evident than in the fact that so many of them prefer this Banshee album. In fact, as any true Banshee fan worth their salt (or their eyeliner, for that matter) will tell you, this album is a waste of anyone's money, the absolute anti-zenith of an otherwise great discography.Lyrically, the Banshees must have been doped up on boredom when they wrote these songs. \\"Cry\\" and \\"Fear\\"? Not exactly the kind of great stuff the \\"Kaleidoscope\\" LP was made of.While the album has its decent intentions, and even some partially redeeming songs (\\"Kiss Them For Me\\" or \\"Drifter\\"), most consumers should probably skip over this one, just as most fans try to forget it ever happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly melodic and dreamy with eccentric flourishes","review":"When Siouxsie Sioux gets going, her music can scare cats and little children away for miles. In the more-staid early '90's, she's a bit more melodic and dreamy, and \\"Superstition\\" reveals different shades of her musical personality. \\"Shadowtime\\" and \\"The Ghost In You\\" are hauntingly lovely, \\"Kiss Them For Me\\" really cooks, and \\"Silly Thing\\" is playfully snazzy. I didn't care for the single \\"Fear(of the Unknown)\\" or the harder-edged \\"Cry\\", but die-hards will probably like those more and the ballads less. It's a touch too slick, but still too eccentric to be labeled 'corporate pop'..and thank God for that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the beggining of the end for Goth's supergirl","review":"This record should never have been made, and neither should have the one that came out after it \\"The Rapture\\", or anthing by the Creatures, for that matter. It's a shame that she tarnished the memory of the wonderful music she made in the 80's with this unimaginative c-grade pop.

It sounded to me like she wanted to have her music played in clubs; that just isn't Siouxsie to her fans. She once said in the interview that even though she thought her band could have done some good music with synthisizers, she opted for the band not to use them so the band wouldn't become branded \\"New Wave.\\" She was right, but now this album produced in the nineties sounds like club music.

I don't know what they are thinking! If you're a fan of any kind of rock you will love this CD. After reading all the bad reviews for this CD I was very very surprised how wrong they were when I actually got it! I really liked Scars and actually am not a big fan of this genre but in my opinion Soil did a great job with this one. Redefine isn't as good as Scars but is still a good album. There is only one reason why I didn't give this CD 5 stars - some of the tracks do have a similar sound but then again what band doesn't have some songs that sound alike?"},{"rating":"1","title":"You might be a redneck.....","review":"This is not a metal album as some of you reviewers are calling it.

Yet another rock album for really dumb people. Don't waste your money, just download the songs if you want a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Redefine","review":"Soil hasn't redefined anything on their follow-up to 2001's Scars, but they didn't need to either. Scars was quite an enjoyable slab of hard and heavy anthemic rock, and Redefine does nothing more than tighten the pace and focus. Right out the gate, Soil belts out some of the best songs of their career thus far, with Pride, Remember, and Cross My Heart of considerable note. The band starts to lose their touch near the end with filler tracks like Something Real and Say You Will, but the drop in quality is mercifully short as the band kicks back into high gear for the closing tracks. Although music lovers expecting a more varied listen might be a little disappointed, those in the mood for a powerful guitar assault will find all they are looking for in Soil's Redefine."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good metal album","review":"The first song I heard from REDEFINE was PRIDE, it is on the Madden 2004 soundtrack. That song rocks, so when I had the chance, I went out and bought the CD. I can say that I am totally pleased with my choice. This Cd just rocks, and unlike alot of bands, SOIL doesnt seem to be doing what is popular. The music is hard and the lyrics are good and this album should do real well. My favorite songs from the cd are PRIDE, CROSS MY HEART, SAY YOU WILL, REMEMBER and SUFFERING. If you are a fan of metal or hard rock, then I suggest that you add this disc to your collection. I dont think you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Appropriate Album Title","review":"Soil's \\"Redefine\\" is what a hard rock/metal CD should be. Keeping the aggression from \\"Scars\\" and infusing it with Alice In Chains and Black Label Society-like melodies, the band remains energetic, but with hooks aplenty. Songs like the title track and \\"Remember\\"(a tribute to Drowning Pool singer Dave Williams) sacrifice none of the grit the band is known for, while stepping up the songwriting noticeably. Vocalist Ryan McCombs stands out more, effectively channeling Layne Stayley and Zakk Wylde at the same time. The band sounds supremely confident on \\"Can You Heal Me\\" and \\"Deny Me,\\" switching easily from and eerie dissonant openings to jackhammering rhythm guitars and drums. Soil shows very deftly how a band's sound can evolve and maintain its initial integrity at the same time.

By far the best example of the boundaries of hip-hop, \\"Do you want more???\\" is the opus of the Roots. Not to say that their other albums don't hold muster (because they do), but this was truly the best the collective had to offer. The anthem of the Roots is \\"What goes on,\\" which combines the talents of their drummer, ?uestlove, their then-beat boxer Rahzel (since aptly replaced by Scratch) and their MCs, Black Thought and Malik B to create a world of rap in which one could exist forever. Other notable songs on the album include \\"Mellow my man,\\" which exemplifies the tempo changes that are the hallmark of jazz, \\"The lesson,\\" a freestyle-type song over an incredible beatbox courtesy of Rah, and \\"Distortion to static,\\" one of those songs that becomes an immovable force in one's head.

I guess that's when I got into real good hip-hop. I fell in love with the sound the second I heard it. 15 years later the feeling has not changed. This and Illadelph Halflife are definitely must haves. Some of the best music you'll ever hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorites","review":"I bought this CD in 1995 and it is still on heavy rotation in my CD player. Favorites include Proceed, Mellow My Man, Essaywhuman?!?, Lazy Afternoon, You Ain't Fly, and Silent Treatment. This is a really mellow, chillout, hiphop vibe. Definitely a hiphop classic"},{"rating":"2","title":"jazzy fresh","review":"yes. this cd is great. lots of jazz inspired hip hop beats. organic. blackthought has mad flow. i like it. i like illadelph probably more, though. still, this album is sooo good. i love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Hip Hop","review":"I bought this album back in 95. I havent stopped listening to it since. I remember people at my school had no idea who The Roots were. I told them \\"You will soon enough\\". Unfortunately it took about 4 more years until the rest of the world found out who these guys were. I have every Roots album (Including the somewhat hard to find \\"Organix CD) and I must admit this is there best. The beats are hypnotizing. The rhymes are just pure improvinizational masterpieces!! Everything on this album works. In a time when a lot of hip hop is just glamorizing and showboating...its refreshing to hear music like this. Ok I'll stop boring everyone just go out and buy this album you wont be dissapointed!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad movie, dont waste your money or time.","review":"This simplistic movies was just plain stupid. Changing names to protect people??? Names are out there already. It basically shows the sequece of murders and then people are scared and no investigation into suspects. If you have read anything about the Zodiac and have seen the good movie (with Mark Rufalo) this will be a major let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"It had me on the edge of my seat, but ...","review":"it wasn't what I expected. I didn't realize that there were two movies with this title, so great, now I have to watch the story over again when I see the other movie. Well, that's my problem, so why do I only give it 2 stars? I liked the suspense and it did capture my interest, however, I was upset that the movie continually used a child as a centerpiece of suspense when, in fact, a child was never threatened.I understand that as a parent you wouldn't know if your child may be endangered, but the movie makers knew the story and they exploited the role of a child to help their movie. That bothers me.Look, I lived through an actual serial killer spree here in the D.C. area including one killing in front of a store my family frequently shopped. I know what it means to be afraid for your child and it is insulting to have a child used in this manner. If it was only a small part of the movie, then I'm not upset, but this was the entire movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD","review":"Worst directing and acting I've seen in a long time in a Hwood movie. The main actor shoud be doing industrial videos for the Navy instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"just all right","review":"This was pretty much standard stuff, very much by-the-numbers. It did, however, creep me out a lot because I had made the mistake of watching it right before I went to bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peel and enjoy!","review":"Didn't know what to expect when I got it, but was pleasantly surprised! Solid musicianship, cool lyrics. Kinda reminds me of XTC, maybe a little bit of the Smashing Pumpkins here and there, without the polished edges. Lots of cool, moody instrumental passages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent industrial/hip hop/punk!","review":"SMP (formerly Synthesia Murder Program -- a name they felt was too \\"stereotypically industrial\\") bust out with a slurry of aggro industrial grooves on this album. \\"Pure Uncut Anger\\" is one of the standout tracks and as been featured on a couple of industrial compilations. Their cover of Ice-T's \\"Lethal Weapon\\" is hard and heavy. \\"Clementine\\" features great cyberpunk fiction lyrics of a bio-engineered person breaking out the facility that spawned him. \\"Cops\\" and the AIDS-related \\"Scarlet Letter\\" are also great songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"First let me start by saying that I have been involved with Karate for over 30 years, I say this because last year I wanted to study Kung Fu but was not sure of what style to study. A friend of mine gave me Grand-master's Pai Lum Tao book and told me to read it without saying anything else about the authur or Pai Lum. The book blow me away, it was one of the best books that I have read regarding a Kung Fu style and I have read many and also attended many schools as a trail member. This book lead me to a Pai Lum school in my area and once again, I find myself in training with the gusto of my youth.Thank you Grand-master Wilson."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst martial arts book since Karate for Dummies","review":"This is the first martial arts book that I have seen that has next to no worthwhile content. The information contained within is little more than the most basic martial arts knowledge combined with a lot of photography. The best part of the book is the abbreviated history of the Pai Lum style, though better, more accurate information can be found on wikipedia for free. Nearly every 5 star review is by a person whose name appears at the back of the book under the instructors list. Don't drink the koolaid, this book is a joke.On a positive note, the photography does show off the impressive uniforms of the Pai Lum Tao practitioners, studded leather gauntlets and matching belts. very nice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!!!","review":"This book is absolutely one of the greatest ever written. It is such a wonderful introduction to Pai Lum Tao. I could not recommend it more."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get how you can consider this good","review":"This is not very structually sound work, the stances are not very structured and i don't understand how this is considered good matial arts."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Ripoff","review":"Pai Lum is a mish mash of various Japanese, Hawaiian, and some mimicked Chinese styles of martial arts. Most of the enthusiastic reviews presented here are from followers of Mr. Wilson and therefore not objective in nature. Anyone wanting to learn real Chinese martial arts should steer clear of Pai Lum, and do a little research into the subject before they buy this waste of paper and ink. Pai Lum has been and will remain the laughing stock of those who practice true Chinese styles."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment, I don't understand other ratings","review":"When I received this book I was all hype over what I had read here. Apon opening its pages and going through it one will discover sparse information as if it had been hastily written and pumped out. Most of the book (around half) is pictures. And being a practitioner of kung fu (pi lum tao, bak ga) I found some of the stances a little off. I know I never hit every stance perfect, but if I were making a book, then I'd make sure they were practically perfect. Either the authur isn't so good a writer or I was expecting too much from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply The Best","review":"This book is the most informative Martial Arts book on the market. The Grandmaster of the Pai Lum System explains every technique to detail. I've been training in Martial Arts for 28 years and never have read a better book!!!! A must for everyone....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mahogany Shelf 48\\"","review":"The order received was in good condition and as was pictured. The only thing that would have been nice or improvement that could be made is to also have a mounting spot in the middle of the shelf or an additional bracket due to the long length and the potential for putting too much weight on it and making it bow or sag in the middle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Economic boat cover","review":"I think this cover is a great value. It fits my 83 Basstracker 3 pretty well. I like the straps that go under the boat it is alot easier than using bunge cords.The material seems to be a pretty good grade as well. I was looking at other covers that were over 300 bucks and also fitted covers from the local shop for 600. This cover is a great cover for the cost and quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"false adv","review":"Ordered hurricane boat cover (canvas)got polyester (cheap) cover.Company covered its tracks by telling me they were sold out,but according to amazon cover was in stock when ordered.Company did not offer to let me know when covers came in or no replacement at all.Told me to keep cover and they would refund all my money and they did just that.Now that shows you what i got and how cheap it was.I buy and sell on ebay and have never got screwed, but buying from a reputable co.got it.Take your at chance, it won\\"t cost you money."},{"rating":"2","title":"30 Incredible Years in Black & White","review":"30 Incredible Years in Black & WhiteHard To Find & Worth Finding4.75 StarsSimply put - Muhammad Ali is beautiful - inside and out -Howard Bingham has been a true friend to Ali pretty much since the beginning and has always and remains one of his closest and truest friends. I've read my fair share about Ali's life and each time Bingham is brought up there are only nice words used to describe him. I don't think I've ever read an unkind word about him...This book is a collection of black and white pictures that Bingham has taken over (at the time it was published) their 30 years together.

Scott Mathews and Ron Nagle do an excellent job on the first half - Nick Lowe and company kick it up a notch on the second half and somehow it remains cohesive. Hiatt comes up with some great songs and has never been more limber vocally. Essential listening.Music fanatic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good album, but not his best.","review":"John Hiatt is the voice that has not been heard by many. He is a great songwriter and has a unique vocal style that doesn't bore you. This album, while very good, is not his best. But, songs like \\"Death By Misadventure\\" \\"She Loves The Jerk\\" and \\"Girl On A String\\" are better than most songs that more popular artist release. You can't go wrong if you purchase this CD. It is that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired","review":"I bought this after seeing Hiatt open for B.B. King and reading the glowing reviews here. The show was quite good, a high-powered, growling, energized performance of a man with wit, charm, and talent.But this sounds like sleep-walking in comparison. Clearly people like this music, but to these ears, from those first mechanical techno Smoke On The Water notes, the whole thing is limp and dull.There is some good writing in here, but with the dreary music to accompany it, I can't imagine I'll be giving it a lot of attention. Maybe I'll just read the lyric sheet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iconic","review":"The boys never fail to make my jaw drop in awe.

It was wicked! They are so hot. This is the best movie ever! You get to watch their concert, and you get special back stage fotage \\"5ive weeks with 5ive\\"! Its so cool! They play some of my favorite songs: Battlestar, Shake, Everybody Get Up, When The Lights Go Out, Its The Things You Do, Got The Feelin', Until The Time Is Through, Slam Dunk Da Funk, If Ya Gettin' Down, Serious, Two Sides To Every Story, Don't Wanna Let You Go, Invincible, Keep On Movin', and We Will Rock You! 5ive is the BEST band! They are so hot and I love all their songs. Ritchie and Abs are the hotest. If you like 5ive I say, GET THIS MOVIE. Its WILL ROCK YOU!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No sound level control","review":"Got this just before a trip to New York City and I have to say I am very pleased with the color rendition, the high definition and the overall ease of use. I've had no problem with battery life and can store plenty on the 4G card I bought with it. My only concern, and it is major, is that there is no way to attenuate the sound when one is in high volume environments like street show with amplified music. The sound captured is atrocious, worse than useless. But in normal environments, sound is just fine. Playing files in windows media player gives poor sound synchronization."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aiptek GO-HD - BUYER BEWARE!!!!","review":"I purchased a GO-HD a month ago. The flash unit packed up on the first day and the camcorder does not switch off when closing the screen or pressing the power sitch, requiring the battery to be removed to power the unit off. When it was working, the zoom makes grinding noises which gets captured by the mic.I sent emails to Aiptek USA & Taiwan sales, support & marketting dept's and have not recieved a reply since, indicating their total lack of commitment to product support.If you are happy to accept this $250 \\"Throw Away\\" camcorder, buy it and take your chances."},{"rating":"1","title":"GO-HD 720P","review":"well,Just received it last night. Packaged well, as always from Amazon. The camera feels really cheap (buttons, screen, etc.)So, i receive it, charge the batteries and shoot a sample... plug the SD card in my pc... results:Video was ok (just ok, but it was indoor, well lit), but sound was horrible. Turns out the VLC player does't play the sound right, and with all the comments about bad sound, i figured it was just the way it was...I later tried it on my laptop which has quicktime and it came out much better (what a relief:, but still very average )I will have to try it more during the day, to see if it is worth anything...my thoughts are; maybe it is 720p, but its sound quality is subpar, and build quality is cheap, then is this really such a bargain??still not sure whether is should get a refund and dish out the extra cash for a decent HD camcorder.Overall, pretty disapointed..."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad audio","review":"If you attempt to record while thecamera is plugged in, the ac adapterwill induce hum. However, when the adapteris removed, it is OK.The problem goes away when off of external microphonesor when off of ac adapter.The camera will run out of batteries in the middleof a lecture. It does not have a 720x486(i.e., dvd) record setting, for resolution.Resampling is required if you intend to make dvds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound out of sync with video","review":"It's a $200 camera so I wasn't expecting much but I was actually impressed with the picture quality of the 1080 and 720 settings. The 720 60fps setting looked great and had fluid movement. The only thing I didn't like was that the recorded sound was about 1/2 second of ahead of the video. That matters when someone is talking to the camera. The still camera took bad pictures too, kind've blurry on the sides. I didn't buy it for it's still camera quality though, I probably never would have used it.I returned the camera though. Overall, if the sound would have been in sync it would have been 5 stars because it really takes nice video, vivid colors, autofocus seemed to work fine, crisp HD picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Picture","review":"I normall use a Sony HDV camera, but I have to say that this little camera has amazing picture quality in its HD mode, especially if the camera is on a tripod. Very good in low light too, Sound quality is also decent as long as you don't exceed a certain sound pressure level.Keep in mind this is a progressive 720, 30 frames per second recording (not 60), so one can't pan so fast, and that the .264 compression is good, but it is high compression so there are some artifacts when shooting grass, leaves, and water. Yes, the lens is noisy, the camera plastic construction is \\"loose\\" and does not have a Canon feel, and the battery life could be longer, but the camera (and a tiny tripod) can fit in a shirt pocket and records an hour of HD on a 2Gb SD stick. Amazing. I can't wait till the end of the dominance of the DV tape by the Japanese manufacturers with their overpriced tape decks. This camera may not be perfect, but it sure points to where shooting will go in a year or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bargain HD camcorder!!","review":"Impressed with the pictures & videos it took in HD all for only $250. Also has a histogram meter! Nightshot mode was acceptable & the zoom noise wasn't as bad as others made it out to be. It may not have all the features of more expensive models, but for the price I'm happy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the money","review":"I've read all reviews prior to buying it, and I am quite satisfied overall. There are some minor issues, but no show-stoppers. Picture quality is good, sound is OK, ease of use is excellent, bells and whistles are none. It's somewhat uneasy to edit the videos on the computer, but if you just want to cut out parts or stitch files together, try Apple Quicktime Pro, it's as easy as cut and paste. Software included with the camera is decent for viewing, but my Windows Media Player has problems playing the files. I wish there was the HDMI output, but included component cables do the job too.If you want a cheap and basic video on the go, it's a great little gadget."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],N={key:0},H={key:1};function x(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",H,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const R=d(C,[["render",x],["__scopeId","data-v-35d5ae4e"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/46.md","filePath":"glossary/46.md"}'),W={name:"glossary/46.md"},G=Object.assign(W,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{j as __pageData,G as default};
