The characters were dull and wooden, the plot insipid and contrived.A woman's husband is off to war and she is left to try to keep the farm and pay the bills. Her brother-in-law (really stupid character) is determined to get her to sign away the farm. It all depends upon selling or not selling six piglets (really!!).The young children watching began to trickle out of the room to go play with their Legos, followed by various adults leaving to get a good long drink in the kitchen and maybe a bite to eat, anything to not have to return to the Nanny McPhee Returns movie.Everything about this movie was poorly done.

I have read Being and Time (which I think is an easier - yes easier - book) and have done much prepatory work for T & M including Introduction to Philosophical Hermeneutics by Jean Grondin -- which I highly recommend).This book is brilliant.

Look at Plato, Aristotle, Nietzsche....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the struggle","review":"This is an extremely difficult book to read, especially because it assumes a level of knowledge about German philosophy that most people, including me, simply don't have. Even so, it caused me to think more seriously about how I interact with and think about art, literature, and history than I had ever thought to do before.

I read the first 50 or so pages, skipped a few hundred, read another page, and then gave up. The dialogue was terrible, the plot uninteresting, and the characters could not have been more boring and bland.

I was VERY disappointed with the flat characters and the flat story telling of this book. Maresa is a very hard character to like because of her exceedingly negative and childish personality. Percy is passive and wimpy and you just want to give him a big kick on his butt for letting Maresa run all over him!! And I was overly disappointed with Ms. Coffman's writing! It was almost as if somebody else wrote it and put her name on the cover, because the story did not flow, nor were any of the descriptions and feeling like her other books. Maybe because the publisher is Mira, and it doesn't have the high standards as Avon or Batam, but this was by far the worst book written by her."},{"rating":"1","title":"FORGET ABOUT IT...","review":"I was so looking forward to reading this book because of the childhood sweethearts theme (even though it was one-sided on his part). Unfortunately, I totally agree with all of the negative reviews. I could not get over how spoiled this \\"heroine\\" was. I tried to like her, but by the time she finally realizes how much she loves Percy, I didn't care! I agree about the \\"romance\\" part of this -- what happened to it?! I love books that cover some history in them, but don't saturate me with it. If I wanted to read about Napoleon, I'd buy a history book. Can't say I'll read another of Ms. Coffman's books because of this one.

This book comes as a big disappointment. The characters are unlikable, shallow, and uninteresting. The romance between the two title characters remains a mystery, as the heronine is (from start to finish) self-centered, vain, and unlikable. Also, the unresolved conflict between Maresa and her father was frustrating -- as I felt that this was the only really engaging relationship in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING","review":"Coffman is one of those \\"uneven\\" authors - her books are either terrific and engaging or disappointing. This book falls in the latter category. The characters are shallow and the story is difficult to care about.I used to buy all her books, then I became more selective. I wish I had passed on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!!","review":"I read the mixed reviews of other readers, but since I generally like Elaine Coffman's books I decided to give this one a try. Big mistake! I grew to hate the main characters and frankly couldn't care less if they did ever get together. (I secretly wished that Percy would get himself a back bone and finally give her the boot.) She was selfish and vain and he was bland. I forced myself to finish this by thinking that it had to get better... but believe me it didn't!In reading the spotlight reviews of this book, I must add that I am educated, well-read and a lover of literature and romance but I still didn't like this book, don't consider it written by a literary genius, or that it should be compared to Gone with the Wind!What this book needs, is a good editor to chop off at least 100 pages, liven up the dialogue and light a spark to whatever chemistry there's supposed to be between Percy and Maresa."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fifth Daughter","review":"Disjointed....Both characters are kind of pathetic. Maresa is so non-introspective (even though the author admits this and uses it to define the character) that you wonder if she ever thinks about anything. And Percy is a wimp. He never gets over or grows out of a crush he had on a self-absorbed child. I was very disappointed with this book. I have really enjoyed books by this author in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book","review":"It's refreshing to read an author who doesn't write the same story and characters over and over again. I have read every book Ms. Coffman has written and love each and every one. Her characters are real people and face real problems. In THE FIFTH DAUGHTER I truly enjoyed watching Maresa grow. She reminded me of Scarlett O'Hara in Gone With the Wind. As far as men were concerned, she didn't have a clue as to what true love meant. She was selfish and fickle and was unable to see the wonderful hero, Percy (who reminds me of Horatio Hornblower in the terrific TV series) was the perfect man for her. It took a war and almost losing Percy for Maresa to mature into a stong and independent woman willing to risk her life for the man she loved. This book is definitely a cut above the average."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cowboy Magic Shampoo","review":"I would not purchase this shampoo again...........Leaves a bad smell in the dog's hair.It truly should be used on horses....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drying and irritating for me","review":"I've used many benzoyl peroxide products in the past, and never had any issues. I think Clean and Clear discontinued my favorite benzoyl peroxide wash, so I tried this one. My face felt dry and tight, but didn't react too badly. It was a bit too harsh for daily use, so I had a milder cleanser for every other day.The real issue is that, for the first time in my life, my hands broke out in terrible eczema. I've never had eczema before, and after ruling out many other products, conditions, etc...I found out this was the culprit. At first I discontinued use, but I had so much (2 bottles) that I didn't want to waste it. After the eczema healed and a month or so went by, I tried adding just a dab of this into a much milder cleanser. It still made my hands painfully dry, so I can't really get any use out of this.Everyone's skin is different, but something about this cleanser HATES my hands.

This was not romantic at all. It was filled with excessive vulgar language, and voicing explicit sexual acts. The acting was poor as the casts discomfort with the script showed it as forkful dialogue. The story line was confusing, choppy, and pointless. In end, the movie leaves you with nothing to say.It appears that the director was smoking crack when this was made. Don't bother seeing it unless you want to go through the pain.

I have heard all the hype, but I just don't get it. I was not appalled by the foul language or the adulterous storyline. It was just the movie in general that I did not like. It seemed so pointless. I mean, I thought that it would be very in-depth, thought provoking. I did not feel that it lived up to all the publicity. Also, as a former Julia Roberts fan, I never thought I'd say this, but I am getting sooo tired of her. If you are looking for a more intimate film of the same genre, try \\"We Don't Live Here Anymore\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Godawful","review":"The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it's reassuring to think that no events similar to the events in this movie have ever happened. Not that no one has ever cheated, lied and generally behaved like a scumball, but that no one has done so for such incomprehensible and arbitrary reasons or with such utterly unconvincing dialog. In fact, \\"Aqua Teen Hunger Force\\" had rather more realistic dialog than this movie. In scene after scene, we're supposed to believe that there is sexual tension between these characters, even though they actually just seem to despise each other and feel very awkward around each other. \\"Time\\" magazine apparently called this \\"a love story for adults.\\" All I can say about that is that if adults actually behaved like this, then civilization would collapse in less than a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Critics are from Fantasy Land","review":"Most negative reviews of this movie fit the following two categories:1. The language was vulgar2. The people are not likeableSome movies depict Fantasy Land, where people are good, the endings are happy, and dancing munchkins pass out lolipops. If you are looking for such a film, the Wizard of Oz is always an option.Guess what? In the real world people swear. People manipulate each other. And the cowboy does not ride off into the sunset. He gets shot in the back by the woman he burned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Storyline doesn't work well.","review":"There's already been enough reviews so I'll keep it short. This movie just tries to use sexual inuendo and images to makeup for the poor storyline. It is not deserving of any awards. Julia Roberts is blah in this. Natalie Portman is good and Jude Law is good but the movie itself is disappointing and just goes round and round and ends up rehashing itself. The biggest problem I had was it showed peoples emotions changing with the wind without any real reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Needed Something....","review":"Like a plot...Like some believable characters...Like an ending.This wasn't really a movie as much as a bunch of clips strung together without any real, clear meaning. I could say it was foolish, sophomoric, vapid, and devoid of meaning, and all that would be true. But to be truly accurate about it, I guess I would have to ask Mike Nichols why he thought enough of this to direct it.Some of the scenery was striking and with what they gave him to work with, Clive Owen was very good, hence the two stars. If you don't see this you won't have missed a thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL","review":"Oh dear - what has the previously wonderful Julia Roberts got herself into here? Actually, she, together with the trio of ohter main characters, holds her character role well in this sad, depressing tale of unfaithfuless, sex, [...]It could have been so much richer fare, this movie. The underlying theme of two couples who really are more interested in their opposite numbers, is not original but nevertheless this cast could have done great things with it; attractive, and good actors all of them without a doubt. But the script is unnecessarily filthy, including a long email conversation about masturbation and oral sex, explicit references to all kinds of sexual practice hopelessly out of place in a '15' rated film (UK). Add to that the scenes in the sex club....you get the idea, be warned. What a shame.So actually my friends and I walked out at that point, so to be fair to this review, we didn't see the climax ( pardon the pun)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Clive Owen is disgusting in this movie.

But if you watch movies to be taken away from the reality of life and feel good, this is NOT the movie for you.The characters screw each other over and you have trouble buying that any of them with the possible exception of the Natalie Portman character really care about the people they are supposedly in love with. What's more you will have a hard time really caring about any of them. The Julia Roberts - Clive Owens story is one of the single most depressing couplings I've ever seen on film. This is not a feel good movie by any stretch of the imagination. The only way it might make you feel good is if you think you're own relationship is dysfunctional, it might seem better by comparision. But if that's not the kind of feel good you are looking for don't waste your time or your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"No message, no plot, no sex, NO POINT","review":"This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

This is one of those movies that you could just stop watching halfway through and not care one bit what happens or how it ends. Why? Because the characters are not interesting.

First of all the people talk so trashy and they talk about infidelity there are no scenes of them even being together IT'S ALL TALK. If you like movies that say we had an affair then show absolutely nothing about what happend and cussing and dirty language through out the film. IT IS SO SHALLOW AND STUPID.

The characters were so childish, self-centered, pretentious, shallow and selfish that I absolutely despised them all. I don't mind films that inflame my passions in a negative way - I've even liked a few (e.g., Larry Clark's \\"Kids\\"). But, this excessively talky and frustrating drivel was far too absurd to be taken seriously. I just didn't buy the motivations of the characters and frankly couldn't understand why I should give a whiff about any of them. Near the end of the film, I found myself thinking that if the characters were real people, as opposed to fictional cardboard cutouts, I would be more than willing to push each and every one of them off a very high cliff, not so much to end their misery as to end my own!!! I HATED this film!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wannabe grown up film","review":"The characters in this film keep deceiving each other, showing frailty and coldness at the same time. So many films fall into this trap. Apparently, being a real adult means lying, masking your boring existence with sexual adventures, being ironic instead of having a sense of humor, and being completely self-obsessed.Some people might welcome this film after an overdose of Hollywood sugary romantic flicks, but there is a whole wide world out there of films with interesting things to say. This one is as shallow as it is pretentious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe these reviews...","review":"Closer was absolutely one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

The biggest problem that all the characters had by the end of the movie was a lack of trust."},{"rating":"1","title":"BRUTAL","review":"I honestly believe this was the worst movie I have ever seen in all my life...It was so bad...it was fantastic...absolutely HILARIOUS!!...Dialogue so bad - it was worthy of rewinding to hear again!I am utterly amazed that many people actually enjoyed this movie!!!....The story, writing, and acting were all supremely bad and with really really obnoxious characters...I just don't understand how anyone could possibly enjoy this self indulgent peice of crap, except, as we did - to get a good laugh out of it!...but we didn't pay for it, and if you have good taste - I'd strongly urge you not to bother!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleazy-Not Romantic","review":"After the ads I had seen with that great romantic song, I was expecting this movie to be a romance. Boy was I wrong! It's the opposite of romantic. If you want to watch four very beautiful people do ugly things to each other, this is the movie for you. With no character development and random clips strung together, it's really hard to generate suspension of disbelief for most of the plot (such as it is) like...photographer Anna (Julia Roberts) hooks up with a guy who thinks he had e-sex with her on an internet porn site(Eew!), then leaves him to get together with her stalker. Hey, it could happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misery Loves Company","review":"I would like to be farther away from this movie rather then closer. This movie stunk so bad I had to open the windows. Great cast gone wrong. I love Jude Law, Natalie Portman, and Julia Roberts but they should have read the script before agreeing to do this movie this could have ended some of their careers. Based on a love triangle 2 couples seem to find love with the other couples other. Hard to follow and very dull and painful to watch. How this movie was ever up for a award is beyond me. Movie skips around in time from present to past to present but with no notice and very hard to follow story line. Save your time and watch something eles this is not worth the time or energy to follow this movie. Wish it was better because just loved the casting and scenery.

People fall in desperate love after five minutes of inane conversation. Jude Law is terrific in his first scenes as an obituary writer who gets a crush on Natalie Portman's character after an auto/pedestrian accident. But the next time we see him, he seems to be playing someone else entirely. Julia Roberts is flat as the photographer who falls for Jude-the- jerk. Portman is serviceable as the waif who drifts through the lives of the other three. As many have noted, Clive Owen steals the movie. He brings badly-needed energy and edginess to every scene. I really can't imagine anyone caring what happens to these four sad sacks (except, possibly, Owen). This is one of those films that critics love, and the people who have to pay for their tickets loathe. And I still have no idea what the title means.

Natalie Portman steals the show, but all of the four leads inhabit their characters with force.The story is every bit, or even more, subversive than you might think, and I loved that.

There was not a single character within this film to identify with in any positive sense whatsoever. If the message of this film is simply to convey that people are manipulative, deceitful, dishonest, jealous, and un-trustworthy; then I suppose it succeeded. I don't mind these subjects being addressed in a film but at the very least done so in an intelligent manner that arrives at a succinct message with purpose. There was no purpose to this film. There was a delivery with no destination. A film need not be uplifting to be of value so long as there is redeeming content and purpose within. This film simply made me want to take a bath with a brillo pad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too close for comfort","review":"Been there, done that. Who hasn't? That's why this movie is so watchable. Most of us, if we admit it, can identify with how these characters seek self gratification, hurt others, realize their mistakes, then go right ahead and make them again and again.

Should this have been the first film they ever made, they would have never been asked to act in anything ever again. Shame on them using such filthy writing in chat-rooms and filthy talking amonsgt themselves. In my opinion, the writers and directors are reprobate perverts in every way, who most likely need meds to sleep at night and who live deformed lives in the day, lives which must be driven by every demon in hell having a ball polluting them. I am disgusted that these actors egos made them graduate to such low levels, right into the gutter and cesspool of utter shame and perversion.I refused to watch this trash until the end.

I had to spend that time watching the brutal interactions between four physically-appealing people talking trash to each other and always wanting that which they cannot have.If you must see Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts in action, then watch this film not for the plot - which is transparent and cliche - but the ideas and questions that emerge. For instance, are people today taking intimacy for granted? When does emotional intimacy merge into falling in love?I could go on and on, but I will end with one final note: I liked how \\"Closer\\" had only a smidgeon of revealing flesh and sex scenes but left me feeling like I had just licked the pavement of Bourbon Street.

Love itself has been transmogrified into a degredated form of sex, dirty sex, and no one is the wiser. What follows in this depressing film, is the downfall of these four characters, their tragic flaws and biting cynicism. It's like a non-music version of \\"Chicago,\\" where love will always fail and sex will befuddle all. These tragic characters are well portrayed but to what end and for what end? Why must we see this rotten form of debauchery, what do we as human gain from this?

The only thing I'll have to admit that I did like about this film is watching Clive Owen. I think he's a hunk. But if he makes many more like this one, I'll lose interest in him too.

In \\"Closer,\\" the two men have cyber-sex, and by the film's climax fail to go into the actual physical act. This is a stag-fest, yes, but it is not about the women who are little more than pawns used by one man to attract/repel/attract the other. Finally, when Clive Owen tops Jude Law in the dermotology office, the encounter is a reduction to language and not the action that the men's opening engagement should lead to. This is a tale of how one man Tops another--minus the courage to show it in a post-gay world. Anyone familiar with D. H. Lawrence knows where this story is going. Think of the famous last line in the Ken Russell film \\"Women in Love.\\" The wife asks: \\"Aren't I enough for you?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Clive Owen was the only good thing in the movie","review":"Clive Owen was the actor who could save the movie.

Even the critically-lauded acting performances in this film are really nothing special. Boring characters go around and around in utterly meaningless and pointless relationships in which they manipulate each other selfishly, and in which nothing of any interest happens or is revealed.

I suppose the acting is good, if you like to see four great actors play characters who are so personally unattractive; not physically but morally.

If I'd seen this play, I'd gone outside at intermission, vomited and ran as far as I could from the playhouse.Unless you \\"get off\\" on misery and hopelessness, you'll avoid this film.

It is about relationships between silly self-important yuppies, with few real responsibilities except to their careers and their fantasies about themselves. None of them care particularly for the ones they are involved with, but instead are consumed by their own ideals of love. So instead of working on their relationships, they seek perfection. This has been done before, and better by others. The only thing that saves this film from total mediocrity is the actors, who really are good. It's just that the script offered little and the direction virtually nothing.Nichols is mainstream, but wants to have the cache of an Indie filmmaker. Alas, he can't have it both ways and so relies on stars to sell the film with their sex appeal. Idiotic, stilted dialogue passes for depth, and abrupt time shifts - where relationship shuffling must be explained - destroy the realism.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly Disappointing","review":"I don't understand how anyone could enjoy this film. It was by far the worst movie I've seen this year. In fact, it was so bad that I doubt I'll be able to enjoy watching the main 4 actors ever again.Although some people feel that watching 4 people destroy each other is beautiful, I find it to be depressing. This movie is about 4 \\"lovers\\" who use each other uncaringly, cry a lot, use the \\"f\\" word multiple times in every sentence, and who are completely unlikeable. It's like the director thought that having 4 beautiful people in a film was enough. I love a good drama, but this wasn't even close.The plot is as shallow as the characters.

Why do people cheat and risk losing their true love? It also delves into how much one can really know their closest companion and whether they are always strangers.The film is directed by Mike Nichols and is a story of four people, initially strangers. He does a fabulous job of illuminating how much one can really know about the person they love. A complicated set of relationships showing fidelity and cheating are examined.The characters are Dan (Jude Law), Alice (Natalie Portman), Larry (Clive Owen), and Anna (Julia Roberts). Dan writes obituaries, Alice is a stripper, Anna is a photographer and Larry is a dermatologist.The movie jumps from first meetings to humorous and sometimes raw honesty in their entangled lives. The script is adult, edgy, and humorous.

Closer is about the interactions between these two couples - their infidelities, their fights, their loves.Despite a talented cast, the characters are so thoroughly unlikable (the men crude and boorish, the women weak and forgiving) that I couldn't force myself to be interested in who might be cheating on whom.

The story of two couples whose lives are intertwined with a complex sexual infatuation with each other.

Portman just didn't cut it as an ex-stripper (not to mention the badly dyed hair in the beginning). And Julia Roberts as a photographer...I just didn't see any of them as being their characters, maybe I was expecting more out of Portman and Law.

The problem with this film is that is is too self indulgent and exclusionary to the point that only disturbed people could relate to. The script was formulaic to the point of absurdity. I guess people call this an \\" artsy \\" and \\" intelligent \\" film but sad to say it is neither. One thing it is however is a waste of time. I think the most foolish scene was between Natalie and Clive in the private loung of a stripper pub. This scene simply didn't need to be there but for sake of making a few bucks at the box office they though it wise to get Natalie to undress and shake her back end a few times. The only problem with that motivation is the Natalie really isn't that hot to begin with. She is just average looking at best, short with big legs if i am being honest. The only good thing about the movie was the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"z-z-z-z-z","review":"Does Natlaie Portman have to be in every frigging movie these days? And Julia Roberts- I though we were going to get a break from her too... let alone Jude Law. Hollywood attempts to do something artistic and intelligent in the line of French or independent films and again falls short. There are some moments of sexual tension and near excitement but unfortunately Natalie Portman does not get naked despite what some of the other reviews say. Julia Roberts plays the same chick she plays in every other movie except maybe Pretty Woman. Although this film attempts to be directly sexual it is not that imaginative and never hardly profound.

This product broke down very soon after I bought it. The previous Panasonic cordless phone with integrated answering machine that I owned, Model KX-TG2383, stopped working in less than two years. Panasonic products have great features and work fine in the beginning, but the products are terrible when it comes to longevity. They break down very soon after the warranty expires. What is worse is that, in my experience, the Panasonic company does not stand behind its products after the warranty expires.

If women are reading it, i'm sure they already know WHY they don't, whatever that reason may be. No need to spend 90% of the text on reiterating that to the readers.

I am a 24 year old who has always supported myself, looking for something that would help me better my financial intelligence and understanding. However, this book considered \\"women who's dream husbands divorced them\\". What? THAT is not why women should be fully financially literate, just in case their \\"plan\\" to marry a rich guy falls through. I think bringing the fact that women live longer then men is completely irrelevant to FINANCE. If you picked up a finance book geared toward men (what I mean is a book not SPECIFICALLY geared toward women) there is none of the nonsense.

Of my 30 years of living and knowing women, none of my friends are as lazy as the women described in this book.In fact, I know men who are as lazy as the women described in this book. The only women that I know who are identical to how Kim describes are my mother and grandmother or my friend's mothers and grandmothers. Maybe this is because they grew up in a generation where they didn't need to work.Perhaps lazy women as well as lazy men might find this book motivating to get out of the house and do something with their lives, but it's not a good book to learn about investing.If you want to learn about investing, read 'Rich Dad Poor Dad' and the Rich Dad Advisors' books. These books actually have value and good information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just common sense","review":"The first half of the book tells the author's story in an entertaining way but I jumped past all that and went to the meat of the book. What she has to tell is just pretty much common sense if you have bought and sold your own home and know how real estate investment works. She gives some good advice if you are ready to put in a lot of hours and hard work and don't expect to make a living from it too soon, maybe never. She uses a lot of pump-you-up hype in her story style so try to look at the facts and stay grounded in reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the return shipping cost.","review":"Rich Woman wasn't very helpful. I found myself getting bored reading through the stories of Kim and her friends reminiscing. It seemed like Kim couldn't decide whether to write an autobiography or an investment book, and ended up doing both badly.The book was extremely repetitive, and not in a good way. Kim was so busy trying to promote her Rich Dad products, the advertised purpose of the book was lost, and the plugs were very annoying.There was also no thought continuity through out the book. I felt like I was reading a term paper and there was a word count to be meet. There were paragraphs that served no purpose. They didn't bring a point home, or shed any light on what was being discussed.Ladies save your money and pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I read this book during a time when I was getting my own finances organized and together and was looking for one more book to inpsire me and keep the momentum going. Well unfortunately this book just didn't do it for me. As much as Kim preaches about financial independence for women I found her constant reference to her husband's success disheartening. I could not help but think that without her husband than no one would know who Kim is. I also found the financial advice too devoted towards investment in real estate. If someone were interested in real estate than I say read this book but if you are looking for a deeper meaning to what the term \\"rich\\" means to you and your own financial relationship than look elsewhere. Please note that I did not finish reading the book so this review is based on the first half."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Beginning to Wealth Building","review":"If you like reading an informative book that teaches rather than preaches, this book is for you.I expected Kim to tell me the steps she took to start investing in real estate, along with the pros and cons, but she went one step better. She sidestepped the stiff, one-person approach in favor of educating me through the eyes and stories of a multi-women reunion.You find yourself trying to identify with one of the women, but even if you cannot, you quickly and easily learn wealth-building steps throughout the chapters. Some situations seem extraneous, but that made sense, too, because life doesn't stop while you learn the ins and outs of real estate buying.If you're ready to build wealth through real estate, you'll keep reading to the end. And then, if you're serious about moving forward, you'll be motivated to proceed just like Kim."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone young women needs to own this book","review":"So much better than I expected! What a surprise! This book was so helpful to me. As the wife of Robert Kiyosaki, and a self-made, independent, multi-millionaires in her own right, Kim writes to the heart of women everywhere. Through her story and the stories of 3 of her girlfriends from college, I could identify thinking patterns about money and finances in general which are inhibiting.As the Rich Dad series of books do, this book shows the need for financial literacy and directs you to make the changes you need to improve your financial education. This book spends more time on discovering what assumptions may be holding a woman from even attempting investing. I liked the section about that helps us when our partner may not have an interest in learning more about financial literacy or investing and the section about dealing with people who have a negative opinion even though they are completely inexperienced. Great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should never have been published","review":"I've read other books from the Rich Dad company, and have been inspired and excited by them. This book, however, was a complete disappointment.I found it insulting that the book was written in a gossipy, let's-get-together-with-girlfriends tone. Did Ms. Kiyosaki really think that women wouldn't relate to the book unless it was conversation-based? The entire book only contained about four pages of useful information.Additionally, the many typos gave the impression that little care was taken with this book. It seemed as though it was written as quickly as possible, edited as quickly as possible, and distributed as quickly as possible just to add another source of passive income to the Kiyosaki's pockets.The fact that the Rich Dad company stands behind this book has turned me off to any other products offered by the company. My copy has been returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute fluff - nothing to learn here folks","review":"Plenty of good books out there about investing, and even plenty about women and money.

It's great that Kim is coming out from under her husband, Robert's, shadow, but come on, where's the beef? All it takes is a person of wealth and a name and you can publish anything. Honestly folks, you could write a better book yourself.

I grabbed the book in an airport before catching a flight because I had read Rich Dad and found it interesting. My main question from Rich Dad was how did Kim buy a 20 unit complex when she was supposedly broke? So, I figured I'd find out in Rich Woman. Nope! Again, this book skirts around HOW Kim and her husband's investments actually came to fruition. I was let down by Rich Woman.

If the dial covered a graduated slit, it would be better. Its not easy to cover the separate holes when you can't see them clearly. I can buzz the mouthpiece better without it. When making notes on the instrument the vibration of the lips is aided by the natural response of the tube length. On the BERP you simply buzz the pitch. It doesn't happen for me. I know that different people have different physical abilities, I don't think mine suits this item. I'll keep trying. Perhaps I'll get the hang of it. Personally I think blowing your horn using as little lip pressure as possible is much more useful. The P.E.T.E.

I played trumpet waaaayyyy back in junior high school almost 34 years ago. Buzzing helps you build your embouchure, and you could also practice fingering when attached to your trumpet.

It seemed to have no focus. Roth's best work, as represented by \\"Portnoy's Complaint\\", \\"Our Gang\\", or \\"Goodbye Columbus, is finely-tuned satire, but this book just does not measure up to those prior masterpieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"vintage roth","review":"I promise to keep this review short because I know there is nothing more unpleasant than a long review...did he like, or not like the book?....Yes, this book is a masterpiece: this is early-middle Roth when he is just starting to discover himself as a man and a writer...A must read for anyone thinking about becoming a writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unsparing, ambitious, funny but also bitter and obsessive.","review":"Roth's considerable abilities are clearly in evidence here: narrative force; powerful intelligence; an unblinking examination of the human heart and mind; an unsparing honesty. But so too are his weaknesses: a truly obsessive concern with men-women relations; an unmistakably bitter tone when he speaks about women; a story that in the end succumbs to its obsessions and anger rather than transcends them, or even finds a feasible accomodation. The endless, fruitless, explorations of the protagonist's pysche finally become too much for the reader; the work begs to be shortened. Still,there are many fine, perceptive (and funny) moments in this book. Roth, even not at his very best, demands reading and consideration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain Yuk","review":"Smell isn't too bad but when cleaning the box, especially where the cats have urinated, the litter sticks to the scoop like wet cement.

For the first few days this litter performed well and my cat liked it, however, after less than a week it developed a strong sour animal shelter stink that quickly pervaded my house and offended both of us. My cat would stick her nose in a pan and sneeze violently before leaving. It became clear she was holding herself rather than use it so I quickly found another brand.I must mention these litter pans are cleaned promptly every time the cat uses them so they are both near immaculate most of the time. I gave this litter a point for low dust but it had really poor odor control. It was closer to odor amplification."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dusty product","review":"Although it seems to clump well, it is a very dusty product (all versions that I tried), despite the claims on the box.

It doesn't clump very firmly at all, and I ended up needing to change out the whole box after only a week or so (I normally do this much more rarely) because the broken-up clumps became evenly distributed throughout the box and the whole thing smelled. It's pretty lightweight too and scatters easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy arm and hammer","review":"As you know cats have their noses in everything, I bought arm and hammer cat litter and found that it had a lot of dust in it.

Never again!","review":"We bought this litter for two new cats we adopted. It was on sale so we thought we would give it a go. I had always used another brand in the past with my cat who recently passed away so I thought trying a new kind would be no big deal at all. As soon as we started using it, the smell was almost unbearable. The cats would not even go near the litter box and the smell of this litter was making us sick to our stomach. I seriously thought there was something wrong with the litter. Possibley a bad batch? But I went back to the store and smelled another box, and it was the same. Never again. I changed back to my old brand and all is normal and the Cat's are happier than ever. I do not recomment this product at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"inadequate odor control","review":"I have to agree with other reviewers. The odor control and clumpability of this product leave a lot to be desired, especially in the corners of the box. If I fail to clean the box out for a day, the corners become super-saturated because that's where my cat prefers to winky tink, and it stinks to high heaven.The litter itself is unfragranced, which is absolutely essential as the fragranced products give me a migraine. I've switched to the unfragranced Multi-Cat Arm & Hammer litter. It controls odors a lot better without adding an obnoxious odor of its own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not block odors","review":"One of the worst I've tried as far as odor control is concerned.

I used it briefly when I first adopted a cat. It clumped fine, but did nothing to cover the smell. Anything arm & hammer I've tried other than their plain baking soda has been very disappointing.

Such as if you choose the male character he is refered to as a \\"she\\" the whole time. I collect anything to do with Inuyasha. But as much as I hate to say it.

It could be due to me expecting too much from it in the beginning but for the most part, this game isn't really interesting (and for me, a huge fan of inuyasha, to say that mean a lot!). The plot was ok but the dialogues were too reparative (you just have to say 'i'm scare' once/twice to get the pt across, not 5x!). The fighting sceens weren't too great ethier. It's mostly just taking turns: u hit me, i hit u, u miss, i hit u and win. skills have nothing to do w/ it, just plain luck!I'm not saying the game is all bad.

I adore Inuyasha, but from the moment I turned this game on, the only thing I could think was... \\"Wow, how UNORIGINAL.\\"I think that if I were still in my early teens (which - I think - is the average age of the Inuyasha fan?) I would have enjoyed this game more, but it wasn't very engaging, the \\"animated\\" dialogues made me wince (for a PS2 game, I think they could have done a BIT more with the movement at least...)I've just seen too many games that had better composition and more detailed design to be able to give any good points about this game.Sorry guys, but unless you're looking to collect all things Inuyasha, this game isn't quite worth buying. The best suggestion would be to rent it first to see for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good and Bad","review":"Purchasing it from Amazon was great. The game came on time and was in perfect shape. The problem with this game is that it is only about 30 hours of gameplay. As a person who plays video games alot, I finished it in less than a week.

I have only heard of Inuyasha by reputation but I have never really had the chance to see it. I bought the game thinking that it could get me started and give me a that head-start for the series. The begining of the game looks like a mini clip from an anime (which it was nice, probably the best moment of the game)until you get sent back in time. Anywayz, I'm not an RPG fan but I love FF and Kingdom Hearts. This game, on the other hand, was really a waste of time. What really did it for me was the very frequent battles. Something that could take you maybe 30 min. it now takes 3 freakin hours because every 5 sec. ur doing another random (yet similar) battle.Its a very basic RPG game, with not a lot of thought put into it nor a compelling story and extremely annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less talk, more action","review":"And what about the graphics????As a strong IY fan, I was looking forward to this game.We bought it some years ago, and I've just now gotten around to playing it a bit.I say a bit b/c I cannot stand another 30 minutes of it.

I don't know if it works on a regular DVD Player as I watch everything on my computer. Played with VLC Player (free download) without any problems.

A cop half man half machine finds his humanity and protects the humans and fights against the machines.

Problem with the rest of the movie is the storyline drags on, theres not much charector development as they are not interesting, the acting isn't good, the pacing at the times is slow and the dialogue is just filler with no substance. Its fun to watch the action scenes and the robot at the end but thats about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time or money","review":"For some reason I thought this movie was going to be good the second time around. I saw this movie when I was younger and didn't really remember what it was about. So when I saw that it was for re-sale, I jumped on it and brought it.

This movie purports to be a \\"cyberpunk thriller,\\" but if you started thinking William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, Neal Stephenson, Wilhemina Baird, Melissa Scott, etc. etc. -- think again.A few cyberpunk SF buzzwords are tossed into this incoherent flick to fool the reviewers. In fact it's just another Z-grade actioner starring a bunch of body builders, fashion models, and plenty of large projectile weapons. Plenty of explosions. Some very low cost locations. Some very bad dialogue. At least the cast got to visit Mauna Kea :-)The movie has a few moments of self-conscious humour and a few moments of cinematic style, but mostly it's just the same old same old -- if you loved Van Damme in 'Cyborg' then you'll probably like this one too.

They also did not lose performance over time that occurs with loss of power in the battery operated digital pedometers.The current version was a total disappointment.

Most of the stories could hardly be called scarlet; they are in fact often depressing. Some are amusing, Woolcott and De Maupassant, for instance, and Noel Coward, of course, is always charming.

One word of caution is this is one in a mini series of three hour long, I personal feel each is a little weak on thier own.The documentry narrator has a very neutral tone. While interesting it allows the viewer to project his or her own bias on the subject.\\"NO ONE CAN BE COMPLETLY NEUTRAL ON THE SUBJECT OF NAZISM!\\"On the the subject itself I found no great errors in history.One does need to remember that the Nazis created thier own links to history often deeply \\"warped\\".

But if you buy the set, be sure to save both the shipping list and mailing label. I found the technical quality of my copies so poor I could not watch them all. This was due to a defective product.

The scientific progression of archaeology has historically taken a somewhat circuitous course, with different theories and methods competing for the limelight. With this is mind, one can understand what a difficult task it would be to sum up this history, methodology and theory in one short book. Overall, Mr. Fagan has done an admirable job, and peppers the book with illustrative examples form prehistory. Nonetheless, there are some sections (particularly on archaeological theory) where I found myself reading and re-reading sentences trying to dissect exactly what he was trying to get at. I came away with a solid, though not complete, understanding of archaeologic fundamentals and the reality of archaeology -- and for a more complete picture, I will likely move on to longer, and more advanced, books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Briards","review":"I found very little about Briards and more of a general book on dogs.

If you really want good advice from someone who knows and understands this breed, contact Briard Rescue.

The beginning is quite slow and vague. The cinematography is very dull and most of the movie feels like a stage play inside the same 2-3 rooms. A lot of the story is rather dramatic and contrived about the list of enemies and old flames that arrive. There were several compelling moments, but a lot of it is based around bravado and a bit of chauvinism. Not really memorable lines or scenes.

Acording to him, the council was pastoral, but not dogmatic. How then to explain those dogmatic constitutions on the church and on relevation, with all those troublesome endorsements of Trent and Vatican I? According to him, the council was about openess, freedom, and tolerance. But the Council's claim of the Catholic Church to be the true Church founded by Christ and of the duty for all Catholics to assent to the teaching of the magisterium on faith and morals somehow gets lost.The book has interest as a relic of mid '60's liberal dreams. But for those of us who have given up our love beads and our sandalwood incense, it's all a bit embarrassing.For a better take on the Council, read Wiltgen's The Rhine Flows into the Tiber."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dissenter's/ Cafeteria Catholic's Guide to the Council","review":"I got a copy Xavier Rynne book that non-catholic friend picked up at a Garage sale for around $ .50.

Mr. Hans Kung is quoted with relish everywhere, but after 40 years of \\"the next Pope who will change everything\\" mentality from the Geritol Generation, look whose sitting on the Papal throne - Benedict XVI (Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger). It truly amazing how the Catholicism of reviewer above bears closer resemblance to Democratic Party Plamks than anything the scriptures bear witness too. The reviewer above who admonished the rest of us to take the word of a distinguished theologian Paul Lakeland who supports Women's ordination and dissents from just about every moral teaching of the Church on Sexual morality should perhaps study up on John Paul II's statement Ordinatio Sacerdotalis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weary History","review":"Xavier Rynne is back with his liberal cartoon of the Council.

Well, if you like A.F.I and don't mind stealing from the band by buying an item which they will not benefit from when it's marketed solely as an A.F.I item, and don't mind some wrong bit's....then go for it. But personally, to me buying this is like stealing music online that a band didn't release, it's incomplete and it's thievery.

In the introduction, the editor comments that \\"the short stories provide a fascinating glimpse of an author shedding one literary skin to reveal another\\". And, indeed, the diversity of style is one of the most interesting things about the collection. From relatively straightforward ghost stories to the dark humor of \\"A Lecture Tour\\", Tales of Love and Loss paint a picture of an author with a wide variety of skills and interest.Hamsun train spotters will notice character and plot linkages between these stories and several of the novels. In general, even though I really enjoyed the volume I am not sure that it is where I would begin with Hamsun. He was primarily a novelist, and as good as these stories are I have to think that they are to some degree benefiting from the reflected light of his greater works."},{"rating":"2","title":"plump and sweet","review":"I ordered cranberries by mistake.

Someone has got to remember these people.The list is only half the book, though. The other half is about the state of medicine in Poland during the war, and what efforts were made to keep people healthy in spite of the atmosphere.

Broderick Crawford gives a powerful performance, but sometimes he goes a bit too far and we get scared instead of laughing. But Holliday's performance is the one that keeps the movie at a steady pace, nobody can deliver such funny lines in such opportune moments as she can.

These two work very well together - it's a shame they didn't do more work together.Of course, the title is the \\"mother's curse\\" - if you had a mom, you may remember her using that line on you. I often wonder if that's why some people don't have children.This book takes you thru \\"expert\\" advice - and than shows you how the situation plays out in the real world. If you are a parent of a teen, you may want this book just so you can remember they don't stay teenagers forever (they _don't_ , really - tho sometimes it's hard to believe).So get this book, find a quiet spot (HA! what's that, the bathroom?) and enjoy - it's cheaper and more fun that psychotherapy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two seamless brands of humor","review":"Honestly, darlinks, I just love this book. Famed columnist Erma Bombeck teamed up with \\"Family Circus\\"'s Bil Keane to create an unusual and enjoyable book.Both of them write/draw columns/cartoons that talk about raising teenagers in the 70s (when this was originally published, I think) Keane's cartoons are not \\"Family Circus\\" in later years, but instead are sometimes-surreal glimpses of seventies parents and kids, such as the girl who has what appears to be a palm-tree-like growth of hair on her head, or the boy carrying a restaurant's worth of food to his room.Ms. Bombeck covers adolescent embarrassment, sex talks with parents, haircuts of the time, and so on. Her columns are funny, witty, and most of all, ACCURATE--especially with Keane's cute cartoons. Too bad it's such a short book--I could read this stuff forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny!","review":"This is a must-read for all parents.

After reading \\"Great Dads\\" I decided to get a copy of the book for my Mother and for each of my brothers and sisters. I never knew how much my Dad had in common with the Dads of Jay Leno, Cokie Roberts, and Mike Ditka. These famous people may seem very distant from all of us, but I'm sure any reader will feel as I did when I read the book: \\"these tales are descriptions of my Dad.\\"Reading \\"Great Dads\\" is a must for any son or daughter. It's sure to provoke tears and laughs as the reader reflects on all that we have learned from our \\"great dads.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly stupid, but a few funny spots","review":"This movie was the absolute worst film from John Landis' otherwise respectable repertoire.Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase's comedic talents are clearly wasted by a [bad] script and paper-thin characters.The gist of the movie is that Alyroyd plays the straight man to Chase's character. Both are low-grade intellegence agents sent as decoys on a mission to launch a missile from the USSR in order to test out the US \\"Star Wars\\" defense system.In a thinly-disguised swipe at the \\"Star Wars\\" concept, the system misses the missile and nuclear war is about to ensue...The ending is both predictable and dumb.There are some funny moments, but when the highlight of the film is Bob Hope dressed like the late great Payne Stewart, you know there aren't many."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun","review":"I have always liked this movie. I don't care what the critics say, this was actually very well done, is easy to follow, and in my opinion, was actually ahead of it's time. Of course, Akroyd and Chase were terrific.

I usually watch this film with my dad and we have seen it well over a dozen times together. We each have our favorite one-liners -- mostly from Chevy.

I gave it a 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"A HOPE/CROSBY STYLE \\"ROAD\\" PICTURE","review":"Spies like us is a tip of the hat to the great Bob Hope Bing Crosby \\"road pictures\\" of the 1940's.Chase and Dan Ackroyd play two low-level CIA agents who are sent on a rather bogus mission in Afghanistan to basically be expendable decoys.The boys are dropped inside a giant crate from a plane and when opened, they are lounging about eating Doritos! So well do they play their Hope Crosby roles that there is a tribute of sorts to the old patty-cake game when they encounter a couple of Russian agents.later, in the tent of a shiek they have to pretend to be doctors and perfrom surgery. Bobe Hope himself makes a cameo appearance.Of course, the boys eventually are the heroes of the movie and get the girls. Funny movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie - shame about the DVD","review":"Well it would seem that Warner Bothers have failed again to utilize the DVD format to it's fullest! The picture transfer is poor - in some places it's obvious that they haven't even taken the time to clean up the original print. Don't be fooled - 1985 wasn't that long ago! So this movie shouldn't look like a VHS rental copy on DVD! The sound is very much below par and there are no extras; no director's/actor's commentary, no cinema preview, no music clip by Paul McCartney etc (He did the song for the movie!). Overall, if you want a laugh and you see this version of the movie for a cheap(!) price - buy it. However, if like me you love this movie, I would recommend that you wait and hang on to your VHS copy in the hope that we get a 'Collectors Edition'. Maybe we will get lucky and someone from Warner Brothers will actually read these reviews!"},{"rating":"2","title":"classic humor","review":"Love this film.if chase and akroyd are great together.if you like there comedies from there prime.you will like this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great combination of one liners and visual gags","review":"After first seeing this movie in the theaters in 1985, I often rushed to the opportunity to see it again in the years following. Unfortunately these opportunities were few and far between. Chase and Ackroyd make a great pair, and their antics can be appreciated by any audience. I highly recommend this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed the movie and I would watch it again.","review":"I first saw this movie when I was very young, it captures the cold war era with a comedic approach. Chevy and Dan did a great job of protraying two screw-ups who end up being decoy spies without knowing it. After growing up during the Reagan years, I really enjoyed both the saterical look at how we were, and the very short clip of Reagan as an actor. Overall, despite a few slow spots, it was a VERY good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"movie deserves a 4 dvd is a 2","review":"i bought this one day and forgot the golden rule look at the box...well I got it home a found out after starting the sucker up it was a pan and scan scam!I'll keep it in the collection until a non-modified from it original version comes out...wide-screen is the way the director intended when will people learn!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Road to Nowhere","review":"Chevy Chase, Dan Aykroyd and John Landis have seen better days. \\"Spies Like Us\\" (1985) fails to recapture the spontaneous humor of the Hope-Crosby \\"Road\\" movies.

It was the biggest waste of time and one of the least funny movies I have ever seen.I only purchased it because I am a fan of Steve Forrest (General Sline). He played the part very well, becoming a parody of his character.Dan Akroyd and Chevy Chase were not funny. Not one single belly laugh in the whole movie. Don't waste your time or your money.

This camera met all 3 requirements easily.Size: almost as small as the current crop of cell phones. People couldn't believe how small it was. Personally, it's a little on the thick side so I put it in my pants instead of my shirt pocket.Price: good value for your money. More features than you'd expect from a sub camera. Comes with its own recharger and NI-MH batteries. About 13 hours to charge it fully.Picture quality: I was actually quite surprised by the picture quality. Really. It's more than just decent or average, it's good. Movie quality however is terrible. Don't bother with it unless you are outdoors. Also, you cannot record sounds.Bottom line: you'll be glad you gave this camera a shot. Great conversation piece too. Pop in a 128 MB memory stick and you can take up to 375 pictures at 1280x960!

I had a lot of trouble putting it down to go to work and stayed up late to finish it. I can't say enough about \\"The Black Jewels\\"Trilogy. If you like fantasy and the kind of writing that makes the world and the people in it come alive and jump off the page at you..then this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Collection","review":"A collection that touches everyone who reads it. A story of devotion to a person that moves you to be greater than yourself. Of men in such awe of their queen that they will stand as her warrior no matter what the risk. Of women so strong that they will stand against society to protect the men they love. A story about abuse, magic, tragedy, and success. I would recommend this book to almost anyone but a small warning.This book takes place in a world divided. Where the powerful magic seeded within the female of the societed can either be protected and nurtured- or destroyed...through rape. It is INDEED gruesome but worth it, every page. Just not a book for the youthful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps me coming back","review":"A friend in Adelaide, South Australia, gave me this book to read on the plane for my trip home. I've now read every book in the series and have patiently waited for the continuing books in the series as they've come out. I loved it. I love the dark, slightly twisted world that has been created by Anne Bishop and keep the series on my watch list. This series is among my favorites and I hope to see many more in the years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh...","review":"Wow, I really don't understand why so many people like this series. It was cliche and predictable; I could see the ending from a mile away! The characters were weak, and held back the plot of the story (Every freakin' character has unlimited magical powers! The lead female character is such a Mary Sue that I actually thought the author was joking. Also, why is every character unbelievabley gorgeous? That was a big pet peeve of mine while reading the series). I had to force myself to finish the books. BAD BAD BAD. If you are a reader of mature adult fantasy, do not subject yourself to these horrible books (no offense). One last thought...just because the story takes place in \\"hell\\" and has sex in it does not mean it is an \\"adult\\" story. Why did so many reviewers warn of offensive content? I felt like I was reading a children's book! Man, it feels good getting this off my chest."},{"rating":"1","title":"It wasn't so great","review":"As far as I can see, there was nothing to particularly recommend these books. The ideas behind them were nothing special, the writing was clunky, and i found the plot boring and repetitive.

If I were you I'd save my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only managed the first book","review":"Weak, predictable and boring.I read the first book and decided that I could not be bothered with this level of drab.

Unfortunately I find that the writing is very uneven, and there is not much continuity. It feels somewhat like a mixture of Anne Rice and Jacqueline Carey, with none of the finesse of either.It would probably appeal to readers of fantasy/romance novels like Cristine Freehan. There is not much intricacy in the plots, the S&M; seem to be thrown in without much thought and the characters have powerful emotions but lack depth or wit.I do not recommend this book as a good fantasy novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I was very dissapointed. The whole idea of the book is great, but the book is just a big dissapointment. Anne Bishop needs to attend alot of writers workshops."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!!","review":"It is really all I can say about this trilogy.At every step of this series I was intrigued. there was nota single moment of boredom. it was truely fascinating!

When I finished the first book I realised there was nothing to look forward to in the sequel...! Yes the character of Saetan is charming and funny, but that is it. There is no plot, no intrigue, you just follow the evolution of the different characters. The heroine left me indifferent ( didn't hate or love her), she is just boring. No suspense, so predictable. I ended up skipping sentences, than paragraphs, finally whole pages!!! Not worth the trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"It doesn't get much better","review":"I picked up this book on a whim and I'm so glad I did! As a lifelong reader of SciFi-Fantasy I find it difficult to find a writer with a \\"fresh\\" plot and Anne Bishop deals it out in spades. Not too many writers can haul out the old female-dominated world plot and make it seem new.The heroes are lovable, multi-dimensional and strong (I'd give anything to meet Lucivar in a dark alley). I hope Ms Bishop continues to write in this world for years to come.I will add that these books are not for everyone, they are very dark with a lot of deviant sex and may offend some."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anne Bishop Black Jewels Trilogy","review":"I haven't finished this book yet, but so far I am not impressed and having a very difficult time getting into it.

Of course, I HAD to get the trilogy. For 4 days, I did nothing else with my spare time but read this!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I really need to sleep","review":"All round great book about a young girls life from her cruel upbringing to her crisis packed adulthood, never a dull moment.The way the book moves through the four main characters lives is brilliant you cant help but cringe at all four of there tragic pasts and smile at there moments of happiness and strength.By the end of the book you feel like you know janelle as your own daughter and you understand why everyone wants to protect her with all the strength they have in them.Daemon, Saeton and Lucivar are great characters powerful, angry and yet very weak at times.No book is perfect and at times i found it convenient how easy people will distrust each other or peoples honor will prevent them from killing dangerous enemies, though the plot must go on so this is easily forgivable.Also alas what other readers are saying is true the word snarl or snarled appeared as often as the word 'the' in the book but if thats enough reason to turn you off a quality book then it is your loss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helluva Triology","review":"The three stories in the Black Jewels Triology demonstrate Anne Bishop at her best. They are fun, interesting, and enjoyable reads all. The good guys live in hell, and what is better than that? I am a huge fan of sci-fi fantasy novels and am pretty selective about what I reccomend to others, but I would reccomend these books. There is court intrigue, family drama, love, redemption, romance, magic, and magical creatures contained within these pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I hoped...","review":"I won't bore you with the plot summary and just give you my recommendation:Read this if you like dark fantasy with witches, demon dead, hell, etc. If this isn't your cup of tea, steer clear because it is too long to try to get through if you really aren't into the dark stuff.Maybe I would give this 2.5 stars If I could... not sure.Okay, I have to say that I am not an experienced fantasy reader. I picked up the Sevenwaters Trilogy and absolutely loved it and was searching for something comparable. However, the Black Jewels Trilogy is much different and not as enjoyable for me. I'm not sure if it was the demon dead, the blood sucking, the male slaves, hell, or what. It just didn't grab me and I didn't enjoy it even though I really really wanted to. Sorry, not for me but I could see how others could get into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the Book VERY MUCH","review":"I found this book to be a very interesting read.It was very well written and the story was very good.I also just thought I'd mention that in expressing their dislike for this book, one reviewer said \\"I never though Ewan MacGregor and Natalie Portman could ever be surpassed in their lack of sexual chemistry, until I reached Daemon and Jaenelle\\"...there isn't supposed to be an sexual chemistry between Ewan MacGregor and Natalie Portman--it's between Hayden Christianson and Natalie Portman."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would read these over and over and over again","review":"I absolutely love the Dark Jewels universe and these stories. The authors style pulls your whole-heartedly into the story and envelops you in the character's world. Whenever I get the chance I read the series through from start to finish including the supplemental stories. I can never get tired of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Unique World","review":"If you're tired of elves, dwarves and dragons, you must try this series. I found Bishop's world and characters to be some of the most intriguingly crafted that I've read. And you might as well buy the compendium edition, because you'll be aggravated if you have to wait to get the second book; the first book is a cliff-hanger.The trilogy is not high literature, but it is replete with compelling characters, true humor, and a world and premise that will capture your imagination.It is also sexy in an often dark way--not to the extent of Carey's Kushiel series but, if you loathed that, you might find yourself disturbed.Very high recommendation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most different vampire stories you will ever read","review":"The Black Jewels Triliogy, especialsy in this three-in-one set, is a GREAT read. I spent many a late night getting to know the charactors of this story. I am really glad that I now have this series in my personal library. I have been buying all of Anne Bishop's other books because these charactors really grow on you. I do have a warning for the faint of heart though... this series has some very descriptive \\"bad\\" things that the main charactor experiences. These sections are very strongly persuasive as far as not liking the \\"bad guys\\" goes.The blood drinkers/dead/night walkers in this book technicly classify this series as a \\"vampire\\" story but it is NOT a - \\"I vant to suck your blood\\" - kind of thing. Totaly unexpected \\"vampire\\" activity.I was enchanted with the range of creatures Bishop created in this book. They added a new depth to all of the charactors personalities.Over-all, i really love this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Jewel that should not be missed!","review":"This trilogy is amazing, addicting, and fascinating. You never want it to end. I connected with the characters and thought of them as my friends. Their wishes become my own. That's great since I usually root for the villain. It's obvious from the first chapter why this trilogy is award winning. I loved this book so much I started drawing sketches of the characters. Talk about being obsessed!! Jaenelle Angelline is Witch, dreams made into flesh. She is the most powerful witch ever born and ever will be born. She has to be raised carefully so that she does not become evil. This book is about her life from childhood to adulthood her friends, and her enemies. Any person that reads fantasy should not miss this Jewel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun times","review":"(not 5 stars...I goofed! Its a decent 4 star though)This series was allot of fun. Bishop created a fairly unique world and her characters tend to be interesting.After reading some of the negative reviews I'm left wondering about how a fairly clear cut book could have confused so many!This series isn't \\"hardcore\\" fantasy like Martin/Erikson, but it does have emotional moments and almost enough violence to keep my interest.This series is well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darkness reigns througout","review":"Anne Bishop's trilogy creates a dark and sinister world that pitches female against male and role reverses placing females into the positions of power. This book doesn't shy away from topics of sex, violence or the ugliest side of human emotions. A well crafted storyline and nicely designed world with characters (witches, demon-dead, warlords) you will hate and like, and some you will hate again. The only drawback of the story was the authors overuse of certain discriptive words such as snarl or snarling (really over 100 times), it seemed at times the only discription used. With that aside, overall the book was an enjoyable and disturbing read into the quest for love, the quest for power and how both can be ruthless and maddening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool, unique takes on the story","review":"I think that this book should be a must own for any phantom fan. Buy Susan Kay's Phantom first, but make this second on your list. Well written, and very imaginative, while still being believable enough to lose yourself in each of the stories. You'll wish they were longer, as I did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Marvelous Piece","review":"I'm obsessed with Phantom of the Opera, so anything that deals with it I'm there. I found this book by accident and was intrigued by its cover. I have an open mind when I read fanfics because I respect people's views and opinions and also their fantasies. I must admit, I was a little skeptical at first with this book, but I must say I truly did enjoyed it. Carrie Hernandez' approach to the real story behind \\"Little Lotte\\" (which is what the whole book concentrates on) is quite interesting. I was extremely shocked when finding out who the REAL Little Lotte was, and after pondering for a bit about it...it all makes sense. This book is based on the original novel, which I find it to be more intriguing since many fics take after the musical (I'm not saying it's bad, it's just a good change). I have to say that Carrie Hernandez did a wonderful job with this book and I highly recommend it to anybody who is interested or is just obsessed with Phantom of the Opera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth reading","review":"\\"Angel of Music\\" is a wonderful set of three well-written short stories. Each one focuses on Little Lotte and her relationship with the Angel of Music. In combination, these stories give a greater understanding of Leroux's book.I enjoyed the first two stories very much, but I didn't care much for \\"The Portal,\\" although parts of it were very interesting. I didn't like the repeated references to Erik's repulsive odor, which resembled that of rotting flesh. We know Erik's facial deformity was quite alarming, and that Leroux said Erik's hands smelled of death. I believe Leroux was speaking figuratively, referring to the fact that Erik had committed multiple murders, not that Erik literally smelled like a decaying corpse.Aside from this, however, these short stories are very innovative, interesting and well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCEPTIONAL ENTERTAINMENT","review":"This book with its compilation of stories was actually the first Phantom literature I ever came across. All others have paled beside it. Surprising that there are so few reviews for this author. Her Phantom is real and tormented; one can almost palpate his presence on the pages. The plots have depth and stunning twists, dark and sinister is the range of emotions Hernandez explores. I only wish she would write more, as I would definitely read whatever she published, regardless of whether it was based on the Phantom of the Opera. I highly recommend the book, though it might give grammar-aged children more than a few nightmares."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for a stinky dog","review":"although this does lather fairly well fragrence does not stay on dog I thought rosewater would emit a better after smell."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"The description of the dvd was incorrect, and it was boring.

The Hugger Mugger mat bag not only has ample space for the mat but also space for a change of clothes in case I'm headed to class right from work. The product is also very durable - through several washes the color has not faded and no strings are unraveling.

When you read Mr. Heller's work, you are waxed into the setting and see-saw back and forth between the same pivotal scenes over and over again--living life the way that Yossarian does. For anyone that dislikes this novel, I recommend watching the movie one time. It will resolve some of the questions I have seen in other people's reviews.I do not recommend watching the movie INSTEAD of reading the book. That would be giving up one of the most powerful experiences a person can ever have with the written word."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest books ever!","review":"The perfect anti-war novel with the everyman Yossarian as the protagonist. I enjoyed this book from cover to cover and it was one of the most witty, intelligent, and odd novels I have ever read. A classic for all time, it was a wonderful read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"This is truely a wonderful book. It is both extremely funny and sometimes shocking. There are so many memorable characters, it is hard to keep track. You really see the insanity of the military and war. The best character is the old italian man. You just can't say enough good things about this book. You have to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not funny.","review":"I'm not really a kid, I just didn't feel like signing in.I expected a lot from this book and was completely disappointed. It's not funny! You know that friend of yours who drags the joke out way too long? that friend is this book. I laughed a couple of times in the beginning and then I realized that that was about as good as it was going to get. And past the unfunny jokes, I felt like I was getting beaten over the head with the war-is-crazy, beaurocracy-is-endless message. He could have accomplished the same thing in 300 less pages. I can't believe I actually wasted my time reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really, Really Disappointing","review":"This novel is widely regarded as a comic masterpiece. The best I can say about it is that occasionally - and I mean once every hundred pages or so - it makes an acute observation about human nature, war, or bureaucracy. The satire in the rest of the book is too broad to be either funny or wise, and there is nothing here to make us care about the characters or what happens to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I have ever read.","review":"All I can say about this book is that \\"I don't get it.\\" Or what I do get, I don't like. This book is dripping with sarcasm and cynicism, and fails to make any point, in my opinion. Yes, the world is a cynical place, filled with cynical people, and often times large institutions behave in ways that don't make sense. I see this every day in life, so writing a book about this aspect of the world does nothing except breed more cynicism. I have enough, thank you. The characters are flat, the story is... ...weird..., and the apparent point and purpose of the story was waaaay over done. Like I said, I just didn't get it. I do not often put a book down without finishing it, but I figured my life is too short to waste on this supposed \\"great piece of literary work\\". It was so dis-engaging, I couldn't get through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOYCOTT SIMON AND SCHUSTER","review":"Fifteen dollars in the Canadian Kindle store for a novel that is almost 60 years old. Ridiculous. Boycott greedy Simon and Schuster and all of their books and authors. Their prices are way out of line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many characters, Too many mini-stories, Too many nonesense","review":"I personally don't read that many books, but this is one of the worst books I ever read. First, they're are too many characters. This book has too many characters that I can't remember even one of them in my head. They include many minor characters that nobody cares so you get confused about it. Second, it has too many mini-stories. It has lots of short stories that doesn't relate to any of the other stories and they are usually pretty boring. Third this is none sense. It doesn't have a major theme or anything and it's just talking about air force men being board of the war and just being crazy. It's like writing every detail of your every day life. I cannot believe that it saids on the behind that it is one of the greatest American literature and I would definitely not recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might have liked it better if I read it in Junior High.","review":"This is certainly one of the most over rated books of the 20th century. I had heard and read such glowing descriptions (And, in fact, the actual concept of Catch 22 is brilliant). However, the writing is so juvenile that I wish I had read it in Junior High instead of after college. Heller is seemingly willing to expend untold pages of drivel to bring off a joke, as in how Major Major became Major Major Major. This book would have been more powerful and more readable as a short story. 50 pages max. I had to force myself to plod through this sophomoric mess. When the war finally ended, no one in the book was more relieved than I."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unorganized, too many characters to keep straight","review":"I has read this novel for a English Class in collage and I found it absolutely mortifying. The psycho Yossarian with his flashbacks of memories and women who are protrayed at whores appaled me. I don't recommend this book to anyone who doesn't like idiotic scenes about nothing important."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was love at first sight.","review":"Catch-22 is simply the funniest book ever written. It is, in places, a deeply dark satire of the futility of war; where the lives of ordinary men are risked for the unattainable ideals and pointless pursuits of others. The reason that this book is so impossible to put down is that one moment it will have you rolling on the floor in laughing hysterically and the next crying uncontrollably over the tradgedy of the characters' situation. If I could only own one book, it would unquestionably be this one. If you read it once you'll read it a thousand times. Buy, read, enjoy. (Once you've read this you might like to visit: clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/yossarianlives to chat to other fans)"},{"rating":"2","title":"What is tragic is absurd, what is absurd is funny","review":"War is a summary of all possible tragic events. Here the main character, Yossarian, is someone who recognizes that absurdity has become a way of life for a world were logic reasoning has been twisted to support a group of persons who could not care less about their fellow beings.The problem for someone, as him, who suddenly becomes \\"enlightened\\" is that he can no longer be understood. Besides he can no longer be in communion with life as it was before. From that perspective everything that occurs becomes absurd, and what is absurd is usually funny. Here is the strength of the book, it proves that once you can laugh about the situations you are living, you are in control of your life andabove those persons who try to keep you under their grip."},{"rating":"2","title":"A BOOK LIKE NO OTHER","review":"Catch-22 is an american masterpeice. It really can not be characterized under any descriptions a mind can muster. It is a true masterpiece that deserves a read even if you are the most fanatical advocate of war. it is long, but when its over you will be wishing for 450 more pages to spend with yossarian and the rest of the group"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck.","review":"Sorry. I didn't like it. I tried to read it for school and found it incredibly hard to get through. The writing is bad and the jokes are not that funny. There are some good spots, but he rambles WAY too much. I have given up on finishing it. I am completely against war, as well, but this book is not brilliant or otherwise. If you want humor, I suggest Douglas Adams."},{"rating":"2","title":"An above average e-version of Catch-22","review":"Having read the paper version of Catch-22 several times, it's one of my favorite books... I was surprised how few scanning errors there were when compared with some of the other masterpiece books I've ordered for my Kindle. Especially the older, out of copyright classics, where I found many errors. I am very happy with my e-book version of Catch-22."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book to break you away from modern fiction","review":"Recently, I decided to abandon my Crichton, Clancy, and Rice books to begin more \\"serious\\" reading. \\"Catch-22\\" was my first foray into the heavy artillery. What a refreshing change! Although it took a few chapters to really get a feel for the rhythm of the book, I was instantly hooked. The atmosphere, the dialogue, the humor...head and shoulders above anything else I've read.It all revolves around Yossarian, a character that wasn't very likeable for a good chunk of the novel. As the story unfolded, he evolved from a coward, to a pitiable product of a dysfunctional environment, to a beacon of strength and sanity in an insane world.Heller's dry, satirical style was perfect for delivering this great story full of quirky, all-too-real characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"War is tedious, and so is this book.","review":"So, here's the thing. I know this is supposed to be one of the seminal works of American literature, and blazingly funny to boot. And while I have no doubt Catch-22 will maintain its place in the canon regardless of anything I write, I found the whole thing quite tedious.Perhaps that was Heller's point: that war is tedious, that war doesn't make sense, that the only way for a soldier to survive a war with sanity intact is to develop a sense of the absurd and act on it. But after 144 pages, I knew I didn't care enough about Yossarian or any other character to follow the absurdity for another 300 pages.Thus, a two-star rating simply because I didn't care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read if you somehow missed it in high-school","review":"This is simply one the greatest books in American Lit. Aside from Slaughterhouse Five (and especially if you loved that) you want to read this book. Like all great works, it may be about a particular time, but it's truly timeless.Also loved:Slaughterhouse-Five (Kurt Vonnegut Series)Mother Night (Kurt Vonnegut Series)The Siege of Walter Parks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"I almost didn't include this book in my reading list - thank goodness I did in the end!Although set during a war, the theme is about survival, insanity and humanity.The language is disturbingly funny and can drive anyone crazy.The story is not told chronologically, which makes it a slightly difficult read, but the book relies largely on its characters and the way that Heller sets it out presents better pictures of each character. At the beginning of the book we get the impression that everyone is crazy, Yossarian most of all. But as the story unfolds we realise that it's all just a hopeless attempt to survive the madness of their era, nobody is fool and least of all Yossarian.I'm currently reading it for the third time - definitely one of my favourite books now. The story may be too entangled to understand at first, but the characters come vividly to life and stay with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"quite a read","review":"Catch-22 was a tough read for me at the beginning, the story was just to weird for me and the characters didn't seem to likable except for Yossarian of course. As i kept turning page after page the story really took off from there, the characters that are introduced and described are quite entertaining. Catch-22 isn't the greatest book in my opinion, but it is quite an entertaining read and to understand the absurdities of war and the people that are involved in it. This book is definitely worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"All kids should read this when they are 18.","review":"This has to be the greatest anti-war book ever written. It is also very very funny, even though a lot of it is so-called dark humor. All kids should read this when they are 18. It will put them off any warlike thoughts for ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOSSARIAN LIVES!","review":"Read this book!I remember Catch-22 having a cult like following among my older siblings and their friends. Catch 22 seemed to have a wide influence in popular culture yet was not a best seller when it was first released. Heller's humourous war-time Kafkaesque nightmare retains its relevancy forty years on as a political and social commentary. No book has made me laugh and cringe so much at the same time.Technically, its probably not the best book I've read but probably one of the most important and influential.A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"the modern Job","review":"Heller is a modern Job, yelling at G-d, complaining to G-d, crying and laughing. His book is scary. Life has no meaning, it is Snowden or Sweden. It is our world that is insane, this is why we laugh insanely in order to stay sane. Heller: life is hell. Yossarian: what's the hell! Milo: is there a demand for Egyptian cotton in hell?I would recommend Every Man's edition of the book - it has a great introduction by a Canadian (or maybe British) schalor. By the way, a customer put a picture of the hard cover Every Man on the Amazon - that one with the Heller's photo."},{"rating":"2","title":"The wheels of the story went round and round...","review":"I was really introduced to this book by reading John van der Ruit's \\"Spud\\" novel. It was very funny in places and, as one who served in the Air Force, much of the scenarios showed that the author understood the context well! I will admit that I started to lose interest after a while as the author tends to spend whole chapters on individuals; some of them grabbed me and others were rather boring. On the whole, an entertaining read that explores human fickleness, the rigidness of societal structures and the absurdity of war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny but dull","review":"I wasn't too excited to start this book. I had to read it with my class at school and, well, we usually don't read very good novels. This one was...okay. The entire novel was a satire-making fun of war. There were a few parts that really made me laugh, but sometimes the book seemed to drag on and on with the corny jokes! And sometimes it didn't make sense just because the author didn't feel like making sense in order to prove a point. I know that's a certain style, but it irks me.I liked how the characters were well defined, if annoying at times. I know, I know-they're supposed to be this way. I'm just not used to reading any book like this one.I'm giving \\"Catch 22�?2/5 stars: 1 star for the fact that it made me laugh [sometimes], and the other for the combination of it being a classic book [then it must be good enough for people to read XD] and having great characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great war novel","review":"This is an excellent book chronicling the experiences of an American bombardier in WWII with objections to sacrificing his seemingly infinitesimal self in order to win a war. The prose is stirring and although the vocabulary can be difficult at times, it forces your mind to create a vivid picture of the scenes. The hilarious characters make you laugh out loud. My favorite scenes were with the two CID men with Major Major and the scene where Yossarion pretends to be a man who died in the hospital for the family of the victim. It was seemingly almost entirely a comedic piece until the last thirty pages, in which the reader arrives at the startling revelation that nearly all of the enormous cast of characters has died. Though it took me a long time to finish, I would gladly read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something everyone should read!","review":"Catch-22 is the story of a bombardier named Yossarian, who is a frenzied officer in the air force who believes that thousands of people he hasn't even met are trying to kill him, which is somewhat true, but they are really trying to kill everyone. His superiors have no compassion, and like other people of great power believe that Yossarian and other officers are there to serve them. Everyone thinks Yossarian is crazy but the only thing he is crazy about is staying alive. Whatever he does he cannot seem to escape the tragedy of catch-22. This gut-wrenching novel, which attacks the cracks in the dehumanizing military service of WW II, reminds us once again of all that we have taken for granted in our world and should not. This long novel took me awhile to finish but it was worth the effort. Every teenager should read this and find the deep meaning of catch-22."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book ever","review":"As a senior in Mercy High School, I have been forced to read many a novel. When I first chose to read this novel I dreaded that I would be preached to on the glory or horror of war throughout my reading. After completing this novel, I can honestly say that Catch-22 is the best novel that I have read throughout my high school career. Joseph Heller lets the reader decide whether war is good or bad and never forces his opinion on the reader. The characters act with human emotions and their reactions are as any real person's would be. Although the stories tend to bounce from one to another, in the end they come together and form a complete story. I was unable to put this book down and wholeheartedly recommend it. This is one book that you will not regret reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant satire","review":"This novel is a brilliant commentary on the absurdity of war, the stupidity of bureaucracy, and the nature of man's existence. Its serious message is told in a comic style, and the chronology ebbs and flows throughout. It is a long novel, but well worth reading through."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great CD version of the book","review":"A friend recommended this CD to me and it was a great recommendation. Jay Sanders does an amazing job reading this book. He provides interpretation that goes beyond the book and makes the book seem even more ironic and entertaining. Parts are laugh out loud funny. He changes his voice to match various characters and really brings the characters to life. I think his voices and interpretations for Yossarian and Milo are great. The part of the book describing events following Orr's crash landing and the time in a life boat is truly hilarious, made more so by Mr. Sanders's retelling. If you have read the book (which everyone should as it is a bit of genius and a great commentary on the absurdity of life) get the CD, if you have not read the book, get the CD. I think this is one of the best CD versions of a book I have ever heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Fun Then You Would Think","review":"I found myself laughing more then I thought I would with this book. Buy it becuase you want to see humor in a crazy situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unreal","review":"The word brilliant doesn't even begin to describe this book. The fact that a human wrote it restores my faith in the race. This is not an understatement.If you only read on book (ever), make it this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spontaneous, insane, a classic mockery of the unmockable.","review":"Catch 22 takes everything we look up to and respect and makes us want to spit on it, and vice versa. Chewing gum under the table will be seen an advanced microchip, and a respectful, bright person will be seen as a democrat.This is why I liked this book so much. If I were a character in Catch 22, Heller probably would have turned me into a king.The great thing about Catch 22 is that a man can write a book that makes no sense and has an insane plot and come out with a best seller. I have no idea why this occurs, but I go with the flow and I say Catch 22 is one of the greatest books I've ever read.I recommend this book to anyone who laughs at anything besides your everyday Disney type slap stick humor, and anyone who knows what everyone else hates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of highlighing and notes on the pages","review":"This arrived in good time, and the outside of the book looked great, but inside it is full of highlighting in differnt colors and notes written in pen. It is VERY annoying to read, and I feel mislead about the quality of this copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets Old Real Fast","review":"Repetitive, boring, long, and the constant self-contradicting statements got old real fast. I get that it's a criticism of war and bureaucracy and all that but it's a really poor one in my opinion. 2 stars for being mildly amusing and some cleverness here and there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange but not good","review":"Hard to read, strange book. Not sure why anyone would like it- it just doesn't seem to be well written, so even with the whole catch 22 point which is pretty clever, it is just bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting in a bad way, you might say.","review":"I am using my mom's account and so this review is by me, not my mom.I read this book for a book project. I must say that I was misled by the short description of the book that said that it was \\"full of witty humor\\". This book makes very little sense. The order of events is screwed up to the point that I was strongly tempted to rip out the pages and put them in some kind of a rational order. The \\"humor\\" in the book is really not that funny to be honest. The rare moments of true comedy were so scarce as to not be able to justify this books existence. Any morals or \\"big ideas\\" that you were supposed to get out of reading this book are lost in the nonsensical ramblings that I guess were supposed to be the plot. I gave this book a star rating because I was required to. Actually, I have mixed feelings about its contents and can't decide on a good rating. I guess the absurdity of the book could be a comparison to the absurdity of war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Fiction But Fact","review":"This is not a work of fiction but the pure essence of reality. If you've ever been a part of a private sector organization (business), the military bureaucracy, or any federal, state of local governmental agency, then you have some, most, or all of the characteristics of some of the lunatics in this book. Which one(s) depends on who you, in your true self, really are. War is the setting, but this book is based on human organizational psychology. Yossarian was the lone sane person in this story, which is usually the case in real-life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious look at the bureaucracy, and ultimately the underlying seriousness, of war","review":"Catch-22 is the story of Yossarian, a member of the US air force in World War II. The story loosely chronicles his time on the base. But mostly, it's an extended exercise in ridiculing military processes, thought, and actions, and at demonstrating just how crazy war is. The ridiculously exaggerated characters and their foibles make the story. They're so bizarre and chaotically presented as to almost make it difficult to follow -- but the humor is so excellent that it doesn't matter. It's a long book, worth the time to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant, Thought provoking, and Hilarious!","review":"Joseph Heller's, Catch 22, is without fail one of the best books ever written.

Take it slow and enjoy every sentence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough book to read- well worth the effort!","review":"this is a really difficult book to truly follow- however with much effort, and time, the characters, especially Yossarian, are brought to life and compassionate! I attempted to read this about 10 years ago, and put it down early. Now, after finally completing Atlas Shrugged (another tough read that took me two tries), picked it up again, read it through and enjoyed the predicament that poor Yossarian finds himself in (how to get out of flying that next bombing run). One recommendation- see the movie of the same name after reading the book, so that you can appreciate the effort that went into making a movie of it... Also, anyone who says \\"\\"catch 22\\" saw the movie it was great\\" who didn't read the book can have no clue about the true meaning of Heller's classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Book","review":"I read this a few years ago as a freshman in High School. It was just as good as I remembered, and it remains as my favorite novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"rather comical and classic","review":"Catch 22 is a novel that is and deserves to be a cornerstone of american literature. Author Joseph Heller uses exelent literary elements unfolding the random series of events and happening that keep the reader waiting to turn the next page.though the book contains confusing themes it is incredibly humorus.all in all catch 22 is a great novel and one of my personal favorites, but is is a book that you have to read it cover to cover to fully understand. that means no flaking out on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"it was love at first sight ... erm ... read","review":"Loved it loved it loved it.I'm not going to bother summarizing because it's been done too many times, I'll just say that it's an amazing piece of literature.

It's brilliant.That's all I can say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've ever read","review":"I have read this book maybe 8 or 10 times. And I thing I'll read this book many more times.

I was scratching my head over this book after several chapters and gave up on it after several more. It seemed to me that at the time it was written, the book may have been a powerful anti-war statement and perhaps an example of a writing style that hadn't been seen before, but I found it very dated, lacking context, and little more than a sequence of caricature vignettes and slapstick devices. Maybe I failed to appreciate it because I'm not American, though I have a decent knowledge of US history and I've been living in the US for more than a decade."},{"rating":"2","title":"CATCH-22","review":"Hellner's \\"Catch-22\\" is not the most intresting book, however, it does bring up important \\"fears\\" that society even today faces. For example, the fear of death is throughout the book and Yossarian has a tough time dealing with it. On a positive note, Hellner's characterization was intresting. He made simple \\"average-joe\\" characters stand out and have a role."},{"rating":"1","title":"400+ pages of the same thing","review":"'Catch-22' is a pretty famous book, so you might think you need to read it to be \\"well read\\". Don't. If you read more than 20 pages you will just be wasting your time. You get the idea by the time you finish the first couple chapters, and after that it's just the same stupidity over and over again. Save yourself some time and trouble and just skip the entire thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books of all time","review":"This book is excellent. It is hilarious and filled with humorous characters. It made me laugh out loud several times. The people that find the plot hard to follow, as Heller jumps between time periods, are just stupid. I find the unchronological order one of the best parts of the book. It allows the reader to see the world as Yossarian does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate description of Kindle edition","review":"If you want the 50th anniversary edition of Catch-22 (and who wouldn't?), with the new intro and critical material, you will have to get it in hardcover or paperback.

Purchased and returned for refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"original but annoying","review":"I had to read this book for school and I didn't find it an exactly fun venture- I disliked it from the beginning and had to force myself to finish it. The last about 70 pages or so are probably the best part the book, but the rest is hardly worth reading. I didn't like the humor or his writing style. I will say that I have never read a book like it. But if you are into reading this type of thing, then it would probably be a good for choice for a read. Otherwise I'd say, with this book, just don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"A classic mixture of hilarity and horror. If u liked Slaughterhouse 5, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece Refecting the Absurdity of War","review":"I first read this novel in 1967, when some friends were fighting in Viet Nam and others were marching against the war. Somehow this novel embodied the absurdity of the Viet Nam war, although it was written about WWII. I marched in Chicago and read and reread this novel. It penetrated the absurdity of the situation at that time. I continue to reread the novel about every five years. It still rings true today and allows a bit of humor the salve the bitterness of war and the beaurocracy of America. One hell of a novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST book i've ever read in my life!","review":"I've read a lot of books, and i must admit that this is the best one! I just finished this book 10 minutes ago, and i know i will read it again numerious times! This books throws the reader into laughter and next moment into tears.It fills the reader with hope and the next moment it feels like a doom. I wasn't able to guess the ending of the book until the very last sentense. Even second to last sentense makes it feel totally different."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the few must-read post-WW2 American Novels","review":"In Catch-22, Joseph Heller created a hero, Yossarian, who will go down as one of the great heroes in history becuase he is adamantly unheroic. If that seems like a paradox, it is, but it is only one of many in this hilaroius novel. This book is considered to be a stylistic masterpiece becuase Heller creates huge, laugh-out-loud funny moments by describing everyday situations in a way, and with a certain tone, that makes them seem ridiculous. Everything from standing at attention to picking up prostitutes while on leave is funny in this book, and the truly amazing thing is that Heller does all of this while at the same time bitterly satirizing the military, big business, and the lunacy of combat itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thinkers, unite!","review":"In response to Toronto: There is not \\"lighter\\" side of war.

The story was mildly amusing, but seemed terribly dated. It just didn't have the edge I was expecting. The joke names were simply foolish: Monty Python did much better in The Life of Brian. I mean, come on, Colonel Korn? Major Major Major Major? And that one officer (I forget his rank) Scheisskopf? (Snicker, snicker, I know what that means in German!) Perphaps it was a groundbreaker when it was released, and maybe its irrelevance today is due in part to its imitation by newer writers who have been able to give it a sharper-honed edge. I dunno, maybe I should take the guy from Toronto's advice and keep reading it until I like it . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Apex","review":"Despite a bit of sluggishness in the fourth fifth of this book, Heller managed to create a truly great book in a manner nobody had ever successfully pulled off before.Like the equally great SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE--really the only significant novel thematically similar to CATCH-22 written in anything like Heller's style--CATCH-22 is usually labeled an anti-war novel. I disagree. I think both are pro-humanity books. Heller and Vonnegut, like Voltaire centuries earlier, both seem to have reached a place when writing these classics where they could no longer stomach the absurdities of their day. It wasn't just war that nauseated them; it was the ease--the eagerness--in which they saw men become animals.They are, unfortunately, depressing books. Great books, but depressing nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the book, NOW!","review":"I'm the 357th person to review this book. The average rating so far is 4 1/2. Why are you bothering to read my review, isn't that recomendation enough?You want more? Fine.I give this book 5 stars because it is the most ingenious, funny and entertaining book I have read in a long time. It is not so much a novel, but a collection of stories about a squadron group in WW2 which somehow all tie in together. Each character has their own foibles, and each is described in amusing detail. At time it does repeat itself (how many times is Snowden's death referred to?), but this doesn't detract from the great wartime yarns that are being told. All in all, a very funny read that 9 out of 10 people will love.There, now what are you waiting for? Put it in your shopping cart, NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exhausting but Excellent","review":"While this book is draining, emotionally, mentally, and even somewhat physically, it certainly deserves is position as one of the ten greatest novels of all time. This cleverly written work of fiction is filled with masterfully utilized irony, paradox, humor, and suspense. It is a shocking novel that makes you chuckle, but with regret. Yossarian is one of the most unforgettable protagonists, the ultimate anti-hero. In addition, the novel is lush with characters crafted to make you laugh, cry, gasp, or pound your fist in rage. I once read another review of this novel in which the reviewer said the novel was \\"frustrating.\\" I agree, to an extent. It is frustrating because Yossarian is constantly trying to get himself out of a horrible situation, but he keeps getting sucked back in and trapped (hence Catch-22). If you are looking for an easy read, this is not it. But if you are searching for a fun, hilarious ride of a book, you've made a wise decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I the only one that hated this book?","review":"Pathetic.I forced myself to finish this book because it was heralded as \\"one of the greatest novels of the century.\\" I found it an amazing chore to trudge through page after page of absurd, repetitive babble, replete with needless descriptions of depraved immorality.If the point is that government/military institutions are insanely inefficient and bureaucratic, ok. I got that in the first 100 pages. Were the next 400 pages simply meant to illustrate that point -- making me \\"experience\\" the absurdity?. I really can't believe I read the whole thing.In all sincerity, I can not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Price","review":"I will not pay $12.99 for a Kindle book.

This book just tries too hard to be funny without any attempt to build on the storyline and the characters. Unfortunately this was twenty bucks I won't get back. I would like to beg anyone planning to actually read this book to not, one of the most absurd things was attempted in this novel and it failed miserably: to look at the lighter side of war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Cover; but one of the best books ever written.","review":"I wanted the white background cover with the medals hanging...I got at blue cover that was not what I wanted.I didn't mean for the above to be a review...thought I was communicating with the seller directly.

Very, very, few books get any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like MASH, except if every character was Klinger","review":"In my quest to read every \\"classic\\" work in history (seriously) I came across this supposed great work by Heller.I always wonder what I am missing when the jacket calls the contents \\"hilarious\\" and hundreds of pages in, I have failed to ever crack a smile.It's the type of novel (like Ulysses) that I truly believe most people \\"like\\" because they think they should, rather than based on it's actual contents.It's absurd, fine. And??? The characters are relentlessly stupid and I never felt, for a second, like I would ever want to have to do with them.Yossarian dumps his bombs willy nilly (of course, nobody ever questions that he might be dropping them on civilians or that the bombers might have to go back to do the job he failed to, and thus present more risk to his fellow Americans) and sticks around sick bay. What a guy.Bah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very original but pointless","review":"Some of the passages in this novel made me chuckle a little. No much, though. The kind of humor employed was strange and I have never seen it before but it just wasn't that funny. The novel had no plot. I don't think it was ever meant to have a plot. But the thing I hated most about this incredibly boring novel was the author's style which when he wanted to refer to something he repeated what the think was completely and used no pronouns. I cannot tell you how much I hated reading the same thing fifty times. He could have literally cut the book by a third then I might have actually finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmmm....","review":"more of a modern day substance-less story... many charecter.. hard readering. i could have summerized the point in a bout half a sentence"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Word To The Wise...","review":"I know... it's just me (it's always just me), but please take heed, and special notice that \\"Catch 22\\" is written in the form of a diary. Just as \\"Dracula\\" is. It seems most people don't mind the diary style, but I can't get over it. It's as though I'm reading someone else's letters, and it doesn't engage me at all. Take that for what it's worth. I can't get through \\"Dracula\\" either and that's just as highly praised, if not more so than \\"Catch 22\\".This is a public service announcement from a reader who cares.

It should not be taught in schools due to it's terrible language and the way women are depicted in this book. The humor in the book is just retarded and although some parts are kinda funny, you want to kill yourself reading the book before you get to them. I hate this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe after page 100.....","review":"I always wanted to read Catch 22 because it was a famous book (and of course the term was used in a Metallica song). I began reading it three times but after 50 pages or so, I always lost interest. I never could discover a story and the many dialogues and events are strange, to say the least. Someone once told me it is a great book after page 100 but I never got that far. So I can only say: don't even try reading Catch 22', read '1984' by George Orwell and listen to Metallica."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catch-22","review":"In my words Catch-22 is overrated. This book could have been summed up in one chapter, and in all its wordiness the only point is that war is extremely boring. Although each chapter had something exciting, Joseph Heller droned on relentlessly about a single character. The climax of the book is when Yossarian is up in the bomber on a mission to Bologna and the gunners guts fall out, because a piece of flak went into his stomach. The whole time the gunner is crying out \\"I'm cold, I'm cold!\\" One side of the book that I liked was how Joseph Heller made each chapter about one person, which makes it slightly better, because the cast is always growing. Each character is unique, and I value that, but his subject matter poor. All in all I had to force myself to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cynicism's a bore","review":"Tried it twice; couldn't be bothered, really - life's too short!

Yossarian as Everyman, struggling to define himself and to get by and get over at the same time. This audiobook production somehow never grabbed me. I found myself drifting every time I tried to listen. Was it me? Was it the intervening years? I don't know. I do know that this is a great piece of 20th Century literature that somehow is not done justice in this version.Catch-22"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic Work","review":"Catch-22 remains one of my favorite books for many reasons, but most of all for the perfected black humor. I also appreciate the witticism amid serious themes of war -- I can imagine it's very difficult to create an uproariously funny novel while keeping the heartbreaking absurdity of war at the heart of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catch-22 read for at least the 5th time","review":"I first read Catch-22 in 1962 as a student and fell in love with its tone,logical illogic and anarchic structure.

I loved the humour, character development and metaphors. No problem with the kindle edition, seemed to be well editted.

I honestly don't think Yossarian cares if there is a war going on--he just wants out. This is undoubtedly the best novel I've ever read. I finished this book a couple of years ago, and I still laughingly think about some of the circumstances that Yossarian got himself into while trying to get out of the war machine that he was part of. You don't have to be of the generation that fought WWII to thoroughly enjoy this book; in fact, you don't have to know anything about war at all to cheer for Yossarian in his attempt to escape the war. Through the study of history we learn that the victors of wars write the histories; Heller teaches us that if every one gets killed during the war it won't matter who wins.

The humor and insane logic make the pages fly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Vonnegut instead","review":"I read this book because I saw it was recommended by Kurt Vonnegut and then again by Matt Groening in a Life in Hell comic strip, so I thought it must be pretty good. It starts out great, but Heller's style is so repetitive it becomes pretty boring to slog through it. It would have been much better if it had been edited down by about half. My advice--read anything by Vonnegut instead...even his worst efforts are better than this thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Painfully poignant","review":"It seems most criticism of this book on the site asserts claims of dull repetitiveness and trite anti-war arguments. Even Yossarian however admits that the war against Germany had to be fought (of course to know this you would have had to get past the first hundred pages as so few of the critics have).The book is about capitalism, relationships, friendship, duty, service, love and the eternal paradox inherent in each. There is something human in this book that touches us as the reader in the depths of their humanity and throws us naked from the tree of knowledge (and good and evil too!) into the world around us. Enjoy the fall!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tao Lin is right","review":"Tao Lin's review is on the money. Heller repeats himself over and over - sometimes entire paragraphs - and not as a stylistic choice but because he probably didn't know where the story was going. No beginning, no middle, and no ending, just a long slog through pages of exposition with no real purpose. The concept and title are catchy, but its all sizzle and no steak. Not recommended, despite its \\"classic\\" description in most circles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get past Chapter 4","review":"I had high hopes for this novel; I mean it's a classic right? My 16 year old son had to choose a novel for summer reading and I helped him pick this book. The story was very difficult to follow and just jumps right into a confusing hospital scene. We hung in there and figured that if we kept reading it would eventually piece itself together and make sense. After Chapter 4 I had lost my son entirely and I wasn't too far behind. I rented the movie out of desperation, hoping it would gel a background story that we could carry back to the book. We couldn't get a third of the way through the movie! There were too many discrepancies between the two and the movie just threw us deeper into confusion. The book and the movie were very \\"Monty Python\\"-ish only not funny.

Personally, I am not a big reader, or a fast one, for that matter, so it did take me a while to read, but I most certainly enjoyed this book. Joseph Heller does a great job in putting comedy into such a serious topic as war. The book has so many morals like stay strong and success will come and different stories that will keep you awake all night; unfortunately, this book is hard to follow because of all the stories and you need to make sure that you remember what happens to each character and build off of that. I highly recommend it for more skilled readers.

Oh well, I don't suggest to buy this book, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take it with a grain of salt","review":"This is a wonderful book if you don't just put it down and decide never to listen to anyone again. It presents the \\"A person is smart, people are stupid\\" viewpoint brilliantly and is addictive and a wonderful read (pgs 85-91 are the best); but the worldview it mocks has something to say too.I recommend reading Kurt Vonnegut's _Cat's Cradle_, which defends lies and organizations, either immediately before or immediately after this to get a little balance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious for All","review":"Catch-22 is a comedic story that keeps you on your toes because of the hilarious actions and reactions preformed by those who are trying to escape the imfamous \\"Catch-22.\\" This catch makes it impossible for Yossarian and the other members of his squadron to go home. Everyone wants to be grounded or sent home so they don't have to fly dangerous missions. You can go home if your crazy, but anyone smart enough to say that they're crazy so that they can go home, is really sane. Along with Catch-22 keeping them in the service, a seemingly infinite amount of required missions also keeps the bombardiers in the air. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone ready for a good laugh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious book with great insight","review":"At first I thought this book had a pretty slow pace to it, but once I got beyond Heller's style, I found it to be a very humorous and entertaining depiction-or mockery-of our country's military, and of the way people in general tend to think. It has a lot of good insight into the decisions we, as humans, tend to make, and of the effects our constant need for approval will have on our lives.

While there are a few parts that are humorous, I thought the book as a whole was horribly tedious. If a student wrote a paper/essay like this he/she would get batted across the head. Verbosity reigns supreme in Heller's work, with tedium a close second. The attempts at humor are feeble. I suppose in the interest of being well-read it might behoove some to read it...certainly not for enjoyment. A shame really, because the basic premise is interesting and, yes, thought provoking. Perhaps I am in the minority, but I don't understand all the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled - this \\"classic\\" is a stinker","review":"Sorry, people. For some reason this book has been branded a classic simply because...well, I'm not sure why frankly. The satire hits you over the head until you are dizzy (unfortunately not with laughter), the plot is cellophane thin, the message completely muddled. The book flows as smoothly as a trainwreck. There are some witty commentaries but overall don't believe the hype. This book is an outdated bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"a dissappointment","review":"I read this book and all I can say is...it was simply a disappointment. I realize it was satirical...however the characters seemed 2 dimensional and unrealistic, and after a while there behavior and responses were so predictable, I soon lost interest and the book became a slog.

It is simply one of the most tedious, poorly-written books I've ever read. It makes its point well within the first 100 pages, then spends the next 300 plus pages beating you over the head making the same point. War is hell, the military bureaucracy is tedious and illogical, war profiteering (capitalism?)is evil, there is no God, there are bigots in the world (and half of them are in Yossarian's chain of command), blah blah blah. The characters are shallow, cold, and completely unlikeable - perhaps none more so than our poor, put-upon Capt. Yossarian, although I don't think that was the author's intent. I appreciate the literary device of absurdity as much as anyone, but its overuse in this novel struck me as...well, absurd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, it was okay.","review":"This book is interesting but it is not one of the best books I have read.

Catch-22 is a \\"no-win\\" situation or a \\"double bind.\\" B-52 bombardier John Yossarian is fighting to stay alive during World War II. His humorous and sometimes frighting realizations of war and life set this book apart. The characters in the story are both fascinating and absurd. Heller's story jumps back and forth in time.

So I will simply give my honest opinion regarding the story.I have laughed, cried and been furious simultaneously on a few occasions while reading this book, and I do believe it is one of those books that everybody should read at least once. If you are an avid reader you will not be disappointed here. If you are more of a casual story seeker, you will probably find some sections of this book difficult and cumbersome, but I would still recommend giving it a go as the exquisite humor mixed in with some truly head scratching moments make up for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"Even though this book was written many years ago I still recommend it for any one.

This book is a classic for a reason. Go ahead and read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The insanity of war","review":"Captain Yossarian has a problem. He wants to live, but thousands of people he has never met are trying to kill him! Every mission he flies as bombadier for the Army Air Forces could get him killed, and he wants to get out of the war. Unfortunately, the only way he can get out is if he's crazy, and wanting to get out is proof that he's sane.This is a biting, cynical indictment of beauracracy and the narrow-minded paper-pushers who make it so disfunctional. From the squadron commander, Major Major, who was promoted based solely on his name, to Colonel Cathcart, who keeps raising the number of missions needed before the crews can go home and volunteering his crews for the most dangerous missions, to General Peckem, who wants to add the bomb groups to his special services command, this book is full of over-the-top characters that are just barely within the realm of believability. This book is funny and infuriating, at the same time, and reflects the worst traits of any beauracracy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterical book with which any war vet can identify!","review":"This is a very funny book because anyone who served during war can identify with the insanity that Yossarian endured. I read it in high school, but I identify with it much more now that I've gone through two wars. A must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterfully Written, Surprisingly Funny","review":"For decades all I knew about Catch-22 was that it was about war, and for that reason, never wanted to read it. Last week I finally picked it up, and what I thought would be the standard war story was anything but.Centering around Yossarian, the bombardier afraid of dying, the novel circles through events, showing them from different characters' perspectives at different times. Joseph Heller masterfully takes the reader in and out of the minds of the large cast of characters, back and forth in time seamlessly.The book is raw, horrifying, infuriating, sarcastic, and surprisingly funny, depicting the insanity of war (or really of any enterprise) conducted by a mindless bureaucracy. Not a light read, not the kind of book I would ordinarily read but one I highly recommend because of the brilliance and depth of the writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be a sheep.","review":"Look, you're a smart person. You know what you like and what you don't like. Unless of course you say you liked this book. In which case I rescind my first statement.

For lack of a better word, this book sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Overrated","review":"Catch-22 is an anti-war book for the easily led and the ignorant. It's for people who just say \\"War is bad\\" without really thinking about why it's bad.The book is basically Dilbert in World War II. As in the comic strip, all the people in charge are unbelievably stupid, don't care about the people they command, and are extremely selfish. The common soldiers are of course much smarter than the commanding officers and try their hardest to get out of work. Their unwillingness to fight is justified (by the book, anyway) because their commanders are just so evil and stupid. Everyone's behavior is cartoonish and annoying.This edition of the book includes a preface by the author in which he, instead of saying anything useful, writes mostly about how everyone thinks his book is wonderful. Well, it's not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"How anyone could call this book a classic, or well written, or even funny is beyond me. Obviously, a lot people were smoking a lot of weed in the sixties to think this thing is worth reading.

Will be a Christmas gift, so we have to wait for the comments but the price was okay !"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of America's Greatest Novels","review":"Catch-22 is incredible. It is full of surprises, and twists you wouldn't expect a war novel to have. It gives you the chance to know each of the characters, and at times you even feel like your one of them. I highly suggest that everyone read this novel, it is one of the greatest novels you will ever read in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bucking the establishment!","review":"A hilarios book. This is the story of a WW2 pilot named Yossarian who knows that that millions of total strangers are trying to kill him and can't figure out why. It's uplifting and endearing as Heller narrates, in his unique style, camp life, populated by vivid, humorous characters that will never be forgotten. Most quick, humorous book I've ever read. the 468 pages breezed by."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a wonderful book.","review":"You will like it. Don't take my word for it.

You'll read it, and then find yourself or someone you know in a Catch-22, and it will make your day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comical from Beginning to End","review":"I'm not going to write a long review, as others have done a well job of it. I just like to say, it was just funny from one page to another from beginning to the end. The whole book reminded me of M*A*S*H with too many Klingers, or, they all seem to be a relative of him. All trying to get out of warzone as many of their comrades are dying mission after mission. I can't believe high schoolers are forced to read this? Sure, it has SAT vocabs strewn all over the pages, but so is sex. Shrug."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Confusion....Only Problem\\"","review":"Catch-22 is a great book to demonstrate certain literary devices. This book is a great book to understand foreshadowing and symbolism. Heller uses great symbolism to present the idea or purpose he's trying to get across. The one main problem I had with this novel was the confusion that Heller puts the reader through. I like books that have mystery but are straight forward with explaining the ideas, exceppt for Heller who makes you think you know the idea but there's actually a twist to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"How long will it take you to really figure it out","review":"The spotlight in which Catch-22 has remained since it became so very popular during the 1960's, is one of great significance to literature. Heller was ingenues in the way he compiled the stories of these seemingly simple characters. The further along in the story the more attached you become the each character. You fall in love when they do, feel loss when they are morning and find humor when you realize the foolishness of their situations.This book was the first of its kind in the way it was organized. It's plot is not in chronological order and you find things out long before you truly understand what they mean. This book is a wonderful piece of literature and recommend not only reading it, but possibly reading it again to fully understand it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brain Teaser!","review":"Catch-22 is really an amazing book. Heller opens with many random character descriptions and stories. Within the first few chapters it is easy to feel confused and/or lost. As the book continues, everything that was once confusing starts making sense and the book becomes rather interesting. This is where Heller puts the icing on the cake. Everything starts connecting with each other and the whole book becomes a masterpiece.Heller also constructs different feelings and views on war and the effect of it. If you are in the mood for an exciting, mind boggling, and action packed book, I suggest Catch-22!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For the complex mind","review":"Joseph Heller does a great job in piecing together this story. Each anecdote acts as a new puzzle piece. As the story progresses the pieces start to fall into place to form the overall picture: a criticism on the aristocracy of war.If you are into abstract stories that make your mind wonder what the author is truly trying to say, you will love this book. The writing style Heller presents is very unique. It leaves his readers split; you will either love it or hate it. The complexity of this text is better understood when reading it the second time through."},{"rating":"2","title":"I had to catch \\"Catch-22\\"","review":"It took me months to find a copy of Catch-22. Somehow, though, I knew that I had to find it. After the first sentence, I knew that I was going to love the book. There's something spectacular about a book that never seems to fit together. The time lapses in the book are just as crazy as most of the characters! I never knew when what happened, but the whole book had a simply CrAzY effect on me. I had to catch \\"Catch-22\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The book that shaped my life","review":"Sometimes I'm amazed that this novel, set on a WWII Italian airbase, could so change the life of a teenaged girl growing up in 1980s suburban Houston. How could I possibly have related so strongly to the book? _Catch-22_ is about the absurdity, the wrongness, the evil which is part of many familiar institutions. It is a primer in how to say \\"No\\" to meaningless demands, cruel commands, nonsensical orders. It is also funny. Certain passages still cause me to laugh out loud. The ending nearly stirs me to cheering. Like _Slaughterhouse Five_ and _Gravity's Rainbow_, _Catch-22_ is not *really* about WWII. Far from being a poke at those who fought the 'good war', it is a take on the society of the Cold War. Also like those other fine novels, it progresses in a circular fashion, replete with wordplay and strange imagery. I can't promise that it will change anyone's life, but it will certainly provide an entertaining and intelligent read"},{"rating":"2","title":"ONe of my favorites","review":"I didn't know what this book was about when i bought it just that it was supposedly a classic. After the first few chapters I was so glad i bought it. This is probably one of the funniest books i've ever read. It is full of dry humor and paradoxes. And it also makes you think quite a bit about the rationality of some things. I hope everybody reads this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal book with lasting re-reading value","review":"I am biased. This is my favorite book, but still... it is incredibly well written. Heller weaves this story dynamically, playing with time and character perspective with a dry, biting wit. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the very best","review":"I get a kick out of the \\"1 Star\\" reviewers who thought it was too repetitive, or too long, or just didn't get it.Keep in mind, this novel is written in a unique style that takes some getting used to. I remember the first time I read it, I didn't get it at all for about 100 pages and actually stopped reading it. But then my sister said it was the best book she ever read, so I reread it with a new perspective.The \\"running gags\\" are my favorite parts, but just the way it is narrated is refreshing, even thought the book is 50 years old. If you have a small home library, this book should be a part of it.It's hard to rate my favorite books, because there are so many types of books that are so different. But I would definitely put this in my overall Top 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic to behold.","review":"Catch 22 is definitely THE BEST book I've read yet. Joseph Heller's characters are very believable, from Yossarian to Colonel Cathcart. The plot is clear, but has its twists and turns, leaving the reader expecting more and getting it. The amazing amount of paradoxes in the book leave you pondering, and the beauty of it is that they all fit in with the book. Truly a must-read book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good, but bland","review":"i found catch-22 to be well written, but i found the humour very bland and utterly repetitive, even though the main theme of the novel is Yossarian being cast around and around again in the circle of catch-22. the only reason why i am giving this four stars, it would be three without this, is because of why it makes so much sense for Orr's whore hitting him over the head with her shoe: she paid him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reading material.","review":"For those that are thinking of reading the book, I recomend it above all others if you want to see a more clear view of how the world works. To all those that disliked it, they must not like to have the wrongs of the world pointed out to them and want to continue living with their \\"sheepish\\" ideas of how life really is."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRILLIANT, DAMN BRILLIANT.","review":"This has got to be THE best book ever written. It is just so so damn hilarious, and yet there are a lot of plain truths in it. Combines a serious message with total humour. It is just so so funny! And genuinely funny, not just slapstick comedy. This book is so great! I have read it three times now and would read it again and again if I had the time simply to memorise the wise-ass lines. Yossarian is such a character! The damn best book ever, ever written. Way up there with \\"Rebecca\\" and \\"Gone With The Wind\\" and \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"it deserves 10000 stars","review":"this is the best book I've ever read (even though I didn't finish it yet) It humor and style is just one of the kind. I admire the author for having so carefully interwined everything together. I must admit it was hard to follow but thats all the more reason to admire the author for writing it. So much of the points that the author made is true. It sort of forces you to look at life from a different perspective--very interesting point of view. I laughed out numerous times when reading the book. the authors way of thinking is just a breath of fresh air. IT'S THE BEST"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is very funny, but it can be confusing.","review":"This book does not follow a novel format. It is more like a collection of memories of the main character(Yossarian). It is very funny on one level and then the next it is very serious. Otherwise, this is a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a paradox that you can't help but connect with.","review":"Being a sophomore in high school, I didn't know what kind of treat I was in for when I picked up Catch-22. I was hooked after the first page. The witty paradox of Yossarian's situation and the realization that he represents all of us, really influenced me. John Yossarian's character really pulls the reader into the plot. I couldn't help but sympathize with him, yet there is something in his personality that offends the reader as well. He is crude at times, but it is so close to the way things were during that time, that you forgive him, and learn to love this character. I thouroughly enjoyed this book, and will read it again and again... I highly recomend it to anyone who likes a challenge... you will be pleasantly rewarded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, absolutely brilliant.","review":"This book is THE most funniest book I have ever read. I read it and could not stop laughing. It's so brilliantly written, with excellent style and jokes that are universal. Of oucrse, it's not easy to catch onto Heller's style, but once you do......absolutley amazing. I can read it again and again and still marvel at such astounding genius. Above all, it is FUNNY with a capital F. Satrical kind of humour. I love this book, it is my definite best."},{"rating":"2","title":"I could not stop laughing.","review":"This is one of the funnest books to read.

The image quality is so wretched, so absolutely horrendous, that it makes watching this masterpiece of a film quite literally impossible. The pixellation, at times, eats up not just individual shots, but entire sequences of the picture.Actually, I've long found that a number of DVDs from Image Entertainment have this problem. Ecstasy (by Machaty) suffers from it as well.It should not be legal to sell a disc whose image quality is this atrocious. I'm aghast that the company can even stay in business if they are marketing pieces of garbage like this DVD release.Bottom line: Germania Anno Zero is a magnificent film.

And comparing in what stature artistic concerns it with Andrei Tarkovsky \`s Ivan childhood is just one echelon bellow, equaled with Forbidden games. .I have seen them all these in the last two months and I can tell you with all the possible objectivity. This is another magisterial masterpiece of the Italian Realism. There is no way out along this struggling and gradually increasing tension.

And unlike Lombard's chemistry with William Powell (her ex-husband in real life)in that film, here she seems to have none with Barrymore.Barrymore has some good ham moments, as do Connolly and the other sidekick. As a whole, a long 90 minutes, with lots of painfully obvious \\"humor\\".For all the positive reviews here, I think smarter comedies of the period--like My Man Godfrey, The Lady Eve and Philadelphia Story--hold up better today than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barrymore Without a Net","review":"John Barrymore's over-the-top reading of egomaniacal producer Oscar Jaffe is absolutely brilliant in Howard Hawks' screwball farce. You basically just sit back in awe as Barrymore improvises a variety of histrionics, facial contortions, animal noises, etc. At times I thought he was in the throes of the DTs. If you are to find fault with the film is that the story struck me as being a little thin, despite being adapted from a stage play by Charles McArthur and Ben Hecht. Also, I thought Carole Lombard, lovely as she is as the former lingeree salesgirl turned toast-of-Broadway, came off as a little shrill. It seems like she was trying to go toe-to-toe with Barrymore but didn't have the comiedic chops to work with. Falls short of classic status but deinitely should be checked out for Barrymore's performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"She loves me!

After her departure she becomes a big star and he has nothing but flop after flop and is in danger of loosing his theater, so in one desperate last ditch effort he tries to get Lombard back...of course as a favor to her.Even after numerous viewing (easily over 20) I still love this movie and enjoy every minute of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Destroyed Packaging","review":"I chose this as a Christmas gift for my father.

Once you start this series, you'll find yourself living through the characters, first hoping they survive, then hoping they prosper. The Gods' role in the making of the swords, giving them to humanity, then, like a greedy child, wanting them back for themselves, imposes human qualities on them and makes their exsistance in that world much more believable while creating the background for the series.

The armband is ineffective. It is narrow and flimsy and the ipod flops around when you walk or move your arm. It is a bad design because the Velcro doesn't hold the case firmly, so it hangs from your arm and makes it useless for a work-out situation.I had actually expected to get a different armband with this, since some retailers advertise it with a thicker, more secure looking armband.

The lead actress, however, can't really act, and whoever cast Alex Cord as Grayeagle should have their head examined.

After all, don't we all want to know exactly why Freud was wrong? Unfortunately Mr. Webster does not tell us much; his book mainly consists of recycled material from diverse sources, confusingly assembled, plus a pseudo-philosophical meditation at the end. Curiously it seems popular to bring in Darwin, who is on the chart of all the \\"critics\\" of Freud. another interesting fact: people who are most eager to attack Freud as a pseudoscientist today are English Professors...

However, my daughter didn't quite get the idea that the plastic screws to adjust the strings actually affected the sound the strings make, so she continually turned them, and I had to keep adjusting them. In doing so one of the plastic screws snapped in half, and now the string hangs loosely and can not be tightened.

For what this product is worth it's not bad. Sure there's the flimsy (at best) plot, the bad dialogue, worse script, and every actor/actress has about as much of a delivery with their lines as one would expect in a B-Softcore porn movie. The only thing going for it is the rather steamy scenes of \\"action\\" and the two female leads. I came across this film while diving in the \\"dollar bin\\" at my local video store for a movie to fill out my free-rental with \\"Predators\\". All in all, I could have come out worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful","review":"I bought this because of the hot picture on the cover. What a mistake. This dismal video holds no redeeming value in term of production (dark), plot (nonexistent), dialog (inane), or babes (keep looking at the wrapper).

The first scam presented by this film is that the seductive beauty on the movie cover is not even in the movie! Big let down right off. The real main character has short, dark hair, terrible implants, and best yet - plays a biochemistry graduate student! The first sex scene is pretty hot - gives the impression the movie might have something to offer - further analysis proves that all the sex scenes are pretty much the same; same positions, actors, music and sequence of events!! There are three scenes that stand out not due to their excellence but simply for their change from the typical scenes the movie offers. Over all, this film (obviously) does not present strong plot or characters. If you are looking for sex scenes every five minutes - this will do. But don't expect anything original, impressive or creative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy low budget story, great softcore sex scenes.","review":"Overall, a pretty bad film. The acting isn't terribly great, and the story is boring in the way that those late night Cinemax movies are boring, but like those late night Cinemax movies, it DOES have it's good points.

Both are sexy, beautiful women and the softcore scenes with them are positively scorching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soft porn thriller","review":"Fairly good film of this genre.

The Perfect Curve let's you decide between two different shapes which makes getting uniforms ready that much easier.

The price could stand to come down but it beats breaking the bill or adding extra time to uniform inspections."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works fine .... but.","review":"I used it for a while - it gets a good curve in your brim but I found myself going back to the baseball and rubber bands because that gives you the \\"wrap around\\" on the edges - this product makes a very consistent arc and IMHO makes your caps look too \\"country club\\" With that being said, I think it would work better with golf caps but not on fitted MLB hats where you either go flat brim (not) or ball player style with the sharper curve on the edges.If you are going for country club, this is the product for you of course."},{"rating":"1","title":"Designs May Vary - INDEED!","review":"When I saw, \\"Children's Construction Hard Hat (Designs may vary)\\", I thought that perhaps the sticker on the front of the \\"Children's Construction Hat\\" may be different than what I was seeing on the website.

Forget about that, the rest of the incredible songs make up for it.Be warned, on the first listen, you may think NFG is a little slow and soft, but that's only on the first listen, and because sometimes the intros start out a little softer. They are actually harder than their self titled. ------ And FINALLY, NFG has their own sound. ----- It's awesome... here's my top 5 songs.Understatement - Fast and hard. Great start to CD A+My Friends Over You - A bit slower, but still good. ASonny - Great lyrics, really cool sound, kind of new for them This is easily my fav song on the CD. A+It's Been A Summer - Didn't like at first, now I love it. A Singled Out - Fast, cool guitar riffs. AGet this CD now.

Almost every song on this album is about a girl, losing a girl, or an ex-girlfriend. I also think Jordan Pundik needs to have his voice mature a bit more because \\"In the Story So Far\\" it gets annoying. \\"It's Been A Summer\\" is a good song but it just goes too slow. \\"Understatement\\" seems like an annoying pop hit and so does \\"My Friends Over You.\\" In addition, it seems like as you listen to \\"Head On Collision\\" you really get sick of it after a bit. Good songs on the Album include \\"Sonny\\", \\"Something I Call Personality\\", and \\"Forget My Name.\\" It seems like other songs are poorly written. It doesn't seem like New Found Glory is living up to all of their talent. If you like this kind of music and want something better, I'd check out either of Good Charlotte's albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emo-Bravo","review":"I'm not gonna turn my back on you yet...I'm not gonna let you down! and NFG does not let anyone down with S&S. As Ron Popeil would say - set it and forget it! Put this disk in your player and let it go from track 1 to the end. The hit (my friends over you)is just the tip of the iceberg with this collection. The only way to beat listening to NFG is seeing them in concert. I saw them at Roseland in NYC In November and it was a killer show!For fans of emo-pop, NFG is right up there on top. My 5 disk changer is loaded with NFG sticks and stones, NFG debut release, Good Charlotte, Get Up Kids, and SEV. Shuffle & play it's Winters 2003 max-mix for me! I recommend all three NFG albums.

My grandkids will be listening to this album some sixty years from now, and I can tell them all about how NFG created a cult following of 11 and 12 year old TRL teenyboppers. Get real.. this is NOt music. This is far from talented, creative, or tasteful. Everyone all at once jumps on the bandwagon and all the punk wannabes are hailing NFG as the greatest band ever. Yeah well, if you think this is punk, listen to THE CLASH, and then we'll see how \\"Hard and heavy\\" NFG is. This is a great example of music's gradual decline.

Punk sounds like punk no matter who is singing it- don't expect any great revelations. If you're looking for something to jump around to, let loose, and just have fun- this CD is worth your time.

I must say I was never a big fan of New Found Glory because of the apparent lack of talent (Come on, they make the same music that Green Day does, only with FIVE people instead of 3. Green Day even does it better, anyway.); however, I decided to get the CD because everyone I talked to would tell me how great it was. I didn't like it at first, but it grew on me.

Another band that started out sort of punk, but then got a record deal and became so pop that rock stations won't even play their songs. Emo is music that makes you think, and sometimes, if it befits the circumstance, makes you cry. The only reason you should cry listening to New Found Glory is because you wasted [$$] dollars. The people at the record store ripped your heart out and then stepped on it. Write a poem about that, poser."},{"rating":"1","title":"NFG Has Officially Sold Out","review":"I love NFG, but they have done what a lot of punk bands have done and that is sell out to the mainstream.

But these guys known as New Found Glory are quite adept at doing such a thing. Everyone is calling them \\"sellouts\\" or \\"fake punk\\", but that's the same with every other band that hits the mainstream. The bottom line is, if you enjoy music by bands such as Saves The Day, Green Day, Weezer, Alkaline Trio, etc., you will enjoy New Found Glory as well.

If you listen to this CD, and compare it to their self titled CD, you would see that both CDs are great, but this one gets the upper edge. Jordan's singing has more of an impact, and the songs keep them original. If you listen to NFG a lot, you would know that they have a unique style, compared to other punk-emo bands. Just because they've been seen a lot on MTV, people criticize them for being too 'pop' now. If you were a true fan of NFG, you'd listen to the CD with a better attitude and understand that this is another original New Found Glory CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Okay. So they're not exactly hardcore punk. But honestly, that doesn't matter. This CD rules.When I first heard \\"My Friends Over You\\" on the radio, it pretty much hooked me as a NFG fan. I rushed online and bought this album, and I'm so glad I did. Aside from the fabulous \\"My Friends...\\" (which is one of the only songs I know of you can repeat five times and not get sick of) the rest of this CD rules too. My favorites include \\"It's Been A Summer\\", \\"Head On Collision\\", \\"Belated\\", and the great \\"The Story So Far\\". If you liked Dookie, Enema of the State, or The Young And Hopeless, you'll love Sticks and Stones.

By the way I think this album is not perfect and extremely dramatic one, but just OK and cool. My favorite songs are No. 1 and No.6.

My overall favorite song is \\"Something I Call Personality\\". It is a really great song and i really enjoyed the lyrics. I also enjoyed the beats of all of the songs and I would rate this cd at a 5. I just love how they are so original and they dont care what people think about them.

The music is irritating and puts me in a bad mood; its akin to a mosquito buzzing in your ear. Pop punk is a genre that should've died following Green Day's Insomniac, however it appears that those fellows who grew up listening to that sort of thing decided to make their own mark on this once lauded music type.

I give this 1 star because they dont have an option for me to give it negative 10000000 stars, for that is what it deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"I've been listening to this CD since the day it came out, and it can't be replaced. I'm impressed by how much NFG has matured and gotten so much better when it comes to writing and recording songs. The cd has lots of songs that make you wanna jump, and some songs like \\"Sonny\\" that really hit close to home for anyone who's ever suffered a loss of a family member or friend. I think this CD is really showing a new, and awesome side of NFG. At warped, I told Chad that I really liked the new cd and he thanked me for the support and everything. It's great to see a rockstar who's still appreciative of the fans who got him there in the first place. The point is, if you love pop punk music like Blink182, Good Charlotte, and Green Day then check out NEW FOUND GLORY \\"STICKS AND STONES\\"!! I promise you won't regret it! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired","review":"I bought the new NFG album \\"sticks and stones\\" expecting them to mature from there breakup, revenge type, attitudes, but all we got was the same subject matter as both \\"nothing gold can stay\\" and \\"self titled\\", theres only a few good songs, but i dont even like them enough to remember there names first hand, im pretty sure they are numbers 3 and 8, but whatever, it will be in my cd player on and off for the next few months but after that it will disappear into oblivion with drowning pool, sum41, and every kid rock album every made. Its just uninspired, and its getting old."},{"rating":"1","title":"NFG sucks","review":"NFG is one of those bands such as Simple plan. They are all little kids who write songs that are horrible. All of you people that classify this band as punk are incredibly mistaken. Pennywise is punk. This is junk. Complete garbage. Anyone who is thinking about buying this album or any for that matter shouldn't. One of the worst i've ever heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm saddened, again.","review":"I feel bad for most kids and the music industry. We have touched kids with candy that rots their teeth and now music that rots, well music. Some albums need to be made to be critiqued and this one and the rest of theirs, and the rest of their buddies, buddies, buddies albums sadden me. I really do feel sick that these guys are the future. Smart kids though, really got some dough. I can't blaim them. I really can't, but it still makes me suicidal sometimes, knowing that this isn't a bad dream and that this is reality.Well, I'll never let my uncle Jim buy me a cd ever again. I'll just politely ask for the receipt or for some cash next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crash and burn","review":"Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh this Cd what can i say, its just bad. First the lead singer so called vocalist is not much of 1 because he sounds like he just came off the street.He aslo sounds like a girl with a really high voice. All the songs sound the same with ok lyrics. Some of the songs are good like \\"head on collision\\" and \\"my friends over you\\" but thats about it. So if you like good music i suggest you stay as far away from this Cd as you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catchy tunes and not much else","review":"Granted, the songs on this album are very infectious and at times fun to sing along to, but that is all this album has to offer. It has no musical depth and the music is pretty repeatitive; i.e. all the songs pertain to ex-girlfriends, and the subject gets old fast. However, New Found Glory will sit perfectly for young girls and for TRL viewers. I think that New Found Glory had the potential to be decent musicians, but this album just showcases the new generation of boy band music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good stuff","review":"The songs are kind of repetitive in subject, but the music is good. I enjoyed this cd very much. There's also a hidden track at the end. Don't listen to this when you're home alone! It'd pretty freaky. I do recommend this cd to anyone who likes the boy band punk tho. By the way, these guys put on an awesome concert that's way better than the cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"It took a while, but it was worth it.","review":"At first listen, the new NFG CD didn't really strike a chord with me lyrically. Sure, 'My Friends Over You' was catchy and all that, but after skipping around I had to bust out NGCS. After a while, though, I really started getting into the tracks. 'Understatement' and 'Something I Call Personality' are great, and 'Head-On Collision' is alright for a mid-tempo. I just wished NFG could really get the energy of their live shows into their albums (Warped Tour in Chula Vista was awesome!). Also, even though the relationship songs are good, the topic's getting a little old. Besides 'Sonny,' I didn't really see much progress in that area. It's better than the s/t, but still not as good as NGCS."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Found Glory Sticks and Stones","review":"I am a great fan of punk and pop punk and this can only be seen as a dissapointment. They are trying so hard to be blink 182 but they simply dont have the tunes. Every song is a samey and dull affair with a bad chorus other than \\"my friends over you\\" which is New Found Glory at their bouncy and perky best. Everything is perfectly polished with some decent guitar hooks but nothing really stands out as great or indeed good. Sadly New Found Glory sound like washed up punk wannabes....."},{"rating":"1","title":"My garbage man wouldn't even pick it up","review":"Garbage. I really don't care if these guys sold out or not. Even if you sell out you make a record with a few decent tracks. This one lacks any creativity. It's all whiny about how their girl doesn't love them anymore and wah wah wah. Someone needs to inform these guys that they're allowed to have input on the making of their own record, because it sure doesn't sound like they did."},{"rating":"1","title":"corporate rock","review":"this my friends, is corporate rock at its best... the 15 year old girls and boys call it \\"punk.\\" They must be punks they have blue hair and tattoos. the only song worth listening to is \\"its been a summer.\\" My friends over you is ok, but it's played out now. And finally... those of you who think they have \\"hard and heavy\\" guitar riffs, i have got two words for yall GOOD RIDDANCE."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected more","review":"NFG is one of my favorte groups. I got hooked after listening to thier self titled release, which is one of the best I've ever heard. My hopes were high when I first got Sticks and Stones, but after a few listens I felt that the CD as a whole was kinda weak. It has its high points with Understatement (my favorite on the disc), My Friends Over You and Forget My Name. Other OK songs are It's Been a Summer, Something I Call Personality and Singled Out. Everything else is pretty much filler. This CD has a much different feel than their previous albums, and it seems as if they have lost a lot of the energy in their songs and have replaced it with emotion. Unless you're a [real] fan and are [eager] to buy the CD, just download these songs and you'll be satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Both CDs occupy my stereo!","review":"First off, I think it is awesome of NFG to give new or previously unheard-of bands a break. It really says something. Now, on the the music!Of course the \\"Sticks & Stones\\" CD is awesome, Jordan's voice is amazing. My personal favorite songs are 'Sonny' and 'My Friends Over You'. What can I say, they're catchy and the lyrics are unusual by today's standards.I thought the extra disc wouldn't be all that good, but I was wrong! I don't really like \\"Head On Collision\\" on the regular CD, but the acoustic version is on this CD and I really like it. I love all the songs on it; my favorites are 'What It Is To Burn', 'Best Of Me', and 'Pride War'.This 2-disc set is really a bargain, and the music is amazing! Even though the bands on it are pretty much unknown, (to me, at least) I hope they do well in their careers."},{"rating":"2","title":"NFG","review":"When i heard NFG for the first time it was in concert, i loved them so i bought one of there cds,when this one came out i was like \\"oh my god its gonna rock\\" but i was really disappointed, its good and all, but it isnt nearly as good as the first one. I would suggest buying it, but only if you have like there older ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't punk...","review":"This CD is the worst thing I have ever heard. This isn't punk or good music. How dare NFG call themselves punk. And becasue of this music everybody who buys this CD thinks there all hardcore punk now. Get over it. This is a discrace to punk. I am not even a big punk fan and I know this CD is horrible. The singers voice is so annoying and the lyrics are pointless. If you want a good punk band try The Clash or the Toy Dolls, that's punk. I hope this helps all you people who want to listen to good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS PEOPLE ARE NOT PUNK, THEY'RE POP.","review":"THIS PEOPLE ARE WHAT EVERY PUNK FEARS, A SONG SO POPPY THAT PREPS CAN LISTEN TO IT, LABELED PUNK, THESE PEOPLE ARE RUINING PUNK ROCK"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst. Band. Ever.","review":"Let's get one thing straight right off the bat, this new craze of \\"emo\\" that's currently making it's way into the mainstream, you know, bands like Saves The Day, Dashboard Confessional, and The Ataris, is probably the WORST form of music I have ever heard. It makes Korn nockoff look intellegent, and it makes **** rock bands like Nickelback look like actual musicians.Now on to NFG, to put it bluntly, this band is everything that's wrong with punk. Whiny voices, extremly stupid lyrics, horrible musicianship, and of course the fact that each song they make sounds exactly the same. I can take one or two songs on an album being about a past relationship, but these \\"emo\\" outfits like NFG that dedicate their whole album to puppy love relationships 10-15 years ago is just sad.Honestly if you think this band and their clones are cool...just stop listening to music all together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow this CD is Terrible","review":"I would rather have listened to N Sync or Britney Spears, no wait, nevermind, it wasn't that bad, but it still stunk, dont buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you think your getting--Check carefully!!","review":"If you are purchasing this for a class, I highly recommend that you purchase the package from the schools bookstore.

My beef with this DVD is the cover (front and back), which ruins the film entirely. This film boasts arguably the greatest ending in film history, so what do the geniuses who design the cover do? Put the end scene right on it. This completely ruins it for anyone who hasn't seen it before; the greatness of the end is its surprise and shock, and anyone who buys this DVD now sees it straight off and its effect is reduced to almost nothing.

Poorly-conceived DVD/VHS packaging is worth 1 star.I saw 'Planet of the Apes' years ago, and to-date it remains one of my favorite SF movies. It had one of the best surprise endings of all time, ranking up there with the likes of 'The Sixth Sense', 'The Usual Suspects', 'The Sting', 'Wild Things' and 'No Way Out'.I noticed that the cover of both the DVD and VHS versions (as shown on Amazon.com) gives away the ending of the movie. Now this doesn't make any sense to me whatsoever. I guess some marketing genius at 20th Century Fox believes that everyone has already seen this movie and knows the ending, without thinking that there might be a whole generation of kids who have never seen the film.Since the DVD version will not be released until 21st August 2001, may I suggest to the folks at 20th Century Fox to change the packaging if it is still possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie is anamorphic but the extras are just retread....","review":"It's nice to see that this movie is finally being released as an animorphic widescreen version, but ALL of the extras are already available on the BEHIND THE PLANET OF THE APES 2 DVD set.

The film has a coherent narrative which was definitely lacking in Tim Burton's version. The world in which the apes inhabit is richly imagined. The basic premise of man's inhumanity to itself and other creatures may be heavy-handed at times but not overly so. The ape make-up is breathtaking and does not impede the actors sporting it. Director Franklin J. Schaffner has assembled a first-rate cast with Charlton Heston solid as the astronaut, Taylor, Roddy McDowell and Kim Hunter give superb performances as the sympathetic ape scientists Cornelius and Zira and Maurice Evans appropriately crotchety as head ape scientist Dr. Zaius. Linda Harrison, wife of a then Fox executive, is visually stunning as Nova, the human girl the apes attempt to mate with Taylor."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"You did it. You cut up his brain, you bloody baboon!\\"","review":"Great movie. Love it for its originality and simplicty. Certainly a far different role for Charlton Heston. The musical score is awesome and sets the proper tone for the movie throughout its entirety; especially the begining. In my opinion its far superior to the 2001 remake. Don't understand why some people trash this movie because it doesn't answer certain questions to their satisfaction. This movie is pure science fiction and fanatsy not about reality or shakespere. Its not supposed to be taken seriously, just relax and enjoy about 2 hrs of family entertainment/adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll be a monkey's uncle!","review":"Short and sweet?

It very well may be, but this is rather like applauding Dan Quayle for his best spelling or Woody Allen for his best weight-lifting.

Pretty much everybody has heard of the film \\"Planet of the Apes\\" and knows something about it, so it's unlikely many with taste and discrimination and intelligence will come here (which accounts for all the five-star \\"reviews\\"), but just in case someone does: READ THE BOOK!

You'd have to be pretty dim to buy into the premise that Heston's character......supposedly a scientist.....wouldn't at least suspect that he might be on earth. There was so much evidence to that effect. So the ending is not a surprise at all. You can see it coming hours away. Aside from that, the movie is just very lame. I had a tough time forcing myself to watch it all the way through. Bad acting, bad dialog, bad plot. Nuff said. You're either with me or against me..:-).........p.s.

Schaffner has directed some of the most magnificent looking movies ever (Patton, Papillion, Islands in the Stream, etc) and I was excited to see the Blu-ray treatment given to arguably his most famous film Planet of the Apes. Sadly, this one misses the boat.The colors are faded and not dynamic in the least and, to be honest, it looks less than I would expect from a standard DVD release.To make matters worse, I know there are loads of features and additional Planet of the Apes material out there and this disc has none of it save for some decent commentary from some of the stars.Wait until a better treatment comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CLASSIC!","review":"1968 version of Planet of the Apes, this is the one that started it all. Received the DVD in a prompt manner. Enjoyed watching it again after seeing it for the first time when it came out and I was in high school. Quality of the picture is very good as is the sound. It's the best of the Planet of the Apes movies, though I really enjoyed Rise of the Planet of the Apes which came out recently. Charleton Heston is excellent and, for its time, the special effects are outstanding. If you never saw the movie and want to see it again, this is a very worthwhile buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"FILM IS LOADED WITH SYMBOLISM AND IT ALL WORKS!","review":"Unlike some statement films where the symbolism is boring and actually repulsive in the original POTA it all clicks. This is due to first rate acting by Heston, (especially)Hunter, and others. Also, believable enough storyline aided by genuine outdoor locations. Returning to the symbolism, a little of the communist-scare overtones are now lost to many new viewers with the mostly demise of communism. But the rest of the symbolism is easy enough to still get. A winner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Special Set to Go Ape over","review":"If you're a Planet of the Apes fan, you gotta have this 2-disc 35th Anniversary set in your library; not for the first disc, but the second one.The first disc has what you'd expect: the full-length sci-fi classic itself.But the second disc offers a truly unusual gallery of supporting materials that will certainly enrich and deepen your enjoyment of this cult masterpiece.My favorite Disc-Two materials include the 2-hour \\"behind the scenes\\" documentary hosted by Roddy McDowall; rare footage of dailies and outtakes; and again McDowall's on-set footage.Both thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pioneer for Sci-Fi movies","review":"Planet of the Apes is a pioneer for Sci fi movies because it showed society that they are fun and thought provoking movies. Planet of the Apes set the stage for movies like Star Wars to become as popular as they are in today's society. As for the movie itself, it is wonderful. I love the cynical Charlton Heston. I think Arthur Jacobs intended to show how wrong discrimination is as the Apes discriminate against the humans. This movie has you thinking a lot especially in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO MUCH SELF-PROMOTION","review":"I was greatly turned off by the amount of times the author mentioned the other books she has written.

They were going to break out the cartoony realm of TV, people were going to get older, their lives were going to change, and eventually Andy was going to become a famous cartoonist with his own animated TV series.It would have been great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not sure what to think","review":"As the title says, I'm not sure what to think of this DVD. On the one hand, if you loved the show you'll love this DVD, as you get to relive the episodes and the fun and the character development all over again!On the other hand, if you loved the show, this DVD might make you sad, as you realise that after about 12 hours, it's over. That's it. No more Mission Hill.This was a very well-done series, I loved the use of color and the more mature themes (definitely worked on Adult Swim) that this animation encompasses. I find myself silently thinking BLINGBLONGBLINGBLONG sometimes at work even. However well done the series is, it is also very short-lived. I am not sure if it is worth the nearly $30, since a rabid fan would consume it in 2 days at most.You might be better off looking it up on Netflix than buying it, but ultimately if you support it with your $$, they may be inspired to make more of them.

But I found it quite boring and odd. Not that oddness is bad (I enjoy Pynchon immensely), but this particular kind is. It is frustrating, repetitive, and does not offer much in the way of style and language.

The book makes great claims on the book jacket, eg \\"it is \\"as precise and dazzling as Joyce.\\" Thats ridiculous! This is a quite shallow book for literary wanna bees! It has no depth. Literary allusions are sprinkled through it, but in a quite silly way with no integrity at all with respect to such plot as there is. The author will merely pick up the name of a great writer and make childish jokes: Joyce by comparison is brilliantly literate. Anyone who reads would be horrified by the comparison! The book is silly from beginning to end and hardly even at the level even of a parody. For that reason and a number of other reasons I got more and more annnoyed as I read it.

I had read the reviews & after being unable for a few years to buy it secondhand, I bit the bullet & bought it new. I am now very mad at myself for spending the money. The book was meandering, rambling & jumped all over the place. No chapter breaks, no real paragraphs even. I felt that a 'voice of reason' was needed at the end. Something to tie the book together.

The plot of this novel (or \\"novel\\") is simple: The world is emptied of people and a lady walks around. She looks at pictures and paintings. She thinks about art and her own life. She thinks about speaking and language and its battle with thought (the Wittgenstein connection).There's a beauty to the idea of a world devoid of interaction.

Highly touted, as an experimental, philosophical novel, it is instead a sappy obvious little boring nothing. The idea is this: Kate is a painter; she is the last person on earth, maybe; she is alone in a house on the Long Island beach, typing her trite observations. That's it. If this is a philosophical novel, it is bad news for both the state of philosophy and the art of the novel. Her little apercus are all about observation and remembrance, the real and the false, blah, blah. Nothing that wasn't covered with more wit in your average dorm bull session at any good university in the country.

But persevere! It went from a book I thought I'd never finish to one that I'm certain I will read again and again. Just beautiful, extraordinary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unlike any other","review":"The style of The Waves may be daunting at first, but I urge readers to stick with it and open themselves to the rhythm, the beauty and the many insights the novel has to offer. The characters may be seen as individuals in the various stages of life, but I view them more as an amalgam of humankind, male and female, child and adult. Each one expresses, through private thoughts and reflections, the ebb and flow of life and perception. Woolf's language is as gorgeous and penetrating as ever, reaching the heart and bone of all that conspire to create a human life, a human consciousness. Virtually all of Woolf's works break with tradition, this one perhaps more so than the others, and it is, like the others, a stunning success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Drownng, Waving","review":"My exploration of Virginia Woolf has been a progression from To the Lighthouse to Orlando to The Waves. The Waves is not the best of the three, but does seem to be the pinnacle of Woolf's technique. Like impressionist painters in the same time period, Woolf was trying to see what the limits of her medium were--what could be expressed with the written word that could not be expressed in any other way. Her amazing creativity with metaphor and blurred boundaries of time and mind are in full force here. In addition, the book has a poetic (yes, oceanic) rhythm that is unlike anything else written. Ultimately, it is not an easy read, but is nonetheless an entrancing experiment of literature as dream."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Masterpiece","review":"This was the first novel by V. Woolf that I read over a decade ago and it changed my perception of the novel. I have consumed this authors works ever since. I have a hard time reading the fluff of today because of Woolf. I thank the stars that this woman was born and was able to create all that she did in her short turn on this earth. Nothing, and I mean Nothing compares to the experience of Virginia Woolf.(well Proust does) If you have a hard time thinking as you read a novel just stay away from her novels. One must think and feel to be able to understand Woolf. There is no elementary school writing here like most of todays best seller authors who type out the same crapfeast with each new installment of trilogys. (I love fantasy and genre writing) but there is just something about Virginia that always brings me back, whenever I am blue or maybe in the spring and I want to take a walk around London, I pick up my faithful companion and delve into the bliss that is Woolf."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Waves","review":"A good read if you understand Virginia Woolf writing style. I found it introspective and thought provoking to get into the heads of the characters as Ms Woolf is way ahead of her time for using psychological and personality issues to convy thoughts and ideas of her characters. The book is one of her shortest so it gives the reader the chance to enjoy her style without commiting to a 600+ page book. She is not for everyone, but I am one of her following."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't the edition for your collection","review":"My review applies to the specific hardcover edition and not to the book itself. The Waves is brilliant. It is an essential book for anyone who loves the art of writing, and loves it especially for how it can alter our perspective on life.My reason for the one-star rating is the quality of the publication. This is not the edition that you want in your collection of best-loved books. It is copied, not printed, on poor paperstock, and in a cheap binding.... Basically an ugly edition. It does not come close to doing the book itself justice. And at the price charged, well, it's outrageous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drama-mean","review":"Literary arrogance at its height, this book takes simple concepts and makes them obtuse.

The vents at the top (which are there so you don't suffocate in the snow) can easily be velcroed shut. This, combined with the fly keep out the wind nicely. True, the window in the fly is always open for anyone to look in, but it's pretty small. Don't camp with weirdos!I love the fact that the fly comes all the way to the ground, which is great in the rain, and allows me to keep my gear dry without it being inside the tent. It's easy and quick to put up...a little tough in the wind, but doable. because of it's low profile, shape of the fly, and tie-down anchors, it performs excellently in strong winds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Customer Service","review":"If you ever plan to deal with the customer service, do not buy Marmot Tents.

After 2 months I called them to find out that they received the tent and would replace it. I wasn't happy, since they no longer produced a single person tent for a 6ft tall person, but said OK. 2 months later I called and was told that my tent had mildew and would not be repaired or replaced. They offered me to buy a net tent at a discount. The cheapest I could find would have cost me over a $100. I said NO, I want my old tent back. They said they would ship it. 2 months later - no tent.

Unfortunately Feldman placed the book into a mooshy catagory between the two. If a reader wants an interesting read this is one. If a reader wants to know facts about the Lost Adams Diggings the goal is more likely to be achieved by reading Four Days From Fort Wingate by Richard French.Feldman's shakey premise that the Adams Diggings is where he says (and that it's been found) is based on an even shakier bibliography taken mostly out of Apache Gold and Yaqui Silver by Frank Dobie, then misquoted. The fact that he's presented it somewhat as fact by giving a bibliography distracts somewhat from what would otherwise be a pleasant and interesting read. If you find yourself tempted to believe anything in this book check the footnote references he uses to support his premises and follow them back to the original document text. The Feldman book is historical fiction. Nothing more or less."},{"rating":"2","title":"A supportive and practical book!","review":"The book states that this is a \\"complete and definitive guide to the practice of church leadership\\" and it is.

There are many out there that say they are intended for CD/DVD writing. However, these are the only ones I found that are guaranteed to be solvent free and alcohol free so that they cannot affect the CD surface. The pens have two tips, which is also nice. However, the smaller tip is what I would call \\"medium\\" and the one I use. The larger tip is really too big to write much in the space available. The smaller tip leaves a dark and easy to read message, and you can get several lines of text on the CD surface if you write very carefully. My only complaint is that these pens are pretty pricey for what they do, especially when one factors in the shipping. I could not find them in any of my local stores, so an online order was the only option. I decided to bite the bullet to make sure I don' damage my critical CDs and DVDs. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yep, it draws black lines on CD/DVD discs.","review":"Bought them so as to avoid destroying CDs and DVDs I write on.

I first noticed that the cap on the fine point end did not hold on very well. So I concentrated on putting it on securely each time. When it dried out, I thought that the loose cap had been the problem. So on the next pen, I taped the fine end on with electrician's tape, so it couldn't get loose. I also made sure to press the cap on the larger end, but it soon dried out and I had written on very few CD's compared to how long a sharpie would last.It is not worth the money for how long these pens have lasted. I have never had problems with other pens, although I have read that problems do occur.

I purchased them intending to use them to label DVD's. The points are extremely soft and do not hold their point long enough to label just one DVD.

When I brought it home it sealed 2 bags then stopped working. I called the company and they said to take it back to the store. I assumed it was just an extreme case so I exchanged it for the same product. Within the first year of having it, the wire that seals the bags has burned through it's protective coating. So now whenever I seal a bag it burns a hole in it, which then lets air into the bag, defeating the whole purpose of the machine. I wrote the company and asked if there was something I could do or a part I could buy, I was told that they don't sell that part and that since it had been a year there was nothing they could do.

Within three months this marzipan had taken on a freezer taste, whereas the higher grade marzipan still tastes great even one year later. They were both in the same bag together, so it can only be the ingredients themselves that didn't hold up.This may be fine for gourmands, but a more refined palate is going to recognize the difference right away. I am so glad that I didn't buy the ten pound block like I originally intended.

As far as sound quality goes, they couldn't be too much worse... so if you are buying them to improve on the already weak iPhone headphones, you will definitely be disappointed.The cloth covering for the cord is nice, and the sliding lanyard adjustment is a nice innovation as well. The problem is that unless you are running the cord down the back of your neck and then around front, the microphone that is built into the cord won't be ANYWHERE near your mouth.

They have a design which requires you to wrap the cord around your neck and attach the phones to your ears. I find this difficult to do and not easy to do 'on the go'. It's also difficult to wear these with a backpack / jacket on as your clothing can pull at the cord and the fact that the wires are wrapped around you makes it that much more difficult to straighten out, especially when the phones are tugging at your ears.I am going to order a set of original Apple earphones to replace these.

I didn't want to give up the microphone and the v-moda duo (with mic) are backordered, so I figured if these were originally $30-$40, I'd give them a try. Unfortunately, the sound quality is nowhere near the Apple headset -- it's resonant, kind of like a telephone, there is little bass (and what there is is boomy and... resonant) and there is *no* detail.

I have used Panasonic cordless in prior homes and just love them. The new models have smaller handsets which I like. They have a mute button and speaker phone-perfect for all those conferences call when telecommuting. I highly recommend this product. Amazon had the best price-even with shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Phone","review":"I spent quite a large amount of time researching cordless phones before deciding to purchase this unit. There have been many complaints about Panasonic's slightly older lines of 2.4 and 5.8 GHz phones. However, this phone appears to be of an entirely different desgin as evidenced by the slimmer handset form factor. I have had this phone for a few weeks and have not run into any performance issues.While the phone suffers from a few minor flaws such as having to pay to download ring tones on each handset and having handsets register missed calls when another handset is used to answer the phone, these types of issues are pretty much omnipresent in the current generation of multihandest/expandable handset phone systems.This product is not perfect but seems much more reliable and than many of the other top of the line phone systems out there. I highly reccomend this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"This phone has all the features anyone could possibly need. It's also relatively easy to figure out, since the interace is similar to your average cell phone's menu-style interface. One thing I was surprised by though, is if you pay to download a ringtone, you only get it on ONE of the handsets! You have to pay 3 times to put the same ring tone on all the handsets. I got burned by this, and it's why I'm giving it 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anubis","review":"Totally excellent, has all the bells and whistles I wanted, but maybe that is why the battery life seems a bit short.

The weight is a non issue for me when it is adjusted properly you cannot even feel that it is on not to mention that it keeps you much cooler without the added bulk of the regular PFDs. As a previous reviewer mentioned, the double D-ring set-up does not rely on the integrity of the plastic buckle to work.Also it comes with the manual-only conversion which involves unscrewing the auto inflation cap(which contains the dissolving pill), and screwing the manual only cap(stowed on the right hand side of the PFD.) The only thing that I would add to the design is a lash tab as I like to keep a knife on my PFDs but I just purchased an inexpensive dive knife and attaching it to the lower right hand side on the webbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Product, but expensive for a disposable unit","review":"I purchased two of these, thinking they would be great to just leave on as I motor to a spot and then jump up on the front deck to fish. As advertised they did exactly as I wanted to - however - humidity makes them go off easily and the little green pins always break way to easily as well. At $20 for the rearm kit, it can get expensive. The most disturbing thing is they are disposable. By that I mean if you happen to get a pin hole leak in one, it is now junk, it cannot be repaired and there is no replacement inner section for them. I have had them a couple short years and take really good care of my stuff, seems weird that it just developed a leak this easily.

Rather, it presents a high-level class library that encapsulates it. The class library looked neat, until I tried recompiling it: i got a number of errors under Visual C++ 4.2. When I removed it and reloaded 4.0, and tried then, the library _did_ recompile. Then, I compiled a sample program, and found it GP-faulting! This was code right out of the book, no changes.If this book taught about directx, it would still be useful, even if the code didn't work properly. But it isn't about directx. It's about a class library that sits atop directx, and which is too buggy for use. Very disappointing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent","review":"This is a decent book, but below my expectations. I really like the author's book \\"The Weekend Warrior\\". That probably helped set my expectations high. I liked that the book is broken into sections based on team size (on both sides).

Not only does the code not show up, but all my closed Eclipse projects opened up, and my entire Eclipse 3.2 crashed big time...

I found that most of the topics I was interested in were covered, but there are gaps (e.g. nothing about multi-page views, undo/redo support, form-based editors, or headless applications), and some of the topics aren't covered in much detail (there is a total of 7 pages devoted to testing, good luck figuring out e.g. how to run your tests in a headless build). I also question the choice of a sample application that needs to connect to a server (XMPP) in order to run, but the code printed in the book is concise and well explained.

The way the author deals with the heroine's memory loss and subsequent personality changes is excellent. And what a cute hero! He basically ended up with a completely different wife to the one he married, something which bothers her more than it does him. Since she can't remember so many years of her life (basically their entire marriage) she's ready to leave him, but the way they work on it is very well written.Added to it is a little bit of mystery and suspense regarding the circumstances of her memory loss and the little boy who she befriends and helps.The story did move a little slowly in places and could have done with a bit of tightening in the editing, but on the whole it's a lovely, well written and thought out story dealing with loss, changing relationships and solving a crime.As for the cover! What can I say?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning Morbid Documentary","review":"This film is not for the light hearted. As the old saying goes \\"do not judge a book by it's cover\\" apparently doesn't apply for dvds, or this one at least. The cover (which involes a gun a pacifier and a large amount of blood) sums up the movie pretty well, which is quite disturbing. But somehow it is an intriguing look at something that would probably never cross a regular persons mind of what a sociopath of the highest degree could perform. A cold black and white documentary with subtitles that follows a vicious serial killer who works for fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"an outrage, and a very smart and funny one at that","review":"This is a black comedy that makes just about all the other ones look just a little bit gray. As violent and ugly as it gets, however, it just about justifies itself as a surprisingly deft allegory about the nature of filmmaking-- and certain dark aspects of human nature. I suspect Hitchcock and Bunuel would have been amused, although the commentary it makes about the dark side of what it means to \\"watch\\" really is disturbing. So watch, if you can stomach it.

If you've been drinking with the right people who're onto all of the verite cliches, it's a fun movie. With my crowd, it's a do shots when shots are fired kind of movie. Bonus points for slamming a beer when they murder and then rape the dead, disemboweled body of the suburban housewife.What gets overlooked is that it's a bloodthirsty little piece of satire that's willing to get ugly to make a point about the moral culpability of an audience.Hilarious stuff, but not for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"blach humor at the best...","review":"u liked Blair Withch cause \\"it looked like the real thing\\", well, Man Bites Dogs was years ahead from Blair Witch... 3 filmmakers follow around Remi, a nice guy, with dear parents, kid loving and with a job ..... a hitman by profesion, xpert in it, sharing techinques and moments of joys and desulution in his job... filmed in Black and Whit, with a Gonzo-style we get to love the good Remi cause after all it's only his job..... with great acting and little production but a realistic one these black humor french movie is GREAT"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"tout a tout gangster, mais tout a tout genereux\\"","review":"Funniest movie I've ever seen.

A film crew follows a serial murderer named Benoit as he goes through his daily life. Benoit is not only a killer, he's also a poet, philosopher, and social commentator! The camera crew gets so caught up in Benoit's exploits, that they begin assisting him in murder and body disposal! MBD is one crazy movie! It's also as hilarious as it is repellent. This is the very definition of black comedy. We watch and find ourselves laughing at situations that we know are not funny. Just like the filmmakers, we join Benoit in his spiral downward to his inevitable end. A masterpiece of dark, bleak humour... P.S.- For a good companion film, look for I HATE YOU, or BEHIND THE MASK: THE RISE OF LESLIE VERNON..."},{"rating":"2","title":"BLACK COMEDY AT IT'S BEST","review":"Man Bites Dog is a stunning portrait of a student film crew who document the life of a serial killer. It looks and feels so real. When I show this movie to people I fast forward past the credits and go right to the film. I tell them it's real foriegn documentary and they believe it, for awhile at least. When the comedy starts it's hard to maintain the gag. This movie is seriously funny and the characters are very believable...maybe because half the cast had no idea of what was really going on. The formula of the film clearly developed in the editing room...and now you can see all the pieces of Remy's puzzling masterpiece in the privacy of your on home. BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Dark and Macabre Satire","review":"Man...who knew the French were capable of this? A black & white \\"documentary\\" of a serial killer named Benoit that's an extremely graphic satire of the media and it's effect's on violence(I won't go into the plot description, since plenty of other people have done this so read their reviews if that's what you're looking for). This movie is not for the easily offended or disturbed(That explains a lot of the 1 star reviews) because of it's graphic depictions of murder and rape. But for those who like their comedy dark...this is perfect. A very well done movie, hilarious at times and very disturbing at others. I like how instead of this being just another pointless movie with explicit violence it actually has a meaning behind it, which a lot of movies nowaday's lack.4.5/5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and a comment on TV realism","review":"Man Bites Dog is a film which explores the dark, light and banal aspects of one mans psyche. The film gives you the message that only incidently is he a serial killer. However, by the end of the film we learn that some hobbies, like serial killing, have consequences for the killer and those who surround him that no-one can possibly guess. Shot in what later has become the Dogme convention style this film is all about realism. It's also very funny, in a dark and ironic way. People who are incensed by the extreme violence are missing the point. The very fact that it the killing is not morally judged, and even tacitly colluded with by the documentary crew following the killer around, and not opinionised by anyone else means that you become the impassive judge, it forces you to think about what is really happening. I would reccomend this film to anyone who is not easily shocked and likes films which are unconventional, funny, shocking, and complex."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocking","review":"This movie defines its genre. The literal translation of the film's real name is \\"It Happened in a Neighborhood Near You\\" (C'est Arrive pres de chez vous). It is creepy to watch because it could be true, but just couldn't.

One moment he comes up with brilliant art ideas for skyscrapers and walls, the next he's blowing some guys brains out. And there are accidents. Like some of the film crew dying. Ho ho! That was funny, in a I-hate-myself-for-laughing kind of way.

The story seems to be rather absurd as the audience views Benoit's random acts of violence. However, in between the violence the audience can meet Benoit's parents and friends while listening to his slanted life philosophy. Nonetheless, the main point of the film remains, which is to figure out reasons for the violence. At the end the audience is left with the notion of \\"why\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Kid Yourself...","review":"This film was pretty weak. I realize it is a low budget satire about the film industry and society at large. But this film is far from providing any useful commentary on these far reaching and noble subjects. It was just a poorly made and poorly written series of disjointed scenes. The director was trying to intertwine his social theories into the dialogue. So maybe it was lost in translation. But whatever the case, the film did not live up to its billing. If you want satire, try Kubrick. If you want a low budget blood bath try Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1973). And if you want a bloodbath with social commentary, try American Psycho. The bottom line is there are much better films that cover the same topics and fill the same niche."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glorified Saturday Night Live Sketch","review":"Very disappointed with this film. This film is really nothing more than a glorified Saturday Night Live sketch- you get the joke in the first thirty seconds and the remaining hour and a half is more of the same.

See Natural Born Killers- its much more effective-if this is the subject matter which pricks your interest. I would really give this 2.5 stars but you can't on Amazon, so I rounded down. It's definitely not a three star movie. So there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rabid Movie!","review":"This movie is sick. Really! I am not a prude. But, there are some very distateful scenes that are unnecessary with the sheer objective of making the viewer sick. I'm not sure if the director was under a great delusion the he is so ironic or bold or shocking. But this movie is total trash. I remember walking out of the theatre when I saw it. I suggest you walk out of your home if it is playing on your tv..... and then move to another town, take an hour long shower and burn your clothes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brutal rape does not an art film make","review":"While I appreciated some of the points made in this film, and its harsh criticism of sensationalist 'real TV', I have a major caveat: this film contains THE MOST BRUTAL RAPE SCENE I HAVE EVER SEEN (ONSCREEN) IN MY LIFE. I think that, while obviously it serves to demonstrate the complete immorality and viciousness of the protagonist/murderer, it is also gratuitous and extremely hazardous to the health of anyone who has gone through sexual violence. I wish I could say that it would bother every human being, but men often seem to go untouched by the cruelties inflicted on women. So. Compelling premise, but stomach-turning content that I don't think anyone should have to see without being aware that it's in there. I saw this movie 5 years ago and it still gives me nightmares.

This work is a real treasure and will continue to inspire and challenge generations of readers now and for ones to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Byron: Overrated Romantic","review":"Byron's poems don't seem to seek to make any statements. Unlike his Romantic contemporaries Keats, Coleride, and Wordsworth, (even Shelley, to some extent) Byron puts forth no idealogy as to what poetry should be. Instead, he relies on certain aspects of that Romantic idealogy, such as frequent parallels between the state of man and the state of nature... however, with few excceptions, this fails to create unique insights, comments, or even descriptions in his writings. What results is florid, wordy, rhyming travel writing, often promoting British or macho ideals. This edition receives a low grade because it fails to lead me to any better of an impression of a poet that has obviously been influential and looked on as an esteemed figure for so many years. This book can be read as an interesting historical document, and, perhaps most importantly, as Romantic poetry falls out of favor, Byron's poetry as collected within helps to explain the reason why."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy","review":"These pants are terrible.

Its the series we run to when we wish to escape the flat boring teenie bopper horror we are now faced with like Scream and I know what you did last summer... Well not this time. This new Halloween installment ignores all that has happened past Halloween II but this is not the problem. It has a flat script that is lacking in its ability to scare, thanks to Scream scribe, Kevin Williamson. Hasn't he proven to us enough that he cannot write anything scary? The worst abomination is Chris Durand. This stuntman clearly didnt do his homework, his rendition of Michael Myers is laughable He moves wrong he's much to fast and not at all methodical or creepy.. all in all avoid this entry unless you really enjoy seeing teenie bopper films."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT WAS PRETTY GOOD","review":"STEVE MINER DID PRETTY GOOD WITH THIS MOVIE JUST LIKE HE DID WITH FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 2 AND 3.I KINDA LIKED IT THE WAY IT TOOK PLACE AFTER THE HOSPITAL INCIDENT IN 1978.

First, the bad points. It is just a little too much like \\"Scream\\" and \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\\", which are good movies, but after a while, get old. The only other complaint I have is the running time. It is way too short for my liking. Now, the good aspects of the film. It is great to see Jaime Lee Curtis again! Jodi Lynn O'Keefe's chase scene is great. I also really liked the gate scene (with Michael swinging that big knife through the bars). The acting is good and the actors are well-cast. And, lastly, I'm glad the writers dropped the whole Thorn sub-plot because I really thought it was stupid. (You have to see Halloween 5 & 6 to see what I mean). Anyway, this is a pretty good film. Not, the worst film in the series, best not the best either."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Halloween sequel of them all.","review":"Halloween H20 was the best Halloween sequel of them all. Almost as good as the original film. I found this film interesting because of the message it conveys of facing your fears before you can move on in life. Jaime Lee Curtis was wonderful in her protrayal of Laurie Strode, 20 years after her encounter with her brother Michael in Halloween & Halloween II. You don't have to see Halloween III to XI to enjoy this movie. The film also had some wonderful scene of humor, particulary from LL Cool J. Kevin Williamson did another top job in this gem in the horror genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"watch it or miss out","review":"YOU BETTER WATCH THIS VIDEO OR ELSE YOU'LL MISS OUTBIG TIME BY THE WAY BRIAN ULBIG GOOD REVIEW IF ANY OF YOU LIKED WHAT I WROTE,WHICH WAS'NT MUCH WRITE BACK ANYTIME I'D LOVR TO HEAR FROM YOU ESPECIALLY YOU BRIAN ULBIG SEEYAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste the money!!","review":"This movie was a horrifing 1st he jumped out the window and was still alive then she crashed the alumbance and he was still alive then she finally chopped of his head.

It has no kind of balance on anything, it takes place after the first film....But they mention the fire that happened in the fifth film. Jamie Lee Curtis makes a laughable come back (from what?) with her poor ass performance as Laurie Strode. I hated this movie. The only thing that gave me a jolt was when Jamie finally sees Micheal for the first time since the first film. When they look at each other through the window..Thats powerful stuff right there for ya. But the rest I thought was total camp. The body count was terrible, acting was worse then crap and the writing was close to Spice World material. My God this movie had no substance. Steve Miner should just stick to Comedies cause this movie made me laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"It wasn't bad. But I was bit disapointed.","review":"H20 was not scary (unlike Halloween 4 Now that's a horror movie) The only freaky part was the part in the road side bathroom, when it looked like he saw her in the stall.

A lot of things that happened were so unrelistic! For example, L.L. Cool J.'s character got shot several times, and you are sure he has to be dead, but he returns being minimally hurt.

It could have been made a lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sequel that lives up to the origional","review":"Halloween H20 I thought would no way compare to the origional, but i was wrong, it was almost better.

It was so STUPID!

It ranks with 3(Season of the Witch, a non-Michael Myers sequel in name only) & part 6 as the worst of the Halloween flicks.

The story was pathetic, the climax was anything but climactic, the acting was lackluster, and Michael just wasn't as menacing as he's supposed to be. The only good moment in the film is when Jamie Lee and her mother(PSYCHO) have an amusing verbal exchange in the parking lot...nothing to build a movie around.

After the events of Halloween and Halloween II, Laurie moves to California and changes her name. However, no one can escape Michael ! Who needs AAA, call Michael for directions as he makes the trip from Illinois to Califoria seem like a drive to the mall. This is a very good movie, but as in all of the movies, there are things that could have been better, such as some mention as to what happened to Jamie, or maybe she wasn't really born since this installment ignores parts 4-6, as well as part 3 (which we ALL should ignore). Overall, a great return to the series for Jamie Lee and an enjoyable movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Good movie, horrible ending...\\"","review":"This was an excellent movie, except for the end.

Now a teacher at a college university, Laurie now has a son, Jimmy, who gets into a little mischief while Laurie is getting ... by her counseler boyfriend. Michael is especially creepy in this one, we can see his menacing eyes finally and his killings are a lot more gory, but the body count is even less that in the first Halloween. Sadly, there is no Dr. Loomis here, but the film starts off with him telling the story of Michael in the first movie. LL Cool J is in this one, too, which adds to the enjoyment, and that is because he delivered quite a performance in Deep Blue Sea, why shouldn't he be in Halloween: H20?

Second, the movie didnt focus on 4-6 which got me a little upset it was like he never exsisted since 78-98. Third, I think that it was way to short nothing really happened just when it got good it ended. Fourth, I really dont like how it focused on Laurie more than Michael.

I thought finally, the bluray technology will allow us to see movies the way they were meant to be seen. It's a shame because the picture quality on Halloween H2O is great! The old Dimension dvd has the correct aspect ratio and is loaded with extras this Echo Bridge edition has no extras. Beware of other Echo Bridge bluray titles with incorrect aspect ratios ( \\"Cursed\\", \\"Venom\\"...) I hope Echo Bridge starts making things right!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Halloween H20 made no sense!","review":"Do you remmber the classic Halloween films? Well this movie made no sense to me because after Halloween 2 Michael's skin was burnt to a crisp and in Halloween 4-6 his skin stayed that way.If you have burnt skin can that go away? Another thing that didn't ake any sense was did laurie ever menchion that she had a daughter that was killed by Michael?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was just like the first one","review":"This has to be one of the worst Halloween sequels I have ever seen. Why would they have Michael Myers wait 20 years? I mean I think that's a stupid idea (no offense). This movie wasn't that scary, there is only like about two scenes that are scary but the rest of the movie sucks and it's so dumb. I also can't beleive that they are busy making another one and I hope that's the last Halloween movie. But if it is the last Halloween movie please don't make anymore it's getting kind of annoying by the way they are making so many sequels that don't turn out to be good. So if I were you I would stick with the first one don't even bother of renting this movie you'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT IMPROVEMENT OVER THE 2ND-6TH","review":"THIS ONE WAS BETTER THAN THE REST BECAUSE IT HAD JAMIE LEE CURTIS AND IT DIDNT HAVE THAT ANNOYING DONALD PLEASANCE.HE WAS AN OLD MAN.AND HE MADE SOME OF THE MOVIES KINDA CHEESY.SEE THIS MOVIE.IT'S PRETTY SCARY"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I had a movie pass.

I really thought that Miner was on to something during the first half. There were some scary scenes and I enjoyed the classic slashing Michael uses to pick the kids but as soon as Jamie discovers that he's after her, the movie just loses it. Everything becomes predictable, dumb, fake and not scary whatsoever. I did like Janet Leigh's cameo appearance though. I can almost compare Curtis to Linda Hamilton in Terminator...in the original, she was shy and innocent, then later she appears as tough and fearless...it least it worked in T2. I particularly found it dumb when she was calling Michael's name looking for him...come on! He ain't stalking her, she's stalking him! All said, this COULD have been done better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok movie sequel but rather poor DVD","review":"I'm a fan of Jamie Lee Curtis and so I bought this and while the movie was ok for being what it was, a tribute sequel to a successful long-running horror series as well as a tribute to the horror thriller genre (the scene between Jamie and her mother, famous for Pyscho was excellent!)For the cost of the DVD and what it represents, I expected MUCH more in the way of extras.

As I have seen all of the Halloween movies...I feel that I have a pretty good idea of what this sequel had to compete with. My personal favorites are, I think what everyone elses are, Halloween I backed up by Halloween II.....as it is great how one movie leads directly into the next. Most of the other Halloween movies lacked the plot that I think most Halloween fans were looking for...the Laurie Strode story. This was by far the BEST plot in all of the Halloween series, and I think H20 did a fantastic job in adding to the scary Laurie Strode plot. The only things that I would slightly criticize are how the movie is a bit short, and how LL Cool J is in it! I hate that guy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Halloween H2O Twenty Years Later","review":"WHAT A RIPOFF!!!!!!!!!

I think Steve Miner could have used more gore (i.e. F-13 2 & 3) and maybe they should have changed the plot to have Myers on his old stomping grounds. Anyway, it was pretty cool, LL Cool J as fun laughing at, but why didn't Michael choke his annoying a@@ like he did to the guy in Part I? Maybe then I would give this five stars. H20 just makes the original look even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all wet","review":"Michael Myers is back once again without an explaination (only signature of DIMENSION) and after 20 years of searching, he's found his sister.

Starts off lame with Curtis dropping a bomb on the project and doesn't get good until the near end, where Curtis begins to improve. Pretty much just another teeny bopper film of the late '90's that wins over part 6 but not by a noticable lot.

This Halloween is really for the people who don't watch the other Halloween's.If your a true Halloween fan, skip H20, if your a person who didn't watch the other moviesand gets scaried easily, go on ahead and this weak Halloween movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet Another Halloween Movie","review":"Well, when I first saw this movie, I was assuming it was picking up where the sixth one left off. That made little sense to me. Why would Laurie Strode fake her death and leave behind her little daughter as prey for her crazy brother? Kinda selfish, to say the least. Then I understood what \\"20 years later\\" implied. When watching this movie, you have to pretend that everything after the sequel doesn't exist.Laurie Strode is living somewhere else now with her teen son. She assumes that her dear brother Michael has no idea where she is. Fool! Michael knows everything.Lots of blood and carnage follow.This movie is OK as a horror genre flick. I liked it better than the sixth one."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Jamie Lee isn't afraid of Michael, Why should the audience be?","review":"The last 20 minutes of this movie are of Jamie Lee Curtis stalking Michael Meyers and not the other way around.If that seems like a scary premise to you then you don't ask for much.This deflates the threat of the masked killer and leaves you with nothing but Jamie Lee doing an action hero impression.\\"Scary\\",yes,but not in the way I want a Halloween movie to be.Stick with the first two movies.Halloween 4 was ok too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Final installment of the trilogy!","review":"Forget Halloween 4-6.

Films three through six wander all over the place and are completely gratuitous in terms of violence, gore and illogic. Number eight should never have been made, undoing all that H2O accomplished, much as 'Alien III' so severely undermined James Cameron's 'Aliens.'I, II and H2O. Stop right there.

There is not only a dreary, but an eerie feeling throughout, as the lyrics echo fears and paranoia as well as the self-doubt mentioned earlier.

It was all the more powerful because of that, although it is quite devastating in the first place. Personally, I think everyone should see this film, as it portrays the difficulties (personally, I believe, impossibilities) of fighting a \\"war on terror.\\" An Italian/French/Algerian co-production, it portrays both sides of the French and Algerian conflict humanly and as even-handedly as possible. It shows the horrors and honors that both the French and the freedom fighters commit. It contains images that will never leave me - in particular the end sequence (which I won't spoil by detailing here).

Ever listend to Mozart's \\"The Abduction from the Serail\\"?Did the algerians want to be independent of france? Yes, some clearly liked to. Problem is: As these nasty men and women didn't find enough support in the beginning, they began to slit the throats of some fellow algerians to make the others fall in line (freedom fighters, ay?).So You may take this film as a typical, one sided sixties version of the events.

We were not expected to read every chapter, but once I started, I couldn't dream of skipping anything. Don Quixote, Book 1, tells the story of a man more optimistic and idealistic than any other in literature. He sets out as a \\"righter of wrongs and injustices\\" and doesn't let anything stand in his way. Book one is also incredibly funny in many parts, both physically and intellectually. Book 2, although a somewhat difficult read and much less humorous, is by far the better work of art. At first, I was apalled at the ending of the book, but I now feel that Cervantes was justified in his ending because he wanted us to mourn the absence of chivalry and hope in our world. I cannot express how much perspective this book will add to your life. Tip: If you are reading Don Quixote in English, I reccommend the Putnam translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Impossible Dream","review":"Anyone who's put his heart into a large, failed project, has to identify with the Knight of the Rueful Countenance and his faithful Squire. The combination of great wisdom and intelligence in most things but complete blindness when it comes to the great Quest, is common to many modern visionaries too -- not just Don Quixote. And the faithful, hardworking squire who follows him and supports him -- and tries to ignore the evidence that the great dream is really madness -- still works for the Don in countless enterprises across the world.So even across four centuries, this book still speaks to us, and far from being a difficult read, it rolls right along -- sometimes funny, sometimes sad, and sometimes very painful, but seldom dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Font Makes This Edition Unreadable","review":"Great book, great publisher (my favorite for quality and hand-holdability), but the font heremakes it nearly unreadable.

Seek adventure and the slain giant shall be your reward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don Quixote","review":"This is one of the greatest novels of all time, but parts of it are dated.

You might also want to read Testaments Betrayed and/or The Art of the Novel by Milan Kundera. He seems to really get Don Quixote as well as the novel in general.As far as this story being inspirational, I just don't see it. It's an amazing, funny story.

It will take you in from the first chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motteux gets the 1 , not Cervantes.","review":"This guy Motteux should be forgotten.

And I have to admit that, yes, Cervantes does drag on a bit. But critics of the novel's length are doing the work a misservice. We must remember that this book was written well over four centuries ago, when the very concept of a linked narrative must have been more than enough to hold the reader's interest. Cervantes's energy sizzles off the page at times, and you can tell he's really having fun with the work. I loved almost everything about this book, and while I might have liked to see it trimmed a bit, I still think Cervantes did a bang up job. Oh. One more thing. I lot of people seem to like Sancho more than Quixote. I'm totally the opposite. Quixote is the dreamer, the one who dares to look at things that never were and say \\" They might be giants \\".

We had the basic cheapie model Dewalt at first and that thing was a good saw, worked well for over a year and a half before it finally burnt up, so we upgraded to the 12 amp HD model, this saw was a beast, cut through the cables like a hot knife through butter but unfortunately only lasted about 4 days before it was inoperable. Dewalt makes some really good tools and they also put out a lot of junk, seems there quality control isn't what it should be. If you're in the market for a recip saw I would highly recommend another brand, my personal saw is a Makita that I've had for around 10 yrs and still works just as well as the day I bought it, if I had to buy another it would definitely be a Makita, Bosch or the original Milwaukee Sawzall."},{"rating":"1","title":"The control switch IS NOT included","review":"The picture for this item is incorrect.

This book opened my eyes to the true inherent flaws of capitalism, and prevented a constructive alternative system. The one earlier reviewer obviously did not read this book, which is very critical of the command-form Soviet Union.One must realize that capitalism does have flaws, and Against Capitalism presents an excellent alternative.

Returning to England following their escapades in North America, Aubrey and Maturin try to settle into life at home -- Jack with his family and Stephen with his scientific pursuits -- but their pasts catch up with them, compelling them to join forces for a spur-of-the-moment mission to the Baltic.

In short, these books are fine literature and \\"The Surgeon's Mate\\" is arguably one of the three best out of the entire series of eighteen written so far. O'Brian's recreation of the cornucopia of humanity in the Napoleonic era is most impressive; but O'Brian's greatest talent, among a myriad of great talents, is to bring a subtle, ironic humor to the Yin/Yang relationship of the two heroes - inducing laughter out of tragedy, and sadness out of triumph.

The requisite amount of magnesium typically is 500 mg to 600 mg daily -- preferably as chelated magnesium or magnesium citrate.As noted above, The Magnesium Miracle by Dr. Carolyn Dean discusses the role of magnesium in the prevention and treatment of diabetes as does the book The Magnesium Factor by Dr. Mildred Seelig.

They both hate eachother but since the two are handcuffed together, they must put their differences aside to survive. Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis are great in this film. Since most of the movie takes place outdoors, the two are always dirty and in grueling pain. Although some of the supporting characters are not as talented (often humorous due to their lack of acting skills), the film is well rounded and well told. The two learn to respect eachother and work ogether where they form a inevetable friendship. I found myself really rooting for the charters in the climax and up to it.

I have never seen an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie that I didn't liked so I decided to watch this one having high hopes that it would be an action packed movie with a great plot. Has Arnold ever settled for less? Well, apparently after doing Conan he decided that he needed better roles. Conan the Barbarian seemed a bit drawn out half way through and I was really hoping for a good fight scene between Conan and Thulsa Doom.

The added scenes feel 'forced' into the movie. The film WAS perfect. I can't watch the Collector's Edition without feeling disappointed. If you can get a copy of the 1998 DVD release, go for it. The picture is not as nicely finished as the Collector's Edition, but you really don't notice any flaws as you watch the movie.

I know it was in stereo at the big screen, so mr DVD producer (and LD and VHS) why not now?

I'm not going to explain what the story is, I'm going to tell you what the dvd version is like. First of all, if you own an old copy on vhs, you will think you are watching a new movie. This is the best you are going to see this movie. The music also comes through much clearer, which is good because i always thought this was a great part of the movie.The outtakes are nothing special. most of them have no sound and don't do anything for the movie. The making of conan is pretty good, but it is also something you will probably only watch one time. The commentary is really funny though. you will be cracking up at Arnold most of the time.The bottom line is that there just aren't movies like this anymore. they don't even come close. this is the best fantasy movie of all time.

However, the extra footage is garbage and costs this version 1 star.The additional dialog between Conan and Subotai is weak, disrupts the flow of the leadup to the last battle and features Gerry Lopez sounding far more Pro Surfer than Mongolian, dude.

The picture was grainy and had a pulsing in the background. You'd think they would've done a digital transfer, but no. The soundtrack was in mono! Give me a break! Couldn't they have at least remastered it to a 2.0 soundtrack if not 5.1? And yes it can be done, because the original Terminator was in mono, but was remastered to Dolby Digital 5.1. I really wish the same care would've been taken with Conan the Barbarian."},{"rating":"1","title":"zero for sound","review":"the color and picture quality were very good and true to the theatre however the sound seems to have been left on the remake floor. if a 1955 movie ie: Brigadoon can be remade into 5.1, universal pictures doesn't seem interested in producing an 1982 movie in 5.1 which would have givin this movie 5 stars, and been worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"WARNING: This version has a new ending.

WHO DOES THAT? I don't think I can name one other DVD that has sound in \\"mono\\". Even the cheapest and lowest of low movies are usually at least in Dolby Stereo.I have seen some older films with better sound, I have seen second rate \\"B\\" movies with better sound, and yet somehow... some genius decided to put this in \\"Mono\\"?Heck... \\"Caveman\\" with Ringo Starr is even in 5.1 yet they are only going to provide Conan in mono?It is a shame that such a great movie is treated with such disregard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite the theatrical version","review":"The reviews for the various Conan the Barbarian discs are mixed together here. Specifically, I am reviewing \\"Conan the Barbarian [Blu-ray] (1982)\\", with product details ASIN: B00509KXYO, Release Date: August 2, 2011, Run Time: 129 minutes.I'm assuming here that my old VHS tape was the 'theatrical' version, but I never saw it in theater. I later bought the collectors edition, but some of the changes always bothered me.The 2011 Blu-ray disc isn't quite the theatrical version. It does remove the so called \\"Moby Dick\\" scene of the collector's edition, which I always thought of as disrupting the build up to the battle of the mounds, with sketchy acting and a conversation that seems out of place.The level of the music vs. the background noises seemed different from the collectors edition in places, and I thought generally better where I noticed it. It includes the extended ending with the princess. I prefer the shorter ending, but I can live with that. 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best for First!","review":"Of all the movies I could have picked - this was my first DVD purchase. I am a huge fan of Arnold's and this is a classic! You won't be disappointed - romance, action & a plot ... it's all there but mainly it's Arnold!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Conan the Barbarian","review":"This is a very interesting movie I enjoyed watching it with my grandson and with my daughter I will share it with my family"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crush your enemies!","review":"See them driven before you and to hear the lamentation of their women! This is good. -one more word needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A glorious tale of epic adventure and terse realism.","review":"This is the epic tale of Robert E. Howard's Conan character brought to life. Sure it doesn't follow Howard's original story line, but what has been done with it is fantastic in its scope. The topography of Sicily mixes beatifully with Basil Poledouris' score. John Milius outdoes himself. The casting is unbelievable. From Arnold to James Earl Jones. From Mako to Max Von Sydow. Bodybuilding fans will also be surprised with a cameo by BB great Franco Columbu."},{"rating":"2","title":"true to the image in the comic books","review":"this is simply a kick a$$ movie. The fact that there is very little dialogue doesn't matter. Arnold can really swing the sword!! This is one of the best action movies that I have ever seen. James Earl Jones was the perfect villian. It's amazing how good a movie with blood, guts, swords, and horses can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Greatest Movies of All Time","review":"For its genre, Conan the Barbarian is the greatest movie of all time. Dialogue is sparse, but when used it is filled with meaning and thought. More dialogue would ruin the movie. The score of this film is perfect. It carries the emotion and energy of Conan. Poledouris creates a score which has yet to be paralleled in the movie industry. James Earl Jones is the perfect villian, powerful, intelligent, and seductive. Not a better cast could have been selected for this film. People who watch this movie and only critic its special effects, are misunderstanding and missing the whole point of the movie. The themes and motifs present through out the film prove it to be one of the greatest movies,if not the greatest movie of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a GREAT movie!!! PERIOD!","review":"If you are looking for a romance movie or a Broadway extravaganza...GO ELSE WHERE! This movie was GREAT for what it was meant to be! The story of Conan! A story of vengeance! An action-adventure movie straight out of Dungeons and Dragons! The movie score is an absolute masterpiece by Basil P. and the movie flows quickly and doesn't lag behind. Though the characters do not talk much, the music pretty much does the talking for them in the earlier parts of the movie. Arnold Schwarzenegger was an excellent choice for Conan as was James Earl Jones as the Evil Snake Demigod of SET. The supporting cast of Characters could have used a little more \\"oomph\\" but they were pretty good over all as well. All in all this was a tale of action-adventure and most of all vengeance. One of the few medieval type of movies that are definitely worth it! Don't hesitate! Here is your chance to own one of Arnold's first and BEST movies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of it's genre","review":"This movie is the best of it's genre not only because it spawned countless rip-offs but because it had originality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot opt out of deleted scenes","review":"This movie is one of my favorite movies of all time... but this edition is awful. It adds deleted scenes into the movie proper, and you can't opt out of that 'feature'. It completely ruins the movie for me, and makes this DVD a complete waste of money as well. I would have liked to have gone through the deleted scenes as you do with any other movie; afterwords as a lark. There is a -reason- these scenes were deleted.. I wish they'd kept it that way, or made this a two disk set: one with the scenes in, one with them out, the way they did Legend."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the genre","review":"Perhaps the greatest work of both Schwartzenegger and Milius, \\"Conan\\" brings the pulp classic to life in a way that goes well beyond its pulp origins.This film is full of wonderful characters and memorable dialog- the great James Earle Jones as the marvelously evil leader of the snake cult, Mako as the wizard, and of course Arnold himself, before he became the comic-book persona in a long line of forgettable trash.Who can forget that first scene when Conan speaks? We've seen Conan grow from a child to a young man, and after nearly twenty minutes he has yet to speak a single word. \\"Conan!\\" cries the interogater. \\"What is best in life?\\" He stirs slowly. Then the deep voice intones: \\"To crush your enemy! To see him fleeing before you! And to hear the lamentations of his women!\\"Now that's film. ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Arnie classic with great action","review":"Although I kind of like the less darker sequel more this is still a good movie. After viewing it again I enjoyed it more than the last times I've seen it. I always liked it but before now I just found the comfrontation befween Arnold and James Earl Jones at the end to be disapointing.(...) I know I'm sadistic lol. Anyway would've been bettter if they had this big sword fight instead.The movie is a lot better made than the sequel which had some bad effects but I think it trys too hard to be a big epic, it drags on too long. It is silly that James Earl Jones leads a clan of people who just wanna turn into snakes. Connan's mean for denying them that lol. For the best adventure fantasy of the \\"80's\\" I'd still have to go with the under-rated Willow though."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want the orignal ending","review":"I love this movie, but I give this release one star because it does not allow me to watch the movie as I originally saw it in the movie theater. I have no problem with a director's cut, but it was not made clear on the item when I purchased it (there weren't all these reviews at the time) that you could only see the ending the way it was originally planned. Most times, you have a choice between watching it in the original theatrical release, or the alternate way. \\"Collector's Edition\\" with \\"Extra Scenes\\" does not usually mean without the original ones.Rent this one first. If you like the alternate ending, get it. If you liked the original ending, you may not want to bother. I wish I hadn't.I kick myself for not watching the \\"Collector's Edition\\" before getting rid of my 1998 version. That was stupidity to the extreme on my part."},{"rating":"2","title":"The commentary is worth it alone","review":"I've been a Conan fan for most of my life, and I was quite excited to get my hands on the \\"collectors edition\\". The video quality, as one might expect of a collector's edition, is excellent. The 2-channel stereo sound is a bit of a let down, considering the amount of work that went into cleaning up the video, but the quality of sound is the best I've heard in any of Conan's previous formats. The \\"extras\\" on this DVD are a little bit of a let down too, with the exception of the commentary version of the movie, which is, for lack of better words, FREAKING HILARIOUS! Just as Milius begins to talk about some of the deeper aspects of the movie, Arnie butts in and says something absolutely retarded (\\"YAAAAH, I Remembah thees part now\\" or \\"Exaaactly\\" or \\"Look at the sawwword\\"). It's seriously funny, and worth watching. It's almost like MST3K, but much more impromptu (and unintentionally funny). I highly recommend this DVD to any Barbarian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who the Hell is Luis Barboo?","review":"OK, was the Amazon server hacked or what? Starring Luis Barboo?

The sound track is amazing. The fight coreogrophy is great. Arnold's acting is...pretty good for Arnold. As with most of the films from the 1980's, there are plenty of racy lovemaking scenes. Not for anyone under sixteen or so. The giant snake is cool too :) This is a classic film that will never go out of style."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Boston to Patagonia by Train","review":"Note: I made some immature Mormon angry because of my negative reviews of books that attempted to prove the Book of Mormon, and that person has been slamming my reviews almost as fast as they are posted.So, your \\"helpful\\" votes are appreciated.

He goes on to imply that his book won't be like that. He also says he intended the book to teach us and illustrate to us the countries he visited. Well, he failed on both counts.It's full of condescension, self-absorption, and odd, racism-tinged comments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can we have an explorer's perspective please.","review":"Paul's books provide a very detailed travel account. But, it appears to be a reporter's view. His writings lack the passion of an explorer. Travelling to distant places is essentially a journey within. Great travelers wouldn't ridicule the places they visit or the people they meet. In this book he seems describing the slums and the poverty of Mexico and other countries. Trust me, not many people want to be poor by choice.Traveling is a sublime, spiritual & learning experience. It is an opportunity to look beyond our perceptions & bias. His writings are just an account of what he saw, they lack the light of a traveler..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the book that got me hooked on travelling","review":"First book I read by Paul Theroux and was blown away by his refusal to play the all-too-easily-pleased and polite traveller/tourist. Theroux is a thinking traveller not afraid to mix it up with the locals or allow people to make fools of themselves.

I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cute first book for children","review":"This is a nice little book for young crystal enthusiasts. It introduces several members of the quartz family, as well as concepts such as cleansing, programming, chakra balancing, and is full of ideas for meditation and crystal healing.Some of the terminology is a bit above many beginning levels, which makes this book great for reading as a family, and it is likely to improve children's vocabularies."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best nfg album yet","review":"i got this cd the day it came into the stores and let me say it was worth every penny...the songs on this cd are just amazing and show the growth that nfg has had since sticks and stones...another masterpiece of the nfg collection.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worn Out","review":"I listen to this CD and it reminds me of several other CDs. Actually it reminds me of EVERY other pop/punk CD or whatever genre this has been branded, made in the past 5 years. Sure, there are other subtle differences but the formula remains the same...whine about your ex-girlfriend, whine about your parents, whine about anything else that they think fourteen year old kids can relate to. This Good Charlotte, NFG, and Mest type of music is really getting old because it never changes. The name NFG is alot better than New Found Glory (...). Don't buy this album you are better off giving your money to a hobo to support his cocaine addiction because at least he'll stop whining when you give him money...these guys will just whine more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Much New Found Glory","review":"I've been a fan for a long time and this and their last albums are really awesome.

This is one of the best CD's of all time. Every song is literly unbelivable. I couldn't even pick the best songs because I would have to pick every song. Trust me if you buy this Cd you won't regret it.

However, I was a little dissapointed with it. The music is the same style, but they have alot more slower songs. If you know New Found Glory, they don't do slow songs that well. They're my favorite band, but the slow songs arent good. They do fast songs, and do them well. The first single off the cd (all downhill from here) is great. Most of the songs on the cd are, but there is a few that arent. I would recomend buying the self titled one or sticks and stones instead. But the cd still is really good, so i'd recomend buying it when its on sale. To me its not worth 13.99, but if you see it for anything less then that, it is well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most awesome album by far!!!!","review":"Catalyst by New found Glory (found at www.newfoundglory.com ) is possibly their best album yet to date! Released 5/18/2004 it is chaulk full of great songs such as All Downhill from Here and This Disaster. Catalyst will likely blow ahead of the sales of their last recorded album, Sticks and Stones, released 6/11/2002.

MAYBE IN HELL!","review":"This band is one of those sissy poser bands like Green Day, Good Charlotte, SUM 41, NOFX(no effects, but they still sound like posers), anything the Offspring has done since Americana(the first 4 CDs are good), or Blink 182. Poser bands have corrupted what people think punk is(especialy Green Day, they and their \\"punk\\" friends started it), and it sickens me. I'm just glad there are some real punk bands like the Casualties still left. When i was young i used to like poser bands, but that is all i was ever exposed to, and now i hate that wussy s***."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have a cold, you should ask for a tissue!","review":"I could just leave the title as the entire review, but I feel as if I need to repeat it many times to get it through these little 13 year old girl's heads. The guy needs to stop singing out of his nose. The entire band needs to take a step back and slow it down a lot. They also need to use more than 3 chords. They need to write lyrics that actually rymes and makes sense. They need to write music that doesn't remind me of 99% of all \\"punk\\" bands out there. I have to say that I am not a fan of punk, a lot of the time I would rather die than listen to it. These guys seriously cross the line. The singing through the nose has consistently gotten worse over the few years they've been around. Bottom line is, these guys suck terribly. So ATTENTION 13 YEAR OLD GIRLS: Listen to anything that doesn't sound like these guys. Might I suggest Oasis, Radiohead, hell even listen to rap. I don't care as long as it isn't this kind of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jeez, when will it end!?!!?!?!?","review":"o jeez, i thought that all this pop-punk crap died out years ago when metal came back into the scene.

Listen to real music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointment","review":"this cd was one of the worst ones i regret buying.it sounds like one song the entire album, the lyrics are similar, the guitar riffs are teh same in every song.the old school NFG had difference, this was just dreadful.i reccoment Sticks and Stones and thier self titled New Found Glory instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"they play punk rock, but they still are pop....","review":"new found glory is another pisspoor \\"punk\\" band that really is pop. they said the video for all down hill from here was going to be a new original video. i can name 4 other music videos made the same way. the only actual punk song is no news is good news (also on Rock Against Bush Vol. 1) punk is a musical freedom. writing, saying, and doing what you want. they made this record for fans. and it makes me sick that a band this stupid is so popular."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"I listened to this on MTV.com's \\"The Leak,\\" I admit im not a big pop punk fan but I can still judge, for example the new Blink CD is pretty good.This CD on the other hand, is repative and very mediocre, not BAD tho, any fan will probably like it but new fans stay away, All Down Hill From Here is one of the better songsAnd what happened to Jordans voice? it was never great but the producer made it really annoying. The best song is probably No News is Good News, but yeah very mediocre CD, its different than the other tho, each songs starts out \\"harder\\" but then goes into the same pop-punk formula as the other CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A LOT better than the last effort","review":"I love NFG. In fact, I still go round calling them A New Found Glory much to the annoyance of newer fans. I have to admit, I was sorely disappointed with Sticks and stones and contemplated buying this album. But I'm glad I did. Pop/Punk like this doesn't claim to attempt to compare to bands like bad religion etc and comparisons like that shouldn't be made. This is a more mature NFG sound, and a welcome one. Jordan's voice has matured and even my sister who claims Jordan's is the most annoying voice ever gave the album a thumbs up.Don't buy this expecting it to be punk. It's not and it doesn't claim to be. But if you're a NFG fan or a pop/punk fan, buy it, as you'll be pleasantly surprised"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Self Respect","review":"All i have to say is NFG is a moneyhungry band that ruined punk rock.

Yeah right!","review":"From all the stupid romors I've heard, New Found Glory was an awesome punk rock band. I decided to test my luck and by this CD.Okay, for anyone who things this is punk, you are sadly mistaken. Just listening to the vocals, I could tell this is pop.The only slightly decent song on this whole album is \\"All Down Hill From Here\\". And ever in that song, the chorus is the only good part. Every other song on this album isn't worth listening to.If you want some good punk rock, buy Bad Religion or Dropkick Murphys, but whatever you do, do NOT buy this CD! If you are a fun-loving pop fan, get this album and be overjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Found GARBAGE! No style and substance!","review":"'Dime a dozen' bands like 'New Found Boring' are an embarrassment to real punk music. This whiney, geared for 12 year olds, overly-commercial 3 chord nonsense is a true testament to how the youth of today has massively lowered their standards in their choices of music! The 'dumbing down of America' continues unabated not only in politics and education, but in their pathetic choices of rock and pop music. For real punk substance and talent, go listen to your parent's Clash, Ramones, Sex Pistols, P.I.L., Dead Kennedys, Gang Of Four, and Stranglers albums, as a start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catalyst - Still Good Stuff from NFG","review":"Although at first I thought this cd was not as good as their previous two, the more I listen to it I love it.

The best songs are \\"I Don't Wanna Know\\" which is a light pop ballad, and \\"Your Biggest Mistake\\" which is a pop-punk song with a touch of 90's post-grunge and a short but sweet guitar solo. Cyrus has improved SO MUCH, he's seriously almost as good as Travis from Blink. Go buy this. NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For eveyone who thinks they know what \\"real music\\" is...","review":"This CD is great.

I can play their game, what about bands like Crass, Aus Rotton, The Virus...\\"OH CRAP, who are they?\\" These kids don't know the last thing about \\"real punk\\", they just want to ramble off a few \\"punk\\" bands that everyone already knows about, and are about as popular as NFG...so screw them, pick up this CD.Also check out some \\"real\\" music, *wink*.

I've seen some of the comments here, and \\"more mature lyrics\\" don't necessarily make for a better CD. This dissapoints because this album holds absolutley zero emotional energy. I've listened through about 3 times now, and not a single song has caught my ear. This is New Found Glory, its supposed to be pop music? And whats with all the lousy metal riffs? The only thing that saves this CD from one star are the few decent \\"slow\\" songs. Maybe the problem is that the band lacks direction as its tried to move away from the cookie cutter mold of pop punk music all about girls. I think you're crazy if you think this is better than any of their previous releases. I'll stick with the emo genius of \\"Nothing Gold Can Stay\\" and the pop brilliance of \\"New Found Glory\\" thank you very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its 'ite","review":"The cd is alright. The first two songs on the album are definitely the only highlight and from there it just goes \\"downhill.\\" The voice of the lead singer is definitely getting old and annoying and it seems that they have somewhat stepped out of the punk genre and gotten a little heavier.

In a magazine review, they said that Catalyst was their 4th cd when it is actually their 5th cd. There are a lot of good songs on Catalyst, but my two favorite are Truth of My Youth and I Don't Wanna Know. This albumn is the most mature albulmn that they have ever done and it shows in their songs. Even though they have many albums, this proves to be one of their best ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not what it could have been","review":"This is a very good album, but to me it doesn't even come close to their other albums. Nothing Gold Can Stay was an awesome album as was their theme song cover album. The selftitled New Found Glory CD was the best they have ever done, every song was amazing, and Sticks and Stones was also an excellent album on which every song was good. I'm not saying that Catalyst is a bad album, but its not what I expected from NFG. Some songs are slow, and I think their acoustic song should have been left off the album. I like the fact that their guitars have gotten heavier and have more of a rock feel to them. Overall the album is good and for all you fans who think that NFG is just another pop-punk band like Simple Plan you are wrong. How many bands were there like NFG in from 1997-2002? Not many. Catalyst is a good album, but if you are expecting an album like the selftitled or Sticks and Stones, beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"my nfg review","review":"this cd is GREAT! all the songs rock, and you're left wanting more. defintely a smart choice to purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!","review":"I'll admite I usually think these reviews are just annoying usually, but I hafta say this is probably the best CD I have ever owned in my life! I;m into all types of rock and punk and I'm pretty picky, but I must say there is not one song on this Album that is not AMAZING!!! If you are only buying one CD, I would make it this one!! There are upbeat songs for when you just need to let loose, and sadder ones for when you need to wallow in your miseries! I never really knew much about New Found Glory, but after buying this CD, I'm completley obsessed! Buy it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NFG's on Fire!","review":"I dont know where to start. I've been a loyal fan of New Found Glory since Sticks and Stones came out and I've got to say...they dont disappoint. Of course, they have matured which is always not only a good sign but a good thing. The guitar riffs and drums are awesome! I bought the CD the day it came out and I've probably already listened to it at least twenty times straight through. It's an awesome album and if you like NFG or just want something catchy and meaningful to listen to, this is the CD for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different is OK","review":"I hear alot of people say that this different from the \\"old\\" New Found Glory, and maybe it is, but that's what makes this CD really good. They matured and it shows. The songs are not darker, but more meaning full. The majority of the songs also seem to be not all about the girls. The best song on Catalyst is \\"This Disaster\\". There are also alot of different twists on this album. On the song \\" I Don't Wanna Know\\" there are strings, and a choir on \\"Doubt Full\\". I recommend this CD to anyone who loves NFG or to anyone who wants to hear somthing different. Don't expect it to sound like anything else they've done, just expect a album that rocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whats Wrong With His Voice?","review":"I liked the guitar parts the bass parts the drum parts but then i heard the vocals. the leader singer is anoying and whiny and it sounds like he is singing through his nose.

If New Found Glory kicked the lead singer out and got one that dosent sing through his nose they would be a OK band. But that dosent seem like that will happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"by far one of their best","review":"I've been listening to NFG pretty much ever since their first CD.

This was one of my favorite gospel albums and I was excited when I found out it was available on CD. However, I was horrified when I received the CD. First of all, the artwork replication is very blurred. The CD itself sounds HORRIBLE! It sounds as if it was mastered from a cassette tape on someone's computer. I am very disappointed in the quality of this CD. If this is the same quality that Light Records gives on all of their CD releases, then shame on them. Hopefully, in the future, this album will be remastered properly and given the reissue that it deserves. For these reasons only, I am forced to give this release only one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Lonely Planet book ever","review":"I am normally a big fan of Lonely Planet, but this book is the ultimate in political correctness. It is a mouthpiece for the government (which would be fine if it also gave alternative points of view.) It's full of American bashing and yet does not point out the problems the Europeans/Canadians are now creating for the island in terms of prostitution and worshipping material goods.The book is focused more on Tourists rather than independent travel...great if you want to know about swimming pools and colour TV's in Hotels. Yet, it provides virtually nothing with regard to casa particulars (staying with Cuban families for cheap) and paladares (eating in Cuban homes). Both of which can save travellers lots of money and give them the experience of talking to real Cubans first hand. The book emphasises eating and staying in places in which the Cuban government can charge monopoly prices.I found the Cuba Handbook to be much more comprehensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a very useful book.","review":"I found this book to be very useful on my trip to cuba.

Unfortunately, it's expressed throughout the book, especially in the historical overview, which is incredibly biased.For a much more objective treatment, I recommend Christopher Baker's Cuba Handbook (Moon Travel).

The sloppy logic often leads one to understand certain concepts in a wrong way. The book does have lots of long-winded mathematical derivations, but they don't really add to the reader's physical insight. (eg. in chapter 11, some simple linear algebra that can be done in three lines are instead derived in pages of summations and index swap)This book is a disgrace to the teaching of physics. Its tedious, sometimes illegitimate algebra spoils the elegance of classical mechanics. Compare it with Landau, and you will see the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classical Mechanics is a Foundation","review":"After using this book(or better trying to use this book) I've observed, after complementing the theory that is just trying to resemble Goldstein obviusly omiting most of the theory and proposing to fill those gaps with little examples.Exercises are poorly described maybe asuming you memorize examples, very few derivations are included most is tenth grade algebra.

Like so many others on this site, my copy of M&T; split in half before the semester was even half over. I'd sure love my $80 back plus interest...I thought some of the later chapters were quite good -- particularly the one on Lagrangian dynamics -- but the first few chapters didn't strike me as particularly well written. More than a decade later, I can still recall a problem in Chapter 2 that wasn't even remotely covered anywhere in the chapter itself. It somehow managed to survive to the 4th edition, and I'd be willing to bet it's in the 5th as well.There were lots of things I liked about Marion and Thornton, but generally speaking, if students are expected to plunk down this kind of money for texts on fairly venerable topics, the content should be QA-tested, and the book itself should be reasonably well-constructed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propping up a coffee table","review":"As the other reviews say this book is a 100% waste of money! For me it seems like the authors were just writing / speaking to here themselves speak. They also just give WAY to many examples of SGML and HTML for a history lesson - really zero actual examples of working XML. Also I found severl errors sprinkled across this text and I found myself always flipping back to see what these authors were talking about.

I agree with another reviewer that there were many glaring errors in the code examples and if a technical person had edited this book, these errors should have been caught. So right off the bat, that did not leave me with a good overall impression of the book. I had a work assignment to complete using XML, and none of my colleages had experience it. I ended up putting this book down after about the fourth chapter, and went to Microsoft's Developer Website, which could use some improvement, but surely conveys XML in a better manner than this book. Now that I am comfortable working with XML and stylesheets, I wonder why I struggled so much with it at all. Maybe because of books like this ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Similar to the preface of a good book...","review":"Does a great job telling what xml can do, but somehow forgets to show you how its done!

The content also has quite a few gaps that require re-proofing.Unfortunately not recommended, especially with other books like XML By Example demonstrating what this book should have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Terrible Mistake-Buying this book!","review":"This book is terrible. It was my first XML book, and I started it will the thought that I would learn much about XML in a few days, but it taught me very little.

I felt lucky that my workplace bought this book and not me, but I was forced to read it nonetheless. I must say that after the first 7 days you feel as if you're supposed to know enough about XML, yet when you sit at your desk trying to contrsuct something out of your knowledge, you realize you've learned nothing. Your countless hours infront of this book had gone to waste. It doesn't teach, it lectures. And it's structure is something to laugh about. Instead of teaching you how to make the simplest XML page and then show it with your IE5, it waits untill the 11th day to do that. Makes no sense at all. Stay away from this book... You should wait for Wrox to publish their version of XML tutoring, just to see how these aces cope with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many errors and contradictions","review":"I was originally teaching myself XML from the W3 and microsoft documentations, but decided to get a book that would provide some application relevance in the learning process. As XML and its associated subsets have evolved this book has become outdated. However the inaccuracies resulting from the evolution of XML after the release of this book are minor in comparison to the contradicting statements and blatant errors present throughout the book. The unfortunate fact is that if you don't already know XML you will not be able to decipher error from fact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look to a different source to learn XML","review":"I have bought a number of Sams books and found most of them very instructive, but this book was a total waste of time and money. There's no logical pattern to learning XML presented in this text. Topics are scattered and there's no recognizable learning pattern. There are too many references to SGML and HTML, and too few XML hand-on examples. If you need to understand the history and similarities of XML to HTML and SGML, go ahead and buy this book.

Now I understand the problem with these books - you need to break things down into easy to bite chunks, and there are times when that is not possible. But where these authors draw those lines is ridiculous! There is no real rhyme or reason to the lay-out of the book. The authors cover DTD's in about 6 different chapters, and normally it's a touch of DTD with everything else and my favorite phrase \\"as you'll see in later chapters\\". If we're going to see it in later chapters, don't cover it here!Don't purchase this book. It's not worth the money. Check out Inside XML instead if you're looking for a book.

The author has profound knowledge of XML, SGML, HTML, and Markup language in general. 2. The author lacks profound knowledge of software engineering in general. 3.

Why this was ever released remains a mystery. It's a possibility this material was written before her Love To Love You phase or shortly after; There's very little if no information regarding copyright dates, liner notes, or production notes. The other vocalists are a little less enjoyable to listen to. Yet, when Summer does take the lead or background, she shines brighter than the rest of the team on this collaboration !

Lots of characters each with their own personalities, cool music, cameos, romance, laughs, color, smooth graphics, and rewarding credit pictures. I'm incredibly glad I bought this! The puzzles are more obvious, and some are just plain silly. If you pay attention, you can figure out nearly every scene as a part of the body. Even older kids will like this game!

Way to long, it goes on and on and although the husband and wife team of K.B. Gilden are very good writers, I question how in the world the editors allowed this rambling opus to go to print without cutting out about 500 pages. To compare it to Gone With the Wind is like comparing Valley of the Dolls to To Kill A Mockingbird. Yes, it takes place in the South, but I saw no other comparison. The characters are strange and unlikeable. There are times the dialog is very odd and ambiguous. I want to like this book.

But have no fear. Big Chuckie is the President Of The NRA so he believes in his Right To Bear Artillery, Armoury And Lotsa BIG Guns.So he shoots a lot of guys.

Aside from Heston, the acting is utterly horrid!

It seems outdated but it SO much fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie, lean extras","review":"Movie quality was excellent. The Special Featurette was rather superficial, but not horrible. If you don't demand a lot of in-depth additional features, this is a good way to get a memorable movie on DVD, if the price is modest.I fell in love with this movie as a teenager. Most of the performances are very strong, and the story is both thought-provoking and gritty. While I loved Vincent Price in the similar \\"The Last Man On Earth\\", I prefer the plotting of this 'remake' better, though, as others have noted, the ending here, while attempting to be 'tragic' and/or ironic, comes off rather contrived. Nonetheless,it still wells up my emotions, probably because I've invested myself too much until then.There's much food for thought in this version of a post-apocalypse world, coupled with servings of action and violence, and a dose of romance. Not perfect, but well above average."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best in 70's sci-fi The Omega Man","review":"The best horror and sci-fi films were made in the 70's, The Omega Man is one of them.Charlton Heston does a great job as the last man on earth who is trying to defend himself against a group of mutant survivors called The Family. The film was quite spooky for it's time and there's no other like it.It has a great music score by Ron Grainer which is funky and spooky which makes the movie great.I love this film !!!, and I look forward to the DVD release."},{"rating":"2","title":"CHILDHOOD FAVORITE THAT ISN'T QUITE AS GREAT AS I REMEMBERED!","review":"I saw this film at the theater when it was released and I really like it. It does hold a certain charm for me, but a person viewing it now for the first time may not think so. The film is a bit dated, but has a very interesting premise which has been done before in \\"The Last Man On Earth\\" starring Vincent Price. The movie took some liberties with the story from the original source novel 'I Am Legend' but, hey... what the heck! My rating is high because of my memories of how I enjoyed seeing this as a kid.....it was just too cool to believe. The DVD transfer on the first release(white cover)is nice and if you are a fan of the movie it is a worthy purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Omega Man DVD from WB","review":"As other people have already mentioned about the story, I will focus on the content of the DVD itself, so that other buyers will know what they will buy. Regarding this movie, all the INFO provided by Amazon is right but Imyself, have experienced some frustration regarding some purchases. Sometimes it states the movie is in widescreen, or had some other languages and based on this info I buy, just to find out later that the INFO on amazon is WRONG.That said, The Omega Man comes on a single disc, is widescreen, English and French languages, and Subtitles English, French,Spanish.It runs for about 1h 38 minutes, has a few extras( teatrical trailer), and is in colour."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie from my childhood days","review":"I remember watching this movie as a child and not liking it's ending very well because it was sad to me.

Of course, the acting and technical gadgets are a bit dated , like watching an old Star Trek episode, but the memories of the original theatre experience are all there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"Before rushing to watch the newly released remake entitled \\"I AM LEGEND\\" I strongly suggest to all sf and movie passionates taking a good look at least once to THE OMEGA MAN. It is essential to see Charlton Heston excellent performance and the minimalist and eery atmosphere of the deserted city. The feeling of alienation and mystery is priceless. It reminds me of \\"SOYLENT GREEN\\" or \\"PLANET OF THE APES\\". There are many details that appear outdated or plain ridiculous by today's standards and the mutant/zombie chapter could be totally rewritten to allow for a more credible and dynamic scenario. None of the less I still have a profound interest and nostalgia for this type of movie belonging to a time when special effects were less important than plot and interpretation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A badly dated sci-fi film.","review":"Heston plays the last man on earth. During the day, he prowls the streets of LA in his Mustang. However, at night he must be back in his upper floor apartment because zombie-mutants come out in the the evening. Both the acting and directing are barely adequate. During the day scenes, you can clearly see other autos and people in the distance (the movie was apparently shot in Los Angeles in the early morning). The make-up and costumes for the zombies are ludicrous. All the actors look glum and dour. I saw this movie when it was initially released and thought is was OK. Unfortunately, it hasn't aged well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Sci-Fi Thriller","review":"With no pun intended, there is a germ of a good story here but the way it's executed is laughable. The direction and script are flat. The thrills and chills aren't all that thrilling and chilling. Attempts at gallows humor are lame at best. Charlton Heston seems to be going through the motions here. Rosalind Cash delivers a cliched soul-sister act. \\"The Family\\", led by a usually reliable Anthony Zerbe, are laughable instead of scary in their black cloaks, sunglasses, and spooky eyeballs. Do yourself a favor and see the basic premise of this film executed better in Danny Boyle's \\"28 Days Later\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Omega Man","review":"This movie was the contributor of many a nightmare involving for some reason little persons in hoods climbing through my bedroom window.

Take all as you will.This film was somewhat thought provoking, somewhat confusing, throughout. A lot of the 'horrors' are left unexplained, or else they receive fast explanations. The mixture of 70s lingo and cinematic cliches were hard to stomach at times. The role of race in the casting of the actors is almost unbearable.The soundtrack sucked. I wasn't alive when the music was recorded, but it seemed to me to be a grab-bag of pop culture musical styles from the era. The music constantly clashed with the mood of in the scenes, the acting, etc. I felt like the whole soundtrack was trying to seduce me into nasty hairy lovemaking, baby. This film came out the same year as Dirty Harry, and honestly, they could have been scored together.Charlton Heston, how you must have fallen from the grace that was Planet of the Apes... if you liked that movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original Omega Man","review":"This movie is still a great watch even though it was made more than 40 years ago.

It gives rise to the question of whether or not if you would want to survive it or not. Charlten Heston gives an arresting performance in this action/thriller. A great Sunday afternoon movie. The musical score is also custom made for this movie. This is a movie you will not long forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I am Legend\\" is a Remake of \\"The Omega Man\\"","review":"\\"I am Legend\\" is a Remake of \\"The Omega Man\\". Aside from the special effects, \\"The Omega Man\\" is a better implementation of the original storyline.

I recently read the book, so I decided to watch this version of the story that was made later. I was thoroughly disappointed in it from the very beginning. Matheson, who wrote the novel said that this film was so far removed from his story, that it didn't even bother him. I can see why, if I hadn't aleady known that it was supposed to be based on the book, I'd have never have guessed it. The book is wonderful, I couldn't put it down, as is Last Man on Earth which was co-written by Matheson under a different name. I was very disappointed in this film.

The premise is semi-plausible, and channels some of the fears that people had back then, but that's about all it does. Not really a deep movie that really explores anything. You can kinda understand the motivation of the \\"enemy\\", but it basically paints them as evil. And the protagonist is nominally the \\"hero\\", but doesn't really say anything to convince you of the \\"right\\" of the way he lives. Maybe that is the point.

I have certainly been missing some very good reading. Anne McCaffrey in certainly a natural story teller and so far I am finding her delightful. I realize that this book probably is not truely a good example of the actual Dragonrider Series, but being somewhat familiar with the story line, I found it a good place to start. Yes, there was a bit more \\"tech talk\\" than I usually enjoy in a fantasy type novel, but that is okay as it was quite necessary, in this case, to tell the story. It, the tech talk, was not overwhelming and did add to the story which would have been difficult to understand the origins of the Dragonriders without.

Certainly the most well-written Pern novel, bar none. Well-formed characters. Good plot. A villain you love to hate. Believeable heroes. And, of course, Thread. Also an interesting look at the craft system while it's still developing from its origins into its look in the Ninth Pass, or even in Moreta's time.I know I hope that she'll come back to the Second Pass with more stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was very challenging with the adult vocabulary.","review":"I am 13 years old and my brother is 11 years old, I have read the book completely, and my brother has just started the book, I was challenged by the adult vocabulary in the book, and my favorite characters were Sorka and Sean. Sorka finds Sean, and he is determined not to show Sorka he is not afraid of landing when he is really scared to death. Sorka and Sean fall in love at the ages of 18 and 20, and then they are chosen as dragonriders of Pern"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book. Just that: Good Book!","review":"This book is also the first Pern book I read. I captivated me so much I went on to read the whole series"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Favorite","review":"I have read some of Anne McCaffrey's other books, and I thought that they were pretty good. Not the case with this one. It seems like I'm the only one that thinks this book was awful, but I just didn't like it.I thought that the story did help clear up some of the Pern \\"mysteries\\" of the ancestors, but I was constantly being averted by the numerous swear words and nasty scenes that I won't mention right now. :-) I understand that some of them may have been affected by living on a \\"corrupt\\" Earth, but I really didn't want to hear that. This book has caused my respect for the series to downslide somewhat. I believe that the same effect may be reached without the above mentioned, and yet still not be classified as a little kid's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the fuss about, anyway?","review":"I saw the Dragonriders of Pern series in the SF and Fantasy Top 100 list, and since the book was both SF and fantasy, my two favorite genres, I snapped it up when I saw the book in the bookstore.(Enlish titles are hard to come by here, anyway.)And then I read it. And then I realized that not all books are good merely for being science fiction or fantasy, or even science fiction and fantasy at the same time. The whole book is about how resourceful, loving, and noble Sean and Sorka are, what an (unbelievably) evil slut Bitra is, what great leaders Benden and Boll are, and so on. The author's obsession with detail, which would have been pleasing in many other books, make reading this book laborious work. Phew! The other Pern book at the bookstore, Dragonquest or whatever, is about the same. What are all these people, reincarnations or something? First novel where I counted the remaining pages while I read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rehash","review":"The villains are overstated and the other characters are bland. The opening is without interest and slow. The best scene is the discovery of fire lizards and even that is repeating an event from a previous book.To be fair, the author has a difficult task in front of her. Her previous books, set in a later era of Pern, contain many references to the the founding of Pern. Now, writing the \\"first\\" book, she is left with the task of connecting her dots and making a story out of them. This isn't her best work, but she manages a credible story that may be more enjoyable to those who have not read so much of the Pern series as I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"best series ever","review":"I love anne mccaffrey. this series is my favorite ever. so well written i would suggest it and all the other pern books to any sci fi fantasy lover"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT","review":"Fabulous prequil to the Dragonriders of Pern series, this is the story of the landing and settlement of the planet by the colonists who arrived from Earth.

Whether a new read or a re-read the stories are wonderfully vibrant"},{"rating":"1","title":"420 Pages of Chatter","review":"This book was a terrible drag to me. Not only is the plot very slow, but it's also unbalanced in a sense that AMC procrastinates pages after pages on irrelevant points and quickly bundles up essential matters in a few sentences. For example, results of essential conversations are reported in three sentences instead of providing the conversation itself. The same occurs with the experiences with Dragons, or with the death of some characters.Then it makes the book complicated to read because you can't predict what you can safely skip... After a while, you get frustrated and end up skipping paragraphs because you just don't care about anyone any more. Never mind who is who and who does what.Eventually, less than 10 pages out of 420 remain in my mind. A pretty bad score, indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her worst book (and I'll tell you why)","review":"This was McCaffrey's worst book (okay, Renegades did suck worse), and the reason is that it destroys all the thrill of discovery that we felt all through the first three books and the rest of the series. The \\"ancients\\" are revealed to be boring, stiff characters not half as interesting as the best of her 2nd string characters. The \\"main characters\\" are stupid and allow themselves to be duped, the evil characters are way too evil, and it basically takes much of the magic of the series away. All this history is meant to be subtle, to be something you think about after you put the book down -- but it's just a lot of dreck. It offers nothing that we didn't know, but a lot of flat, boring characters named Benden, Bitra and so on, and does nothing good. Please, do NOT read this book.

It is for mature readers but is a good book. I would highly recomnd it to young adult readers. About a sivilization on a different planet and how it grows. About how the humans got there and how some people shoulden't be there. A touching story about people trying to populate a new planet. How they have a problem and solve it. I won't get into how they solve it that would give part of the story away. I think that for fantasy readers this is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 2nd favorite McCaffrey-book","review":"This book is my second favorite McCaffrey-book after Dragonflight, and Anne McCaffrey has certainly done a good job at describing how the dragons were created.

This was defenately something I needed to explain all the smaller bits about Dragonflight, and I still refer back to it while reading the other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy","review":"This is a set of nice black finish (not black chrome) adapters.

He was a very good storyteller but only an average writer - that is, his prose and characterizations are not particularly good. 'The Bride Wore Black' fits this rule completely.In 'The Bride Wore Black' we have essentially five different murder stories with one seemingly common element: the same murderess. In the end we understand a bit more about her motive and why these victims were chosen. Woolrich also delivers a delicious surprise ending. Don't expect any subplots or side romances. This is pure, simple reading enjoyment that doesn't tax the brain but keeps your eyes glued to the pages.Bottom line: certainly among Woolrich's better books. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"as important as chandler and hammett","review":"you may not have heard of woolrich, but he travelled the same dark streets as noir's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gusus is not Gus Gus","review":"Amazon totally blew this one.

It is a band called Gusus, made in Japan and it is horrible. Easy mistake to make, I had to read it several times before I realized what had happened. Amazon made the same mistake, and since there were no reviews on Gusus, I didn't pick-up on it.It is heavy metal with a male screamer....good for some, not good for me.Amazon, you need to remove the entry from the Gus Gus list!P.S.

This is a reproduction of an ancient document from the Mixtecs, around 1400 AD, from the area today known as Puebla or Oaxaxa. The project took seven years to complete as they painstakingly reproduced the Codex with accuracy and authenticity. The color plates are a delight to the eye as they depict kings, mythical warriors and the Mixtec belief system. Each plate is explained, in great detail, in the beginning of the book for your convevience. The colorful plates are intricate and exact on thick high quality paper. This is great stuff for an artist working in any medium that needs inspiration or just wants to reproduce. A good book for history buffs too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gem","review":"This is a very strange and beautiful book in pictures. It reads like a dream if you tune in to it, and reveals very deep meanings about the relation between life and death, the human relation to the forces of nature, and time. Even though there are no words, it is possible to understand. If you get into it the symbols become more and more recognizable, and they begin to speak. the calendrical symbols and the spirit deities are completely recognizable. The sequences are all about times, and there is a big element about sacrifice. It has to do with the consequences of change; there is no life without death. The book has a very powerful image of life and death fused back to back that pretty much is the epitome of all the book is about. It's all about life and death in relation to time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Other 5 Star Reviews are Right","review":"I will not go over their 5 star comments except to say that I agree.

However, the film's power is not in the actors' abilities to portray different characters, but in its stark simplicity that historic Rome is able to live anew for the viewer. (Indeed, Open City was filmed only several weeks after liberation and many of the film actors were unschooled and found off the streets.) One can not help but feel the power, agony and brave fortitude of the film's characters.The film is worthy of many, many viewings; Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"A Great film ..filled with the emotion of the times.

However, it appears that most of the reviewers refer to the VHS version. I bought this DVD the moment I heard that it was on DVD, and am much disappointed. Overall transfer is substandard, subtitles miss a bulk of dialogues, and most of all, there is at least one missing shot that I noticed in this transfer (It is the famous shot in which the resistant is being tortured by blowtorch). I had VHS released by Connoisseur, which is superior to this DVD on every level.So buy VHS or better yet tell Image to restore this gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"a great film ruined by bad transfer","review":"I agree with many reviewers here that this is truly a great film. Someone mentioned that the story is melodramatic or even propagandistic, which is true, but it is really beside the point in this case. What is important here is how the simple story is told in even simpler way in this ground-breaking film, transporting the viewers to the breathtaking moments of last days of WWII in Rome. However, I think many reviews actually refer to VHS version because DVD (released by Image, I think, from Blackwell Films) is even worse than VHS (released by Connoisseur). I bought this title as soon as I heard it was on DVD, and I was much disappointed to say the least. The transfer is substandard in overall, subtitles miss whole bulk of dialogues, and most of all, there is even a missing shot from the film (It is the famous shot in which the resistant is being tortured with torchblow).

This is a must-see film for all movie fans worldwide. I loved the characters!

It is sentimentalizing at its worse, I particularly found the portrayal of the German commander weak, as he looked like a gerbil, and did not seem very apt or capable.

I do mean that Cinderella-like quality about Tess (Melanie Griffith), who's swept away from her life as harried office drudge to rising star of the business world. I especially like that she did it herself, with her prince charming (Jack, played by Harrison Ford) helpful and supportive but clearly not the one doing the hard part. And I don't ignore the catty delight to be had in seeing Tess unwittingly steal Jack from the evil stepmother/boss Katharine (Sigourney Weaver).Among many other things, Tess does a great job of showing what it's like to grow into one's success when it comes so suddenly.

In many cases a drummer can make or break a band and though the female singer Trish and songwriter are left theyve lost that special something they had. Annoying drum machines clatter away synths sequenced to simplistic motifs- fragments of songs that in the past were carried by unique arrangements falter under the sound of what i guess was hip in electronica a few years ago.

The interviewed people responds in various languages, e.g. Spanish (with Argentinian accent) or Korean. The problem was that the subtitles did not work at all, which made it difficult to understand, and thus frustrating!

I expected a more in-depth analysis of the side effects of globalization.I give it 2 stars only because of the activism behind the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the quality I expected","review":"If you are seeking a good quality then do not expect that this will be the product to buy. For the cost you pay, it may be OK, but personally I prefer to pay some extra and get a better product like Dura-Stick II Electrotherapy Electrodes, it cost almost double, but defiantly it is much betterBeware that the adhesive conducting layer is not good at all and that will limit the number of times you use it.Also, the shipping price is so expensive - but it is also expensive on the other product I am suggesting to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Costly but Effective","review":"The price of the electrodes was great, but the shipping cost nearly doubled the price.

With medical needs coming first, you are best off to get high quality pads that can be used over a couple weeks. The brand (I forget the name this moment) that my physical therapist uses kept working even after two weeks. I don't know if the ones reliamed ships are just old, or just not very high quality but you will waste more money by going through the pads quickly rather than purchasing higher quality pads at a higher price.

It's basically a serial killer movie with Bigfoot as the killer. It has some funny dialogue, but the entire film just bored me terribly. For the sake of the review I did finish watching it. Apparently, many other reviewers found something to like here, I was not able to find it. Beyond the stale plot lines, sometimes funny dialog, and boring premise (you know, a bunch of campers go to the woods and get hacked up by a machete weilding maniac, oops, I mean a big hairy multi-clawed bipedal maniac), I just felt it was boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why can't I find a good Bigfoot movie","review":"The idea sounded good, a group of people in the woods being stalked by a bigfoot, but the acting sucked and the night time scenes are impossible to follow.

To say that the sasquatch cgi monsters are terrible is an understatement. Those B-grade 1970's bigfoot films like Creature From Black Lake and the Boggy Creek series are FAR better than this stinker -- a shame in this age of modern technology and film making.

Although the authors obviously did a considerable amount of research for this project, the book as a whole seemed to me rather tedious, with an overwhelming number of characters who contributed little to the final outcome. Although the liberation of Paris was a momentous event and is depicted well in the final chapters, I think a more profitable line of pursuit would have been to examine the critical miscalculations made by Hitler which resulted in the loss of Paris for the German army, or morale among the Germans as the European campaign collapsed. As such , the book offers little in the way of insight into these events, and this, I believe, is its greatest weakness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"Great story of how Paris survived the second world war.

I got very engaged with the characters as well as the plot. Excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful!","review":"The recipe for success isn't so tough to figure out, writes financial entrepreneur Charles Patrick Garcia. Start with a heaping helping of passion, then mix in equal parts hard work, integrity, belief and positive attitude. The quality of the final dish resides in the details, of course, so the former military intelligence officer outlines the actions you must take to succeed and the mindset you need to adopt. Garcia's easily digested writing style, peppered with plenty of real-world examples from the military, politics and business, makes this motivational book a rewarding repast. We suggests Garcia's success manual to managers looking for a refresher course in staying focused, inspired and on task."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read for High School Students","review":"I am only in high school, but this book meant a lot to me. I am really glad that I read it now, while I still have my whole life ahead of me. The pressures that young people face (to \\"slack off\\" in their school work, to take the easy road) often push them to make decisions that do NOT lead to success. I see this all the time. And I think that if more high school students read this inspiring book, they would realize that they have a whole world of exciting possibilities at their fingertips and that they can, we can, all reach out and get them, Garcia shows us how!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"I'm a pretty big fan of motivational books, because they seem to be exactly what I need at any particular moment. I actually found out about A Message From Garcia through an email spam. It was touted as \\"different.\\" I'm not sure how different since many books of this genre are usually speaking the same message, just with different examples and perspectives. But, it was easy to read and kept me turning the page. I really liked the \\"how to\\" aspect of the book. After all, it isn't any good reading about other people's success if you don't know how to make your own.A big \\"different\\" -- The book was augmented with a website called Success Compass which helps you set goals and then e-mails you a reminder at whatever frequency you wish, even several times a day. I guess the key to success is not allowing yourself to forget what you want, and the Success Compass website doesn't let you forget. I liked it and I think you'll like it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring, Uplifting, and Practical","review":"A Message from Garcia offers a fresh way of looking at the tried and true, plus some new and valuable Internet wrinkles. You'll get your money's worth, and then some, from this success manual. Changing your life: that's what this book is all about.

Starting from the bottom up, the lowest rack works great for rollerblades, running shoes, and even a light bike rack. I'm using the next basket for mountain biking gear and the two nets are holding helmets in one and will be nerf balls and yard toys in the other. The side hangers are nice to hang water bladders and camel backs from as well.The package came a little beat up from Amazon and I was missing a single net.

The first one came with two of the same arm. Amazon sent a new one and the second had a broken basket. Between the two I was able to put one together.The unit itself is just okay. The wire rack on the bottom is flimsy and will surely break if used as a bike rack. A plain plastic shelving unit would probably work better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what was expected","review":"I find this to be unlike other Racor products I own.

Poorly designed. Bolt holes don't line up and the bottom rack will require some ingenuity to get it together. Doesn't say where it was made but my guess is in China."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not buy unless you are or live with a handyperson","review":"I like the concept, but the product itself was very poor quality. It was very difficult to assemble. The holes in the tubing did not line up and we had to drill new holes to assemble the product. I can tell that it will probably only last this summer, then will end up in a landfill somewhere. I wouldn't recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stand, problems with holes lining up","review":"I read the reviews before purchase so I knew that there might be problems with assembly. Mine arrived in a very worn box that had several rips to it. It did not damage the integrity of the parts, but several nuts/bolts were missing. The problem was that those parts are measured in mm rather than inches, so it was more challenging to find replacements at Home Depot, but we were able to.Putting it together was a bit of a challenge. As others have noted, the holes do not always line up correctly. So, it took my husband and I working together to get it assembled. As long as you have patience, you should be ok. It does work very well for the job and makes finding all our sports equipment easy... we keep it by the front door, so it also encourages the kids to want to play outside more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs an Alignment","review":"This product is a great idea with a bad final design. The holes are not aligned. Attaching the racks to the standing bars is impossible. I chose a few to align with the screws and used heavy duty zip ties for the misaligned holes. The zip tie bends to accommodate for the lack of alignment. I called Racor and they sent a new X-Rack free of charge. Unfortunately, the new one did not align, either. Do not purchase this unless you can drill holes through metal, have zip ties at home, or feel like having a product that does not assemble as it should."},{"rating":"1","title":"Move On. Nothing to see here.","review":"What a disappointment. I have never had a problem putting things together, even if directions were lousy photo copies.None of the holes lined up properly, could have used some washers. When it was finally completed, was worried it was going to fall over as it was wiggling side to side. Do yourself a favor and move along. Dont say I didnt warn you.

However, the experience was ruined by poor workmanship. The holes simply do not line up on the parts in order to assemble it properly. The holes are so far off that it is necessary to redrill some of them in order to actually put this together. Lot of work. Company offered to replace it, but it's too much work to disassemble it, repackage everything, and wait for a new one. And the next one may be the same, anyway. Since I imagine these are manufactured using a jig or fixture, it looks like there was a bad setup at the factory and would then result in many units manufactured this way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming two hours in Spain","review":"The Flower of My Secret is a charming surprise about a middle-aged, Spanish romance writer who is devastated when her husband leaves her. The plot is actually fairly predictable. What makes this movie so enjoyable is the main character, Leocadia, who is beautiful, talented, and flawed. In fact, it is her flaws (her penchant for melodrama and booze, to name two of them) that endear her to the viewer. This movie is the perfect way to spend a rainy weekend afternoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almodovar's Worst, Still a Very Good Film","review":"This one was a bit abrupt and underdeveloped in my humble opinion. I say that only when comparing this to his other works.

He's made remarkable and unforgettable films--All about my Mother, Talk to Her, Tie Me Up!

So I looked in the index under Delicata and is says \\"See Vegatables; Winter squash\\". So I turned to Vegetables and no Winter Squash. I looked under W found the recipe under W.The Table of Contents lists starting page for a chapter, like side dishes. But when you go to that page the list of recipes at the beginning of the chapter does not show page numbers for the recipes. I really expect it to be easier than this to get to a specific recipe.The other big missing is nutrition information.

My favorite types of science fiction stories deal with time-travel and alternate universes - this novel contains the latter as its main plot device - yet even I found myself becoming lost in the multiple upon multiple Voyagers and Voyager crews.An excellent example of what this novel could have been is Peter David's \\"Q-Squared\\", a very complex but entertaining, fascinating, and non-confusing Trek story containing multiple time-tracks. Also recommended is \\"Dark Mirror\\" by Diane Duane, the first Next-Gen encounter with the \\"evil\\" universe from the original series \\"Mirror, Mirror.\\"After reading David's and Duane's books and seeing the \\"Year from Hell\\" episodes on TV, I was very disappointed in \\"Echoes.\\" It really doesn't cover any new territory that hasn't been covered before.

I thought they could have added about 10 more pages that found a reason, any reason, to go to the planet afterward and get their amacolite and see what normal life is like on the planet.

In many instances given explanations miss real depth, and many errors and inconsistencies can be found throughout the book.Just as if it was quickly written for selling by numbers without a real concern about contents. Occasionally it seems that some subjects were written to fullfil the exam requirements, however, the author did not have the experience with the subject.The publisher made a smart deal with training centres to use this book as their reference...- Not recommended -A few pages of errata can be found on the publishers website, however, many more are still uncovered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read review by : cts@cts.pp.fi","review":"I fully agree that this book is a disgrace.

I have been supporting and consulting with Windows for almost 10 years, I have my MCSE 4, and I spent so much time re-checking the facts in this book I could have read another one! They can't even get the requirements for Windows 2000 correct: Their requirements listing on Page 5 is totally different than that on Page 77! (This was the first of many problems I found).If you are new to Windows NT/2000, DO NOT GET THIS BOOK, as you won't know enough to separate the inaccuracies from the truth.

It may cover 100% of theexam objectives but not to the depth that you need and the authorsshould know that.If you want a book that will introduce you towin2k pro and have a little extra then you may want this book.

I do not pretend that technical books are error free but in this book, there is no single chapter which is free of errors. It is totally unacceptable to buy an expensive book which instead of helping you to pass the exam, it will as a matter of fact mislead you!If I was the author of this book I would ask the publisher to retire it and compensate all the poor souls who bought it.I passed the exam on the first try with a score of 800 but obviously not thanks to this book but thanks to ExamCram."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"I had to give this \\"thing\\" a star to post this review, otherwise I wouldn't have given one at all.

You're much better off with a book and a tape"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Don't bother with this software. It is a really pathetic package. First of all, it crashes all the time. Obviously, this package isn't supported since there is no patch for the crash on their website. But secondly, there is no uniform strategy to their teaching methods. Basically, this is just an engine that speaks chinese along side pinyin text. And a few games are thrown in to the mix. The speech analyzer which another reviewer commented on is useless. I can say entirely different words than I am supposed to and it still indicates I am speaking correctly.Really, I'm surprised that this package is even on the market.

Called VuPoint Solutions, they told me that my OS system should be compatible, but if it is still not downloading I need to either a) return their product to the the seller or b) attach it to a different computer. Now as far a 'tech support' goes, what BS. They didn't even offer any troubleshooting advice. They also said they weren't selling the product anymore.

I now want to finish the series by reading 'The Buck Stops Here' again.I loved 'A Dime a Dozen', but 'A Quarter for a Kiss' was even better! It's definitely one of my favorite books!A 'Quarter for a Kiss' ends with such a cliff-hanger that I can hardly wait to read 'The Buck Stops Here' and continue Callie and Tom's story.All-in-all this is definitely a book that I recommend if you enjoy a great mystery with romance and don't mind being \\"on-the-edge-of-your-seat\\"!*I received a complimentary copy for my review.

I am about to read the next one so I might change my mind. While the first three books started off slow, this one started out from the beginning keeping you in suspense. It was at least 1/3 through the other books before it even got suspenseful. Also in this book we learn a great deal about the mysterious Tom Bennett. We learn about his past and his connection to Eli. We also learn some secrets about Eli but I won't mention it here and spoil the story for you. Callie and Tom's romance grows stronger in this one. Another thing about this book and I believe which has already been mentioned is that this book ends on a cliffhanger. None of her other books have done this. I'm starting book five which is the last. I regret it is the last. I'm going to miss Callie and Tom."},{"rating":"2","title":"It should be a movie!","review":"The entire series has been exceptional. I have learned a lot about charitable organizations while enjoying the mysteries. Mindy Starns Clark is one of my favorite authors and she did a great job on this book.

Every riff and melody conforms 100% to templates. They don't even have the 1% of originality or creativity necessary to make a hook that's actually catchy. If you wanted to put in the time and effort I bet you could find places where every riff on this album has already been used in other band's songs. I'm not saying they're ripping anyone off, I'm just saying they're so faceless and generic that it's inevitable.

The Fairly Oddparents is really a hilarious show. If you don't believe me, borrow \\"Abra-Catastrophe\\" from Blockbuster or your library. It's GREAT!And also, I hope WB keeps it's word and releases Tiny Toons on DVD. (Why would it take until 2006?

It pretty much consisted of the camera following the band around outside or in a cab with songs from the band playing. The few times the band members spoke during the documentary they seemed like they were being forced to talk at gunpoint or something. The video coverage of the concert in LA was shoddy. The only redeeming thing about the dvd is the four or five song set played on the second portion of the dvd.

It is NOT a documentary in my opinion. It's not even as good as a nice, solid 15 min band interview. It looks like the footage of a 12 year old child trying to make a documentary. The only positive about this DVD is learning that Bloc Party are excellent live!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good, but if you're a BIG fan... maybe its ok","review":"I really like Bloc Party's music and have all their albums, but this is, by far, the worst documentary I've ever watched. I'd say, get it for the live performances if you want, but these aren't even the best (crowd is very unenthusiastic and I'm sure Bloc Party messes up a few times here and there), but I understand this was fairly early on in their career as a band, so its cool. To give you an idea of the documentary, the interviewer on the documentary asks Kele, \\"No offense, but I notice you stutter a lot. Was that difficult for you growing up?\\" I don't see how he answered that question so calmly. I'd say buy this real cheap if you absolutely have to have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"God Bless Bloc Party","review":"I was very suprised when I found out that Bloc Party came out with a dvd. They are still a rather small indie band and barely known in the states. I'm a big fan of them, but have never seen them live so I was a little unsure.The dvd menu has two features: documentary and their live show in Belfort, France. The documentary is a mix of band interviews and live clippings from a LA venue. The LA show was good live footage, and they sounded excellent however the interviews with the band were dull and pointless. Bloc Party isnt as interesting as they are on stage; I dont blame the band entirely-it is the journalists/interviewer's questioning.If you like live footage and don't care as much about getting to know the band personally then this dvd is perfect. I was happy regardless because Bloc Party rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great concert footage, little else.","review":"I was very excited when I heard this was coming out, because Bloc Party is one of my new favorite bands. I love \\"behind the scenes\\" footage, but what was available on this DVD was very limited. I think the band is a little camera shy. The concert footage, however, is amazing! The sound is great, the band was on fire, and I don't think a smile ever left the singers face.

I thought it was quite difficult to balance especially taking corners and getting off and on the bike. I just purchased the Instep trailer (because we have two kids) at Target for $69 and couldn't be happier. I truly was so easy to put together the hardest part was putting the coupler on the wheel of my bike and that only took about 5 minutes. My kids loved riding in it and I loved pulling them. I only wish that I purchased this two years ago instead of the bike seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"It is so nice to have the bike trailer because my whole family can go on a bike ride now instead of trying to have a someone watch my son while my husband and I go.

And the best part is that my son loves going with us on our bike rides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this trailer","review":"Took my 3-year-old granddaughter for a ride in this.

Easy to install, kids are comfortable inside. My first thought would be that this trailer would be so heavy that my wife would have a hard time pulling it. That was not the case and the hitch to attach it to the back of your bicycle is well designed.Because the arm bar is only attached to one side of the trailer, it does have a tendency to look crooked, especially if configured as a jogger cart.Overall, its a great solid product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"This was truly was \\"Quick N EZ\\". The trailer was very easy and quick to assemble and hook up to my bike. It is a little cumbersome to take apart for storage. Added bonus for me was the front wheel that came with it so that it can be used as a jogging stroller as well. The kids love to ride in it and the rain flaps are a great feature to keep the rain/wind out of the trailer. A great purchase at a great price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased in PA","review":"We purchased the InStep Quick N EZ Bike Trailer for our 16 month old son. We have used it for both long walks and bike rides and our son loves it. It is very easy to put together and also to transfer between bike trailer and stroller and is relatively easy to pull behind a bike! However, we purchased it with hopes that it will fit two children in the future. I really don't see how two children would fit in it comfortably. The price from Amazon was great! It is approximately $30-$40 cheaper than other places. We chose the free shipping with Amazon and received the trailer within two days. It folds flat, so it will be making a trip to the beach with us in a few weeks. In addition to fitting two children, my only other problem with the product is the buckles are difficult hook. Once my son is in, he's in. Getting him out takes a little work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great deal","review":"This bicycle trailer is wonderful! It is very light weight and very easy to pull. The directions are a little bit tricky (once you find them!) but I was able to figure it out. It is roomy inside and must be pretty comfortable...my 1 year old didn't complain. The only criticism I have for the trailer is that the \\"seatbelts\\" are so hard to clip and unclip. I wish the manufacturer would have put a little higher quality buckle in the trailer. Overall, a great deal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cruizzzzzen with The Kiddies","review":"I was quite apprehensive about purchasing this bike trailer at first, mainly due to how inexpensive it was compared to the others on the market. I was afraid that quality would have been skimped on to keep the price down. That could not be further from the truth though. It is a solid trailer made from quality parts that is easy to assemble and the kids don't want to get out of it. We have a 2 & 3 year old, who absolutely love going for rides through the park. They have been on up to 12 mile journeys in the trailer and don't want to stop.I highly recommend the ez-trailor. My only other recommendation is that you can purchase an extra quick connect to put on another bike for about $7 if you use more then one bike"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick, easy & enjoyable.","review":"Very easy to assemble, attach to bike and store. I have a 2 1/2 year old and 1 year old - gets a little too close for comfort but it works! Belts do cause chafing and are uncomfortable, but I think I'll take someone else's advice and sew something to them to avoid it.You don't even realize the trailer is attached except the need to make somewhat wider turns!

Ours essentially dissolved. I'm thankful that nothing happened while our kids were in the trailer. The straps are what support the bottom of the trailer, providing structure to the cabin as well as the seats.I'm not the kind to be strongly against things, but in this case for the safety of the passengers please do not purchase this trailer.If you have purchased this trailer, please inspect straps ASAP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bicycle trailer/stroller combo","review":"I purchased this because I wanted a jogging stroller and something I could use as a trailer behind my bike. This combo works great used as either one; I've been very happy with the product. My son is 1 year old and seems to be very comfortable in the seat, he frequently falls asleep. The transition from stroller to bike trailer is really easy and quick! I have no complaints, we are very satisfied!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You Get What You Pay For...","review":"Sadly, I have to agree with the other poor reviews. My 13 month old hates this thing. The seats are not comfortable for him; no matter how we try to adjust the straps they cut into the neck... and it gets very very hot in there even when biking in the shade. It is not really a smooth ride at all. I am very disappointed in this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dual purpose, Good Quality","review":"Like most parents, reading good reviews always help in making a purpose. Before I order this trailer from Amazon, I bought a bike trailer from Wal-mart. To make short and sweet, I returned within a week; quality sucks, material sucks, was not able to convert to a stroller. Well for $75 and free shipping, I order this from Amazon. Immediately, the fabric of good quality. I didn't have to read the instructions, very easy to put together. You just pop the wheels in and it locks. The black aluminum looks like along with the black wheel. It may not last 3,4 or 5 years, but for $75, it's a great value. My boy love to come along on bike trip!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you just have 1 child and strong fingers","review":"The bike trailer looked nice once assembled. However, as soon as you put two kids in it, they seem to sit on top of each other and barely enough room for the both of them. The seats are not very balanced or flat. It creates a dip in the middle which is fine for 1 child, but with 2 kids this creates a problem since the seat area gives it like a hammock effect. You have to have strong fingers to latch each child in it. I seem to have the most problem unlatching the straps. I thought it was a cheap latch system. They could've put better latches. But for the money, you get what you paid for. I would've invested in a better bike trailer."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good hope it will last...","review":"It is my first experience with these types of trailers.The frame looks robust, but I don't know how long the material/nylon will last.My considerations for purchasing this trailer were the price, and the option of the trailer to become a trolley that can be taken off road. The maneuver in hard trails is great. The straps and the seats are not comfortable and I needed to place a soft baby mattress inside to easy the ride for my daughter.Three more issues. One is that the flag came broken, and the other the overall packaging for this product was not very protective, the corners were smashed and there were many holes in the cardboard box. I don't think it is a consideration for buying this product or not, but InStep should pay more attention to packaging and protecting this product.The third, issue is the metal bracket attaches the trailer to the bike doesn't fit my bike and now I need to think about a different bracket to have the trailer attached."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good item but pay 2 bucks more to get different one","review":"The product was good. Good design and easy to install. But the pictures for this product were misleading as one of the picture showed this trailer as stroller.I should have read the description well before buying it. But there is another product form InStep which turns the trailer into stroller, which we actually ended up getting.This is worth the money and kids really liked it. Easily fits two one samll and one big. Cannot put two big kids in this one because of space issues.Be careful when riding the bike not to step over a protuding rock as the base is not hardshell but a soft polymer (mattie) like material so can hurt the kids and can wear out after some period.Overall a good workout and fun with kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Trailer","review":"Recently got this bike trailer, easy assembly. It works great. My 8 month old and 3 year old girls fit in together with no problem. There is not a lot of support, so when my 8 month old rides alone, I prop a boppy pillow around her and a pillow under her feet to keep her upright. She immediatley falls asleep whenever she rides in it. Works great as a stroller too! Very easy to maneuver and folds compactly. Kind of hard for the little ones to wear helmets as the back of the helmet hits the material in back making it uncomfortable. Great for casual bikers. Would highly recommend it for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love it","review":"We got this to use as both a bike carrier and a double stroller. Putting it together was SUPER EASY since it comes mostly assembled. It is bit tight for 2 kids though, a 4 year old and 2 year old. Because the seat is not firm they tend to slide together and then fight because they are pushed up against each other. It attaches easily to a bike but be warned there is alot of drag almost like pulling a parachute. I am guessing every carrier would have this issue though. As a stoller it is very easy to manuever and push. There is some storage behind the seat and that adds to its convenience."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap but fabric bottom makes wholes.","review":"on bike riding, my kid put his foot on fabric bottom. it was scratched on the road. finally it makes whole just in 2 days. what a quality is this."},{"rating":"2","title":"affordable, lightweight, smooth ride bike trailer","review":"This trailer is ideal for folks who want to be green consious and cutback on those car trip with the kids. The trailer is great for daytime road use with one or two toddlers. As a mom looking for arobic activity and affordable family past times, this product fits the bill. I can pack the kids up and ride to the local park. I burn calories on the bike, the kids get the fresh air and exercise at the park. The five point restraint systems is a bit hard to clip each time the kids get in and out of the trailer, but for $100.00 it was well worth the expense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick N EZ Bicycle Trailer","review":"The Quick N EZ arrived in fantastic condition and in a very timely manner. We were very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riding Easy","review":"We just purchased this bike trailer. We haven't had the opportunity to use it as a jogger, but as bike pull behind it has seems easy to use and enjoyable. It folds easy for storing and is easy to attach to your bike quickly. Our daughter seems to really enjoy it. I can't account for how it will wear and hold up after time which is my only real worry about it. The only other thing I am not totally sold on is the buckles and straps. There are several and none of them are super easy to use. Certainly though it was worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, quick n ez","review":"Putting the trailer together was very easy and taking it on and off the bike is pretty simple. I am impressed that the trailer does not pull or tug when riding the bike. Other than a little extra weight it is hardly noticeable. The only difficulty is the small stiff hooks on the children safety straps are impossible to unhook, causing discomfort in my fingers and the children get very frustrated that it takes 5 minutes to unhook them. Otherwise good trailer for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The kid loves it!","review":"This was easy to put together, only complaint was in airing up the tires, they partially came off the rims the 1st time, not sure how you can remedy that. I put it together in about 10 minutes and when my son sat in it, I couldn't get him to get out. He ended up sitting in it in the living room and eating a snack. My husband was the one towing the trailer and he was surprised by how light it was and thought it was fairly easy to control. We did have a little trouble getting it to fold as flat as the factory did when we went to store it but nothing to get too frustrated over. All in all we like it a lot and the kid really loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uncomfortable Kiddie Ride","review":"Support for kid in trailer uncomfortable specially if potholes are present. Quick assembly easy to connect and good instructions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Trailer & Great Buy!!","review":"Easy to put together and easy to store. You can also purchase a Stroller Conversion Kit for $30 from the manufacturer to make it into a stroller. I plan on doing that as well. I am planning ordering an extra coupler kit so my husband can hitch the trailer to his bike as well! What a neat idea. Spacious and well built!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Do not buy this stroller. This stroller got a hole in it after the third day of using it. It is really made for one child. If you put two children in here they get smushed against each other. It is also hard to strap the children down into the stroller. Don't throw your money away on this junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick N EZ Trailer","review":"Great versatile bike trailer. Easy hook up, break down, and min. assembly. Only wish I would have got the same trailer with the walker attachments. Baby is 10 months and likes riding and often falls asleep during rides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two year old loves it","review":"I was concerned about whether my two year-old would like a bike trailer, as she does not always care to be in a stroller. But when I assembled this product one day after work, she did not let me stop until it was done. She made me put it together without reading the instructions and take her for a ride. Reading the instructions just slows you down. I put this trailer together and attached it to my bike in a few minutes. Truthfully, there is nothing to be put together, it mostly folds open and closes. I paid $80 for this at Target and could not be more pleased. My kid refused to get out in order to go inside when it was bedtime. I shudder to think about spending the big bucks for a more expensive trailer, especially considering a child is riding on their own bike in a few years."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really is Quick N EZ! Great product!","review":"After buying the 1-2-3 Child Carrier by Fisher Price and being very dissatisfied, we decided to purchase this bike trailer instead. It took less than 15 minutes to install, and we have been very pleased with it so far. It is very sturdy and well-made. The product is made of a nylon fabric that appears to be very durable. It is very easy to pull. My 16 month old daughter seemed to enjoy herself except for the fact that she can't comfortably wear her bicycle helmet in the seat. It pushes her head and neck forward. I am going to try to remedy this problem by placing some towels behind her back which will create a little more space between her and the back of the seat. This will hopefully allow more room for the bulky helmet. Overall, we are very happy with this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Value for Bike Trailer","review":"I would recommend this product because :1. the price (on Amazon)was the lowest I've found anywhere2. product is high quality3. easy to put together (wheels attach and sides to put up)4. simple to attach to bike (in fact, I've switched the trailer from my bike to my husbands several times with just a wrench)5. fits either my 21 month old twins or one twin and my 5 year old (I even have a bike seat attached to my bike and I pull the trailer, to take all 3 kids for a ride!!)The only reason I didn't give it that last star was because the shoulder straps are sometimes difficult to remove from the crotch strap. Sometimes it takes a little work to wiggle it free. But certainly not a reason to not buy this product. I use the bike trailer on blacktop bike paths and neighborhood streets, I probably wouldn't recommend using it on non-paved surfaces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product but not for a wiggler!","review":"I purchased this product along with a bike as a mothers day present for my wife(and my 13 months old daughter). With the free shipping option, I received the product in about a week and it was pretty easy to put it together.The first time we tried it with my daughter I realized that the straps and the harness were not secure enough to keep her inside the trailer as they would be in an infant car seat. The other point is they are not as padded as you'd think they would be for a 1-2 year old.The bottom and the back of the seat could also use some light blanket for comfort.Overall it looked like a pretty decent product and with the price that it's offered at, it is still a good buy.For the straps I think I'll go ahead and buy a pair of Soft Wraps Strap Covers so my daughter would feel more comfy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick N Easy 100%","review":"I love this bike trailer!!. I purchased it on sale for $69.00 and I will tell you that is a great price!!! This bike trailer took me less than 5 minutes to put together. It is not flimsy or cheaply made. It is very durable. Brightly colored and well designed. It folds to compact and the wheels pop off at a click of a latch. You don't have to work at it to get the trailer to compact. A++++ Worth every dollar even at full price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bicycle Trailer","review":"This trailer is a great value. I waited and watched through half the summer for any of the local department stores to have similar products in stock, but they never had any and the prices they had listed on their shelves were at least $50 higher than the price I found through Amazon. This trailer converts easily to stroller mode and pushes very easily even with both of my 3-year-old and 5-year-old daughters riding inside. When they get to big to ride it, and can ride on their own, I look forward to using it to carry up to 100 pounds of supplies for day trips on our bikes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Overall","review":"We bought this to use as a stroller primarily for our 3.5 year old son with autism. We bought it with the hopes that his 5 year old sister would be able to hitch a ride with him now and then. It definitely meets our expectations as far as that goes. The rear tires needed air when we got it. They are fine now.Pros:Folds flat in just a minute or two.Large enough for our very large (41 inches, 42 pounds) 3 year old AND his big sister (42 inches, 36 pounds, 5 years old).Pushes with ease compared to a regular double stroller.Ample storage in rear.Cons:Bottom is basically nylon, with no real support. We may remedy this with plywood underneath; not sure yet.Doesn't fold flat in seconds like a regular stroller, but it's not much of an issue. It is easy to do.No cup holders or snack trays anywhere. There are little nylon pockets inside, though.Bottom line:For the price, it does what we were hoping it would. There is room for improvement, but overall it's a nice stroller!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS TRAILER IS DANGEROUS, STOP USING IT IMMEDIATELY!","review":"IF YOU OWN THIS TRAILER, STOP USING IT IMMEDIATELY!!!! THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS!!!After one year of very little use the trailer is now just garbage. All of the gray nylon straps on this thing are now so weak that you can rip them in half with very little effort. These straps are the ones used to hold up the seat, and more importantly they are the straps used as seat belts.Today when I was buckling the seat belt on my two year old, the belt just pulled right off of the seat. So I decided to check the other straps and I found that I was able to easily rip every single seat belt off of the stroller with almost no force at all. I am glad that I noticed or I would have been putting my child in serious danger!For anyone that has this trailer STOP USING IT IMMEDIATELY AND THROW IT AWAY. THIS IS NOT SAFE FOR YOUR CHILDREN.If you are thinking of buying this thing DON'T!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EZ trailer is EASY!","review":"I bought this for my daughter to cart my grandson in when she goes for a bike ride and we were all very happy with it.The trailer also doubles as a stoller.

Easy to see why they were one of Billboard's best unsigned bands of '99. This record is even better. I heard that they are recording a new record to be released in a few months. It's too bad that their bass player/singer left them to pursue his own deal, but I heard that he was in Atlanta making a new record of his own. Could be cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this one!","review":"Of all the astrology books I've read dealing with finance and the markets (around 15 of them), this is the MOST obtuse of them all. The author gives examples of his own successful \\"predictions,\\" while ignoring all the failures. It's as if I went to the racetrack and came back telling you about the horses I picked and money I won, describing my amazing deductions for selecting winners, but neglected to tell you about the losers and the fact that I came away with an empty wallet. Through it all the author's inflated opinion of himself is made glaringly obvious, which makes the whole reading experience even more annoying, if possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS THE BIGGEST LOAD OF B.S.

Although I do not really subscribe to astrological belief, I read this book out of curiousity.Mr. Weingarten sadly disappoints when one tracks his predictions against the realities of the market.The notion that the astronomical alignment of the planets can affect the performance of financial markets is idiotic. Astroharmonics? Please, you might as well promote Dianetics or the Psychic Hotline as alternative investment methodologies.Adding to the disastrous possibilities of adopting this pseudo-system is the author's gigantic ego. If Mr. Weingarten is as smart as he claims, why isn't he running one of the major investment houses?

This text is the bible of a discipline that ostensibly began in the twentieth century, as self-conscious writing began to absorb architecture as a theme or subject.Each successive wave of theorization about architecture contains similar elements of concern and patterns of approach, each multivalent through time or the pen of the author. Hayes gathers the contentious groups and individuals who have jumped into the fray of Architectural Theory and presents them neatly, their most salient essays all within one binding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"Save your money.Content- Although this book collects many scriptures, it makes no attempt at demystifying or clarifying them (not to mention English translation from French). Thus, most of the content remains up there in the realms of theoretical vagueness, that is-illegible.Fortunately you can find most of the text on the interwebs! Easily translated into coherent everyday English and well explained.Form- Spacious margins mean smaller text, means savings in printing, means difficult to read. Small ,grey fonts, again, translate into savings in print- very difficult for the reader. Not all pages have numbering. Why is that? Go figure. For example from p.329 to p.337 no numbering and not a single image to try and explain this bad design.

The author shows in great detail, utilizing many first person accounts the steps from the Enabling Act all the way to the closing of the war.

This book is on the same level as those as far as transcription quality. The transcriptions are very accurate for the most part. I only have a couple complaints, one being that they tend to use the same songs over in different books. So if you're like me and have more than one book than you definitely have some repeats. Also, in the song \\"Ribbon in the Sky\\", they did not transcribe Stevie Wonder's long solo at the end of the song, which is one of the main reasons I got the book! That was disappointing. Other than that it's a great book and I can say the same for the rest of the series.

They are extremely catty in their remarks and base their dislike for each other on their mutual interest in a boy. Nori, the commonere Mermaid is in love with the Prince, but she thinks said prince loves Elina and vice versa. Thus, she uses this as an excuse to be, frankly, a real bitch for the remainder of the film.Okay.

I enjoyed Billy Bob's dialogues with his dead partner (reminiscent of Electric Mist) but grew a bit tired of the decadent rich people theme from Cadillac Jukebox. If I hadn't read all the Robicheaux books I would recommend this book without hesitation, but I'm disappointed that a writer of Burke's stature appears to be using formulas. I don't think originality is too much to ask for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gritty, Texas flavor and another winner from JLB!","review":"Like an actor, type-cast and losing steam, Dave Robicheaux's (briefly) on vacation, until the muse is rekindled. Instead we have Billy Bob, a ragged around the edges guy, whose nightmares, are thankfully fewer than our Crescent City pals.Like many, I've read all JLB, in chronological order, and like many, I've rushed sleeplessly through a story, then more leisurely re-read each to savor the fine writing and local flavor.I could eat chicken-fried steak or nopalitas with Billy Bob as well as piping hot beignets and po' boys with Dave. The tarnished hero, tilting at personal windmills is the common thread, here. The story is engrossing and tightly plotted. Here here, James Lee for trying something new. I enjoy Dave Robicheaux but I am willing to try something else-reaching a little outside a tried and true series to devour a new treat. Excellent read and ultimately rewarding on many levels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same story different setting","review":"If you have never read a Burke novel then you may like this. If you are familiar with the Robicheaux novels, then pass this one up. I like James Lee Burke's novels, but this book is just the same story and same characters with different names and in Texas instead of New Iberia, LA. Billy Bob is just Dave Robicheaux except as a small town lawyer rather than a small town cop. He has a woman partner, has semi-adopted a young ethnic child, talks to a ghost, defends the down-trodden and his father was killed in an oil company accident just like Robicheaux's father. He deals with sketchy characters from his past and has to deal with the \\"psychic scars\\" of his past as the NY Book Review put it. Sound familiar? If you have read the Robicheaux series then, of course it does. I found myself missing the antics of Clete Purcel. Same idea here: the rich and powerful screw with the down and out. Guess who wins in the end?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed it.","review":"I enjoyed reading Cimmaron Rose. It was good entertainment. I liked it better than the Robicheaux novels, because it was less depressing. I liked the women in it.I have lived in 2 very small Texas towns as a teenager. Kids were not immune from the town's pressure to conform to its moral standards. The rich kids were the children of the town's leaders, and were under more pressure to conform and be \\"good\\". When teenagers get drunk,parents seem to always find out. Kids generally got into trouble when there were not enough activities. They \\"parked\\". The best looking girls were always in danger of getting pregnant.I think this novel was good fiction and I hope no one assumes that small Texas towns have so many misbehaving children (or corrupt police)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great read from James Lee Burke.","review":"Jame Lee Burke is one of the finest story tellers writing today.

Actually the ghost gives our hero good advice throughout the book.Darl Vanzandt is a twisted sociopath who gives the novel some spice as does a convict who is released from prison on a technicality.Burke's novels are imbued with powerful characters, great dialogue and moving prose.I look forward to the next book in this series"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Rose by any other name -- NOT in this case","review":"James Lee Burke has quite a following and I'm not quite sure why.First off, the title has nothing to do with this book besides being the name of Billy Bob Holland's granddaddy's significant other. Maybe I missed something, but this book is about saving his estranged son.While Billy Bob's reflection into the past shows insight into his character, the plot is convoluted and found myself at the end wondering how he ever figured out who did it. Of course it's one of those novels where key information is with held until the end but Billy Bob knew it all along.I think I'll pass on the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"jaes lee burke","review":"james Lee Burke just keeps on doing it.He has a way of endearing a flawed character, which is a change from the stereotyped heroes most authors prefer.The fullness of the characters, along with their idiosycrocies, make for very enthralling entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read, Terrible Ending","review":"Having never read a James Lee Burke novel before, I gobbled up Cimarron Rose, enjoying meeting all the colorful characters, two of whom was Pete and his PI sidekick....couldn't wait to hear what happened to both of them and fully expected him to jump into the relationship he should have developed right from the gitco.I actually threw this book in the garbage (something I have very rarely ever done in my long reading life) after I read the last chapter. The recap of characters he gave us was [disappointing] and never once mentioned either of those two.It was a total let-down but obviously meant that I loved the book all the way to that point and was so emotionally involved with it that it hurt to close the book with so many questions still unanswered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Burke at his best!!","review":"Burke introduces a new character and a new location.

It may well be the last. Unhappily, Mr. Burke has adopted the \\"cookbook\\" approach to his novels, and I, for one, don't approve. As long as they sell, though, I suspect that he will continue to use that approach. However, one can always hope.\\"Cimarron Rose\\" has the predictable human monster, hyper-introspective protagonist, stupid lawmen, and Burke's other standard characters. Unlike his earlier Dave Robichaux novels, though, characters in this book are cardboard-cutout in nature.

Novelist Eric Ambler's intelligent script remains faithful to Nicholas Monserrat's novel about the last voyage of HMS Compass Rose and all who sailed on her. The splendid performances of Jack Hawkins as her captain and Donald Sinden as his First Mate bring the novel to life, as do the performances of the entire ensemble cast, which includes Denholm Elliott. One of the best aspects of the Rank organization films of this era is the devotion that went into the delineation of even the minor characters.Some viewers (an example being my son) may shun this picture because it was filmed in black and white.

It seemed like it would demonstrate why all humans have an aptitude for Math, and maybe how those who are 'innumerate' could tap into this inborn potential.Unfortunately, this is not at all what the book delivered. It was basically a description of the evolution of the Human brain, specifically with regard to language acquisition.With about 30 pages left in the book, he finally launches into his Thesis, which is that we are natrually good gossips, and that Math, to real Mathematicians, is very much like gossip. Mathematicians know numbers like they are people, and know their properties and relationships deeply.That was it.

Second, the author may have some good points on how humans evolved to have math abilities, but these points would be very hard to find--I didn't find them, they are probably somewhere deep underneath all the irrelevant trivias.

Not a single problem. I do have it on an electrical outlet that is not being overloaded. I'm at a loss to explain why so many people had problems with it--obviously something in the electronics part. I wish the non-stick was thicker; it started to wear off during the 1st year, but is not a problem. Other than that, I recommend getting a spare gasket --I'm replacing mine this year, but it's been going strong through 3 years of good, hard work. I don't recommend this item if you're doing large amounts of canning--quarts won't fit and if you've a lot of pints, well, use your regular canner for them.

BUT - last use, I loaded it up with roast and all the veggies, started it and it went out while it was cooking...(never got up to pressure) JUST dead - no electronics at all!

Obviously, as a Naxos set it's an incredible bargain, and in terms of general musicianship, period authenticity, and sound quality it's the equal of its higher-priced main competition, the Minkowski version on DG Archiv. But it has one tremendous advantage over that recording: Fouchecourt. He's the best haut-contre tenor in the world for French baroque repertory (maybe all of baroque repertory), and he completely lives up to that status here. This performance is simply beautiful from beginning to end, and I have a hard time imagining a better one.

It's interesting how pertinant the subject matter is.That being said, this movie is pure entertainment. We watched it as a family and both my husband and son were interested throughout. My son was delighted when Lily Tomlin gets so tiny that she lives in the kids Barbie dollhouse.THe supporting cast is excellent as well as the kids. Joel Schumacher does an excellent job directing.

You can see the size of the grain change throughout the film and the beginning is so bad it's not even VHS quality.

In writing it, Fred Abraham drew on the 4-volume series on visual mathematical books on Dynamics, by Fred's brother Ralph Abraham (a pioneer in chaos theory) and Christopher Shaw. As such, it not only applied non-linear dynamical concepts like Attractors, State Spaces, and Bifurcations to psychology, it actually showed what such mathematical concepts looked like. Though chaos theory has been most useful for psychology as metaphor, the metaphor is immeasurably enriched by understanding - and visualizing - the actual under-pinnings of dynamic change. A difficult to find book at present, but well worth it for anyone interested in how non-linear dynamics is important for not only psychology but any of the so-called \\"soft\\" sciences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not seal & won't fit other pyrex cups","review":"I use this cup for making salad dressing.

They made a sticky dough which they threw at the Pincushion man until he got so stuck together that he just rolled away in a huge ball of dough. All the balloons piched in, some making dough, some manning the machines that threw the dough. They had a warning system that was sounded when the Pincushion man appeared.

I'm throwing it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Word cannot describe how much I hated this book!","review":"Domestic violence is a very serious issue and being on the outside looking in is such a painful and frustrating place to be. That being said, if you want to spend many hours being frustrated and annoyed by completely unlikable characters then this is the book for you. I really wanted to like this book. It was a very quick read and after each chapter I just kept hoping that Piccoult could find some way to reel me in and make me a fan. Sadly this does not happen. It feels as though the book has trouble stringing the characters together or even giving reasons for their existance. There is no payoff for any character, just misery all around. As the book ends, you are supposed to feel proud of Cassie's strength, but you really just continue to feel weakness and pity. It was just too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing....","review":"Jodi Picoult came highly recommended to me from a book editor friend and so I ran to the store to pick up \\"Picture Perfect\\". What a waste! The writing was very choppy and non-sensical at times. In addition, I found it very difficult to believe any of the characters. The ending was quick, lame and overall anti-climatic. It left me feeling like, \\"I wasted all this time reading this for what?\\". I'm not sure about the other Jodi Picoult books, but this one makes me not even want to waste any time reading the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"so so","review":"I honestly just never got really captured by this one. The writing was beautiful, just nothing that made me put it down and go \\"now that was good\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I am a great fan of Picoult but was very dissappointed with this book. I list The Pact as my favorite book followed by a few of her earlier titles but this book was a total bore. I would have put it down if it was not for the author. I kept thinking this has to get better but it never did. Save your time and skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abuse","review":"An old problem, no social economic divide, affects us all. Jodi does it again hits the heart and mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get to the point please","review":"I am a huge Picoult fan, and when I bought this book it actually made it's way through three friends before I got to read it myself. I did not like this book at all. It's an important topic, yes, but it's been done, and in not much different stlye then say, Sleeping with the Enemy, minus the killing, add in the Hollywood scene. It was frightfully long, and I just kept thinking, okay Jodi we get the point he's abusive, he's a tortured soul...don't torture me for it. She could have cut about 100 pages from the book, truly. There was a lot of filler, and unimportant events, and then too many beatings....we get the point already.However, I give Picoult credit for her understanding of a situation a lot of women are in, staying with an abuser, blaming themselves. Picoult is a MASTER at building her characters, and while I didn't appreciate the story much, or find it new, or in intriguing, her characters ALWAYS are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Page 36","review":"This book has been a waste of my time and money. I made it to page 36 (after two attempts) and that's as far as I'm going to go.I've not read any other books by Picoult; I hear good things all the time. I guess I just picked the wrong one to start with, because Picture Perfect is not enjoyable at all.The writing is both dull and overly dramatic. The whole situation is rather soap opera-esque and unbelievable. Very, very slow.Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"I found myself not liking Cassie at all. Every time Alex hurt her, she said it was \\"her fault\\". For a woman who was so smart and independent before she met Alex, she surely must have taken a Stupid Pill after the wedding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even start reading this one...it doesn't get any better","review":"Read all the other one-star reviews. They say it very well. I trudged through half of this book & skipped to the last two chapters, only mildly curious as to how it would end. No surprise there. They have reissued this book with a picture of a yellow dress with a green field in the background -- similar to cover pictures on her newer books. Don't be fooled. This was copywritten in 1995. Luckily for her fans, and I am one, her later offerings improved immensely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate Author's Style of Writing","review":"I don't want to say Picoult's books aren't good, but I find the style of writing very frustrating. She goes back and forth and takes forever to get to the point. The books are so long that afterwhile, it's hard to maintain interest. I finally just flipped to the ending and ended it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd Picoult","review":"By 'odd,' I don't mean Jodi Picoult is odd, she is my favorite leisure reading author for the past 2 or 3 years and I have read almost all of her books. What I mean is that the voice in this book is a voice that is so different than hers that it almost does not seem like one of her books. I am not complaining about her writing in a different voice; I think her flexibility in voice across her books is generally a positive characteristic of her books, in fact. I just found this voice somewhat distant and the story jumbled, like she had a hard time for whatever reason taking the emotional perspective of her characters in this book. However, as I said, I really enjoy most of her books so do not let this negative review detract from reading her books in general!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Picture Perfect","review":"This novel met all my expectations of the genius offered by Jodi Picoult. The psychology behind always having to be 'picture perfect' is shown with great insights.I'm an avid fan.Irene"},{"rating":"2","title":"another Jodi Picoult book","review":"This was not my favorite book by Jodi Picoult. I think I felt annoyance at Cassie. But all in all it is a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par with her others","review":"I struggled with this book. I just could not get into it. I have read Nineteen Min, Handle with Care, The Pact, Salem Falls, My sisters Keeper.... and this was by far the biggest disappointment. Hard to get into for me..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly Entertaining, Completely Unrealistic","review":"This book was readable and somewhat compelling in that I wanted to know what would happen next. However, the narrative was ridiculous in its depiction of the character's lives. A UCLA professor who seems to have all kinds of free time for attending events with her famous movie star husband? It reinforces the stereotype of college professors having an easy job that doesn't require any more time than giving lectures (with apparently no preparation), going on sabbatical whenever they feel like it, and traveling to exotic places to do research. That was just one of the silly descriptions in this very silly book. I had to work to suspend my disbelief long enough to finish it. It was like watching a soap opera - a guilty pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"filthy language","review":"This is my first Jodi Picoult novel and it will be my last. Although more interesting than the ones I read decades ago, this is basically a simple romance novel. Despite the interesting info on anthropology, the film industry and Native Americans, it is the same plot: boy meets girl, boy struggles, boy gets girl in the end. Along the way we are assaulted with filthy language and terribly violent images, not to mention sexual explicity. Why a young woman would want to ruin a nice story (mostly) with nastiness is beyond me. I'm just glad I borrowed this from my local library rather than waste any money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I only gave this two stars because it kept me reading - but ????? This is not like any other Jodi Picoult book I have read. This is a trashy dime-store romance novel. What a letdown from an author who has written some excellent reads. Do not waste your time. Can I get the hours of my life back that I spent reading this trash?"},{"rating":"1","title":"her other books are so much better","review":"I have read two other books from picoult that are absolutely astonishing. I went to a book store looking for a book from her that did not land you in court system because I was getting sick of reading about judges and court. Well i chose this book and wish I did not. I've started it about four times and still am getting so bored and putting it down. I'm going to finish it but I hope non of her other books are like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"This book is the literary equivelent of a video game. Although fans of soap operas may enjoy it, this novel is so far fetched it lacks any sort of credibility. All it needs is a swash-buckling, over-muscled pirate clutching a flame-haired, raven eyed damsel (or is it raven haired, flame eyed? I forget...)on the deck of a ship during a violent thunderstorm. Oh, well, maybe on her next novel...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"This book was nothing but painful to try and get through. Though I sometimes enjoy Jodi Picoult's writing, Picture Perfect was extremely far fetched and simply unbelievable. I spent a lot of time rolling my eyes, shaking my head, thinking...come on, give me a break. I stopped the torture about 60% of the way through, giving up the hope that I had indeed wasted 10.46.Pretentious, unbelievable, boring, pathetic story line...save yourself the money and the torture..pass this Jodi Picoult novel by."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed in quality","review":"I expected Very Good Conditon, not got the opposite! This book was very worn & yellow. VERY DISAPPOINTED!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fast service","review":"Book was shipped fast, but would have appreciated it being wrapped in a box or bubble wrap as corners were rounded, but perhaps they were that way before shipping so wrapping in paper might not have been the problem. Otherwise, book arrived fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"First book by this author, not sure I'd read another","review":"To sum things up, this book could have been cut in half (at least!) and gotten the same point across. I almost gave up on this book a few times, but for some reason kept reading. The ending was okay but everything leading up to it was long-winded. This was my first book by Jodi Picoult and I honestly don't think I would read another by her, sorry to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read again by Jodi!","review":"I was hesitant to read this one, although I've read all of her other books (and loved all of them). I felt I couldn't connect, what with the subject matter and it having to deal with a celebrity type romance. I couldn't put it down though. I loved how the story unfurled, slowly, letting the readers get a real inside look at how this happens and how a smart, professional woman could even let this happen. People always think, \\"that would never happen to me\\" or \\"she's foolish for staying.\\" This is a fabulous portrayal of how a woman could indeed get sucked into this sick cycle. It was wound in with excellent and detailed settings, vivid characters, and excellent Lakota Sioux Indian tales woven throughout with surprising character twists. I loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great characters","review":"Jodi has always been able to bring characters to life and has certainly done so here. We are allowed to see into the main character and even understand other characters as well. Very nicely done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously, save me from this book","review":"I am a Jodie Picoult fan yet am finding this book an arduous literary sleeping pill. Seriously, I am in the 4th quadrant of the book and Cassie is now going to the indian reservation with the cop. Arghhh, someone please email me and tell me what happens so I don't have to read the rest of this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, unrealistic, and all over the place","review":"I had high hopes for this book, but it lost me in the first few chapters. There wasn't one likable character in the entire book. I thought much of it too far fetched to even be in the realm of believable. Between Indians, Africa, Anthropolgy, Hollywood, Maine, and the Bayou, there was just too much going on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and thought provoking...","review":"This is my third Jodi Picoult book, the first was \\"Plain Truth\\" which I found completely amazing and engrossing. It's difficult for me to explain exactly why I love this author so much - because it's sometimes an inner battle to even read her stories, because the topics are often painful or disturbing. But that's what makes her so good - and although I am admittedly an \\"escapist\\" reader who usually reads just for entertainment - reading this was still pure pleasure. A few other reviewers complained about implausibility in this story; I enjoyed the presentation of characters who were very diverse and accomplished, yet still flawed in such basic ways. I also enjoyed the method she uses in this story, the piecing together of the character's past in flashbacks. Good imagery, interesting characters, a great ending. Definitely worth reading, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacklustre","review":"I didn't like this story at all. I didn't like any of the characters. Cassie in particular irritated me. She ad no endearing features for me. The story development was poor. Themes were introduced throughout the book that went nowhere, or had no real relevance or depth. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than her best","review":"There is WAY TOO MUCH going on in this story..Hollywood glamour, Indian mythology, Anthropology, Domestic violence...rates down with romance novels. This is definately not the author's best. I am thinking of giving up on it. A BIG disappointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Horses? this book is for you!","review":"I loved this book. The photographs are spectacular. The writer brings you up close and personal to her adventure with horses. I will share this book and then re-read it and enjoy it all over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed the quotes and the photos","review":"The reason I bought the book was because of the lovely quotes it contains from a variety of famous authors and poets. The photos are very nice to look at, too. It captured the way I feel about horses like no other book has before."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"This book was awesome. I think this book is good for someone who dreams of having a horse or already has horses. It would appeal to the young and the old. Awesome photography and the DVD was done well. Lots of beautiful horses running around in their fancy to music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book for Horse Fanatics.","review":"I just received this book and it is beautifully written and expressesthe almost inexpressible passion one can have with equines.The photos are beautiful , if not, breathtaking. Bravo to a realgem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Book and Video","review":"I purchased this book for my daughter - and avid horsewoman. We loved the video and the beautiful photography. The text and the quotes inside are an added bonus to this wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once again the pro critics are dumb","review":"The title of my review says it all. This is not a great film, but no worse than any sitcom or tv drama that wins an emmy. If you like trashy romance/i wanna be a star flicks, this will not disappoint. Watch it, enjoy, and to hell with the critics--or at least to the valley with 'em."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gives mediocrity a bad name","review":"This film has nothing but one great song (with at least one lousy one) and a pretty good title. None of the performances are memorable. Get ready to see some chick staring at a pill bottle, because that is repeated repeatedly. There is more filler than in a Thanksgiving turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Simply boring is about all I have to say. I was so glad when it was over. Throughout the whole movie I struggled to figure out what the point of this movie even was. The singing made me cringe. Overall it was just bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic in every way!","review":"What can I say? This was a very controversial look at the Hollywood drug scene in the 60's. Watching Sharon Tate always gives me an uneasy feeling, though, just because of the thought of what happened to her a year later. The story does pull you in & makes you sympathize with every character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valley of the dolls","review":"The film was excellent and I would highly recommend it. It was received in a timely manner and in great condition. I would recommend both the film and the seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who sang for Patty Duke?","review":"I have been a fan of this film since it came out, and have all of Patty Duke's lp's in my collection. The rumor is that someone sang for her in this film. Well, if they did WHO??? It sounds just like Patty. Anyone have an answer? the newwly released DVD is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For Repeated Viewing Only","review":"I remember my first time watching this film. I was in complete awe during the first 30 minutes as to how this film was ever made. And by the end I was literally hysterical enjoying it not for what it was intended (scandalous drama!), but for what it actually was: the most memorable funny movie I have ever seen. It was then I realized I must be gay as how else could I appreciate this cinematic masterpiece? A MUST see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guilty Pleasure","review":"Believe it or not, the film is a considerably sanitized version of the famous novel, but both have one thing in common: they are extremely entertaining trash-wallows. Valley of the Dolls is perfect \\"guilty pleasure\\" viewing for a midnight gathering of hairdressers, vintage clothing merchandizers, hard-core feminists, and female impersonators... especially if every one has had a few drinks before you plunk it into the VCR!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as watching the movie","review":"Valley of the Dolls is a classic movie, one of my favorites. Listening to the CD is as good as watching the movie. I found myself singing along to all the songs and picturing in my mind the movie scenes as each song began. It is classic camp and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves this trashy but good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The great Dukian paradox","review":"How is it that the brilliant child actress of \\"The Miracle Worker\\" could have grown up to give the single worst performance by a famous actress in a major Hollywood film in \\"Valley of the Dolls\\"? Although the movie is almost too painfully bad to be funny, it might be worth your time to see it for every moment that Patty Duke is onscreen (especially if you're an aspiring actress yourself--you can take notes, and then throw them away). And don't drink anything during the incomparable \\"Boobies!\\" scene or it will come out your nose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Valley Of the No-Talents","review":"If overacting is worth an award, this film should receive all of them. Patty Duke screeches she is Neely O'Hara--and I want to run for earplugs. Somehow Susan Hayward--a great actress--got talked into being in this mess. Did she need money? Barbara Parkins is pretty, but she delivers her lines as if half-asleep. If it is fun to watch a bad film that was made in all seriousness and sincerity, then have a good time with this one. Even Dionne Warwick get into the act as she sings moronic title song that was, incredibly enough, a big hit. Budding film makers should watch this movie; then they will know what pitfalls to avoid in their own careers."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE ORIGINAL RELEASE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS.","review":"THIS DVD IS A CHOPPED UP VERSION OF THE ORIGINAL THEATRE RELEASE OF THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS. I HATE WHAT THEY DID TO THIS MOVIE.THEY HAVE TRIED TO MAKE IT A LIGHT COMEDY BUT THE ORIGINAL MOVIE WAS MORE SERIOUS. THE QUESTION I ASK IS WHY DID THEY ALTAR THIS MOVIE? THEY NEED TO RELEASE THE ORIGINAL MOVIE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible disappointment","review":"The movie is a disappointment. I was prepared for bad acting but I was not prepared for the frequent deviations from the storyline in the book. This movie is not representative of the wonderful Jaqueline Susann novel that I enjoyed. In the movie Jennifer loves Tony Polar and Tony Polar does not have the mind of a child and Anne loves her mother. Obviously this was not the case in the book. These things may seem subtle but this is the trend of the entire movie. The characters personalities are different and nothing is improved as a result. I would not recommend buying this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"This terrible movie has singing! Bad singing, and lots of it! Overacted, trite, and BORING! All those good reviews, I thought it would be campy and cool, but it's NOT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I enjoy the movie only because Sharon Tate is in it (although Parkins and Duke were good as well, being the main characters). The subject matter is interesting, how fame destroys lives, but the way the movie was done was like a cheesy soap opera.Watching this next to the ladies' other works, you can understand why Sharon didn't care much for this movie.I don't like this movie that much because it does not stick to the book at all. I understand books and movies differ from each other but it gets rather confusing with VOTD because characters that were in the book were omitted from the movie and there were things those omitted characters said in the book that were put in another character's mouth in the movie. It's all very confusing.The ending is vastly different in the movie than from the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valley Of The Dolls","review":"I saw this movie many years ago and again last year on television. I enjoyed it so much I just had to order it when I saw it was available through Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book instead","review":"Don't waste your time on this movie, it doesn't even hold a slight candle to the book, the moive doesn't give you time to realate to the characters and goes by so fast you don't even realize what's going on. The only good thing that all the actress were good for the roles but they had a poorly written script to work with...if you want to know about Valley of the Dolls read the book ...that lets you relate to the charcters and it's well written and nothing is rushed."},{"rating":"2","title":"movie","review":"i bought this movie for my daughter. she read the book and loved and wanted to watch the move. she was very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"A blockbuster film that is still socially relevant.","review":"This film has everything Hollywood looks for in a 'rags to riches' kind of story and everything the public likes in a celebrity scandal . 'Dolls' is seedy and glamorous, taudry and tender and just a little left of center in the acting department. There were times I laughed when the film was attempting to be serious and more than a couple of times when I realized how spot on this show is about the entertainment business. Love, ambition, drugs and sex make for a great backdrop for Sharon Tate's vapid character, Barbara Parkins obtuse character and Patty Dukes reality-show-like bad acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd can't live without my Dolls!!!!!!","review":"When it comes to pure 60's camp, you can't get any better than this! The story follows three women that aspire to be more than they are and how they fall into the world of drugs. I recommend this for it's pure entertainment and dramatic interpretation of drugs use in showbiz.Sparkle Neely!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Bad You Can't Stop Watching","review":"It was inevitable that Jacqueline Susann's compilation of typingwould be made into a movie. It turned out so bad even she hatedit and she had a bit part. Patty Duke's career nearly died afterthis one. Who can't stop laughing as she is crawling around onthe streets. And her scene in the nuthouse with Toni Scotti isone of the greatest hoots in screen history. Barbara Parkins fadedinto obscuritiy and we all know what happend to Sharon Tate.Only Susan Hayward as the Ethel Merman prototype, Helen Lawson, isany good but her scenes are limited. She is dubbed by MargaretWhiting. This is the type of stuff that the E Channel is full ofand we just can't help ourselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"God-awful music and false eyelashes galore!","review":"If you're planning on taking this one seriously, don't bother watching it. My husband DESPISED it. I got very tired of Dionne Warwick's infatiguable warbling, and the rest of the songs (the first half is nearly a musical) are dreadful too.If you can get past that, it's entertaining brain candy. I cracked up over Patty Duke grumbling about \\"boobies\\" and that *she* made it without any.It's over acted, mushy, and a plain bad movie, but I did get a kick out of al the 60's styles."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT ABOUT JUDY","review":"Judy Garland really should have been in this movie. She would have been incredible, as always."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turkey!","review":"A hilariously dumb and embarassing soundtrack. Dion Warrick's voice just gives me the creeps. It's soundtrack is probably worst than the film (eventhough the film is kind of fun yet trashy). I'm sour Jaquline Susanne wasn't pleased with the effort that John Williams put into the title song (but then again her novel was totally crap as well). The most bizaare thing about this soundtrack is that it was actually nominated for an Acadamy Award, I reckon that it should have earned a Golden Turkey instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, campy throw-back to the 60's and the wicked ways of show business! Watch Patty Duke's beads when she sings!","review":"The most unintentionally funny movie about the road to fame and fortune. So bad, it's good. Wish they had a soundtrack available for it (maybe they do) because the songs are as laughable as the dialogue. Great camp and has been imitated, but never duplicated. There is only one Valley of the Dolls!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Bad It's Good","review":"I have to agree with Reviewer #1, this is one of the worst movies ever made; and yet, like a 30-car pile up on the freeway, it's impossible not to watch. WAY over the top performances by Patty Duke, Susan Hayward, Lee Grant (and just about everyone else), eerie, rare appearance by Sharon Tate, great title song sung by Dionne Warwicke, wild sixties fashions, cheesy dialogue (my favorite: \\"There's only one star of a Helen Lawson show and that's ME, Helen Lawson, remember?\\") - it's all here. I can't wait to own it on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic TURKEY comes to DVD","review":"OH MY GOD! One of the all time worst films that is FUN to watch had finally come to DVD. This is a classic! Please remember that the novel by Jaqueline Susann is (or was) the top selling fiction book of all time. The translation to film did not work. Script, acting, directing - all is terrible & cheezy but somehow the film is kinda fun. Maybe because it is about Hollywood! You get to watch some great stars in some embarrassing awful situations/acting. Have Fun. You may want to rent it first to see if it is your cup of tea, but I am definitely adding it to my already large DVD collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU GOTTA SEE THE FILM FIRST....TRUST ME","review":"To fully enjoy this soundtrack, you have to be able to visualize the scene(s). Mainly, because, the lyrics of the songs \\"I'll plant my own tree\\", \\"Come live with me\\", \\"It's impossible\\" and the other Patty Duke song will just seem really empty and stupid (which they are, but, they work in the context they were meant). Now, don't get me wrong, I spent 20 years waiting for this to come out....and I LOVE IT. However, it only makes the 4 out of 5 stars, because, it truly is incomplete without the Dionne Warwick title track. It opens the movie, and therefore, should open the CD. Overall, it is a perfect 60's time piece. But, remember, see the movie first, and you'll be hooked....trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"As a product, the tape arrived and is in excellent condition. As to Valley Of The Dolls, it is what it is -= simply a good flick to watch - I think Sharon Tate is amazing beautiful and it is hard to realize that someone that beautiful and spirited came to such a heinous end. Patty Duke is excelent as is Barbara Parkins - stunning is simply the best word for her beauty in this film. Long flick but worth the time to watch. I think it is a more realistic picture of Hollywood than most present."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie classic!","review":"Very daring subject for the time it was made. A movie that can watched and enjoyed many times over. Stunning performances from Patty Duke and the late Sharon Tate. The quinessential movie soap opera with a desperate theme."},{"rating":"2","title":"My doctor says I'm self-destructive. So what!?","review":"The movie is what it is. It works on 60s melodrama level and for camp value. It claims to have been cutting edge for it's time. So what!? I'm watching (and loving) it NOW."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Broadway doesn't go for BOOOOZE and DOPPPPE...\\"","review":"When Patty Duke is in the asylum bathtub(with her body covered with canvas and just her noggin sticking out)she is hysterical screaming at the nurse, \\"Whaddya lookin' at??!!\\" Her performance as pill-popping, booze-swilling Neely is the centerpiece of a dynamite camp classic, plush and full of pomp, with every sour note in place. Sharon Tate looks cautious and scared as a showgirl, only getting her ire up after meeting a sleazy movie producer (played by an unknown actor with an hysterical 'French' accent). Barbara Parkins is the novice New York secretary who climbs the ranks awfully fast, but her big Bambi eyes and whispery voice are attractive. Not for the squeamish, the film is full of ribald exchanges and several silly scenes(like Parkins in the ocean getting seaweed in her mouth!). But if you're curious, \\"Dolls\\" will no doubt entertain."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best campy films EVER!","review":"This film was panned by the press when it came out in 1967, but it still was a big him.Over the years it's become one of the greatest \\"Good Bad Films\\" of all time along with \\"Mommie Dearest\\".What I can never understand is why \\"I'll Plant a Tree\\" was not awarded Best Song?Oh that picky snobby Academy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Trash, but awesome, but a \\"important\\" question","review":"I have to admit that I love \\"Dolls\\" but have to confess that it is pure trash, and only for those who can really enjoy the satire of it.It's awesome Fox is finally releasing this classic, but I have an important question...with all the extras and such on this 2 disc set..what about \\"widescreen\\". This was a Panavision film, so I sure hope Fox does the right thing and puts this SE out in that format...does anyone have, or can find out, anything relating to this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually, i liked it!","review":"The first time i saw this my better half wanted t owatch it so we sat down and for a few hours i laughed at a movie that was supposed to be serious but was so campy it was funny. Three women Barbra perkins(a secretary), patty duke (a singer/movie star, and sharon tate (a model) all try to make it in the world and all three resort to drugs. my better half loves jackie suzann books, and although Jackie's books are not my favorites i would still give them a chance. ther e are so many over the top scenes. my favorites had to be the sanitarium with patty duke and the catfight between patty duke and susan hayward ( i was laughign so hard) \\"meow\\". i also think the music score is nice no to mention the title song which i like sung by dionne warwick.its one of those movies you can sit and watch and not have to think. another movie that is funn but not intentionally is mommie dearest which i have also watched countless times over the years. rent or buy this video! campy and hilarious!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, but terrible","review":"How can you rate this 5 stars when it is so ridiculously bad? This has been ridiculed for years, but it's become a cult favorite with gays. Yes, it's still entertaining, in an over-the-top way. But unless you are a fan of overacting, then you may be less than enthralled. Patty Duke is the most overdone. She plays the Lindsey Lohan of 1966, as a 26-year-old Broadway star who gets drugged up. The late Sharon Tate comes off best as the no-talent who uses her body for \\"nudie\\" films. Barbara Payton, then the hottest one of all from the TV series \\"Peyton Place,\\" has since been forgotten, and she plays the most straight-laced. Even for the late 60s, this was an old-fashioned film, but they tried to appeal to kids with then-risque topics. It is quite silly. Some people know every word of this thing.

I finished it in 2 days, couldn't put it down! Even in today's standards, the backstabbing and nasty characters keep your interest very high! I was so excited to rent the movie as the storyline is so wicked. All that's presented is supposedly what some call campy but is really just stupid. 'All About Eve', John Waters movies -now THAT's campy. This Valley of the Dolls has to be the worst adaption of a novel of all time! Please Hollywood - make a remake for the novel's 40th anniversary in 2006. Jude Law can be the hot Brit Lyon Burke, Jennifer Lopez as voluptuous Jennifer, Natalie Portman as Anne Wells? And bring back all the characters in the novel - how about Allen Cooper and Gino? And maybe develop the characters through the years like the novel does.

I'm older now and the only way I'd watch it again is at the point of a gun. Maybe that's what hell is: being forced to watch movies such as Valley of the Dolls throughout eternity.The plot is vapid. The acting is poor and outdated. When it was released the movie was a pot-boiler intended to titillate the sexual extremities. Even that has been bypassed with time.On the other hand, evidently a lot of people love this movie. My man-hater ex-sister-in-law thought it was great, back when it was newly released, though my thoughtful, intelligent, mature ex-wife agreed with me about it. I suspect it qualifies as a 'chick flick' these days.

The text is accompanied by low resolution black and white images of the use of gymnasium equipment and the real-life adventures of the NinJew. Author Richard Walters has promoted his book via a campaign of [...] Friend Requests.The workout and nutritional information are well-founded and easy to follow, but there are plenty of easier-to-use books on the market. The adventure is just weird beyond belief, and the text is smattered with references to G-d and his great Omnimax theater. If you in author Richard Walters's inner circle of friends and family, this is probably a wickedly funny book, but as an outsider, well, I am just baffled.

When I clicked on the button to slow the speed of the dialogue, the sound was distorted. It's a shame that the software has these errors, because otherwise, it is a very good program.

The tramp tells him of gold--gold hidden somewhere in the mountains far away, and gives Charles vague directions. So Charles quits his job and goes in search of the hidden gold. But he finds more than he bargained for, including a mad professor, raging grizzly bears, and the torture-loving Apache Indians.I recommend all of Joseph Altsheler's books, although Apache Gold is one of my favorites.

He is basically a ruthless criminal played by Nils Asher. Apparently there were no Asian actors in Hollywood in 1933. He falls in love with Megan immediately. But it is unrequited. She is conflicted & may be falling for him. He is very charming. Those look like real tears streaming down Megan's cheek in one close-up. For our time, it's a bit racist.

What an incredible love story it is...and it's not one of those books that you read once, and then put back on the shelf, never to be taken down again, either. It is one which you can read again and again, and each time you do, it is as new as when you FIRST read it. It is one of those few novels that retain innocent romantic dialog, and yet it is intriguingly poetic and beautiful beyond words.

However, since this book WAS written before Gloria Steinem, I'm willing to overlook that. Besides Maugeritte, the characters are wonderful, especially Percy, and the novel is very suspenseful.

Read something else, like Tom Jones, where there are atleast Cliff Notes or a Movie about it. Maybe because everyone here has given this book 4 and 5 stars, it seems I have no clue what I'm talking about. I tried to give it a chance, but I simply could not follow the reading.

The book is written in that dry, stale, matter-of-fact style people were \\"supposed\\" to write in back in that day. Instead of describing excitement & espionage, this book is more like an Ed Wood film: the writer talks about exciting things supposedly happening, but no excitement occurs. We're just supposed to assume there's adventure. Aside from the constant boredom, only an idiot wouldn't know who the Scarlet Pimpernel was by about page 20. Since it's so obvious, all the mystery is killed from the outset. From what I understand, the novel was never as popular as the play. I guess people didn't just stand around talking about exciting things happening in the play, but actually showed them taking place. If you're up one night & can't get to sleep, read this book.

But to a modern reader, the book's age is apparent on every page. The central mystery of the book (the identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel) is obvious well before it is revealed.

The thoughts and concerns of the main character (Marguerite) are plain, without nuance or complexity, and by the end I was gritting my teeth every time she was described as \\"the cleverest woman in Europe.\\" The book's first sentence is great, and the first chapter is very good, but it's downhill from there.

Personally I'd been dreading this book for a while but I must read every book on my bookshelf and I finally picked it up. I'm not sorry that I did because everytime I set it down I longed to be reading it again. The story just takes off with an opening of the daring Scarlet Pimpernel's ingenius ideas of helping the French nobility escape and then rapidly becomes an intriguing tale of danger, loyalty, deceit, and romance. It's complete with twists and turns and a remarkably surprising ending. :) Enjoy this book. I know I will read it again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Entertaining","review":"THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL WAS FIRST A PLAY, THEN A BOOK, IN WHICH FORM IT HAS BEEN IN PRINT SINCE 1905, WHICH, IF LONGEVITY IS THE TEST, MAKES IT A CLASSIC. HOWEVER, NO ONE COULD MISTAKE IT FOR A MASTERPIECE. WRITTEN BY AN EXILED HUNGARIAN ROYAL, Baroness Emma Orczy, THE STORY IS AN HISTORICAL ADVENTURE STORY TAKING PLACE DURING THE REIGN OF TERROR A FEW YEARS AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. IT IS A SLIGHT TALE, AND A LOT OF FUN TO READ. THE CHARACTERS ARE ONE DIMENSIONAL AND EXAGGERATED: THE VILLAINS ARE ESPECIALLY EVIL, AND THE HEROES ARE ESPECIALLY HEROIC. THERE IS CONTINUOUS ACTION, WHICH MAKES THIS BOOK FUN, ENTERTAINING AND A NICE DIVERSION FROM SERIOUS LITERATURE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adventure, Disguise, Romance, Drama... It's all Here","review":"This story introduces us to a circle of friends in England during the French Revolution who, for the sport of it, travel to France in disguise to rescue French aristocrats from the certain death of the guillotine, right under the noses of their captors. The identity of their leader, the Scarlet Pimpernel, is a guarded secret but one that interests more and more people as more and more French aristocrats are discovered in safety in England. Constant danger, wit, romance, and adventure befall the reader at every turn.I've noticed in other reviews that people complain about the book starting out slow or gruesome or whatever. I don't remember noticing this myself, but I think any book worth reading can take a little patience in parts. Just let yourself absorb the story and give the author a chance. Don't spoil the book by watching the movies first. It's more fun to see the mystery unfold in all its subtleties and intensity in the book first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melodrama spun of gold and silver","review":"Orczy has an overheated prose style, and her characters are made of cardboard, but she managed to strike gold in this book. It's hard to tell if it was an accident or not. The sequels aren't as good - but then, they wouldn't be, would they?The Scarlet Pimpernel is an archetype. He feels as much a fictional god as Robin Hood or Sherlock Holmes. The ending (by which I mean, the last third of the book) is nail-biting. Orczy doesn't over-bake, and certainly doesn't under-bake, the suspense: for once, her natural writing style is perfect, given the structure of the plot. This is a book you'll find yourself reading in one hit; and almost before you realise what has happened to you, you'll find that you've read one or two of the sequels as well. That is probably a mistake, but what the hell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, Very, Very Good Book!!!","review":"I really enjoyed this book, and I am defiantly going to read the rest of them! This is the first of many Pimpernel stories, and it is very good. It has lovable character, wonderful twists, and a heartbreaking Love story. My mother and I both read it and Loved it!! I totally recommend it for anyone of any age I was 15 when I read it a year ago, and My mother is in her 40's, and We both loved it!!NOW THERE IS ONE THING I SHOULD WARN YOU ABOUT... The first few chapters are a little slow and you may be tempted to stop reading, but KEEP WITH IT!!!! It is so worth it!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BOOK 1ST MOVIE 2ND","review":"I was captivated by this book from the moment I began reading - I could not put it down. One of my favorites.

It almost pull you into the year 1792 \\"the year of grace\\". Above all Though it had great irony, so great it makes your mouth drop neary to the ground; above all that was the greatest aspect of the book. Although at some parts, not many at all, there was too little action, and very shappy love parts, not enough to destory the plot as so happens in many books. If you can get over a few \\"dry\\" moment of action and a couple of shappy love parts; you will love this book. You will love this book if you like great irony also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, I was surprised.","review":"Ok. I was assigned to read this book by my teacher. I usually hate books that teachers make you read so when I got this I thought ugh how boring can you get? And as in most good books the first few chapters were incredibly boring, or so I thought. Then I really started to get into the book and soon I couldn't put it down. This is now one of my top three favorite books ranking number 2 only to Harry Potter. I recommend this book to anyone who likes action and romance stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"*YAWN*","review":"I loved the book version, but boy, the audio version was a dissapointment.

What was wrong in those years that made them uninterested in school? Had them being bored or dropping out? How did the politics make them feel? Why did they cease to care more about what had at one time been \\"their country?\\" A country where they could live and learn and were intersted in it? This kind of work can help such people by just showing that it was real, that things were going on in the background of their education that explain things that happened---like other kids taking advantage of them or stealing and no punishment ever being given. All kids in school now should read this and other books--- to understand the system they live in. This book should have been available to young kids--- to understand it wasn't all their imagination, the wrongness of certain things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drew Peterson:Untouchable","review":"Even though Rob Lowe did a nice job in his role, overall I thought the movie was pretty poor.

Il Generale Della Rovere ($29.95; Criterion) is a Roberto Rosselini film starring director Vittorio De Sica (I'm always surprised when he acts but De Sica acted in hundreds of movies). De Sica plays a con man forced by the Nazis to impersonate a general and get info from Italian prisoners. For the first time, the bum feels a twinge of conscience. Extras include interviews and a visual essay. Visit me at michaelgiltz dot com."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nasty Colonel steals the show","review":"A great film. Twists and turns, surprise ending. A fine performance by Vittorio de Sica as the hapless thief impersonating the great general. Hannes Messemer, as Colonel Muller, is brilliant - you can never really believe him, though Messemer (best known for playing the Kommandant in 'The Great Escape') gives Muller a human element that consistently leaves you not knowing whether to cheer or boo him. Yes, it's a bit dated, and like all Italian films the dubbing isn't perfect, but I found this film quite riveting. Watch it if only for Messemer (and his very good Italian!) and Rossellini's creative camera direction and use of music which, as always, is outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inner Strength","review":"1971's Inner City Blues is jazz great Grover Washington, Jr.'s debut album.

The CD is overall a pretty nice set-up. It has video, pictures, read along, and you can even record your own voice (which just confirmed how much practice I need). There are a few long passages you can listen to while watching the pictures roll by and/or while reading the words. The passages are interesting to, about The samba, and Rio de Janiero.

The leftwing worldview of the author is on display here with all the sublety of, well, an atomic blast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here","review":"I was disappointed to find nothing in this work I hadn't already read in several other Oppenheimer biographies. Dr. Cassidy seems to have taken upon himself the mantle of chief apologist for Dr. Oppenheimer, dismissing any and all evidence for his leftist connections while consistently leveling equally specious charges against his accusers. In short, if you want fresh insights into this complex personality you will be disappointed.

The plot was so loose you could hardly tell there was one. The movie dragged very much throughout. I had to fast forward some of it because I could not stand for lack of action to happen. Whoever wrote this was a terrible screen writer. The director must have been asleep. Some of the actors were really terrible. It was an offbeat movie made practically by family members. I think that might have contributed to the problem of lack of distance from the characters and loose plot. It was just terrible. I am sorry I wasted my money on this.

I cannot say there is anywhere else I would have found some of these authors recommended or reviewed. Mr. Alcalay writes with enthusiasm about authors whose literatures will never make the weekend book page. These authors are diverse in approach (poets, novelists, essayists, historians) and smart. They provide more immediate accounts of other places and states, some of the light and the heavy.

In addition to straight history, there are innumerable works of fiction, not the least of which is William Shakespeare's play.Allan Massie seems to be keenly aware that he is on heavily trodden ground, and struggles to find something new or fresh to add. He studiously avoids all the dramatic moments (most major events happen off-stage) and the result is a very slow-paced, uninvolving book. Despite the addition of much fanciful gossip about the sex lives of the famous characters, it was a struggle for me to keep reading. Fortunately, the book is short enough and Massie's writing is literate, so I did read on to the end.However, after Massie's earlier Augustus and Tiberius, which I enjoyed very much, this one falls flat and was a major disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expensive but good","review":"Name brand ink seems to work better in my printer.

If you listen to \\"Mano\\" there is reason to believe it is a response and a very strong comeback too. Excellent song in every aspect, just as the album is also.

My suggestion is - Definitely buy the game; it's great, especially if you're a fan of either of the other two games in the trillogy - but buy it at a local game retailer like Gamestop, EB Games, Game Crazy, or maybe Circuit City (not Best Buy - they overprice everything, and probably don't stock this game anyways(it's too old))."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but not much of a tool","review":"I had my reservations about purchasing this tool due to the description being a little off base......as if it was describing an electric shaver. It does not require the two AA batteries, rather, it has a rechargable power pack inside. It does not have surgical steel blades that easily cut hair. It does work okay, just okay, but for $14.00 I guess that's about how good it works. Built inexpensively and priced accordingly.

The graphics and visual experience is well done, but this is not a Latin Course. Though the Wheelocks Textbook has been very helpful as a beginner's Textbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor value, not a course","review":"I was very disappointed with this programme. It is one of the worst language programmes I have ever seen.I have studied Latin before and know many words and the basic grammar, but even I found it difficult to cope with the total immersion approach.

In short, the movie opened with a few lines of dialog as the camera flys over the ocean. Suddenly we dip beneath the waves and for the next hour and 40 all images are from underneath the water. The only sounds you hear are the film's excellent score and some occasional sound effects to enhance the scene.The film itself is broken down into sections which represent themes. Each theme is then appropriately scored by Eric Serra. Using this structure helps in the film's pacing as the theme can be scary, lighthearted, or awe inspiring.

Why does he spin the camera around like we're in the middle of a dryer ?At the half-hour mark, there was a shot reminiscent of the opening of Solyaris.

There are no flashcards or anything to help you learn that basic vocabulary. 3) Like most languages there are different forms of words depending on if they are a plural, if it is past tense, etc. e.g. mouse and mice, or was and were, or slow and slowly.

In one specific incidence, the writer states you are able to receive Holy Communion even if you have committed a mortal sin and haven't gone to confession. This is not permitted in the CCC.

Track #5 (Thunderpuss 2000 Club Anthem Mix) is almost orgasmic. Any of the songs of this single will infuse you with the power that this woman's voice conveys. The Instrumental version is also very refreshing. In synthesis, GET THIS SINGLE.

It took verses from the gospel of Thomas and discussed their meaning, put it in context, and gave you spiritual practice ideas to \\"live\\" the concepts.

It may be graphic and expressive, but it shows the artist's true feelings about this part of the female anatomy..... Nothing wrong with that.... I remember that the first time I heard the song on the radio I thought someone was singing about \\"Ülo\\". And I said to myself, a song about the famous Estonian histologist and educator, Ülo Hussar! But later I found out that the song's title was \\"Culo\\" and had nothing to do with the previously mentioned Estonian citizen. It is a refreshing song anyways, and it deserves a 4.

It's not like Jennifer's music has been good to start with anyway. I'm not a big fan of the song \\"Get Right,\\" but I love the video, so I got the dual disc. And trust me, \\"Get Right\\" is the ONLY good song on the entire album! Jennifer is not the best singer. Just listening to each song was giving me a headache. Her voice is so bland, she sings so flat, and out of tuned. If you caught the 2005 Grammy's performance with her \\"husband\\" Mark Anthony, you know what I'm talking about.I can't believe Jennifer just sat back in the studio and said, \\"Yeah, this album is TIGHT! Lets release it!\\" Let me tell you something Jennifer, \\"NO IT'S NOT!\\" Maybe J. Lo should choose different music producers. Cuz this, this isn't cuttin' it!Don't waist your money on this. Unless you are a hardcore J. Lo fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Wrong","review":"According to her official websites. Song writers claimed her vocal is stronger than ever in this album. It's just a lie. Get Right is already a wrong demonstration. A high register she can't afford. Her weakness is totally shown. Due to a healthy digital sales, it can climb high on the Billboard Hot 100, radio-play chart is already a flop! The second single 'Hold You Down' is another failure number, not to mention other more horrible tracks in the album. This whole package is a trash. Plain tracks, stupid vocal, lyrics... the last two ballads are nightmare! And there are some stolen materials here (again). Thief! 'Rebirth' is even worse than 'This Is Me...Then'Please don't cheat us money. Your videos are hot, your movies are okay, but when it comes to music...byebye!

How do you do it J. Lo? How?The answer is obvivous. If you don't know, here are some hints: chest, bra, pants, sex. Get it? Her body. Now, I'm not just blaming J. Lo, as loads of other people have done this, but none have been successful. If I had J. Lo's phone #, e-mail, or whatever, I would ask her. She'd probably say something like \\"What do you mean you don't like me? My albums have had enormous popularity on MTV. If you don't like me, I suggest you buy a ton of your favorite artist's albums, because I'm always gonna get a #1 on peak on the Billboard Hot 200.\\".Don't let her get away with it.

This album really disappoined me, and I was truly hoping that doing all that would actually better her musical talent... I'm sorry, but this only gets one star from me.Edit :: I also feel it's important to know that the lead single off of this album \\"Get Right\\" was lifted from an unreleased Usher track called \\"Ride,\\" and apparently there's another track on the album lifted from Brandy. The lack of creativity in making a living off of the ideas of others isn't very impressive at all. Who's next, JLo?"},{"rating":"1","title":"J.LO","review":"Let's be real here, J-Lo is not an artist. she's an entertainer. a glorfied back dancer at best. Her voice is simply not made for singing.

I've realize that she sound like she is complaining and whining while she's trying to sing these songs. There is no emph in this album anywhere.

I didn't like it at first listen and thought her voice was annoying, but she's just hiding it through computer vocals. She's no powerhouse but she could make an effort to work with what she does have as she did in the past. Get Right, Cherry Pie, Whatever You Wanna Do, Hold Us Down are good songs, and although this type of music is nothing new to r&b/hip hop music, it's still a nice buy.

The word \\"me\\" is the most heard lyrics of Jennifer Lopez. Very sell out word for her. I prefer her to concentrate in her acting career. She's better to be in the movies.

I was feeling get right a lot cause it's much better than that 'jenny from the block' mess she put out but the rest of the album is anything but right. The songs are weak and there are no melodies or hooks that the first 2 albums had. Maybe she should just stick to acting and continue building her acting skills instead of putting out albums. I suggest releasing a greatest hits and focusing on her acting career instead, and maybe being a backup dancer too"},{"rating":"1","title":"Even the best producers couldn't save her terrible voice!","review":"I love earlier J.Lo materials either with stronger dance beats or when she sounded like Mariah Carey's Hip-Hop songs(like her \\"I'm Real\\" remix which was inspired by Mariah Carey's \\"If We\\"). Since my friends pointed out that most of the catchy chorus in her songs was actually sung by background singers, NOT J.Lo, I really was not sure if I bought a J.Lo album or her backup's album.

Jennifer Lopez has never been an innovative artist but always manages to release a disc full of fun dance songs. This one does not deliver. \\"Get Right\\" was promising, but unfortunately there's really nothing else here that offers anything. The new single \\"Hold You Down\\" with Fat Joe is a rip-off of that other J. Lo/rapper collaboration \\"All I Have\\" with LL Cool J from the superior This Is Me...Then disc. \\"Cherry Pie\\" may not be a strong cut but is the only other song it sounds like she's having fun on.

On the 6 was a nice debut especially because of the timing with the whole latin music explosion (at the time ricky martin, enrique iglesias and marc anthony all had hot pop albums). But now it's clear she should stick to acting. She's lucky usher threw away the GET RIGHT beat because it's the only radio friendly song she has. Her 2nd cd is still the best and that's not saying much although \\"love don't cost a thing\\" will forever be a pop classic.

In my opinion she is an ok singer. This cd is ok, its a good try. Get Right is definately in my opinion the best song. The beat on tat song gets me all the time. As for all the other songs they are just ok. They arent great and dont play out to the title REBIRTH. If your a fan of Jennifer Lopez get the cd, you may enjoy it more than us who arent huge fans. For those not such a huge fan and not sure bout buying the cd but like her two hits get right and the one with fat joe, then download the songs<--- Dont get the album........"},{"rating":"1","title":"Things that make you say HMMM","review":"I bought this album hoping she would finally get the hint that listeners want some jumpy, dance music, but was I ever wrong. She has 3 tracks on the cd that I enjoy, and using the word \\"enjoy\\" is pushing it. She needs to take her music to another level, and I am thinking after her last 2 cd's that level might be...stop singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"rebirth of what? songs that suck as bad as the ones on Remix","review":"All I can say is I'm glad I paid no more than 3 dollars for this album. I have all of Jennifer Lopez's albums and most of her decent movies and videos. If you like Hip Hop, you will probably like this album, but I rather her pop and ballad style songs like on the \\"J.Lo\\", \\"This is Me Then\\", and most of \\"On the 6.\\" The only songs I liked were \\"Cherry Pie\\"- it has a very energetic upbeat style and (Can't Believe) This is Me, as it is done more in her previously mentioned style. \\"Get Right\\" is horribly sing-songy and will stick in your head more than \\"It's a Small World\\" and if you've been on that Disneyworld ride- you know exactly what I mean. And in case you didn't get enough of \\"Get Right\\" as the first song, it's also the last song on the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"you sound like a dog jho","review":"DUMMYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY who thought of the concept for this album who ever did they need to get donald trump up there and say your fired because this album sounds like a gay brintey spears cd you made me cry because your voice was just off track so i therw the cd away my mom got mad son i spent 1299 on acd that sounded like a sick dog everone who has these cd throw it away"},{"rating":"1","title":"stick to acting jenny","review":"j lo never made solid albums, she was always a singles artist who released the strong tracks from her albums and made the rest filler material. Rebirth is no exception to this. She should focus on her acting career and dance skills much more than music. I appreciate her trying to do a little bit of everything but lets face it, she never had a good voice, she just had some nice r&b/hip hop flavoured singles that made her popular but at the end of the day she still can't sing great though she could move and has put out some decent movies"},{"rating":"1","title":"a bit better than this is me but still not great","review":"Get Right was a great first single despite j lo's weak vocals, very catchy dance music!

Yes, I will give credit, some of the songs will make you dance, but still, this is boring and gets tiring after a while.J-Lo fans should be happy. Others not so much. The only thing I have to say is if J-Lo thinks this album is going to pull her out of the tailspin her career has taken, she better think again."},{"rating":"1","title":"rebirth? more like the death of her music career","review":"Get Right is the only okay song that is a party banger, the rest really sucks and has too much sampling and weak vocals.

She gets the kind of cuts that Mariah,Whitney,Christina should be getting but can't.i always got the feeling that music for her was a Hobby&If it worked than cool.Her Producers&Modern Technilogy have been able to create some catchy slick Material that has worked&at a time or two I have dug a few things,but being on the real it's still all about the Visual with me when i think of J-LO. splices of the tracks& on mute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rebirth? More like DOA","review":"I remember Jennifer Lopez as an actress, specifically in Steven Soderbergh's \\"Out of Sight\\". When she's with the right director, Lopez is more than just a competent actress. When she's with the right music producer, Lopez's singing voice is merely acceptable. The songs on Rebirth know how to make the most of her limited vocal range and the sound is always sleek, bouncy, hip-hop flavored, ballad-ready, and R&B friendly; in other words there's a little something for everyone. Not that covering every possible market demographic is such a bad thing, but Lopez needs to be careful that she's not diluting her persona for the almighty buck. It seems that Rebirth does exactly that and though there are some pretty good tracks like \\"Get Right\\", \\"Step into My World\\" and \\"Cherry Pie\\", Rebirth for the most part is stillborn."},{"rating":"1","title":"thank god for music 'cause she can not","review":"....sing. please jen,jlo,jenny o whatever stick with the food the booty shots anything but the singing. i wish i had listen to this before i purchased but i thought it had to be good..girlfriend got over ben got married doing things..not. dont but this listen to whatever they play on the radio if that happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"She needs to grasp the idea that she can't sing!","review":"It astonishes me that some people actually can't listen to this painful, nail on chalkboard CD and actually give it more than one star!

She needs to spend some of that undeserved bling bling on some singing lessons than her skimpy outfits. All the songs on this album are totally unlistenable! She completely lacks power, vocal range and versatility. Jennifer Lopez represents everything that is wrong with music today. She gets a recording contract because her good looks and success with her acting career. Just because your a great actor/actress doesn't necessarily mean you can sing, too. Some actors/actresses were able to achieve it, but not Jennifer Lopez. She needs to quit the music business while she still can. Please stick to acting...OH, WAIT! I forgot, she can't do that either!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pirated Music","review":"Now, everyone who has heard \\"The Roof\\" from Mariah's multi-platinum Butterfly album, have been taken by surprise. The official remix for Jennifer Lopez's song \\"Hold you down\\" sounds exactly like Mariah's 1997 hit. \\"Hold You Down\\" is using the same sample used on Mariah's song. \\"The Roof\\" contains a replay of \\"Shook Ones\\", which was written by A. Johnson and K. Muchita.In January, he listened to Lopez's \\"new\\" song \\"Get Right\\", which was exactly the same song he had recorded. According to Female First, Usher declared, \\"I hate it, but I'd better get some of the publishing rights or else. I didn't put it on my album because I couldn't get it right. But I didn't expect J.Lo to just take it.\\" Usher and his producer, Rich Harrison, are still trying to find a solution to the issue.The funny story here is that Jennifer Lopez launched two songs in a row using ideas from two previously released songs - by other artists, of course."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHE SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN BORN!!!","review":"This album sucks! The only song that I think is OK....is \\"Cherry Pie.\\" I hate \\"Get Right\\" those annoying horns over and over and over! And she stole that beat from USHER!

She is so jellous of Mariah Carey. I love Mariah Carey, \\"It's like that\\" is awesome. Mariah can actually sing. I don't think JLO should go on tour because she will be lipsinging the entire time.

One listen to that flat, nasally voice, and you'll want to chuck the cd in the trash.This is a good example of why the music industry is making less profit. It's not because of p2p file sharing.

HORRIBLE!!!","review":"Jennifer Lopez has a very weak voice. Yet the originality of her songs have been pretty decent... until now. I couldn't stomach finishing any of the songs on here. Here are two excellent reasons why Jennifer Lopez should quit while she's behind:1) Two of the songs on \\"Rebirth\\" were stolen from more-talented artists who chose not to release them on their albums (Get Right is a girl-version of Usher's \\"Ride\\", and \\"Ride or Die\\" is a screwed-up version of Brandy's \\"I'll Do Anything\\");2) She wrecked a classic (\\"Hold You Down\\" sampled Shirley Murdock's \\"As We Lay\\") with weak lyrics and uneventful melodies;Her entire album is fluff. The lyrics are extremely repetitive, she has run out of things to say, and there's only so much you can do with a weak voice with a limited range, even with the best producers. It's best that she just gives up and returns to acting (the only thing she can perform decently...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually no stars! Her worst yet, if that is possible.","review":"Music is my passion, most all genres. Jennifer better hold on to Mark and hope that some of his talent for singing rubs off on her.

Instead, we get \\"Rebirth,\\" with cheesy arrangements and cheesier vocals. The first single entitled \\"Get Right\\" not only showcases Lopez's weak register, but the singer's inability to find a sound to hold her diminishing audience. She should have stayed with the latin flavor of \\"On the 6th\\" because the music compensated for what she lacked in talent. Overall, this album was a serious disappointment and would not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!..

Not one song on this album sounded like she even had control of her voice. It sucked. The lyrics were horrible to. She just repeated the same thing over and over without really any purpose to the song. JLO needs to stick to acting not ACTING LIKE SHE CAN SING. With the CD being titled REBIRTH you think that she would have had alot better songs but she didn't. Her title had nothing to do with her cd. It should have been called \\"ALL READY DONE.\\" Cuz nothing on this album was new. Even the song with Fat Joe is so similar to the one she did with LL Cool J on \\"This is me then.\\" I heard no vocal range on any tracks. Most of the time there was something else drowning out her voice. i.e. the horns and the background singers. JLO really needs to stick to acting and stop ACTING LIKE SHE IS A SINGER. Don't waiste your money on this poor quality CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh. Horrific.","review":"I suffered through this CD twice just to give it a chance. The first song is \\"ok\\" and the pseudo-latin flavor is nice at times, but this is one bad CD, even for the clubs. She has such a horribly thin voice and the music isn't fun because it's too dumb for even that.I really don't like this CD; however, I can see with certain tastes that some folks might enjoy it for background music or just dancing. Don't expect to enjoy it too much if you're looking for anything artful, emotional, or beautiful because this CD is void of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"More than a Rebith...a Death","review":"Jenny has die as a singer...This cd is bad.Just GET RIGHT is good and maybe \\" CHERRY PIE\\", the rest is crap...Sorry Jenny, best luck next time.

I am amazed at the amount of bad reviews people gave for this album, but I'm not a veteran J.Lo fan.\\"Rebirth\\" is fun, funky, and gets me dancing. Some of the songs are kind of hokey. They're the type of songs I would expect to find on an Ace of Base album. No disrespect to Ace of Base because I like them too, but the lyrics get pretty cheesy sometimes. They are the type of songs you memorize and sing along to in the car.In any event, if you haven't listened an album by J.Lo before, you'll enjoy this one very much. It's a nice blend of what you would expect, like dance songs, coupled with really nice r & b slow songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let By Gones Be By Gones","review":"It's Over, Girl.

When I want to see how hot Jennifer Lopez is, I use my eyes. I watch her videos and films.

And although she may follow the rules of any other pop-star, she falls flat on her back.Tracks like \\"Step into my world\\" prove themselves to be dull and unoriginal all at the same time, due to an extreme lack of melodies.

The only tracks which show a different direction are GET RIGHT (Those horns are genius!...and the version with Fabolous is better), HOLD YOU DOWN (Good song for you and your boo) and STEP INTO MY WORLD (Very sexy and Middle Eastern feel to it).

The feud is over between the two and J-Lo has finally come to the realization that she simply can't compete. The only thing worth enduring on this album is the first single, \\"Get Right\\" and its remix featuring Fabolous. To listen to each worthless filler in between would just be torture and is highly not recommended. After a disasterous 2004 Grammy Awards performance, you would think one would want to lay low for a while and give the rest of us time to forget how utterly awful your voice is, but not Mrs. Lopez-Anthony.

Listening to the album, you'll become aware of the huge impact she's had on pop culture and rightfully so. Her songs are insanely catchy and some of the best pop music has to offer. Her videos are fun and exciting (which can be seen on the accompanying DVD) and she has a certain charisma that other pop stars don't have. The highlights of the album are: Toxic, Baby one More time, Slave 4 U, Oops, Stronger, Boys, and the bonus tracks (especially I've Just Begun). The remix CD that goes along with it is also great, particularly the Outrageous mix and the Chris Cox Megamix. I urge you to pick this up if you've been a fan of any of Britney's music. It has something for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BRITNEY SPEARS GREATEST HITS CD,WHAT THE F@#K","review":"IT IS AMAZING THAT THIS AWFUL WOMAN HAS LASTED SO LONG AS TO CREATE A GREATEST HITS COLLECTION.IT SHOULD BE CALLED AS WORST SONGS INSTEAD.I WOULD RATHER HEAR CATS SCREECHING THAN HEAR A BRITNEY SONG.BRITNEY LIKE TEEN POP MUSIC IS AS INTERESTING AS WATCHING WET PAINT DRY.DONT,AND I REPEAT DONT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF BUYING THIS CD.THIS CD CAN BE BETTER PUT TO USE AS A COASTER FOR YOUR BEER CAN.GET ANY ALBUM FROM MUSIC FROM \\"REAL\\" STARS LIKE METALLICA WHO WRITE AND SING THEIR OWN SONGS AND DONT LIP SYNCH AT CONCERTS LIKE BRITNEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"i just don't get it. why do these record companys always fail to make these greatest hits albums complete. every single time?","review":"for the first disc(the actual album itself)it is missing four songs: born to make you happy, from the bottom of my broken heart, don't let me be the last to know, & i love rock & roll. and the second disk(the remixes)coming in at under a half an hour, more could of been added(i'm a slave 4 you, & stronger remixes just to name a few)and maybe some more b-sides and rarites. to full up the disc. right?. all in all a missed opportunity to make your GH's set into somthing that would of been nothin short of spectacular and a way for fans to remember you. if this set was complete(which it is'nt)fans would say(shes the best, this is the best, and i just got my money's worth). way to go spears & jive records, & all you record companys, for screwing up. again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gee, you people need to get a life","review":"Britney Spears isn't deserving of more than two lines of thoughts, especially since her so-called \\"singing\\" is horrific.

Her followup CD included hits like Oops I did it again, Lucky and Stronger.Britney has had fewer hit songs since her second album in my opinion. I really like the song Boys from the Austin Powers soundtrack and the autobiographical song I'm Not A Girl Not Yet A Woman.All of Britney's older songs are excellent and they are included on this CD. However, I think some of these songs are too recent to be considered on a greatest hits album like Toxic and her duet with Madonna Me Against the World. My Prerogative is not very good. I had a hard time understanding the words to her newer songs to be honest. I enjoyed listening to about half of the tracks on this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your Legs?","review":"Why the hell did you get your legs airbrushed on the cover photo?

I have all of her CD's...except this one. Why would I buy her GH CD when I can put together this CD at home? Sure the DVD is an incentive but that's the only reason why I may purchase this CD. The new tracks are available for download and would be cheaper if you just bought the tracks.

I ain't madd at her at all.I respect Her Hustle,but lets be real there ain't much there in terms of Music vibe.every era has a Britney type of Artist that catches on&oh well they have a few decent cuts but that doesn't make a Greatest hits."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little premature, but good CD","review":"Although it's a wee early (ok who are we fooling?? she's only been out 5 years!!) for Britney Spears to release a greatest hits CD, I love it. I am not a fan of her, but I love singing and dancing to her songs. The best song on here and that she's ever released is \\"Toxic\\". I was disappointed that she did not include \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\" on the disc, but I guess \\"Everytime\\" makes up for that. As for her new songs, \\"I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)\\" is a great song. But \\"Do Somethin'\\" is not the greatest. But all in all, a solid effort for this too early greatest hits CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Britney may as well be a porn star","review":"I can't stand this white girl.

To have a greatest hits this early in the game is ridiculuous. That's why \\"greatest\\" cannot apply, also for the fact that the songs stink. To compare her to Madonna is even worse. The problem with Britney is that she a manufactured paper doll. She's cute, but her vocal are severely weak. Like Janet Jackson, she mumbles most of her lyrics and is extremely nasal. It's hard to see any sincerity in her music since most of it is written and produced by factories.As much as I love Madonna's music, she does not make the weak \\"Me Against the Music\\" any better. Making alliance with this girl can only hurt Madonna's career.Maybe the greatest hits package is the final chapter in her less than impressive \\"career\\". Let's hope she makes a better mother than a singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"whoa","review":"brittney needs to put on some clothes in the first place. No, i'm not jealous of her, so don't think that i envy her. Her main sellers are girls. No straight girl wants to see brittney concealed by only a bra and undies. What a role model!! As far as her music, it sucks, not to mention all of her music is computer generated, along with her voice. Obviouly modest is a foreign word to brittney. No wonder why many teenage girls are walking around like they are worth $5.00. What happened to the 50's and 60's modesty? It is a shame that people have become primitave in their clothing again, wanting only to parade around in next to nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, she did it again","review":"She keeps releasing music. It keeps disappointing those of us with hearing. It's even worse when you realize it's a marketing strategy that appeals to younger singers who actually do have real talent.High living and over exposure has done Britney in. Of course she never really had talent. Now she's just worse than annoying because she always sought the limelight but just spends all of \\"My Prerogative\\" grousing about it. What a cheap hypocrite."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far...not so bad...not so great!","review":"As the liner notes state, \\"50 Million albums sold in five years...\\" WOW, what an accomplishment! To this simple fact, the cd title \\"Greatest Hits\\" holds true. Everyone will have their views on Britney but just remember many back in the day used the phrase, \\"she won't last\\" to the Madonna as well and twenty years later...here we are and here she (Madonna) still is. So this collection of songs is not the best song writing, or best vocals but they are good enough to be titled great, catchy pop songs (a few even to be considered classics). I hope to see her come more into her own and start writing more songs herself.

It's gets a little quieter and less stronger. Just something I thought I'd put in. Anyway, whether you would like this album or not really depends on what you have already got.This album recieves four stars from me because of the catchy tunes and all the hits are on here, so basically, you'll like every single song (except maybe her new ones). Britney Spears may not be the greatest singer in the world like Mariah Carey or Christina Aguilera but she can sing. If she couldn't sing, how did she get a record deal in the first place? Her voice was much better during her first couple of hits though.However, if you have all her albums like me, or already have a few, this isn't for you. It's nothing new. If there are songs that you don't have already, buy the actually album like Oop . . . I did it again, or something. There are some songs there that are really good but arn't on her greatest hits."},{"rating":"2","title":"What'd you expect it would be?","review":"To everyone who is complaining about Britney's record label putting out a greatest hits CD: Dont buy it. I figure, for the 10 dollars I paid for it, I got exactly what I wanted. I'm not exactly the biggest Britney fan in the world and I know she certainly isnt the greatest singer out there, but this CD is perfect for the \\"not really a britney fan.\\" its got all her fun early stuff, her dance-inspired later music, and its all together. I'd much rather put money down to have all her hits on one CD than shelling out money for four different ones and have to sit through hours of filler music and sappy ballads.Also, I love the bonus CD with the remixes of Toxic, Outrageous, etc. I can't get the \\"breathe on me\\" remix out of my head, which is a good thing. Personally I've been listening to this CD more than the main one. I couldn't give this album 5 stars b/c some of the songs are kind of cheesy and Britney's voice just sounds over processed, but as a whole its definately fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"This is the best album. Shes came along way from Baby One More Time. She deserves the title Queen Of Pop. Most you hear is \\"She sells sex\\"(most of which insecure kids writing)and \\"Not sutible for children\\" blah blah blah, everyone who sayed that has most likely never even lisen to a single song. If you dont want your kids to listen, dont let them. Dont come hear and complain. Her music is enjoyable. Its fun to listen to, She has a beautiful voice.

Since 1999, Britney has put out a number of memorable pop singles. Last year's 'Toxic' was her pinnacle and I don't know if she will be able to top that one. She certainly doesn't with her latest single, her cover of Bobby Brown's 'My Perogative', which lacks any real joy. It's rather dull and Britney sounds so serious, that it's only a lost cause. But there are plenty of hits here: 'I'm a Slave 4 U', '...Oops, I Did It Again', 'Boys', 'Lucky' and '...Baby One More Time'. There is also a bonus CD featuring remixes and a megamix. This is definitely a great party record. Britney may not be a great singer, and she is no Madonna either, but give her credit, she and her producers have made some great ear candy. This album makes a strong case for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"A PITY ZERO STARS AINT AN OPTION","review":"iT IS AN ABSOLUTE SHAME TO CALL THIS STINKER AS GREATEST HITS.Britney is arguably the worst singer of all time as she blatantly lip synchs,chain smokes and is an awful role model.retarded songs like boys and toxic make me sick and want to run and play my LED ZEPPELIN CD'S.DONT BUY OR LISTEN TO THIS TRASH.ZERO STARS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Music","review":"This album contains plenty of fine pop songs. While Britney isn't the worlds best singer she has a voice good enough for these songs and what good songs indeed! \\"Toxic\\" is a good lyrical song. About a relationship and how you love your partner. Anyone one who's veer loved someone will relate to that. \\"Baby, One more time\\" (her 1st hit) again deals with that universal topic. \\"Lucky\\" a song about someone seemingly having it all, but doesn't feel loved, again a story many can relate to at some time in their life. These songs are trashed by many unfairly, yet, they deal with real life. Something \\"serious\\" rock bands wouldn't know if it came up and hit them in the face.This album collects many hit singles, but the studio albums also contain some fine moments that were just as strong as the singles but never made it beyond an album cut.Highly recommended.

Britney Spears is not a pop artist. None of the artists out there who classify themselves as pop are.

I saw this on TV and there is no doubt that she cant sing to save her life.This album is not consistant and has many weak tracks. The rishi rich remix is a pathetic blast at bhangra and sounds like a cheap remix knocked off in one day.Dont waste your money on this record"},{"rating":"2","title":"SHE NEEDS TO LOSE HER PUBLICITY!","review":"I am very annoyed of getting the newspaper and seeing pictures of this slut!She is so weird and she needs to get a life!She tries to be all sexy but she can't sing or dance or attract me!Never ever like Britney Spears again because she is a snobby,slutty,ugly,crude,drug-addicted,alchoholic,unnatural/not cool immature freak!These songs are so much the same so it's boring and retarded!If you want to listen to singers with respect and dignity and TALENT than go buy Kelly Clarkson,Avril Lavigne,Usher,Beyonce,ALICIA KEYS,Kimberley Locke,Ashanti,Ciara,and Brooke Valentine!This will make you a lot more popular so ditch Britney Spears!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopefully the last chapter of a dreadful story","review":"I shall waste no words on this puppet.

Are you kidding me? This is the musical equivalent of a Jeffrey Dahmer cookbook. Ye gads. The only greatest hits Britney has are courtesy of a push-up bra. I'd barely classify this as music.

Every now and then, I'll be surprised with a good song, but it's definately not because of her voice, more because of the beats. The only recent song I have liked by her was \\"Toxic,\\" and that, like I said, was because of the beats. It's a great dance song. But then you hear a song like \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\" and \\"Lucky\\" and it makes you want to gag. With that Alvin and the Chipmunks thing she calls a voice, it is enough to make you wonder why she became famous in the first place. She is definately not a good role model, much less a good singer, and not an impressive dancer at that. On this album, there are only a few songs I like personally, and they are mainly upbeat songs, like \\"Overprotected,\\" \\"(You Drive Me) Crazy,\\" and \\"Toxic,\\" but other than that, this album is nothing to brag about. However, any true Britney fan will be satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Britney Spears","review":"Poor Britney Spears. I actually feel sorry for this woman. I have watched Britney Spears show \\"Chaotic\\", and she is a really nice person. I don't care if you hate her music, you have to admit that she is one of the nicest superstars around. But... most of her music is horrendous. \\"Do Somethin'\\" just makes me want to rip my f$%king ears off. The only good song on the Greatest Hits release are \\"Me Against the Music\\", so that is why I decided to give Britney at least one star. I would love to meet her, because she seems like such a nice, carefree person, but she needs to retire before she fades into oblivion, which is already happening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney Spears' Prerogative.","review":"All the tracks in this album are great. I can't say that enough times, but I ADORE Britney's version of Bobby Brown's \\"My Prerogative\\"!!! For starters, it is empowering to hear A WOMAN sing a song like this.

Yes, I know shes been around for a few years...longer than most people expected, but she only has four albums, two of which weren't very good...Britney is a classic case of star that doesn't care what they do to their career so she has to get a greatest hits album out now before things goo to bad and everyone forgets about the mommy to be that had a select few years in the spotlight.

At first I was impressed with its power and liked the lift off unit. However, after using it for about a year the cheap plastic started to break. It also clogs very easily and you have to take everything apart and make a big mess trying to clean it. The suction hose clogs and you have to run a wire through it to remove the plug.The standup unit no longer stands on its own because a chunk of plastic broke off that locks it in the up position. One of the cord receptors broke off after about 20 uses. The belt tends to make a burning smell. The flex hose is not long enough and just pulls the lift off unit over unless you always hold it in your hand.Unfortunately, all current home vacuums that I have seen are made of plastic.

In trying to further pad her information from a brochure into a book, she went so far as to list the names of every county in every state!And of course, she has suggested reading.

The Thymes hand lotion is a little thicker than the body lotion, but not by much. Importantly, neither the hand nor body lotions are greasy.My favorite Thymes Eucalytus product is the Eucalyptus shower gel, as it smells heavenly and opens my sinuses! (BTW, The Thymes Eucalyptus body lotion is NOT as strongly eucalyptus scented as Molton Brown's Warming Eucalyptus shower gel. I prefer The Thymes Eucalyptus products.)

I consistently read single sentences that were written in a language style that was ultimately imprecise and offered poorly explained information. The programs offered as examples, while interesting to work through, were long winded when all the reader wants is a simple example to illustrate a specific concept (ie. pointers and references).

As it intices him, it becomes an obsession. It holds transformation powers that Kethan must figure out to control, for he is driven out of the keep by his jealous cousin Maugus. Anyway, It's a cool plot.But, I was terribly sick of the writing. Every other sentence began with an \\"I\\". If you're going to write in that 1st person, you cant write it like that. She seemed to throw in details just as they became effective. It was written like a journal. And there was hardly any dialogue. I was not impressed.

Large chunks of the plot were cut out. The movie is chock-full of TV/movie cliches. The acting throughout is cheesy; one expression would be that the actors are chewing the scenery. The ending is changed around completely - in the book, the good guys don't win, and there is an appropriate apocalyptic resolution to the story; in the movie, the plot changes course for no apparent reason and the ending makes absolutely no sense.

It gets more like conventional SF films toward the end, but interest holds up throughout.And, as an aside, it does not surprise me that your reviewer who clearly dislikes Tracy Lords (who I think is highly underrated because of her pornstar background - she is learning all the time), is named 'Gay'."},{"rating":"1","title":"tommyknockers","review":"I wanted to buy this movie after reading the book to compare the differences between the pieces.

In my opinion, the movie has far too many variations from the book and doesn't have the detail the book has. I understand that a movie is only based on the novel, but I don't believe the movie does justice to the book at all. I am a strong Stephen King fan and have read many of his novels...as well as watched the movies based on those novels. Usually the movies follow fairly well with the novel.

Not a very good movie and bad acting!","review":"I love the book \\"The Tommyknockers\\" and I also enjoy most movies that are made from King's books, but this one (and \\"Thinner\\") is an exception. First of all, the acting is horrible. The funny thing is that the best acting comes from former pornstar Traci Lords, and that still isn't very good (but she does look very hot...). The effects are pretty poor and always look the same (ie. green lights). Some of the things from the book translated nicely, like the shed, but otherwise I believe that if I hadn't read the book first that it wouldn't have made any sense at all. It's really sad when I have to say the line: \\"The best thing about this movie is Traci Lords.\\".

I love his books and some of his movies. But I don't love this movie. I don't know how someone could come up with this bad of a movie from a pretty good book. First of all, without giving too much of the movie away let me say this, in the book they uncover a flying saucer. Whatever the thing in the movie is, it isn't a flying saucer. It blows my mind that they would change something this central to the point. And as some other reviews have stated, by just watching the movie, you have no idea why some of the characters are not affected by the ship like the others. My recommendation would be to take a little more time and read the book. You will be better off if you did.

This is a minor annoyance.More troubling is that the sound isn't in synch with the video. You hear words a quarter of a second before an actor's mouth moves. That's a major flaw, thus my Two Star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really, really lame.","review":"This movie was very boring to watch, and I didn't care about any of the characters. I think I finished watching this movie just because I was too lazy to get up and take out the DVD.

Meaning most of the story talks about how a certain substance increases your creativity but also increases your dependency. Seeing one man trying get rid of his dependency while helping others beat theirs. Like every other Stephen King movie,this plot has great bulid-up but has a lousy pay-off in the end. It also has every overused casting cliches like the cheater,the drinker and so many others. Some of the acting is soo over-the-top,it's laughable. What else can I say? It's stupid but it's a fun kind of stupid and also one of the more entertaining films to say the least.

So what happens when you go through this process with a King book that was rubbish in the first place?Absolute crap is the answer, of course. This dire mini-series is 2 and a half hours of sleep-inducing soap opera, twenty or so minutes of midly entertaining ending, and almost 3 hours of pointless viewing in all. King was asking for it though; the actors (including Jimmy Smits, tragically miscast as Gard) have to wrestle with the terrible script and plot, and the special effects are suitably 1930's thanks to the small budget and the ridiculous stuff they had to re-create from the book.

Granted, that's all in the book, but it written chillingly by King in a way only he can do it. There are some exciting alien moments at the end, but by then it's too late.

Double that with the fact that most movies hardly ever line up with the book that's based on and well...My gripe is the transition from putting the movie in it's original format onto DVD was bad.

However, Sandra Benitez is a wonderful person and instructor. I am still looking forward to reading The Weight of all Things.

I need MAJOR help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle, too gentle...","review":"I found that in reading Ms. Benitez' first novel that I was being lulled into a gentle portrait of the interconnectedness of the people of the village of Santiago and I enjoyed that, most of the time. At other times, I felt that the author, in the name of verisimilitude, strove to re-create the village life so much that it got in the way of the truth of the story. Remedios, the central character, was under-developed as a shamanness--that is, I wanted to see her power over the lives of the other characters WHEN THEIR STORIES WERE BEING TOLD. Instead, she was just an intercalary effect.But really, these are small criticisms. It was refreshing to read a novel where each character was treated with their own dignity."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazingly true","review":"i really enjoyed this novel.

About 80% of that cd re-appears here (even though the original Roxy cd only runs for about 35 minutes). After this compiled part a few tracks are added from the a concert that has been released 3 (three) times before (see: The Best And The Rest from 1990 and the re-release \\"Sham 69 Live\\" from 1993 which are complete, or the almost complete \\"Sham 69 live-United\\" on Hallmark from 1996. Be warned...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad sound","review":"Don't listen to the other review. This is when Sham added a keyboard and this has nothing to do with The Roxy. Most of the songs on here were written long after The Roxy had closed it's doors. Think that this is live in Italy but I could be wrong. This is from a live cd from around late 78 or so. The sound is boot quality and not worth the purchase unless you are a diehard Sham 69 fan. 'Nuff said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Movie","review":"This movie brings back classic late-70s, early 80s SCI-FI. It's a compelling story of survival with all the great monsters you'd expect from Sandy Collora. The soundtrack is unbelievable, and really adds to the drama of the movie. There are very few CG effects, and almost everything is done the classic way: live action, guys in suits, and miniatures for the ships. In the age of mind numbing effects and CG run amok, it was nice to see real people doing real things.I highly recommend this to anyone who likes classic SCI-FI."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done movie.","review":"I really enjoyed this sci-fi action packed movie.

I look forward for seeing more of such movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful film with riviting characters","review":"I loved this refreshing, visually stunning, old style, character-based sci fi. I was captivated by the cinematography, and completely engrossed by the characters. It's a must see for any sci fi lovers, and a masterpiece in low budget film making. A remarkable film on all accounts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and forced.","review":"This film's quality level is something you could expect from a film student learning his craft. The dialogue is awful, the acting is cringe worthy for the most part, and the movie drags on and on with scenes that didn't add anything. This is what you expect from a student that ignores his teacher's advice about learning the rules before deciding to break them. You have to know why they are rules before you can decide to ignore them, or you end up with unwatchable garbage.Did he make this on a shoestring budget? Yes. Does he deserve praise just because of that? No. It's bad. It's actually worse than the horrible movies SyFy creates. I'm not sure why this has such a high rating here and on Netflix, but I'm guessing that it's friends and family of the filmmaker. (The same reason horrible, self-published books on Kindle get rated so high.) Do yourself a favor and steer clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Tupac CD ever made","review":"If there is any Tupac cd to own it has got to be this one because he is so real on it.

I guess the best way to describe it is like this:It's old school, don't be too shocked not to hear pac saying thug life every 4 bars. But if you ask me that's a good thing because the rap itself is more political and focuses on struggling and opression rather than money and groupies. It's really all a matter of whether or not you like the actual lyrics or just the voice and the beat, if you like this album go to the record store and get the Lost Tapes as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before the chronic, before doggystyle before illmatic and before ready 2 die there was 2pacalypse now!","review":"this is a classic album.

Recorded in 91', it was released when Pac was only 20. Though not his best album, its very underrated, and Pac had already shown on this album he was a gonna be a major force in the hip hop world, before he became the greatest rapper ever. This album sounds like a mixture of Public Enemy and NWA. The songs are very political, and almost all them contain some message or another. On \\"Brendas Got A Baby\\", Pac demonstrates his story-telling skills to perfection and makes Slick Rick look like an beginner. Its one of his most deep songs today even, about teenage pregnancy. \\"Souljaz Story\\" is another great story telling track. However, songs like \\"Words Of Wisdom\\", \\"Trapped\\", and one of the best Pac songs ever, \\"Part Time Mutha\\", showcase Pac's social conscience at its best. This is a very underrated album. Definatly a must have for all Pac fans. RIP Pac"},{"rating":"2","title":"thug master","review":"Tupac was the master of the rap genre.

This album is one of his weakest. Brenda's Got a Baby is the only great track on this album. Nas, Jay, and Biggie all dropped classics on their debut but it took Pac 4 albums to finally get there. He's a legend no doubt, but just because you love Pac don't lie to yourself and say this album is great. Though Pac didn't do too well on this album, it is nice to see that he was trying to rap way back in '93. Once the east/west war started though, that's when he finally got popular and started making decent music. RIP Tupac."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak debut","review":"He gain fame by his actin, but his debut was weak and it was not good at all.

I got turned on to this band with their 2007 releasePerfect Mess, and wanted to hear what they sounded like earlier in their career.It's hard to describe Maryslim's sound on this album. The band cites influences like AC/DC, the Cult and the Foo Fighters, and I guess that makes sense. Split Vision is a hook-heavy, very melodic (they're Swedish after all) rock record with a punk rock attitude. I'd compare the band to hair metal revivalists Hardcore Superstar and Gemini Five, only with less sleaze and more punk-like. It's not too serious, not too complicated, and basically just rocks.It's nothing groundbreaking, but Split Vision is a totally fun rock n' roll album from a very promising band. Modern rock isn't all gloom and mediocrity, and this band is the proof."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Let-Down","review":"I've read his non-fiction and expected better. While there is some good insider stuff, the characters are unconvincing, the plot becomes totally implausible, and he glosses over some pretty important (and unbelievable) occurences (such as an MIA returning from a Russian gulag after nealy 30 years! Guess what? He's not bitter at all! And no one in the US Govt. is upset!) A poorly imagined novel that is yearning, no doubt, to find new life as a screen play.

Take a look at the endnotes, most are citations from other volumes. I also found it sad that others have to resort to sarcasim in their reviews. The story of PT 109 in this volume is not fair or true. It was not Kennedy that enable the crew to be rescued, but rather Lenny Thom, the XO. Before you attack someone on these pages, you should do your homework."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"As I read this book, I was struck by how little new research was done. All the information seems to have been pulled from other secondary sources. No PT vets were interviewed. And the account of the post sinking of PT 109 is all KENNEDY KENNEDY KENNEDY! No mention whatsoever of the heroics of Lenny Thom, the XO of that boat, who wrote the note that got them rescued. It was NOT the coconut shell! When will the truth be told~?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting story, well told","review":"By zeroing in on a narrow slice of years (1937-45), Renehan is able to go into detail that other writers on the Kennedys have simply not had space for with regard to the war years. His evocation of Jack Kennedy in the South Pacific seems especially good. The best, I think, that I've read. Also, Renehan dives quite deeply into the story of Kick Kennedy and her courtship/marriage with Billy Hartington, heir to the Duke of Devonshire, and it is all very well told."},{"rating":"1","title":"ouch","review":"By the end of Chapter Five, the author had flogged me with the phrase 'Texas Ranger' more than thirty times, with far too many of them attached to the heroine's husband's full name, i.e.'Jack Galway, TEXAS RANGER.' (my caps.) The cast, who supposedly already knew the heroine, spoke in awkward, expositional sentences like, \\"Hello, Susanna Dunning Galway, stubborn, willful, separated wife of Jack Galway, TEXAS RANGER. How is that ten million dollars you have that you haven't told your Texas Ranger husband about yet and oh, have you told him about Beau Garrity, your secret stalker of one year ago who might have murdered his wife and the reason you separated from your husband Jack Galway, Texas Ranger?\\" The villains are limp spaghetti and their motivations ridiculous.

My advice for BFMV is if they want to make it in the metal world get a new singer and push the singer back into rhythm guitarrist unless they want to keep him and appeal to the emo kids instead.Its still better than AV7, but who isn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't think of anything to say about this CD except...

The first song was good but,the rest of the album left a sour taste in my mouth. If I had to describe this record I would say it sounds like Atreyu and Avenged Sevenfold had a love child. The guitar is actually really good but, the singing is way too emo for my taste. It isn't very original either.You might even think that you have heard some of these songs on other metal records that recently came out.\\"The Poison\\" does have it's moments. I liked \\"Spit You Out\\" and \\"4 Words\\" alot. Had there been more metal singing, less emo singing, and a little more originality it might have been worth buying. Instead they just leave you wondering if the same people who created N'Sync created these guys. 2 stars weak"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best thing to come out of england in while","review":"Bullet is the best thing to come out of england since priest. their guitar work with different drumming is beyond believe. myself i am a drummer and i can do this i just have never thought of it. then their songs are never too long and always leaving you wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Excellent CD.

Songs such as \\"Suffocating under words of sorrow\\" and \\"Tears don't fall\\" are prime examples of this bands ability. Matt Tuck has awesome vocals and writes some damn good tunes! The rest of the band oozes with power and dominance. Every tune on this cd is amazing and hard hitting. Watch out Trivium you now have some competetion.

The hardcore metal fans will most likely be disappointed do to the fact theres no one yelling and barking through out the whole track as to where you cant understand what he's trying to say.

I've been using it for 6 weeks and I've noticed that my dark circles are getting lighter. The fine lines are fewer now and definitely less noticeable. It also has a light SPF.

I keep a copy in my office and make a point of re-reading it from front to back every six months or so.At the same time, I have found it very helpful in striving for a functional family. My wife and I found ourselves overwhelmed in dealing with our first child. While I have read a variety of child discipline books and other how-to manuals, I have found this one as useful as the best in the family field. In four years, we have gone from a house that had fairly constant crisis and drama to a much quieter, \\"well-managed\\" household with two kids.

It also could practically serve as a reference for how to service an organ, which I didn't really need to know, but wasn't too annoying. I came from a long piano background before I started organ, and I found it a very difficult to transition. This book recognizes that for many, the new fingering that is required by organ is harder than the challenge of pedaling. I certainly found it that way, having to keep my hands legato while reading three lines, playing pedal, and pulling stops.

Its along the quality of an Eminem song and holds your interest with nice beats and quick, slick verses. Its just a shame the rest of the CD isn't the same. The rest of the CD is boring, dull, has no great beats (If I Can't has an okay beat though), and just plain sucks. How can people say this guy is better or even as good as Eminem or Dre? He's boring, sings bad, has bad beats, and is always boasting about guns and fights (Wanksta), women (P.I.M.P.), and clubs (In Da Club) just like all the other boring rappers of today.

I believe that 50 cent is the stereotype of rap music. All he speaks about is money, cash, hoes, guns, and beefs. And the scary thing is that this is the rap that most kids are listening to. If I were a father I would rater have my kids listen to artists like Comon Sense or Talib Kweli instead of this bull. You know were he got his name. He got it from this NY coke dealer who ruled the city by fear. He thinks he deserves to be called 50 because he took some shots.

I bought this album because of all the hype surrounding it, and because of the fact that Eminem is my favorite rapper and he signed 50. Big mistake.

You can hear it in 50's slurred voice, he stumbles on simple rhymes that he can't bust (no pun intended...). And that new G-Unit project he's doing is no better. Watching his \\"Stunt 101\\" video on MTV, its obvious that he's going the wrong way. He releases a debut album, it sells millions based off hype, and then watch: his next album he's bragging about his cars, money, and ho's (in Beg For Mercy). Try some good rap like Eminem or Outkast."},{"rating":"1","title":"if this album is so good, why can you get it for 5.00 above?","review":"that was a retorical question. because its stupid music for stupid people. the fact is that you would not think your average crack-dealing scumbag could rap, so why would you start now? this man is not smart, plain and simple. people who aren't smart can't rap, just look at jay-z. i laughed out loud when i heard he named his \\"crew\\" g-unit after damon albarn's concept group gorrilaz. how unoriginal is that? as i've read in the countless bad reviews here, this guys flow is inert(not in motion). its sounds like he has a mouth full of marbles, and everything sounds like trl trash. being a human target is not a rap credential. lets just say i hope he dies trying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just when I thought rap couldn't sink any lower.......","review":"Come ON! Is this a joke? Did somebody really allow this album to be released? I can say, with 100% certainty, that there are absolutely ZERO redeming qualities about this CD........NONE! No good beats that require anyone to do anything more than push a few buttons, no good lyrics, and.....wow.......50 cent can NOT rap (and rapping isn't even hard......AT ALL!!) And yeah 50, you got shot 9 times.....oh great! Perhaps I should go buy a gun and finish the job (you'd be even prouder then, dumbass). To anyone who likes this album, I simply ask WHY? No seriously, why do people like this album? I really wanna know; if anyone could find anything good about this album, I'd flush my wallet down the toilet.I hate you, MTV. (by the way, this rating should be zero stars; why isn't that an option?)P.S. Please God, don't ever allow anyone who sucks this much to have a career in music. And if you must, kill me first."},{"rating":"2","title":"50 should stick to mixtapes","review":"I have to say the album is decent. I can listen to the entire album which is a feat to achieve in this age. As impressed as I was, I thought 50 was lacking something throughout the album. He was lacking his true creativity that you can only find on his mixtapes. When 50 busts freestyles his lyrics are dope, and the flow is there, but when it comes time to go retail there's something holding him back. 50 has a lot of potential, but he and whoever is producing his ish needs to let it flow straightup. Listen for this lack of flow in G UNIT'S Beg for mercy droppin on NOV 14 2003. I hear it lacks the energy of their previous mixtapes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wicked","review":"This is one of my best albums i was at the shops first to buy this. any body who likes eminem will love this i know i do."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Rap World Has Gone Retarded","review":"When this is what's hot...that's perfectly clear. The highlight of this album is \\"Many Men,\\" and most 50 fans hate that particular track. The first single was the weakest track on the LP. \\"21 Questions\\" is another mediocre radio hit saved by the vocals of Nate Dogg, while \\"P.I.M.P.\\" is another pseudo-Southern hit saved by Snoop Dogg's indestructability. The rest of the tracks just kind of blend into each other. The beats are nice to listen to, while not very original. The rhymes are even less so. Save yourself the money and the trip to the record store, download the singles, and wait for the next peon to come along."},{"rating":"1","title":"How does this garbage get recorded?","review":"Enter quite possibly the world's most unintelligent human being. Now turn him lose on a microphone, and play his verbal garbage over any hit radio station at least once an hour. Who decided that this idiot's nonsensical ramblings had to be recorded to ensure that every 120lb caucasian male in North America dress in XXXL clothing in order to appear tough? The \\"rapping\\" over the atrocious attempts at creating rhymic music is pathetic. I only wish \\"Fiddy Cenn\\" could understand integers, so I could give his sorry ass -5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unoriginal, Uninspired","review":"\\"In Da Club\\" is a fun song to dance to. And that is where the fun of this album ends. 50 Cent's rap style has been done before (I-20, anyone on the Cash Money label). The only reason his hit song is catchy is because it sports an awesome beat created by someone other than 50 Cent. Of all of the famous rappers I have heard, 50 Cent has the least talent by far. Everything he says sounds grumbled and there is no change in the tone of his voice. In addition to his lack of talent, his lyrics are poor. There is neither depth, nor substance. Nobody will ever care what 50 Cent raps about. All they want to hear is the beats.I gave this album 2 stars only because the beats are generally pretty good, but 50 Cent had nothing to do with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"commercial garbage","review":"i think it's disgusting how much hype this guy gets for his mediocre crap. it seems that getting shot can't make you a good rapper, and 50 cent is living proof. he can have all the street credibility in the world but it doesn't mean he has any substance. like many others have said, this is mtv stamp of approval carrying tripe. maybe he'll win like 10 grammy's so he can hang out with will smith and the other pop bs that passes for hip hop these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"give me a break","review":"50 Cent is the worst rapper of all time. He can't rhyme or tell a story. anyone who thinks he's good is either 5 years old or dosen't know what real rap is. he's been around for years. where have you people been. eminem could have picked anyone and you idiots would like whoever it was. If eminem said the moon was made of cheese most of you people would probably believe him. this album is a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"why does every1 like 50 Cent?I dont get it..","review":"I never actually bought this cd but i dont need to. Why don't i need to, because 50 cent sucks. He can't rap,all he does is mumble,and the only reason people like him is because he was produced by eminem. Most people who listen to 50 are pre-pubescent girls that the like the songs because of the beats.Why dont people listen to good rappers like King Gordy and Esham. So in conclusion 50 cent sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah, yeah...","review":"I don't give this album 5 stars, because 50 can do it better (or he at least did better on \\"Guess who's back\\"). So I waited more from this album, but yeah, it's good. Dre's beats we're good here, like always. And all the haters: If someone's (50 Cent) mainstream, doesn't mean that he's not good. That's just what you punks don't seem to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF is this Crap....","review":"Ok only two good songs on this entire disk. Patiently waiting, and In da club ( but that was quckily played out ) The rest of the songs are crap, and like others have said, you cant understand what he is sayin. Basically because he mumbles everything. Here is another \\"POP\\" artist like Eminem. What is happening to music these days. Since when did, Jay Z, 50, Ja, Nelly become rap? Music like this gives Hip HoP such a bad name. Thank god for Westside connection, and all the Hip Hop artist out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WAYYYY TO OVERRATED","review":"50 Cent doesnt have that much talent what so ever in rapping. I have no idea why hes so popular, there are only a few good songs on this CD which are probaly In Da Club because its catchy, P.I.M.P. because it has a good beat, and Patiently Waiting because Eminem is in it. If you listen to 50 he has no flow or rythym and hes just boring, unlike Ludacris or Eminem who bring style into their songs and sound different in all their songs. 50 has no good dance beats on this CD so I am puzzled on why this guy is so big maybe people will learn. O yeah he didn't get shot 9 times its all part of his big tough guy from the hood image."},{"rating":"1","title":"agree with the \\"garbage\\" comments","review":"i really and truly do not see what all the \\"fuss\\" was about, 50 has a below average voice for rapping, his lyrics are shallow, but Dre, is behind the beats so you know they gonna be catchy, that is the only thing that saves 50 ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.","review":"I find 50 to be a decent rapper. I think he is way overhyped however, and dosen't have as much talent as many other less popular rappers. This CDs executive producer was Eminem but you can't compare the two. 50 is a gangster rapper while Em is just an insane rapper. Eminem however, has far more talent then 50 cent when it comes down to lyrics and originality. The only stand out tracks on this album (other than many men) are the ones he's featured on. The rest of them are a bunch of I'll kill you, I'll blow your brains out, smoke a joint, etc. etc. kind of stuff. It's the kind of garbage you hear from a mediocre and uninventive rapper. So unless you really like rap regardless of who or what it is, skip this one, and don't buy into the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Quarters!","review":"He's no Biggie & definately no 2Pac, but he's got a new refreshing style to be called his own. I think his voice and lyrical style gives him something, extra that was definately lacking since Tu Pac Shakur and Notorious BIG. He's alright with me, I'm not sure he has staying power though. He definately has those club bangers, and radio hits!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERHYPED!!!!","review":"This album is way to overhyped! 50's being called as good as tupac and rakim, he doesn't even touch those guys. It makes me sick, that he can be even compared to them. See 50 as what he is, an average rapper with an incredible producer (Dr. Dre). The beats are solid and pretty good though they aren't Dre's best work. (take a look at the original chronic or snoops doggystyle album for that)This cd is not worth buying. Just burn a copy from a friend i'm sure one of your friends has it. Personally i like more intelligent MC's like Nas, 2Pac, Aesop Rock, Atmosphere, or even some De La Soul and Tribe and i love Outkast. All of those artists have albums that blow 50 outta the water. What has rap come to when albums like this go 6 times platinum, i mean honestly, back in the the 90's when Pac, Biggie, Wu-tang, and Nas were in their prime a record like this wouldn't of gone platinum. Bottom line- just burn a copy! This guy doesn't deserve any more recognition he's just an average MC."},{"rating":"1","title":"The next shmo who flows?","review":"Imagine all the sweet beats on this album blanketed by Eminem's rapping and lyrics. That would've been something amazing. Too bad we're stuck with 50's droll voice and moronic rhymes. It's tragic.I think 50 should thank his lucky stars. All 2 of them. Yep, I'm talkin' about Em and Dre."},{"rating":"2","title":"hdh","review":"This album is the Best,by the way the best tracks are in Da cluband 21 Questions It has the best songs.

Save your money on this trash, and buy a Tupac album instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Em, Dre.......... Why?","review":"All right, I will make this short and sweet. 50 cent as an artist is terrible. He is completely monotone and can anybody really understand what he is trying to say half the time. I'de be better off trying to figure out what Ozzy is saying. The only thing that truly saves this album from complete destruction is the fact that 50 has 2 rap moguls producing his album. Thank god he has Dre and Em producing his album cuz if it werent for them this album wouldnt have sold a tenth of what it sold. I'de even come as far to say that I have lost some respect for Dre for even thinking of working on such a terrible project. I just have to say that if 50 is the future of rap than were all in trouble cuz rap used to be poetic like 2pac or Nas and now its just pop like Justin or Britney. All in all 50 cent's is about the amount i'de pay for this hip hop massacre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um.....","review":"I am having a hard time understanding rap. There are so many musicians out there that are infinitely better. Especially jazz musicians who spend their life becoming amazing at an instrument and most of the time make very little money at it. I am sure that there are some \\"true\\" rap musicians out there, but I have not heard or seen a single one. If you want to hear true musicians listen to people like Chick Corea, Al Di Meola, Joe Satriani, Steve Kimock, Charlie Hunter, Will Bernardo, John McLaughlin, Wynton Marsalis etc... These guys are actual musicians. They understand music, they know how to create true masterpieces. This 50 Cent and almost all of the rap, R&B, hip-hop seen is destroying true, worthy music. Don't feed this beast that lacks any musical abilities.

I don't get tired of listening to it except the tracks that have already been played out on the radio (21 Questions, P.I.M.P., and In Da Club). Give credit where credit is due.

As for 50 cent's \\"get rich or die tryin\\" it is not gangstrap nor its gangsta at all because most nuggaz into 50 are either white or trl fans so therefore? Its wack. The whole album is wack and 50's lirycal skills are gone like the wind yo. All i gotta say is that 50 need to stop tryna act like dat wack azz nugga pac and just be himself.

He is currently hip hop's golden boy because he has something every suburban white kid would die for : Street cred. And I'm talking real street cred on the ghetto streets, not the wild streets of Iowa City or Bergen County.It's very simple. The people who LOVE 50 cent are the worst type of rap fans.

That's actually a blessing, for once you do make out the lyrics you realise that virtually every song is about how rich he is, how many girls he's slept with, or how he's going to shoot you. He has no ideas, nothing new to offer lyrically. At least you would've expected some dope beats from Dre and Em, but they don't deliver on this boring CD - the only semi-decent tracks on the album are \\"Wanksta\\" and \\"You Not Like Me\\", neither of which are available on the US version of the album, as 50 chooses to stuff it with filler from his own group, G-Unit.

It is nowhere near Nas's Illmatic or Biggie's Ready To Die. This album was well produced but 50 didn't have the lyrical flow and his MCin' is really awful. U can bearly understand what the f@ck he is tryin' to say. If this album is just for parties and clubs, then 50 has suceeded, but if he is trying to get the spot of being one of the greatest MC's of all time, then he has FAILED! I can't believe people are comparing him to 2Pac or B.I.G. He is nowhere near their league when it comes to dope lyrics and awesome lyrical flow. For a guy who has been shot and stabbed hasn't really been talking about his life experience in his album. He just talks about his money, cars and jewelery. I was really disapointed with this album, because I know 50 Cent can do better, he just needs to apply himself.

He just plain sucks. Classical music is better than this junk. rap is bad no matter who's singing. 50-cent is a gay over shot loser who has other people create songs for him to sing and get rich off of, while the designer of the song get 5%. all rap is the same. People just sing blurred words, that would rhyme if you could hear them. Nothing special. In contrast, a rock band actually plays an instrument and sings words you can hear, understand, and sing along to. if you want good music buy a Green Day or U2 CD. It's just my opinion but, I'M RIGHT! 50-CENT SUCKS.3 reasons why you should not buy this CD:1. 50-cent is isn't talented, he doesn't play an instrument.2. 50-cent is hated so much that hes been shot 9 times.3.

Go buy it NOW, you will like it if you like Dre and Eminem, no crap Jay-Z or Clipse; they just talk and talk, nothing has ever happened to them.

How can we, as individuals of society, allow such a talent-less wannabe rapper become so successful, simply because he was a dug dealer who got shot nine times. Fine, if the muic actually had ubstance i would understnad, but it simply doesn't. The tracks all sound the same, in their profane, mysoginistic and voilent way. 50 cent simply doesn't have the interllectual capability to write anything slighlty meaningful or sinifcant, and will hopefully be forgotten with tomorrow's waste.A good beat does not justify an album's existence.

At 15 and 16 hip hop/ r&b was my fav kind of music. I'm now 21 and I only listen to alt & punk rock. Why?

The massacre has it's good Cuts, like: In my hood, Gatman and Robbin, and God gave me style. No matter what 50 couldn't top this CD anyways. This CD was in instant classic. Every song has good beats, and 50 knows how to work with em. Best songs are the dre beat ones of course: In da club, Blood hound, and if i can't. If you want a CD too bump in your car then this is definitely it. I suggest getting this before the massacre... the massacre seems to be geared more towards the ladies.. songs like: Build you up, Just a lil bit, Candy shop, amazing lead me to believe it.

I don't know what copy of this CD YOUR younger sibling played on 4 hour car ride when you forgot your own headset/other CDs, but the one I heard had no tracks worth listening to. I don't know what about rappin about gettin shot and gettin women over produced beats and synthed melody makes a song great, but Amazon.com (and many other people who critique music for a living) really needs to have higher standards for grading rap music. And no, I don't hate 50 simply because he has gone commercial or b/c everyone knows his name; there's some good radio music out there, but every genre of music suffers from those one or two way-overhyped icons.

There will obviously come a time in the future when a revolution will take place and originality and creativity will find its way back into rap. As long as garbage like this persists, it will make it easy for a change in rap to occur.

There are only 4 songs that sound decent and they are:PIMPPatiently Waiting (feat. Eminem)In Da Club21 Questions (feat. Nate Dogg)That's it. But its not enough to make you buy the entire cd. As I stated before, got change?"},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERRATED","review":"This is a truely bad rap CD from one of the most overrated artists of all time. It has great production, but 50 Cent is a flat-out horrible lyricist. This guy is NOT the next Tupac, although he may be the next Ja Rule or DMX.Someone said that if you like The Roots, you probably won't like this CD, and I have to agree. If you like Eminem's new stuff (not his old, Slim Shady stuff. They are completely different, as Slim Shady was FAR superior to the current, no punchline dropping, Em), or DMX or 50's underground tracks, you will probably like this CD. If you like lyrical content in your rap, you will not.It's a shame this guy was signed over Royce Da 5'9."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a great message!","review":"\\"Get rich or die trying\\" Wow, I mean what a powerful message to our youth.

Why can't any of you people see that? And no im not one of those stupid kids who listens to death metal like all this modern music (...).Real music is Rock from the 70's and late 60's.Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin really found the point of music. And no this isnt a racial thing, Jimi Hendrix is black, and hes one of my favortie musicians. Not to mention he was a hippy, and one of the greatest guitarist of all time.My theory is this whole rap phase will end just like in the 80's with Hair Metal and 60's with the Psychedelic era. Each phase started its own culture, excatly like rap, and died within 5-9 years. Rap will be dead soon, and classic rock will return,FOR GOOD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The problem with 50 cent and other great rappers","review":"50 cent has emerged as one of the greatest rappers so far.The problem i have wit him is he dont [care] what heis teaching to kids.

If ur like me i dont wannahear junk in songs. Then at the end of his album, he has a songcalled \\"Gotta Make It To Heaven.\\" How is he gonna make it to heaven if he cusses and says guns and violence is the answer? You cant make it to heaven like that, and dont know what christianity is. If u want the same good sound and better lyrics I reccomend to these artist:1.Krs-one2.Nuwine ***Nuwine sounds like 2Pac***3.FTF ***Sound like Hot Boyz/Juvenille/Big Tymers4.LL Cool J (\\"10\\" is a great album.)5.Wyclef Jean"},{"rating":"2","title":"Man this is wat iv been waiten for","review":"Man this is the kinda rap record iv been waiten for for many years mater beats by killas like denaun porter eminem and dr.dre and super gangsta murder tracks like heat and many men there are so many hits on this cd.

It has everything you want from a rap album, it relies on the basics, beats and lyrics, and both live up to the hype. True, we have heard the stories and seen the image before, but rarely do we see or hear it from someone who has genuinely lived this type of life, and that is why this album is different. 50 Cent was destined to make it big and Eminem and Dre have realised this.

Eminem.This song certainly grows on you.As well as In da club .21 questiens which shows a whole new romantic side of 50 cent and shows he has a heart after all.Patiently waiting is superb and i think is would really boost the album sales if releasd. Many men is the kind of song u like more as u listen to it.I used to be an anti- rap person before i listen to this but now i do certainly like rap . This is the best album ever if 50 cent can make another album like this i would ceratainly worship him(not really).so if u like rap or rnb ..this is THE album to buyu wont be disapointed.

I think the song that I am referring to is PIMP, well anyway this song was some of the weakest rhyming that I have ever heard. The rhyme sceme is simpler than 80s Eric B and Rakim.

I cannot understand for the life of me how this cd made so many \\"best of\\" lists last year. This dude's flow makes him sound mildly retarded this is worse than Chingy. I've been a fan of Hip Hop for going on 2 decades now and I realize that everybody complains about the sorry state the music is in, I don't think that's true. Mainstream Rap music might be at an all time low as far as creativity and talent, but the underground is flourishing. Avoid garbage like 50 Cent at all costs, check out artists with something to say like Blackalicious, Jurassic 5, Madlib, El-P, hell even Outkast. This is exploitative trash and 50 Cent must have gotten some serious brain damage on one of those occasions when he was shot.

The sad thing is, 50 blew up 2 be one of the top rappers. RAPPING IS NOT ABOUT IMAGE. Its not about being shot, it's about rhyming about a particular topic and making sense, or {for the truely gifted ones} telling a story of sorts. 50 can't do either. He can act and look tough. Great for magazines, bad for radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what rap has been missing.","review":"To everyone who has been saying this CD is not good, please at least try and back up your arguments.

I'm quivering in my boots!... yeah so here's some reasons why 50 Cent and rap music is crap:They don't write their own lyrics and if they do they fail.They have rubbish easy beats in the background to add 'effect'.They usually get loads of people featuring on songs so they don't have to show off their wonderful talent.They don't play any instruments whatsoever.If you disagree with those points then you obviously don't know what music you're listening to.50 Cent and his 'hommies' are just posers who have no talent at all.

Of course if you like Ja or anything like that radio mess you ain't gonna like it. That seems to be the case with all those out there sayin it's average at best. Y'all need to put the LL Cool J album down and look for your inner thug. 50 wasn't tryin to make stuff for you to listen to on you 6x9's as you cruise around in your Chevy Malibu, this album is for the thugs rollin' through the hood in the Caprice with the tinted windows on dubs. So if that ain't you, stay off here dissin' a album that's pure gold. With tracks like 4,6,10, and 18, this album tells bout the life in the hood.

This is not real rap.","review":"50 Cent has to be one of the most overrated artists to come around in the past 10 years. It seems that both media hip-pop fans and underground hip-hop fans love this guy. I just can't understand why. First off, let me list off some reasons why I feel he sucks:-He has no flow-He shows absolutely no emotion. He has the same boring, monotone vocals in each song.-He's another rapper who tries to get by on good beats, rather than lyrical talent.-On the song, \\"Patiently Waiting\\", Eminem embarasses the man on his own track. You can obviously tell who the better lyricist is here.-All he talks about is how he's going to kill people.-He has an annoying slur.The only good songs on \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\\" are \\"Patiently Waiting\\" (which is good only because of Eminem), \\"21 Questions\\" (Nate Dogg saves this one from sucking), and \\"Life's On The Line\\" (A hidden track which was made before he got shot and gained that annoying slur)."},{"rating":"1","title":"no stars if i could","review":"pure garbage. to rap means to talk and implies thatyou have something to say, i got some rap for you,'this disc sucks'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Now we moved past weak voices to mumbing ones?

He has no talent. Being shot 9 times is no excuse for sucking this bad.

The album is consistently enjoyable and riveting from start to finish. This is where the repetitive part comes in. The hard-hitting, thumping beats that comprise 50 Cent's album ultimately meld all the songs together. After listening to album for a long time, all the songs really do start to sound the same due to the Dr. Dre/Eminem-produced power beats that emphasize each track. The single exception to this is \\"21 Questions,\\" a delightful surprise tucked in toward the end of the album that shows a completely different facet of 50 as well as a different aspect to the album.Overall, it's a great album to listen to in your car, your living room, \\"in da club\\" or anywhere you may be. Go out and cop it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is worth about 50 cents","review":"This guy can't rap. Not only that but he encourages all kinds of things that are terrible.

Don't worry about getting them out again - there's more on this album you'll want to not hear too. Track 5, In Da Club is simply terrible. That's it, no further explanation needed. Once music was a simple thing. People played a jolly tune into a recording device, people played it and danced about a bit. Now we need professional psychiatric care for an audience assaulted by the likes of track six, High All the Time on a regular basis.Five people died whilst Heat was being created. I can only say that they are the lucky ones and missed out on what sounds like my guitar gently weeping (pus that is). I had to abandon listening to track 8, If I Can't after my nose and ears began to bleed. Like My Style (feat. Tony Yayo of G Unit)? No, no, no, no and no. Horrible. Like 50 Cent's own internal organs attempting to end it all towards the end of the track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loose Change","review":"Wanksta was a good song. In Da Club was ok. The rest of the album is just BAD. Don't take me the wrong way by the title to this(ie. Loose Change), I hate Ja Rule's rap too, but Get Rich Or Die Tryin isn't worth the money. Most of the beats are really good - wether it was Eminem or Dre or whoever else that produced it, I'd buy this CD if it had the Instrumentals.But the truth is, Fitty definately does NOT deserve the hype he's getting. Obie Trice is so much better than him, and D12 totally outdoes Fitty's gUnit. Though I found his tracks Back Down and Order of Protection kinda funny and how they made fun of Ja, but the CD isnt worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can anyone like this?","review":"This guy sounds like he has a speech impediment. The only positive thing about this CD is that some of the songs are mildly catchy. When I first heard this \\"artist\\" on the radio, I laughed. I would be so ashamed of myself if I had a song called \\"In Da Club.\\" First of all, \\"the\\" is a really easy word to spell but he somehow gets it wrong, and writing about how shallow you (Get rich or die trying) is pretty tacky.

He only made himself look bad because no one saw his point (even his fellow rappers thought it was in bad taste). The worst offense to rap music this year is 50 Cents's \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin\\" which is painfully dated. Gangsta rap died when 2Pac and Biggie died. Plus, this cd is not even \\"gangsta\\".

If you want to buy a hiphop album thats actually worth your time and money get \\"The Unseen\\" by Quasimoto. or \\"No Man's Land\\" by Souls of Mischief. Dont even waste your 50 cents on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre lyrics","review":"I really like Dr. Dre's production on \\"In Da Club\\" and \\"What Up Gangsta\\". It's very widescreen and explosive. Dre really knows how to craft beats around the persona of the artist he is working with; whereas on Em's albums he creates beats that belong in some strange cartoon funk world, here he makes cinematic blockbuster beats, like a gangstered up Jerry Bruckheimer film. 50's lyrics, however, are just lists of cliches. I remember Guru from Gangstarr rapping that \\"too many rappers wanna be gangstas, too many gangstas wanna be rappers.\\" This is what he was talking about. Give me talent over street cred any day..on top of that, dude looks like some kinda corny pop'n'lock action figure. In a few years he'll be singing duets with J.Lo, just wait..."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't know it was edited","review":"Didn't realize it was the edited version of the album.

Thanks Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO DIRTY LYRICS???? Awesum album, however","review":"I love 50 cent and i love this cd, however, i think it was kind of dumb to make a version of the album which has no curse words on it. i didn't see the point of that. i own the dirty version and it's a million times greater. i give the dirty version five stars, but i only give the Clean version one star out of five. the dirty version is the greatess rap album evr. that and 'jackpot' by chingy. for real good metal albums, buy limpbizkit 'Chocolate Starfish and the hotdog flavored water' and or linkin park 'meteora'."},{"rating":"2","title":"JA YOU BETTER WATCH OUT DOG","review":"This is the hottest album out right now. If you are a rap fan, you must have this album in your collection. It fuses hardcore street lyrics with excellent production from Dre. Its justs sounds awesome. Put the the CD in the deck and just listen. Great DVD extras only bolster this awesome package from 50. Columbia made a huge mistake dropping this cat from their roster. He came along way dragging alot of haters, he addresses this on the album. Just cop it. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm ashamed to listen OR look at him...","review":"I though Mase was bad... I'm actually beginning to like him now since 50 cent came out. And, does he actually think he looks touch staring with that \\"hard\\" expression on his face? No! He looks constipated. Then, he smiles... he looks like a baby crapping its diaper. He has no talent, he has only one tone to his voice and he raps so softly, you can barely understand him. I mean, he could be rapping \\"Do not pass go Don't collect $200\\" and no one wouldn't notice. In a couple of years, he's gonna fade out, like most no-talent wannabes."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wouldn't pay 50 cents for this","review":"Oh my God this is filled with complete garbage. Just a bunch of pop culture phrases and made up nonsense words in rhyme, whenever two quarters here talks about guns it just makes you think about committing suicide.

This album drops some scarce beats throughout, but 50 Cent's errant attempts at laying anything down lyrically fail miserably through an album that wholly lacks substance, innovation, and cleverness. 50 Cent's recent popularity is a sad testament as to what can pass as hip-hop in an industry that regards true talent as an afterthought. Essentually, \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin\\" is another lame CD on a long list of recent pop-rap that plays off all the same cliches in mainstream hip-hop that have generally fueled its demise. If you want to listen to hip-hop that truely displays substance and character, listen to Blackstar, Mos Def, Common, Talib Kweli, Jurassic 5, and anything by the Roots."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolute disgrace","review":"this album is an absolute disgrace to hip-hop. there is no decent song on this cd that hasnt been heard on the radio (which i dont like anyway), i only got this because my mate almost forced me to, saying it was so good. the next day i beat him up. i strongly recommend to everyone not to buy this, you will be disappointed like i am. it seems there are no decent hip-hop albums coming out these days, except for the recent Too $hort album. if you want real rap from THE pimp, get any TOO $HORT album, not this fricken impostor, 50 cent. every too $hort album is better than this (and he has 14 albums), which says something.

The first time I heard \\"Wanksta,\\" I felt unmoved. It was just another rap song. \\"In Da Club\\" was okay the first five hundred times, and that was only because it was catchy and had a decent beat. The lyrics...mediocre. And that is how I would describe the rest of his songs: average. People rave for miles about how 50 Cent's lyrics are the \\"realest\\" and how he's one of the best out there right now.Don't kid yourselves: He's not. To me, he is simply a fad. I notice a lot of 50 Cent fans are people who never listened to rap to begin with. Perhaps because he's a novelty?I don't recommend this CD to real rap fans. Some of the songs on \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\\" may be tolerable, but I don't see the point in supporting an artist that feels the need to claim how \\"real\\" and \\"gangsta\\" he is incessantly. If you're real, you don't need to repeat it 500 times.

Then a creep with a record label came along and thought, \\"That is really good [music]!\\" But he was wrong.50 Cent is like a slug, or in his little \\"I think I'm the coolest human on earth\\" language, a 'wanksta.'

If you listen to the radio EVER or watch MTV you have without a dobut heard the maybe over commercialized: 'In tha Club', '21 ?'s' and the very catchy 'P.I.M.P', however you may have missed 'Patiently waiting' which is a sick and dark mix of lyrical prose and geniues on the part of 50 as well as Shady CEO and MC MASTER Marshall Mathers.

The collabos with Em are very good, with Paitently Waiting being the best track on the record and Ems verse is off the hook.

For one, he lacks flow and rhyming ingenuity. He isn't saying anything I ain't heard before. The only thing he has going for him is his image and a wealth of fans who love him for his image. If you like it, go ahead and listen to it, but if you really think that he can spit, go out and buy yourself some Hieroglyphics and give yourself a crash-course in lyricism. Trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Power of a dollar\\" kicked ass than this...","review":"To me 50 cent's very first album \\"Power of a Dollar\\" was more Hip Hop at its purest than \\"GRODT\\".

The rest of the tracks are just repeated attemps to get a single. Real \\"thugs\\" don't name drop, brag or boast about the things they needed to do to survive. 50 is the platinum plus performance thug he so desperatley tries to critisize.

But on his 2nd album what was there to rap about. So this cornball had to go after MCs that's far more Better then him to save his rap career.

Obviously I am a big fan of his songs my top 5 would be: 1.Heat 2.P.I.M.P3.In Da Club 4. Don't Push me 5. Bloodhound. You guys need to realize what has happened to 50 Cent(stabbed, shot, and etc.) and give him credit where credit is do.

He's very monotone and he is not pleasant to listen to. I guess he writes decent lyrics, but who can make out the mumbo jumbo that comes out of his mouth? Anyway, some of the beats are cool (In Da Club would be great without words) but, I have to agree with other reveiwers who hate the self proclaimed \\"pimps\\".

The subject matter throughout the album is trite and sends a message that rap music is violent and 50 comes off incredibly shallow, its all guns and drugs. There is a song or 2 thats ok but basically I don't care if 50 got shot, gets high all the time, does'nt call the cops when he is shot or how much he hates lapd or nypd.

The reason it gets 2 1/2 stars is because the CD gets old and repetitive, but it's tolerable. ALl 50 Cent really raps about is street violence and being the best. I can't really hate 50 Cent, because he dissed Ja Rule, which made him stop making more irritating music. It's bullcrap that 50's getting so much hype from the media and the so-called fans. How the hell could this CD sell more than Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle? I'm sure some of you remember when Vanilla Ice was cool. Then people started thinking he sucked (which he did anyway.) That's probably how 50's career will end. Everybody has to take MTV seriously on what's cool and what's not. Half the reason 50 Cent gets so much attention is because he got shot nine times.

All have nice beats, especially the intense \\"Patiently Waiting\\". \\"21 Questions\\" with Nate Dogg is a great song with nice soft beat, with timeless lyrics (And always remember girl we make mistakes/to make it up I do whatever it take/I love you like a fat kid love cake). \\"Wanksta\\" is actually not 1 of his better songs, but a street anthem nonetheless. \\"High All the Time\\" is a dope track too.This is one of the best debut albums to come out in awhile.

Almost all of the songs contain references to Ja Rule or when he got shot, or some other thing he did. All he does is big himself up for doing all that stuff, or make fun of someone who didn't! The beats are pretty tight, but what do you expect out of Em and Dre?Another thing, the edited version is terrible!! They edit out words like high, gun, shoot, pop, and stuff like that!! IT'S INSANE!! If you're gonna waste money on this crap, get the dirty version. Or get a cheap copy of it so you don't have to waste money. The only song that's good on this album is Patiently Waiting, and that's only because of Em. 50 has good flow, but he's SOLD-OUT!!!

Of course the popular \\"In da club\\" is a hot track but tracks like \\"Don't push me\\" with Eminem and Lloyd Banks, \\"Like my style\\" with Tony Yayo and \\"Patiently Waiting\\" with Eminem again, are off the hook as well, just to name a few.With high expectations, they were fullfilled after listening to this CD.

Though i liked the track Patiently Waiting because of Emimen's wicked rhymes and his mad flow, i also liked Don't Push Me, because of Eminem's and LLyod Bank's masterful touch.

It doesn't even deserve the one star I'm giving it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not up to scratch...","review":"First of all let me say that I was really looking forward to seeing this version. I adore the 1995 one with Hinds and Root, think it's marvelous and was hoping for more of the same. In comparison this was like the high school (and not terribly talented one) freshman class play. Bryan Marshall was good as Wentworth, but Ann Firbank was inexcusably wooden as Anne. Not to mention her wig was horrendous. It made her so top heavy I kept expecting her to fall over! The set was stagey, but given the year of the production I more or less expected that. Just not up to scratch.They get two stars for having completed the production but not for much else."},{"rating":"1","title":"no comparison!","review":"The actress playing Anne was 38 at the time! Apart from that, there is no comparison with the exquisite portrayal by Amanda Root in the 1995 movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as enjoyable as \\"P2\\" (Root/Hinds version)","review":"It's still Jane Austen, so how bad could it be? It gets 2 stars automatically just because it is an adaptation of my favorite book written by my favorite author, but I firmly believe that going out of your way to cram as much of Jane Austen's words as possible into an adaptation does not necssarily make it a good adaptation. I didn't like the casting, I hated the costumes (especially Anne's green plaid dress!), the hair was laughable (dittos to the Caroline Bingley allusion!), and the acting was wooden. If I wanted the audiobook, I would have rented that instead of this. This reeks of the '70s; get the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful betrayal of Austen","review":"As a huge fan of JA and someone who thought the Amanda Root/Cioran Hinds version coud use improvement, I ordered this older version thinking Captain Wentworth might be better cast in this one and some of the scenes left out of that production might be explored in this.NO!!! Everything about this production is a disappointment. The actors are overly (and obviously) made up in a way that screams inaccuracy for the time period; the acting is stilted all around; the actress who plays Ann is WAY too old for the part; and the sets are dismal. I literally couldn't get through it. I then gave it to my Mom who is a rabid Austen fan and she, who generally will watch anything based on Austen, called and asked if I minded if she just threw it away!! The definitive filmed version of Persuasion will just have to wait for a future production..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was awful.","review":"I did not like this adaptation at all!! Persuasion is my favorite Jane Austen novel and the 1995 version with Root and Hinds IS the one to watch. This BBC adaptation from the seventies makes you laugh for all the wrong reasons, (the \\"Regency Bouffant\\" hairstyle of \\"Anne\\" is a howler! Every scene is dominated by her hair. ) I was sorry that I wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT the video with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds","review":"The writeup on this video is wrong. The 1995 version of Persuasion is the video with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. This version was made in the mid-70s and is tedious, dull, and boring. It was so bad that I could not bring myself to finish watching it, and I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to adaptations of Jane Austen novels.By all means, buy the 1995 version, as it is a quiet classic, but avoid this one like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Faithful to the Book and Really Bad!","review":"This is my favorite Jane Austen novel next to Pride and Prejudice. The Masterpiece Theatre versions of classic novels have usually been very faithful to the books, but this version deviates drastically and tediously expands the story to four hours. Every subtle nuance in the book is drawn out and explained just to fill out the time. Thank god Masterpiece Theatre improved and got better. The 70's versions of Emma and Pride and Prejudice are fantastic. The movie version from 1995 is more faithful to the book and the characters as well as being great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Atrocious","review":"I decided to watch this after reading the book (for the nth time) and watching the Amanda Root/Ciaran Hinds film. I nearly laughed out loud, but it was far too painful for laughter. The feel of the production is that of an early Monty Python skit without the jokes, although the actress playing Anne is unaccountably amused most of the time. Even taking into account the low budget and primitive equipment of the time, this is a poor effort. Haven't seen the ITV 2007 production yet, but it's got to be better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save yourself tedious hours","review":"Picked this up at the library. I can't say one good thing about it. The costumes were not authentic fabrics for the period, the editing was sloppy, the cinematography downright stunk, it dragged horrendously with a \\"walking\\" scene that was ludicrous, the acting was like a \\"first read\\" at community theatre (maybe worse), the Admiral flubbed most of his lines, the lead, Anne, looked much older than she was supposed to be....and what was with that hair? They were all just reading their lines...no emotion whatsoever........Save your precious time and don't watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes a favorite story BORING!","review":"This out-dated, low budget adaptation is awful. It does stick to the book as far as events and takes the time to tell the story. But it makes one of my favorite books seem so dull! I struggled getting through this one. If you're a fan, I'd recommend the Amanda Root version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I am big fan of the BBC 10970's era Pride and Prejudice and Sense & Sensibility so I thought I would enjoy this as well.Persuasion is my favorite Jane Austen novel.Sadly, between the 60 years old Anne who lacked that inner fire, the Little house on the prairie fabrics and the scary mismatched interiors I had difficulty watching this film.It didn't help that Capt Wentworth never bothered to steal a secret glance so we hoped maybe he still cared.There was no follow through, so the letter he writes at the end made no sense.See the Persuasion with Amanda Root.Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"persuasion","review":"I enjoyed side A, but side B wouldn't play, so I went through the process of getting a refund as there was not guarantee that the next DVD wouldn't have the same defect. Amazon has refunded the full amount."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling acting and hideous video quality","review":"I couldn't even sit past the second scene. The actors seemed as if they were reading their scripts without any direction or preparation; it was shot for TV in a way that simply doesn't hold up compared with modern productions, and the sets and costumes are unbearably '70s. I could do a better production myself just by getting my friends together for a casual reading and videotaping it, and so could you.I strongly recommened reading the book (which is fantastic), then watching the '90s movie, which though very understated and not as explanatory as it should be, is at least watchable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"Let me count the ways:Bad writing. At first I thought they were trying for a \\"Pulp Fiction\\" type of wittily semi-meaningless dialogue, then I gave up and decided it was just BAD. Translated from a German screenplay, but this wouldn't be any better auf Deutsch.Bad direction. The action scenes look like an episode of \\"Cops\\", the sex scenes look like porn.Bad acting. Chad Lowe's wall-pounding men's-room rant about some half-explained record company lawsuit is as bizarre as any I have ever seen. Hilary Swank's accent seems to change from Brooklynese in the first scene to Minnesotan in the finale.Even the squealing guitar music is bad. ...Hilary Swank has come a LONG way from this swill to \\"Boys Don't Cry.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"? Yeah!","review":"This was awful. All I can say is if you are a Hilary Swank fan, rent it so you can quit walking past it with curiousity in the video store. Just get it out of the way and done with. Obviously it's only been released to make a few bucks out of Swanks's breakthrough in Boys Don't Cry. Her only good part in the movie is at the end. Chad Lowe is hideous in it, each part dragged on and on- my fast forward button served me well. Jeez, what a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleeechhh!!!!","review":"Possibly the worst movie ever made - dialogue was improved immensely by putting it on Fast Forward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sugoi onchi","review":"This 7-track, 23-minute CD of a 3-girl band from Shizuoka, Japan consists of barely passable guitar playing, but whatever merit the guitar playing may have is ruined by the terribly off-key lead singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way better movie than I expected","review":"OK, it IS an Ed Wood movie so it ain't all that good. The acting was wooden, everything was done on the cheap as expected, ect, ect. But not a bad movie all and all. The plot was easy to follow, there was a little bit of intrigue. And the fight scene featuring Ed Wood himself posing a a thug, which seemed to go on forever, was worth the price of the movie by itself.Negatives........the \\"burned to order\\" format is kind of crappy. The root menu is confusing although if you just start with the first thing to come up you will get through it easily enough. That could have been done better. No info on the slip cover either, other than the title and what amounts to an ad for Sinister Cinema, but nothing about the actual movie itself. That could be doctored up a bit to at least point out that this is a Woodie. But it seems if you are ordering this in the first place you would know that.Buy it, it is a \\"Lost Woodie\\" that most folks don't even know about let alone have seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Farberware Fan","review":"I have purchased other pan sets and yet always seem to come back to Farberware....I would like to point out that this set does not have a proper sized skillet (10 inch). The 9 inch is great for grilled cheese or one hamburger, and the 7 inch for frying eggs. I had to purchase additional pans to \\"round out\\" this set, which is why it only got a 4 star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Product","review":"Almost 50 years ago, my Mom bought us a complete Farberware Cookware Set and about 10 years ago,(still is great condition), I gave them to our daughter who is still using them. Having to purchase a new cookware set, after much research (because of all the different sets available), I decided to purchased the Farberware Classis S/S, W/glass lids. I am more then pleased with them. The only thing that I would change is the frying pans by making them stainless steel W/O non-stick instead of aluminum with non-stick, to match the rest of the set and not be a throw away item after the non-stick goes."},{"rating":"2","title":"great value cookware","review":"This Farberware set is a great value for the price.

I own a similar set of the same brand and have been very pleased with it. So far the recipiant has LOVED them and uses them frequently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Set of Pots and Pans","review":"I really like this set of pots and pans. It works very well for my needs and it proves to be easy to clean since we don't run them through our dishwasher. The handles have become a little lose over time but they are easy to tighten right back up. These pots are really good for a small kitchen since the pans are on the smaller side. The glass lids are nice but the non-stick pans do not come with any lids. I would recommend this set as a great buy. We are planning on purchasing more of these pans in a larger size as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"very happy","review":"I bought this set for my daughter as a starter set. She loves it.

Yes, 11 years is a long time, but I selected what I thought was a well-made set of pans that I hoped would last a lifetime. One large lid that fits my 2 largest pans recently broke. The handles pieces have come apart and cannot be reassembled as the parts are stripped. I emailed photos of the broken pieces but was told that this could not be accepted as proof of the broken product. The company verbally offers a replacement \\"if the product is still available\\" but only if I mail in the pieces in question. With the prices of shipping and the question about whether they'll actually ship something that fits my pans, I feel really disappointed in Farberware products. I wouldn't recommend this brand for durability or customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing \\"Classic\\" about his set","review":"Cost of steel is up, so Farberware cheaps out -- instead of the steel lids on traditional Farberware, and the lids that are included in the larger \\"Classic\\" sets, this set has far less durable glass lids. For years Farberware has cut corners by including thin, cheap no-stick fry pans in its sets, but this is a new low. Maybe in a few years they'll be selling plastic pots and pans? A real shame -- another American brand that once signified quality now makes disposable products."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY THIS","review":"This is the worst product ever, don't buy this.

I would not recommend them for every day, long term use because of their cheap quality. Also, the handles are made of a lightweight plastic so make sure they aren't near the hot burner! On the bright side, the lids fit nicely and there were various sizes of pans and pots to accommodate most basic cooking.

The steel pots are perfect. I am not crazy about the non-stick ones, wish they had covers too, and a bit heavier. Besides, I don't care for non-stick surface as much because it could leave toxins after a scratch. I like the glass lids, they are easier to clean. The size of most pots in this set is fairly small which you may not realize from the size provided in quarts, but appropriate for a small household's kitchen. Overall, it's a pretty good quality set for the price compared to all those other brands with highly inflated prices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Received this set UPS today and returned to Amazon.com today also.

It is impossible for me to tell the difference between the ones I print at home and lab-produced prints. I think it is certainly worth the price Amazon is currently charging. This paper beats out Kodak Picture Paper for quality, as well as the HP papers I've tried,even better than Jet Print Professional papers I've used.

Souljah's Revenge,Representin' 93, Keep Ya Head Up, Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z, I Get Around and Papa'z Song are all great songs, Keep Ya Head Up,I Get Around and Papa'z Song are most likely considered to be the classics from this album.

Me Against The World & All Eyez On Me completely blow this album away. But this does not mean that this is not a good album, because it is. There are a few really good songs like Keep Ya Head and I Get Around, my favorite song on this album is the title track. I think that this CD would be a lot better if the production wasn't so low-quality. I'm not saying that the beats aren't good, but on some of the songs you can barely hear Pac's voice. This is a CD that would be worth a digital remastering. But Overall I would say that this is must-have for any true 2pac fan it is better than 2pacalypse Now and it is definitely better than Until The End Of Time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Pac Album","review":"Ok Ok, I know alot of people will disagree with me on that seeing most people say that about say All Eyez On Me or Me Against The World. But this album is just incredible. Pac was at his pinnacle with lyrical skills and dropped some sick rhymes while the hard hitting beats fitted the lyrics perfectly. There are some seriously good songs on here with my favourite, Keep Ya Head Up. Thats my favourite ever...period. I just simnply love that song. Other classic joints are - Last Wordz, Holler If Ya Hear Me, I Get Around, Papa'z Song, The Streetz R Death Row, 5 Deadly Venomz, Peep Game and more. Yes and I see people knocking the production, the production rulz. The beats aren't supposed to be like the smooth g funk of albums like The Chronic. As I said before, this album is full of hype.

I bought the CD at first for \\"I get around\\" and \\"Keep ya head up\\" but as soon as I heard \\"Holla if ya hear me\\", I was HOOKED from his awesome portrait of what the hood looked like from the inside.I was as sadened as most to hear that 2 Pac had been gunned down and his voice had been silenced. Thank God, he had so many tracks already laid down that he could come out with so many albums after his murder.

Usually umbrella strollers don;t have such good back support.Easy to fold unfold.Only thing which it lacks is the weight, it is almost as heavy as normal strollers, I was hoping it to be little bit lighter for easy carrying around. Also the foot rest is little short, so it is not comfortable for kid to sleep.Overall serves the purpose of sturdy compact stroller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stroller","review":"I love this stroller. it is heavier than other umbrella strllers, which is a bonus. It doesn't feel flimsy like the lighter weight imbrella strollers. My daughter is 7 months old and very squirmy. it is easy to fold and lift with one hand which is priceless if you live in a large city. I just wish it had a bar across the front and it would be perfect. I have no complaints, it handles nicely and the price was awesome. I also own a Graco Quarto Tour Deluxe and love Graco products. i do wish the seating postions were a bit better, but again, overall, this stroller is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Umbrella Stroller","review":"This is a nice stroller. I bought this one over the Chicco Capri because it can hold up to a 50 pound child, has a multi position recline and I have a 2 year old and 4 year old. The only 2 negative comments I have is the way the seat reclines and the adjustable leg rest. I like the fact that it reclines all the way, but my 4 year old is less than 40 pounds and when he sits in it, his weight reclines the seat pretty far back, although he doesn't seem to mind, and there is no way for me to make the seat sit fully upright when he is in it. Also, I don't see the point in the adjustable leg rest. Either mine doesn't work properly or it was just a poor design. OVERALL, I like this stroller. It folds up nicely, doesn't take up a lot room when folded, strolls nicely, and looks nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, compact, stroller","review":"We wanted a compromise between a compact umbrella stroller and a large, durable, one. This stroller gives us just that. It's rugged and provides a smooth ride. Easy seat adjust. Easy setup and collapse. Fits nicely in the trunk --smaller than a golf bag. Only complaint is the canopy. It can detach easily during stroller setup/collapse; and it only has 2 positions (expanded/collapsed). The height of handles is fine for both my wife and I. I am 5'11\\" and she's 5'3\\". I don't have to hunch over. Overall, this has been a great stroller. We've had it about 2 1/2 months now."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's ok","review":"After some research, we decided to buy this umbrella stroller, because of three things:1. Space: Even Though we have a pretty good trunk space in our minivan, our huge stroller was taking more than 50% of that space, with this one the problem is solved.2. It is really easy to fold.3. It reclines, so our almost 7 month old girl can still take a good nap.What we don't like about the stroller is the shade. This shade comes off really easy.Overall it is a good stroller, if it weren't for the shade, we would give it 5 stars.Update: Our daughter is 3 1/2 years now and still uses the stroller. we have taken this stroller to several trips abroad, to cities with extreme hard to walk sidewalks. The stroller is still in good shape. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible sitting position","review":"I bought this stroller based on some reviews. The majority were good including Consumer Reports. But a couple reviews mentioned this poor sitting position. The stroller has an adjustable seat but in the full upright position you can very lightly pull back on the seat and it will drop right down to a 45 degree position. The very motion of my toddler getting in to the seat and sitting back, for example, was enough to push the seat back. I returned the unit. Luckily, Amazon has this postage paid (Amazon picks up the bill) return option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned it","review":"I bought this stroller for my upcoming travels, needing a maneuverable and lightweight but sturdy stroller. When the Graco IPO arrived I had to do some minor assembly including putting on the wheels which I could not complete because the push-in locking assembly for one of the rear wheels was stuck inside the leg, making it impossible to securely attach the wheel. So it went back that night. I got a Maclaren Volo instead, which requires virtually no assembly, is smaller, and is more maneuverable although I found the Graco IPO to be easier to fold and unfold and I preferred the darker fabric. I don't think the Maclaren is completely worth the price, but for me so far it is better than the Graco IPO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome stroller!","review":"Purchased this stroller for my 2 1/2 yr old who is 39\\" tall and is 37 lbs. This is a beautiful stroller. Easy to put together (actually my 16 yr old put it together for me). However, the stroller does not accommodate a taller toddler. Her head was about 5\\" above the back rest and she looked \\"stuffed\\" into the stroller. Like I said I love the stroller itself. It is sturdy, has a nice size basket underneath, and handles are perfect height. I just wish it were a little wider and taller! I would even toss the canopy aside and add more inches to the back rest! Hope Graco is listening!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Don't waste you money! Recieved the stroller and used twice before the handle cracked and it squeaks so bad that I couldn't stand it. Back was constantly falling down and my daughter only weighs 20 lbs. Poor design!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How is this going to hold up to 50 lbs?","review":"The construction of this stroller is sturdy and relatively lightweight. Our main issue with it is when it's in the recline position our 2 year old, who is about 36\\" and 30lbs, her head would be almost over the top of the stroller. And there's this \\"pouch\\" for the head that just fits her current height, so I can't imagine how a 35-50lb child would fit comfortably in the IPO. I'm sure this stroller is great for pre-toddler children, but we were looking for something light and maneuverable for the occasions when our toddler is tired and wants to rest. Maybe they should advertise this as up to 50lbs and up to 36inches."},{"rating":"1","title":"back seat collapses even when brand new","review":"I received this stroller as a gift. Even before using it for the first time, the back seat stays collapsed in the horizontal position.The customer service told me the would send a new piece, but I have doubts it will work since I read in many reviews that it does not solve the problem.I am REALLY disappointed with Graco.Bottom line : You get what you pay for!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better choices","review":"I was excited when I found this stroller. I thought it was a great price for a reclining umbrella stroller but this is a case of you get what you pay for and the low price is not a value. The canopy on this stroller is terrible, that is my biggest complaint. I have since replaced it with a Baby Planet stoller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I bought this stroller for it's wider frame and compactness. I had this stroller for about three months and was very satisfied...then the seat started to recline whenever my son was sitting in it. We had to use a bungy cord to hold the seat in an upright position. I tried to return it to the store I had bought it from but it had exceeded the 45 day return policy. Graco is replacing the fabric portion of my stroller but I have no doubts that the same thing will happen after a short time of use. At $130.00 I consider this stroller to be a very expensive piece of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it at first but...","review":"I loved everything about this stroller, but I noticed after a few uses that the front wheel does not touch the ground,so the stroller veers off to the left constantly. I have 4 boys, so I need something that I can push with one hand, and it was very hard to push. I returned it BRU with full intentions of getting another one, but noticed the floor model was doing the same thing, and the one at Target did the same thing as well. I am disappointed because everything else about the stroller was great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST STROLLER OUT THERE!","review":"After so much research and \\"testing\\" out strollers, this is by far the best umbrella stroller out there, esp for the price.

It folds up super small and has a handle for carrying. We loved it for the airport. It is also great that it is umbrella size and reclines. Even older kids get wore out! Also the basket holds lots of stuff. I did buy a seperate cup holder...it is a great stroller!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Graco umbrella stroller","review":"I looked at Consumer Reports and reviews on-line before purchasing this stroller. I was not happy with how heavy it was and the shade comes off everytime you close up the stroller (the only good thing is that it closes up compact and very easy). I also have a regular combi stroller that I bought with my combi carseat and infant carrier and that's far lighter and manuevers better. I would not recommend this stroller if you're under 5'3\\" and small frame because the handles are made for someone around 5'7\\" or taller and it's heavy to get in/out of the car."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy - Go for quality (even if it costs a bit more)!","review":"We bought this stroller beginning or middle of June and right from the start it gave us trouble. The axle to the wheels were misaligned and the front wheels would not touch the ground so going for a walk was always a struggle steering! I met another lady in my building who saw me struggling with the stroller and she mentioned that her Graco stroller had the same problem! We are so disappointed because it one of the only strollers that has a seat that can be placed horizontally so baby can sleep comfortably. We only wish we saved the box so we could return it. We just bought a McClaren which I can now steer so easily (I can even steer with one finger and it goes where i need it to go)!

I was very hesitant to buy an umbrella stroller and researched just about every one of them. I chose this one because of price and reviews by others. It is comfortable for my 2 year old and she enjoys riding in it. The only issue I have had is the mechanism to fold the stroller sometimes comes out all the way. There are 2 small prongs that I sometimes must push back in, in order to lock the stroller in position for my daughter to get in. This is pretty minor and I think I may be to forceful when I fold the stroller. That is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for moms, not for babies or toddlers!","review":"This stroller has a horrible sitting position, the sides are not padded so when you baby falls asleep the head touches the metal frame and the baby gets a mark because of that plus sometimes his head gets stuck in there. But for a mom is perfect! Light and easy to maneuver. Please before you buy this stroller think about your baby being comfy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I had it sooner","review":"I bought this to replace my Combi lightweight/compact stroller which my daughter has outgrown. She's 5, but I still find her wanting to ride or be carried. The combi became increasingly more difficult to maneuver with a larger child. This Graco IPO more than accommodates her (she's about 38 lbs) and I have complete control and maneuverability. The storage area under the seat is more than enough room for whatever I've needed so far. Plus the dual handles make for places to hang bags when shopping."},{"rating":"1","title":"meat grinder plates","review":"First of all the plates were what I wanted however the diamter is wrong. it is too small to fit my grinder.

While it does fall into the lad/caper formula, this book is a much finer piece of writing than other examples of the genre. He has so many wonderful, comical observations of everyday life that I found utterly delightful. Light, easy and very funny - don't listen to the grumpy reviewers - it's pure formula but very well executed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific novel","review":"I found this a terrifickly well realized novel, driven less by plot than by the characters' ambivalent relationships to their various backgrounds, which collide in the life of the laconic, but sensitive, narrator. It's not lad lit as usual, but carefully staged observations about those things that swirl around and within us. The last few scenes contain, certainly, some of the weaker ones of the novel, but there's something of interest on every page. Laird's just a wonderful writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 Stars for Excellent Description - But Room for Improvement","review":"I gladly give this book 4 stars because the descriptions are sometimes stunningly astute. A joy to read. Perhaps it's my age (60 year old female), but I found the \\"teenage boy\\" humor/jokes too infantile. A lawyer thinking and sometimes acting like a 12 year old does not work for me.

And I don't say that about just anything.","review":"Having the pleasure (and no doubt embarassment) of being married to the most beautiful and famous novelist in London, Laird has no right to be this talented. What a debut novel! Wrongly dismissed as \\"lad lit\\" by stuffy critics, this shrewd and incisively written comedy of chickens coming home to roost is funny, compelling, craftily worded, but never ornate; the action flows fast but not fast enough to obscure Laird's sardonic skill, and the knowing details of slum life in Belfast and white-collar work in England. A terrific read-the most impressive debut I've seen in years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite as good as it could be","review":"I recognize that this is probably the most comprehensive book on Fireworks 3, but I am a little disappointed in it. There is lots of good information. It is sometimes overwhelming. There are examples in the book that you just can't follow along with. They give you the completed exercise but why not give you the starting graphics, give you directions and let you create the finished product yourself. I was also disappointed in several chapters on the CD ROM that didn't seem to have the correct files as the chapters in the book. So I decided to go to their web site to see if they had corrections. When I went to the site identified in the book, it was the site for the Fireworks 2 book. The book is an invaluable resource and should be in anyone's collection if they are working with Fireworks 3, but, in my opinion, this is not a 5 star book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice! But could have been a little better!","review":"This was a fairly good book. But, I found myself getting lost and confused several times while reading. I have never used Fireworks 3, and I have not used any other sort of graphics design program before. So I am new to graphics design. I found the book to be very helpful but confusing in a couple of chapters. I did have a few problems with the book. The first couple of chapters throw all the menus and tool options at you right off the bat. It kinda blew my mind, and I almost had a melt down! One last thing I didn't like about the book is the constant pointers to using Fireworks with Macintosh. I am ofcourse a Windows user, so I found the constant references to Mac pointless. I will remain a Windows user until the day I die, so I could of done without the references to Mac in the book. Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed the book.

It sounds like Refused meets Cro-Mags. Buy it and start a pit in your own bed room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kreg SML-F125-1000 Pocket Hole Screws","review":"A Good bargain if you plan on building lots of frames using your kreg jig. These screws are made specifically for the Kreg jig tool. It's hard to find these screws locally or they come in small bags or multi size packs. This is the size I use the most so I stocked up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Banding Banding Banding","review":"I decided to roll the dice after hearing the mixed reviews on this set. Unfortunately, my number didn't hit. While this set has fantastic specs, especially after tweaking the settings, the results are moot. I have three large bands that run from the left to the right of the screen. Sharp keeps saying they are working on a fix, but nothing yet. If this unit had no problems, it would be a five, but how can Sharp not recall a unit with glaringly obvious defects?"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 TVs, 2 cases of banding","review":"It took only a couple days for me to notice horizontal bands about a quarter of the way down from the top of the screen. They were most pronounced on solid-color backgrounds, but most severe on gray/black backgrounds. At first I thought I could deal with it, but when I watched HD channels my eyes were constantly drawn to it and it got really annoying. So I took it back to the store (luckily the appliance store has a generous return policy) and exchanged it for another one, hoping that this one wouldn't be afflicted. Unfortunately, same story, distracting horizontal bands, except this time they were closer to the middle of the screen and even worse. I think I'm going to take this one back as well and get a different TV altogether. The HD picture is great if you can ignore the bands, but it's just too much for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great TV","review":"I bought this television based on it being the highest rated by Consumer Reports and I am pleased. Great picture and sound. I really think the review would be better if I could tell you what it was like 3 years from now. Still, the 1080 is impressive. Also, I bought this through Amazon via Tiger Direct. The shipping was less than 5 days, a very nice extra."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent performance for my application","review":"Got this set in December to replace a twelve-year-old 35\\" Mitsubishi in our master bedroom. What an improvement in all categories of performance! NO BANDING OR ANY OF THE OTHER PROBLEMS OTHERS HAVE EXPERIENCED/IMAGINED. Ten additional digital channels received over basic Comcast cable. Both analog and digital broadcasts display seamlessly. Panasonic upsampling DVD/VHS and TIVO display beautifully. Major purchases should always go this well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp Aquos LC46D62U not the latest and greatest??","review":"I purchased the D62U instead of the latest product by Sharp, the D64U, to save a few dollars. Do I regret that decision? Heck, no. The difference between the two would be transparent to me. I find that the Aquos has a true black background which gives true colors. Set up is simple. It took about five minutes to learn the controls without reading the instructions (Yes, I'm a true male). The only time I needed the instructions was to put the base to the screen. I definitely recommend this model to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"HD Heaven","review":"Get it. Sharp delivers on the goods with this one. The picture quality is amazing, the speakers are as good as it gets built in, and the inputs are plentiful and easy to work with. I bet the newer Sharp Aquos model with upgraded features and the added HDMI input would also be sweet if the price comparison is close enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"New TV Doesn't Work","review":"I ordered my new 46\\" Sharp TV to watch during my surgery recovery. However 6 weeks after my \\"new\\" TV was installed, it still does not work. I am being told the AV board needs to be replaced however getting the Sharp warrenty contractor to replace it is almost impossible. I am now being told it will be another 2-3 weeks before it is fixed.

They told me repair was $1400 and were totally rude when I said TV is one year old and should not have bad board unless board was defective to begin with. Cindy Ranes basically told me to eat the TV and was totally useless to talk to on the phone. I would never buy another sharp product as it seems they make expensive throw away flat screens. Go ahead and buy if you want but be prepared to toss in a year or so as they are garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp Aquos and 1 Happy Customer","review":"I just purchased this unit, installed it and i love it I have 2 other units LCD and a Plasma and it is the best unit of the three. Great picture and brilliant display!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely satisified","review":"I bought this sharp about two weeks ago after many weeks of shopping around and debating between different brands, plasma, LCD, etc... This TV cost a little on the high-side of what I was looking to spend, but once I got it home I was not disappointed! The picture is great, even from a side angle. Fast motion sports don't suffer from any trail effect (4ms response!), and the OPC setting works well in my somewhat bright daytime living room. Plus full 1080p is nice! The over the air ATSC tuner picks up all of the local HD channels even without an amplified antenna. My one (insignificant) complaint is that the gloss black frame shows fingerprints too well. A flat/matte black would have been nicer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid Sharp","review":"Purchased this LCD from SharpDirect 3 weeks ago, its been broken for 2 weeks now and counting. Sharp does not want to replace it, they want to fix it in my home. The service technician does not work for Sharp. They are from some local third party. I own both a philips and a panasonic HD TVs that have had no issues.I have spent the past two weeks trying to sort this out with Sharp, but all I have received has been either incorrect information or no call backs.Spend your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY FROM SHARP!!!!!!","review":"After having a Magnavox TV for over 30 years without a problem, My family decided to update my parents to a LCD bigscreen.I thought this was the one to get..I was wrong.After a short period in time,the LCD screen went out.Lucky it was still under warranty.BUY A DIFFERENT TV!!

I purchased from Tigerdirect through Amazon. I am very pleased. I researched the internet for months before I purchased. I found the T.V. slightly cheaper from a few other sites, however, I couldn't find much info on these retailers so I purchased through Amazon. I paid 1499.99 plus 99 shipping last weekend when they had it on sale. I would still pay the near 1700 they are asking now. The picture is incredible. Tigerdirect has excellent customer service, they set up shipment through Roadway, who was great also, and I had the t.v. in 4 days. The picture w/ my ps3 through hdmi is unbelievable. I cannot wait for high def. programming. I am very pleased w/ this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great action movie...","review":"This is Segals best movie ever. The action is fast paced...the movie is never boring. The characters a well acted and Erica Elaniak (fine as ever). Fighting scenes are exceptional as in all Segals movies.

Other 10% of random scenes exhibited alot of grain and snow. Still a major improvement over the DVD release that I have viewed multiple times. Only wished they cleaned the whole movie. You won't miss the untreated scenes, extremely grainy. Otherwise, still a great movie in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guilty pleasure is right!","review":"As a card-carrying feminist, I have no business liking this movie at all, let alone keeping it active on my TiVo so I can dip into it now and again. So, why? Well, the over-the-top silliness of Gary Busey and Tommie Lee Jones is a big reason. Seagal's own acting style is so minimalist (he doesn't ACT in the usual meaning of that word!) that the movie needs Busey and Jones to go over the top, and they deliver. The direction/editing are fine for an action flick; none of the payoff sequences drags on a moment too long. And the script isn't nearly as stupid as one might expect; there's even occasional flashes of wit (Seagal, to the complaining Eleniak: \\"I thought you were all for equal rights for women.\\" Eleniak: \\"Only when it benefits me.\\") I actually waited with some anticipation for Under Siege II, but was sorely disappointed; that one lacks the pacing and fun of the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie for saturday afternoon","review":"typical steven seagal movie, he will deliver plenty of action,and always has a person in the film who dislikes him and becomes his enemy. set aboard a ww 2 abttle ship, this movie is historical ijn the fact, hollywood got to film aboard it , before the ship was sent to hawaii, tommy lee jones, and gary busey deliver good performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is NOT seagals best","review":"I dont know why people say this one is good. its soo bad. The only good things is Tommy Lee Jones, who does a really good performance. And thats all thats true about what i heard.

However, Internet access to any other site worked fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"This is definately one of those movies that you just want to watch again and again.

Well worth the purchase price for one of Steven Seagal's best movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT ACTION FILM","review":"UNDER SIEGE is a great action film. Seagal is in his typical hero (who has encountered government corruption/mistakes) form with great martial arts moves. The USS Missouri is a great platform and Gary Busey and Tommy Lee Jones are great \\"bad\\" guys. In fact, Jones has an absolute field day. Great performance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Out to Sea","review":"Seagal's immitation of Bruce Willis Die Hard pales in comparison. I've often wondered how Steven Seagal got a break in the movies. He seems possessed with the acting talents of a lawn gnome and his martial arts skills seem to consist of nothing more than a series of stunt men performing flips, slips and prat falls all around him everytime he blinks an eye. I would love to seem him in an actual M.A. competition, I don't believe he would get very far. He just seems too phoney to take seriously and as such, his movies suffer."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie ever made not to star Sly Stallone","review":"People please, give me a break. This is without a doubt one of the stupidest movies ever made. I mean c'mon! What's with all the 5 star reviews? Have you ever watched this sober? First of all, if I was in the US Navy I would feel highly insulted watching this. This film made the US Navy out to be a bunch of scared sheep ready for the slaughter.Tommy Lee Jones gets so tiring so fast, his hardline acting approach gets old instantly because in every movie he's in he plays the same character. He's as one dimensional as a 'Family Circus' cartoon.The waste of time and film it took to make this can only be salvaged in a 10 second scene, Erika Eleniak popping out of the cake. I mean wow, talk about a perfect bod! Her mammory protuberances were off the chart. Seriously, the woman is perfect. Except for that brief bit of nudity, this film should be burned along with Sylvester Stallone's classic prison movie 'Lock Up'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Under Siege","review":"My god! I can't believe how many people gave this film 5 stars. It's absolutely awfull! Don't get me wrong, I like action films, but this was one of the most dire films I have ever seen. But then, all of Segals films are a pile of steaming you know what. FOR GOD'S SAKE, SAVE YOUR MONEY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-worshipping, egomaniacal buffoonery","review":"What a bunch of worthlessness. Aren't even this ego-glutton's mindless fans getting tired of this man's endless worship of himself? Think about it: Seagal's made how many movies now? Okay, okay, now think about this: How many times have the bad guys touched him up?Answer: Never.At least John Wayne got shot in the leg (multiple times, mind you).At least Clint Eastwood had to survive a hanging and some pig slop thrown back at him in his career.But Seagal's giant ridiculous ego will not tolerate him to be even graized by a bad guy.Seagal sees himself as a god because Seagal, deep down, is stupendously insecure, just like any blustering bully on the block.Get over it, this man and his onscreen invincibility is as believable as a cartoon at this point. No, I take that back, even Tom managed to hit Jerry back once in a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"A younger, leaner Seagal","review":"This is probably one of Steven Seagal's better films.

Seagal is not afraid to let his audience laugh once in a while to ease the tension and Academy Award winner Tommy Lee Jones (Best Supporting Actor THE FUGITIVE) is a real SOB as a renegade Navy SEAL attempts to fire a nuclear missile into Honolulu after an attempt on his life. it is up to Steven Seagal and an exotic dancer hired to entertain the ship's captain at sea. compatable with the Playstation 3"},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD DVD TRANSFER","review":"Even though I've never been much of a fan of Mr. Seagal I remember having enjoyed this movie when it first came out on the theaters. And since Amazon had a good price on the Blue-Ray version of it, I decided to purchase the disc. What a disappointment! The movie starts out fine but very soon the picture becomes extremely grainy and full of noisy artifacts, to a point of distraction. It was difficult to enjoy the movie with so many annoying snowy picture. If I could I'd return it, but it's not worth the trouble. The only thing I can do about it is to vent my frustration at the people responsible for putting this turkey out, and to warn the potential buyers at what they are getting into when the buy this Blu-Ray version of Under Siege.Thanks!Rudasi"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Surprise","review":"I like Steven Segal even if he isn't found to be one of the most critically acclaimed actors of our time. He does an excellent job in this film, as does Tommy Lee Jones who is also one of my favorites. There are spectacullar shots of an amazing battleship and although the story is a bit far-fetched the writers and the actors have made it believable. There is a lot of ation in this film, and even a fair amount of comedy. This movie will get your patiortic side to show as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"A very good movie with perfect actors for the parts that they play. Steven Seagal does an out- standing job as the Seal who saves the day. Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey are excellent villains. The action is nonstop. Seagal uses his Seal skills to handle the forces of evil. Tommy Lee Jones plays the bad guy very well. The bad guys fall in droves when Seagal makes his move. The movie has an exciting ending. This is a must buy movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under Seige Bundle","review":"I purchased the Under Siege Bundle because I liked the movie and the bundle was less expensive than purchasing one by itself. The bundle is literally the DVD and the Blu-ray wrapped together in plastic. This is why I didn't give it 5 stars. I typically purchase bundles because I have a combination of TV's that are standard and high definition and some are not Blu-ray compatible. DVD Blu-ray bundles give me the flexibility to play the movie on any TV. I'm not sure when I'll get a chance to watch either of them, so I trust that the quality is normal for new movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo Zulu","review":"This is a fun movie to watch, lots of great Battleship footage, reasonably accurat portrayal of weapons launches.

I thought it was un necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Stupidity","review":"This is the worst action movie ever made, with the destroying of good actors like Gary Busey & Tommy Lee Jones who usual great actors in movies but they come off as lame, this rediculous action movie, where Steven Seagal doesn't get injured, it's just bufoon going doing killing that has no plot & even worst acting,it's more like a comdedy than an action movie if you think hard enough about it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Implausible, Old-Fashioned, Great!","review":"What a quaint, old-fashioned story!

AirLandBattle was conceived as a politically expedient approach with which to fight a ground war in West Germany, and by holding to the idea that NATO needed to defend a finite territory against superior numbers, they allowed some very shoddy operational thinking to make its way into official doctrine. The Cold War over, the problems remain.

The only disappointment is that his final two Top 40 hits on Warners (\\"Abigail Beecher\\" and \\"Action\\"--the theme from \\"Where the Action Is\\") are not included.

I can obtain school names for kids interested in certain area of study. The research for the details is still left to me, but Rugg's quick finding book allows me to gather in the details through research of my own.

It was last on my (very long!) list, having been added as an afterthought - then I saw it recommended for foreign-language majors in Rugg's and got really interested. A year later, I'm finishing my first semester at my ideal college. There's obviously no guarantee this would happen for other people, but I do believe that anyone who requires a certain strong program/s at their school of choice will appreciate this book. I also like that schools are grouped according to selectivity, another way of helping readers narrow down their options.

The author's spirited introduction sets the stage for learning about women who made a difference in their time.

Those who can are certain to enjoy this simple story about shoes, feet and multiples of 100. Fortunately, the story is short, fast-paced and has logical rhymes. Unfortunately, the \\"math\\" part is really only about three sentences long and includes only: two times fifty, five times twenty and ten times ten. Even so, with arithmetic seeming to sometimes take a back seat to reading and writing, this is an easy, fun way to expose your younger reader to the number 100 and some of its factors. Reading level is K through Second grade. This would be a great book to read during 100th Day of School celebrations.

Handy and beautifully crafted pull-out design appraisals by body type enhance the utility of the book. But the most compelling reason to include this book on your homework list before you buy an SL is for Olson's evaluation of the collectibility of each body type (and models within type) and the 8 factors that affect the value of a collectible car. While the book is a little skewed to the Gullwing and 300SL roadster, it's hard to argue with the author's obvious visceral appreciation of these works of automotive art, and the pictures and vignettes in the book are priceless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste (a lot) of Your Money on This Book","review":"I agree fully with David L. Stanley's review of this book. To spend over $60 on a publication that contains advertising is ridiculous. Granted, it does contain some useful technical information, but the bulk of this book serves as a diary of the author's adventures. If your looking for useful information when purchasing a Mercedes SL, there are plenty of other sources. For the price, this book might qualify as a coffee-table collectible, but its small size and print prevent even this. I will probably be throwing this one into the fire, so I won't be reminded in the future of how bad a ripoff it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly enjoyed reading this book","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, which is written by a real automotive enthusiast. I actually read its 350 pages in two days -- I couldn't put it down. As an owner of a dozen Mercedes-Benz automobiles, I enjoy reading everything I can about these cars and this book, while it had some things I knew, was rich in lots of details that were new to me. I'm going on a trip soon, and I'll take it along and read through it a second time. The $60 price ... not a bad deal. That's lunch at the Williamsburg Inn for my wife and myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Antique Boris","review":"While the top-quality soloists and the Bolshoi chorus and orchestra make this a remarkable historic recording, the fact that it is a remastering from a 1948 master leaves much to be desired as far as fidelity and overall sound quality are concerned.

The idea of seeing what families of diverse backgrounds eat is a great one, and even more fun the idea that the staple food is a common one, but the plot is non-existent.

It was a turning point in my life. One that I will never forget.\\"The Pages of Life\\" was the second Christian album that I purchased and I absolutely fell in love with this one as well. This album beautifuly displays how to acknowledge God through praise and worship. The messages of God's goodness are translated brilliantly through a variety of vocals and musical arrangements. It's obvious that God is working through everyone and every sound on this album. God's message of all things are possible through Him, is not only spoken loud and clear, but it is soulfully felt as well.

The devil really knows how to fool you when he knows that something is coming from the Lord. Fred Hammond's music is truly an inspiration to me. When I feel down and out, his words sent by God gives me the strength to carry on. I already had two CD's by Fred Hammond before I bought this one, The Spirit of David and Inner Court. Some of the songs on Pages of Life were also on The Spirit of David and Inner Court. It seems as if they were better on Pages of Life.

The night I brought this CD home, I attempted to listen to it on my personal CD player. I was extremely sleepy that night but I wanted to listen anyway. Well, I ended up falling asleep on the first 5 songs. However, on track #6 (Your Steps Are Ordered) GOD opened my eyes and I heard that song from start to finish. That song spoke to my spirit and confirmed some things for me.

However, this great man of God is one of the few that I listen to, who has learned the realities of worship and the power of praise. This album is not filled with \\"common religous phrases\\" that appeal to the emotions, but it instead, challenges, convicts, and assists in moving complacent Christians out of the penumbra of the Holy Spirit, and into the center of His presence.

It is useful to people who have in-depth programming knowledge but no idea how to do a budget or interview job candidates. I found this book specially timely, given that my team is composed of several technical professionals who are now considering a move into management. The information in the book is well layed out and quite accessible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than it's predecessor. . .","review":"In this sequel to \\"Why Catholics Can't Sing\\", Mr. Day takes on the deplorable trends in church design and architecture seen in the last 30 years. Although his remarks are aimed at the Catholic Church, much of what he says is equally applicable to many Protestant denominations as well.In a world where utilitarian seems to be the name of the game, it is good to see that there are still those who appreciate beauty and tradition in their worship, and understand 'why' churches, erected to the Glory of God, should look the part.The angry tone Mr. Day displayed in his previous book is not to be found here, which is a wonderful improvement.As a clergyman, I strongly recommend this book -- even though it may, at times, be an uncomfortable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth About the Human Experience - You will be changed!","review":"As with Volume I of the Voyager series this volume continues on with the history of earth and the human experience here. The information in this volume is as dense and complex as the first one and will definitely change you on a micro/macro level as you read and absorb the material. It was a great relief to get information that finally made some sense for me. As with Vol I I highly recommend this book if you find you have outgrown the fairy tale stories that are perpetuated about the human experience. Very mature work. Only for the serious truth sojourner.

Some have interfered with us and have their own agenda while the Gaurdians have been with us for along time and are still there to help us if we choose to be open to this information.

This book will open up so many doors for you and what your are seeking. Much Love & Light friends - Namaste."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good place to start","review":"Reading this book for the first time may give you a headache. But it's a good place to start if you want to learn more about ascension and our planetary, solar, galactic, universal, and cosmic drama.Keep in mind that this book was published in 2001, and according to the author, a lot of things have changed since then. Here are a few pieces of information that you may not find in the Voyager books:- The 'Halls of Amenti' star gates fell in 2003 and are now under the control of the 'Fallen Angelics.'- We are now in a 200 year evacuation order from the 'Guardian Alliance' because our Sun is dying and our 'Veca' universe is currently in a 'Fall' system.- 'Lower Earth' will explode in the year 2976 AD.- Vertical ascension is no longer possible; only diagonal ascension is possible.- The ascension path would be to go from 'Lower Earth' to 'Higher Earth' then to 'Median Earth' then a few places in between, and then eventually to 'M31' the Andromeda Galaxy.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant book","review":"A brilliant book that begans to expand our knowledge on our hidden history and role in an ever growing galactic drama. Many significant events have taken place since this book was written in 2002. Ashayana Deane has promised a follow up and this has been delayed. In the meantime I highly recommend Theresa Talea's new book which has built upon the work of Ashayana and the Guardian Alliance and answers more questions that the GA have yet to reveal, and also has a more concise galactic history including the post 2002 dramas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice clutter hideaway","review":"Not fine furniture. That said, this small pedestal is a great place to tuck away NetFlix movies and all the DVDs that always seem to accumulate around the television.

He had the story planned out from beginning to end and he would not deviate. As i read this book i kept feeling the story moving out of line, like there was something else that needed to be told, there was more to this story. But then Butler would rench it back in by bringing up that infernal question. Other reviewers have spoiled the \\"surprise\\" but I wont. To me, the question didnt matter. The man's need to know seemed forced, almost unreasonable. And certainly the ending didnt necessarily have to end that way. Simply because he was recognized doesnt mean he was responsible. But, as i said, Butler had an agenda with this book. It was a story he told his way, regardless of how the story itself wanted to go. And so we end up with an endearing Vietnamese girl, an almost endearing American man who asks strange questions, and a story that limps from being beat into line too often. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"a predictable disappointment","review":"It's been years since I've been quite so tempted to throw a book in the garbage. Where was the character development? Where was the heart of this book? I felt as though I was reading a trashy romance novel vs. work by a Pulitzer pize winning author. I was disappointed in not only the cheapened content, yet the structure in writing about it. I felt absolutely NO connection between the characters, and therefore toward the book in general. The predictiblity is probably the biggest disappointment overall. If I wanted to read a perdictable romance, I would have picked it up at the supermarket, not in the literature section of a prominent bookstore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog Cookie Review","review":"My dog White Cloud was a little hesitant at first, but now she really enjoys these Peanut Butter Molasses Dog Treats.

The cookies were not only adorable, but apparently pretty tasty. Recently, though, the last few boxes I've bought have contained nothing but broken remnants of the advertised shapes of cookies that don't even have the cute outlines on them that originally distinguished them from each other. Additionally, the cookies look overcooked and are very hard. Plus - they no longer have that fresh baked smell to them. I really am disappointed in the quality control from Blue Dog Bakery. For the amount of money I spend on these, I expect consistency to the quality. I guess I need to find another low fat treat alternative for my furry family members."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the bisquits, but sorry only mixed in stores now!","review":"I have been buying these peanut butter/molasses dog bisquits for several years now, but can only find the two \\"mixed\\" varieties in the grocery stores (mixed meat flavors and mixed cheese and meat flavors). My dogs get diarhhea from these other mixed versions - I know it's the cheese flavors and maybe the liver...) My only complaint in buying them from you, is that I had to buy 6 boxes at a time. Please tell the groceries that it is ok to have mixed versions in the store, but not to forget loyal buyers like me who want only the one kind!!

First the attaching chord to plug it in is way too long, and no place to wind it up to. The mount is also just one point, and doesn't fit real well. Very unstable when you try using the phone. The price should tell you something as it is made very cheap. The chord for the hand-set is also way to short. Will be stretched beyond recommendations unless you stand right next to to the phone.

This 2005 addition to the SUBMARINE RECORDS catalog continues their excellent track record of compiling high quality sound from Glenn Miller live broadcast material from 65 years ago! As with the several other SUBMARINE CD's I own, 'Hold Tight' presents the band's mainstay vocalists Marion Hutton, Ray Eberle and Tex Beneke, but also spotlights the brief period in 1941 when Dorothy Claire was in the lineup. I enjoy the range of the tune selections on this CD; some very well known and others less so (at least for me), like Daisy Mae which is one of my favorites on this CD. If you like the Miller sound, and like the idea of hearing it 'live' from famous ballrooms, 'Hold Tight' will be a good addition to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"5, 4, 3, 2, 1 monotony, yet great for days before the flu","review":"Lots of bad things to share but know this: this workout is great for those low key days when your feeling the flu bug, the not so extreme flu bug that is. But, the sane person should opt for rest and water. Kindhearted control struggles exist between Sugar Ray and Jill Goodacre as giggling denotes it. Jill is incredibly monotone in her count downs and unenthusiastic but is in great shape-this in itself might motivate you. Cues are lacking; bad for the beginner and great for the expert who watches this again and again. And, the camera person lacks experience in fitness productions. The workout is slow-paced, flows enough and Sugar Ray is fun. It's okay-fine to borrow from the public library."},{"rating":"1","title":"you won't break a sweat","review":"i was going to sell this video in ebay,but since the reviews here are poor i'm not sure anyone would buy it.

Jill Goodacre and Sugar Ray Leonard don't compliment each other at all, but instead struggle over control of the workout. The video seems as if it was taped without much preparation or previous experience leading a workout (there are a lot of mistakes). Jill Goodacre has a serious problem with rhythm and counting which gets very annoying throughout the workout. Some of the moves are fun, but the overall workout is pretty boring and not very challenging. I would stronly recommend looking elsewhere for a good boxing workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this video for the abs/legs portion","review":"I have used this video for years (even bought another when I wore the first one out).
