Fast and Furious was as entertaining as the original without the originality. I only watched it because it was broadcast. In the age of mma, Vin Diesel's tough guy machismo is comical rather than intimidating, and Walker's beta male as leading man style is an awkward phenomenon. An action movie will only ever be as good as it's protagonist is inspiring.There were a few scenes that were fun to watch, like the tunnel scene at the end, but the fun never lasted long. The only standout was the actor who played Braga, the main antagonist. This movie is summed up by the scene where Diesel and Walker say to each other, \\"You thinkin what I'm thinkin\\", referencing a plot revelation the audience saw well in advance. That is to say, \\"Fast and Furious\\" is essentially a collection of well-used action movie techniques stitched together unimpressively."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie! =) Almost good as the first one.","review":"This is a great movie, any fan of the first one gotta love this one.The main characters are back, the story is pretty good, and action is even better.First movie was good, second one sucked, third was alright it had few good scenes but with this one they went back to the roots.

So when I heard the new version was the same actors as the first one, i knew I had to give the franchise one more try. I was not disappointed, this is a decent movie with plenty of action, cars, and girls....basically the kind of movie that appeals to all guys and the acting and plot make it worth the time for the ladies.

With the return of the original cast I expected it to be on the same level as the first installment -- which it isn't. The screenplay has several holes, the excess of CGI images made the movie to look like a video game and very unrealistic (especially the tunnel scenes), and the plot is simply ridiculous. It is worse than 2 Fast 2 Furious, which is not that great. Only the first scene is interesting, all the rest is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gives \`mindless' a new name...","review":"Seriously, I'm a fan of the franchise. I loved the original, despite its ridiculousness. I actually enjoyed the second one, to a far lesser degree, and I really liked the way the rebooted the franchise with \`Tokyo Drift'. I was actually excited to see the original cast come together for this fourth installment. Sadly, it's a disaster. I mean, this is barely entertaining. The premise is far too similar in scope to feel anything remotely enjoyable, and while this sites reviewer wants to tout these thrills as being anything but cheap, I must digress and state that these chills are the epitome of cheap. They don't illicit anything genuine. There is a limit to stupidity in a film. Certain films are crafted to serve the masses a dose of \`good time', and I can embrace that on occasion and when done right, but this is far from right. This is just plain bad.

In jazz, this is a power trio -- Clark, Paul Chambers on bass and Philly Joe on drums. But I have two problems that keep me from giving it a fifth star. First, the album features all standards, and Clark was one heck of a composer. We're talking about the man who wrote \\"Cool Struttin',\\" \\"Sonny's Crib,\\" and \\"News for Lulu!\\" Second, Sonny was a fabulous player in a quintet or sextet setting, and had some serious players join him on his albums. John Coltrane, Donald Byrd and Curtis Fuller joined him on \\"Sonny's Crib,\\" Jackie McLean and Art Farmer on \\"Cool Struttin',\\" and Tommy Turrentine, Charlie Rouse and Ike Quebec (on 1 track) on \\"Leapin' and Lopin'.\\" It's nice to hear Clark tackle different material in a trio setting, but if you discover you love Sonny, buy this CD after you've gone through the above."},{"rating":"1","title":"Other Songs","review":"It was really her earlier stuff...I'm trying to find a particular song titled \\"How's Your Love Life Baby\\".

The other leather bands are poorly made (I think) the leather is tough and the band itself is rather thick and poofy. They have a patent leather like shine and quality to them.

Following the author's constructs, you can apply simple arithmetic to your life.George Shaffner presents the numbers. You have to decide which route is the most feasible to take. It's usually not a life or death situation, but once you do the arithmetic, the choice is simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the RHPS Fanatics","review":"I bought this as a gift after searching for items hits for Anthony Stewart Head for a Buffy Fanatic (who also loves RHPS) and we found this show to be extremely entertaining.

I bought two 3-packs about a year ago from Costco. Now that it's a year later, and I'm putting up the xmas tree, I thought I would *really* test the alarm that is in the family room with the tree. So after putting in a new battery and making sure that it wasn't in \\"silent\\" mode (which is a convenient feature for problem locations, such as a kitchen where the alarm goes off all the time), I held the unit about 5 inches above a burning candle. Nothing. So I blew the candle out. Lots of smoke, no alarm. Hmmm....So this made me want to test the other units in the house. Of the six, three were unable to pick up the candle smoke. Not good. Don't buy these. There should be a recall."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product will kill you","review":"I could not believe the low ratings for this product, so I decided to buy one and test it.It triggered with a small amount of steam. Boiling a quart of water on the stove in an open pot on an electric range top, in a kitchen with the windows open, the alarm would trigger as far as 23 feet away down a residential hall.However, I was unable to cause the alarm to sound with actual smoke. I started with a bic lighter 2 feet under the detector. I moved to newspaper on fire in an open pot. Finally I built a smokey wood fire with green wood, sawdust, leaves, and pine 2x4s in a BBQ in the back yard, and held the smoke detector directly over the fire with tongs.It never sounded.I dropped it in the fire. It melted, and eventually burned. It never sounded.It is my belief that this device should be recalled from the market. It will NOT alert you to a fire in your home. DO NOT PURCHASE IT. If you have purchased one, buy a smoke detector made by another company and throw this unit away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work.","review":"There was a fire in my kitchen and the alarm was 10 feet away and it DIDN'T SEND OFF A warning.

Whenever someone is taking a shower, the steam from the bathroom sets off the alarm in the hall 15 feet away. Heaven forbid I boil water on the stove 15 feet from the downstairs alarm--the steam strikes again! I've begun taking the battery out while cooking or showering, which is a pain in the neck. And based on the other reviews, when there really *is* smoke nearby, nothing happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be illegal / recalled / discontinued","review":"We have a woodstove and wanted to be alerted if during an overnight burn there was back draft, producing smoke. Plus just wanted the reassurance of having the smoke alarm. This unit consistently remained silent when another smoke detector nearby sounded due to smoke. So I agree with the other posters, this detector is not only junk, it could end up killing someone due to its shortcomings. I will never buy another First Alert product if I can help it. Shame on them for not recalling this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after 2 years","review":"Had the same experience as many of the other reviews here. Bought the 3 pack from Costco. During my 2nd year of ownership, I performed my annual change of batteries and found that 2 of the 3 units were not functioning. I'm concerned that I have been living in a house with non-functioning units and thank God I was not in a situation where I needed the smoke alarm to alert me. This is dangerous and unacceptable, as the life expectancy of this product should be longer. Simple - Do not buy this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommend","review":"Though I have not tested it for smoke/fire capability, I really liked the feature of having multiple mounting locations since it lined up perfectly with the previous fire alarms I had mounted in the same location.I am curious about previous question claims concerning the fire alarm not going off since the alarm is designed to a UL standard. The instructions from the alarm state to never test with an open flame but rather to test with aerosol spray. Further, there are many reasons for the cause of an alarm that does not work... read the instructions and search on the internet!I would recommend the product..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but it has a gross mistake","review":"This is a nice plastic folding sheet that has some essential basics for new learners of Japanese.

Heline Corrine really knows her stuff in regards to esoterica and this shows through in this enlightening book. Heline has a firm grasp of the Qabalah and is especially illumintaing around the qualities of the Hebrew letters and their occult properties. She really approached the whole thing from the point of view the western mystery traditions, in particular Christian Hermeticism. So if you are a fan of Christian Hermeticism and like the writings of Paul Foster Case etc.. you will get a lot out of this book.

Not only did it make it impossible for me to have normal relationships with other human beings it helped compound any defects that I have found in spiritual systems full stop. It was the line about all tests of love leading to unconsciousness and the following assault of the mystic - ha - voices.

I was excited when I read the Amazon product details for this one, bagged and tagged it as soon as it came out, and was shocked when I watched it. Unfortunately, it was probably the weakest release of theirs I\`ve seen yet. All of the product details are fabrications (if not outright lies), as there is no real horror to speak of, no real mystery involved, no dark forces at large, nothing remotely interesting anywhere. To make matters worse, a Succubus is an irresistably beautiful demon who drains her human lover of lifeforce while engaged in carnal copulations, according to mythology anyway, and the Succubus here is a fat, ugly broad you wouldn\`t take home after last call in a bulldyke bar... skip this one and slit your wrists instead. Yup, it\`s that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good atmospherics, but light on plot","review":"This movie is generally true to Scandanavian horror. It maintains a generally creepy feeling throughout through effective use of music, camera angles, filters, and the like. If you're into Scanadanavian horror (e.g., Let the Right One In), you're likely to find aspects of this appealing. However, irrespective of that element, the story is thin and very slow to develop, bordering on boring. Also, despite the awful box art, this film is low budget but it has a much more professionally polished feel than the box art would otherwise indicate. Worth a rental for the die hard Scandanavian fans, but should be a lower priority viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Traditional Yang-style Tiajiquan","review":"I think that this DVD would be better if it had english translation.

I have a few problems with the organization of the convection chapters (4 & 5). Working with those chapters requires a lot of flipping back and forth. That complaint aside, the material itself is very good.The problem with this book is that the binding is of terrible quality. I think the book was printed in 1999 (maybe it was 1998, I'm not sure). At any rate, the pages fall out all the time with only light to moderate use (and this is true for everyone in my heat transfer course who got the book). Keep the book opened to a page long enough and it will separate from the binding and fall out. This is a total rip-off for a text that costs >$100 paperback. If a prof assigned the book, I would try to convince him to assign a different book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heat Transfer","review":"The book was in excellent condition and the shipping was very fast. Great transaction,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for those in physics","review":"This is a problem solver book with few diagrams and a lot of newspaper-type pages. The text is blochy heavy seriffed and is difficult to read. I have opened it once, maybe twice. Like your typical problem solvers, you can now find a lot of solutions (even to your specific problem) on the web...for free. There are a lot of equations and theories, but not enough useful stuff for applying these equations to conditions in the real world. The equations are not numbered well and it is impossilbe to tell between interemediate derivations and the final useful equations.

Coltrane is waking the dead with his soprano on that song. It's easily one the greatest sax solos of all time. This album would get 5 stars for that song alone, but the other songs are great too. \\"Everytime We Say Goodbye\\" is another great song with nice solos from Coltrane and McCoy Tyner on piano. \\"Summertime\\" is another crazy solo from Coltrane, and he wakes up even more dead with that one! And finally \\"But Not For Me,\\" which is a great song to close the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sopran sax by Coltrane.","review":"All I have to say there are the best sopran sax title from Johnny Hodges - Ellington small groups sessions. Great waltz My favorite things, but more graet titles too. One of the best albums from Coltrane's Atlantic period."},{"rating":"2","title":"up there with the best","review":"Coltrane spins the sheets of sound unlike any other sax player of the time; time (present) is now, so one would have to place this \\"album\\" next to the music by tenors of today. Kenny G or even Branford anyone?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music, disappointing packaging","review":"This is a great album. I have the LP version from 20 years ago and ordered the CD to give as an xmas gift. It just came today and of course I haven't opened it, but I'm disappointed with the packaging. It comes in a crummy looking cardboard sleeve (typical of Rhino Records, I now realize) instead of a jewel case, with a cheesy looking sticker on the outside saying \\"His Breakthrough Jazz Album!\\". Since it's a full priced CD, I'd have expected traditional packaging; and since it's a gift, its appearance actually makes a difference. I'll use it anyway but wish they hadn't cheaped out like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trane and Julie Andrews just too much!","review":"I hate the title track, and everything about the movie, The Sound of Music, viscerally, and I can't enjoy the title track because every time I hear it I think of that movie. Seriously, though, I feel this album is the single most overrated record in the entire jazz canon. I much prefer other Trane records from this time frame, such as Coltrane's Sound, and Coltrane Plays the Blues. There is just something pretentious and depressing about this record. Why did he play THAT song? I hate that song!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite things","review":"This album has four songs and a million feelings.

She's average size for her age but a little tall. After reading other reviews, I decided to purchase a 3-4T. It's a little big but will totally work. Better than being too small. The hat & shoe covers are made very well. It looks so super cute on her! She was excited to try it on & already wanted to go outside, lol. I would definitely recommend this costume. It shipped pretty quickly as well. Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Met \\"argh\\" expectations!","review":"I ordered this for our average size 3 1/2 year old. She's approx. 39.5 inches tall and 34lbs. She wears a size 4 in most clothing and it fits great! Overall quality is pretty good. I'd read the reviews and knew the hat may not work. I immediately took it out of the bag, turned a kitchen mixing bowl upside down and put the hat on top (like sitting on a head)to bring back some of it's shape. Looks fine. The bandana is not the kind of bandana I had in mind. It's a long scarf about 3.5 inches wide. Also looks great. The belt is too big but I'll just cut off the excess \\"pleather\\" and put on a new piece of velcro. The buckle is different than the picture but still really cute. It was to be delivered by Oct. 4 and arrived on the 3rd. Overall we're very happy and the costume looks adorable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small, not a 3-4T.","review":"The look of the costume as pictured seems cute, especially on the little girl who appears 3-4 years old, but the costume wasn't made to fit a 3-4T. It looked like it could maybe fit a 1-2 year old, maybe. Rather small, but still cute. Had too send back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute","review":"The skirt seems a little short & the shirt a little big. The hem on the neck was unraveling & part of the seam on the skirt was not sewn. However those were easy fixes. Had I had more time I would have exchanged it. I did add some beads to the hat & belt. It was too hot for the boot covers. Even with the few imperfections I really like the costume & hope she can still wear it at Halloween."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pirate Costume","review":"This costume is adorable.

The boots are a bit of a waste and look pointed as they have no bottom and sort of just collapse flat/folded, not nearly as cute as in the photo. Everything else is adorable and as pictured and my girl loved it. Her big toddler tummy makes her look fairly funny in it, but its totally cute. She loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well deserving of 5 stars","review":"This device is well designed and operates flawlessly. I especially like the programming capability where one can record the name of an incoming caller. It saves a lot of wear and tear having to run to the phone to see who is calling. If a sixth star were offered I would give it that rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voice Announcement Caller ID","review":"Wooks great. Easy to program and the voice announcement you can add is a great feature. Also, the ability to insert an announcement for a partial number, such as area code, is a nice feature. The only short coming is that there are only 3 volume levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voice Announce Caller ID","review":"Great for me as a way of recording those calls with no name caller id. That way when they call the box says the name."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great little machine 'tho a tad loud.","review":"This is a wonderful device and works great. The led screen is bright and easy to read giving telephone number, name and time the call came in. It keeps track of the number of incoming calls that you have had. A red light blinks signalling that you have received new calls that haven't been checked. The announcing voice is clear and easy to understand--although it can be a tad loud at times, especially when one is already on the phone and another call comes in on call waiting. A handy instruction manual comes with the devise that is easy to understand and use. Although it's a bit more pricey than other caller IDs that I have had, it is by far the most useful and is highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Longer Announces Through Handset","review":"I just received unit, it has the exact same model number, but the feature to announce the caller over a phone has mysteriously and silently been removed. The new manual also has removed the sentence saying that it will do this.If a company is going to remove a feature, they ought to give the item a new model number. This is standard business practice.I have cordless phones all over the house, so it's not helpful if I can only hear the speaker in one room. Having it announce over any handset seemed like a great feature that was removed.Also, not sure if they changed other parts, but the voice quality of recorded names is not very good. It is muffled and hard to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Sound","review":"When I received this item several weeks ago it worked fine. Since then the sound quit working and you can't record.

This product is incredibly easy to use and sets up in minutes. I have heard other talking caller id units, including the Panasonic brand and this one is far superior. The sound quality and is top notch and also allows you to record names in your own voice. I had my friends record thier own names in thier own voices. This is a must have product!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems from Day One","review":"I was really looking forward to using this unit since it's very hard to find stand-alone Caller IDs any more.But of the six or so phone calls we received the first day it was online, about half of the calls were terminated after one ring. The callers did not ever hear the phone ring on their end. We turned the unit off and on with no success.So I will be returning this and not risking another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"na","review":"works fine for basic answering, somewhat complicated for extra features. The wall hanging bracket is quite flimsy. Hard to read wall mounted. Best to set on desk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Lived","review":"Initially I really like the ClassCo caller id box. Having the voice announce the phone number is very convenient. When the phone rings, you don't have to stop whatever you are doing and go to the phone to read a name/number. The voice announce lets you hear who is calling.Unfortunately after just over a month, the caller ID box no longer works. The phone company has been out and determined that the box's wiring is bad and affecting phone service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to a caller ID phone.","review":"Once you understand how to use it, it is a wonderful and inexpensive electronic device to have.Hearing who is calling in your OWN voice is great.Much better than the phones that have \\"caller announce\\" in a voice that most of the time is hard to understand. I have recommended it to all my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"Works great, but just wish it had an option to announce the caller more than once. My last talking caller-id announced the name twice, which is ideal. Other than that, the unit is extremely easy to set up and works flawlessly. You can mount it on the wall too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caller ID 9900CW","review":"This is the 2nd 9900CW and operates well but requires a user to record the caller ID by name otherwise the phone number is used. Other than that, it functions well and promptly as the call is coming in. A problem with cell phones and identified numbers is an issue - all identified the same can be confusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad experience, stll waiting for my money back","review":"Coustomer service was very nasty. I had the device only two day's before it stoped recording the phone number announcements. They called me minutes after I posted that I was not pleased with the product. They they said I could return it, which was fine, but I returned it over three weeks ago and I still haven't gotten my money back. I then posted that it was taking forever to get my money back, then Amazon called with a bad attitutde. Unfortunitly this company is the only one I can find that sells a voice caller ID so I'll just do without. I am not buying anything from Amazon again, you can count on that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective out of the box","review":"The scrollpoint button was sticking in the down position when I plugged it in, and I was unable to get that to stop.

I dug out an old mouse I had leftover from a PS/2 and am happily using that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money well saved","review":"I am very happy to say that I did not purchase this book; it was loaned to me for my opinion. I find the author's mentality so disgusting (you can see why from the other reviews) that I am not even going to finish reading it. Generally speaking, I enjoy satire, but I find this just a vehicle for the grossness that so many find desireable and amusing in today's culture. Save your money - buy a GOOD book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful tailoring guide.","review":"I bought this book when I decided to make my 20-year-old son a Prince Charlie jacket to wear for Scottish dancing and piping events. It's the Scottish equivalent of a formal tailcoat with satin lapels, meant to wear with a kilt. I wanted it to fit him perfectly, and I wanted to use all the custom-tailoring techniques with no shortcuts. The sections on fitting were worth the price of the book. The fitting information available for working with women can be adapted, of course, but it was tremendously helpful and reassuring to have a tailor's view of fitting men. From there, the construction steps were clear and easy to follow. The finished product is truly fine. I would have tackled this project anyway, without the book. But I know the jacket is better because of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"We used this book at school","review":"Although this book wasn't on our book list, most of the class bought and it followed what we were learning. I have since refered back to it everytime I make a suit. I still have the jacket I made in class, and it looks as good as the day I finished it almost 15 years later.This is as good as it gets in tailoring. It works just as well for women as it does men. Can also be adapted to coats."},{"rating":"1","title":"?","review":"This book is for persons who are just starting out, not tailors. It is good to have reference books in your library but this book has the same construction directions that a vogue men's pattern has in it.

Boy was that a bad decision. When I received it, the stickers were already coming off as soon as I took it out of the box and there was dirt or something sticky all over it. When I tried turning the sides, it only wanted to turn one way, barely, and you about had to break it to turn it the other way, which just made the stickers come off even more. And it does that for every side. If you just want it for a cheap toy to look at, maybe for a kid, and not use it to actually solve the rubik's cube, I guess it's alright, if kind of expensive. But don't waste your money on this, I regret not just buying an actual rubik's cube. I was very disappointed with this product. I should of listened to the other reviews, instead of buying it for the price, because I just ended up wasting my money in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy, broke the same day","review":"This is the worst!

I don't use the word \\"performed\\" lightly - so many recordings these days are overproduced and edited until the final product comes out slick and, well, boring. This isn't like that at all - there's a sense of a real performance contained in both works, and that's what really puts this disc over the top."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Peppino Gagliardi CD","review":"The Peppino was one of the greatest singers of Italian popular music.

I also have the video, but the tenor is raw voiced Rockwell Blake. Vainzo is a vast improvement, but I wish he had more heft. Lagrange has an odd vibrato I find irritating. But then, I'm ridiculously picky. As on the video, Anderson is just amazing. The beautiful quality of tone, fantastic breath control and smooth coloratura (I hate bouncy coloratura). She really stops the show with \\"Robert, toi que j'aime.\\" The audience just can't scream enough. I've played it over and over myself. Mesmerizing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly interseting, but needs more detail!","review":"I found the ideas presented in this book very interesting, however I was dissappointed to see too many \\"decorative\\" images more than details. It provides very general information about the roots of each letter and how they evovled in time, but it does not go into too much detail.

I knew (at that time) of PF from Frampton Come Alive (along with 6 million plus others!) and was blown away by his virtuousness on stage. His chops were amazing then, and on this CD, well like they say about fine wine...just gets better with age. I am not a fan of instrumental cds...but this is special, in a unique way, because it came out of left field from an artist who musical career has been defined by 1 live album, and in my eyes, a Humble Pie legacy!...great stuff indeed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WELL DONE PETER FRAMPTON!!","review":"Having listened to many guitar based all-instrumental CD's over the years ,I have to say that Peter Frampton's Fingerprints is one of the best I've listened to. This CD demonstrates Frampton's versatility and skill in playing different types of music including Blues, Jazz and several all out rock numbers. Fingerprints also show his sense of humor with \\"Grab a Chicken\\" which is one of my favorites. Other favorites include Float,Cornerstones,Boot it up, Blowin Smoke and Blooze. There really isn't a bad song on the entire CD and there is such a variety that you don't get tired listening to it over and over. Forget about what you think you know about Peter Frampton and pick up Fingerprints and listen to how it is suppose to be done!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Frampton is alive","review":"If you are a Peter Frampton fan, don't waste your time reading any further; just go and buy this great album and add it to your collection.If you are a new to Peter Frampton's music, then be aware, this is nothing like any of his previous releases. PF. is a great rock musician with an amazing history, however this new album is simply instrumental; a blend of Rock and Jazz with some beautiful melodies.Frampton is delivering great music here and if you have aged listening to Frampton, than this album is a perfect continuity to his music yet mild and mature.New to Frampton's music? Start with \\"Live in Detroit\\" instead.A jazz music fan? You will love this new release.If you like this album, check Larry Carlton in his album called also \\"Fingerprint\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This CD was a disappointment. It simply does not feel like a Frampton album. This in all probability is because of the many other collaborators on the album.

Overall---I expected better."},{"rating":"2","title":"STUNNING !!!","review":"This is one of the finest \\"guitar\\" albums ever made.IMHO.Why? Great tunes, virtuosity, passion and fun. There is a lot of \\"fun\\" missing these days from instrumental guitar god CDs. Peter shows how it is done with grace and taste. Mr Frampton is and has always been a master of his instrument. Forget the \\"I'm In You\\" crap and and judge the man by his chops, songwriting, musical acumen, professional and personal integrity.Amazing that my 2 favorite CD purchases this year have been new releases from English Gentlemen Peter Frampton and Ray Davies.This is how it is done! Bravo Peter !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Listen","review":"Good let listening all the way through. Frampton has a variety of guitar sounds that showcases his talent. There are no vocals on this one as his guitar does the singing. One of the best and underrated gutarist of all time.His rendition of Soundgarden's Black Hole Sun is a highlight.

Shameful!Most of it's already been said in the other reviews, so I'll be brief: For me on the whole, Doves get five stars. They're magical -- bad almost doesn't exist. Based on that honest belief, I was compelled to go with five stars here. But 1) there were some poppy moments in this collection that weren't their usual stellar, and 2) I'm SO used to Doves albums being seamless and this one was not.These are trivial mentions, though. Oh how tough to be such a straight-A student! Sorry guys, B+ is just not good enough. (I say that with the utmost sarcasm.)In shortest: This is a fan must-have. SO LOVE the remixes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fan must-have","review":"Too much great stuff on here makes up for the incidental music bits that are pretty inconsequential.

So, I added the cd to my Christmas wish list and was fortunate that a family member ordered it for me. Lost Sides has an interesting mix of song types. Some songs are mellow, rich sounding, and serious, such as the first song, Darker, and a later song, Valley. Nice bass, guitar, percussion and vocals. Some songs are light and catchy. Most have a head-nodding beat. I enjoy listening to this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Decoration Only- Very hard to Play or tune properly- beautiful addition to a music studio","review":"This sitar looks beautiful but if you are looking for a playable sitar to take seriously then this one is not for you. A beginner's sitar or introduction to how a sitar functions. Its worth the money but serious sitar student should look elsewhere.

I chose this because another review stated it was perfect for aspiring musicians which led me to believe it could be played and would produce music. Not so! The strings are like the ones you would find on a cheap toy guitar purchased for $1.99. Although the sitar looks nice from a distance, an up close look reveals a very sloppy finish and paint job.

The sitar, like the piano, is an instrument made to project it's full qualities. If you've ever been to a piano recital, you can rest assured the maestro will not come on stage bearing a half sized piano.If you want a wall-hanger, or a chic-magnet, then buy this, by all means.

Margie has never made a bad record...It's impossible. She just was one of those artists that never got the best promotion and proper managment...But what a voice! Smooth, silky, raspy, honey flavored and just down home sexxxy.

You have to find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not completely accurate","review":"This book really should be called \\"Beans to MILK Chocolate\\". It describes the process of making chocolate but states that \\"the paste is mixed with powdered milk and sugar\\".Milk in fact, is just an optional ingredient and this book leads people to believe that chocolate has to be made with powdered milk.I agree with the other reviewer that this book is very short, but that is what this series is like. They are short introductory books that don't overwhelm young readers (which I can appreciate)."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, economical choice","review":"If you take the price into account (and who, buying this, doesn't) it's a great buy.

This is the Bad Brains record I've been waiting for since the early '80s."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD lacks Christmas","review":"Strangely enough, the majority of the cartoons on this DVD have nothing to do with Christmas. I think the Popeye cartoon has a few seconds of a fist fight in the Swiss Alps. There is snow, and that is as close as it gets. The Hawaiian Birds has a few moments in New York winter, but no connection to the Holidays. Now, I am always happy to have another Popeye cartoon, but I was actually expecting it to be Christmas themed.The DVD quality is about what you come to expect from Cartoon Crazy's. The picture is fine, the sound can be a little weird but I like it, and the extras are mainly adds for their other titles.If you are looking for a collection of classic Christmas cartoons, they did a much better job with their second outing, \\"A Cute Cavalcade of Classic Christmas Cartoons.\\" The best cartoons on this DVD, \\"Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer,\\" \\"Christmas Comes But Once a Year ,\\" and \\"The Shanty were Santa Claus Lives,\\" are duplicated on \\"A Cute Cavalcade...\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Campy Christmas Cartoons at Thier Best!","review":"For some reason or another I really enjoy these classic and campy Christmas cartoons. I remeber getting them at the grocery store as a kid when you could find two cartoons on a tape for about $5. Christmas Comes But Once a Year is probably the best on the DVD in my opinion, but they all have their charm. I was amazed that these cartoons would have made the transition to DVD so I was very happy to get this when I did. If they don't have this one in stock try Cartoon Cavalcade, I believe, which is about the same line up. Possibly the nicest special feature, which it does have, are the behind the scenes write ups about each cartoon. I'm personally not that impressed with sound one way or the other but I have been told but friends who are more into that aspect that it lacks in that area. But heck, the cartoons are over 50 years old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disappointing","review":"Having read the glowing reviews on here, I was really looking forward to this book. I'm guessing the other reviewers were just happy to have a new Prisoner story, since The Prisoner a) only had 17 episodes; and b) ended in the late 60's. Beyond getting a new story about the Prisoner, though, the book is really pretty terrible. In the first few pages, there's a murder that sets up the rest of the book. Unfortunately, that murder is the only thing happens. The remaining hundreds of pages are Number Six and his new galpal 18 walking back and forth, interviewing people, and shooting each other sarcastic one-liners. That's it. The Prisoner was about a lot more than just snappy come-backs and I don't think it's unreasonable to expect something to actually happen in a story after the initial plot point. Overall, it wasn't the worst thing ever written, but if my copy accidentally fell into my cat's litter box, I wouldn't make an effort to retrieve it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every bit as good","review":"Every bit as good as all the previous \\"Prisoner\\" fiction.

I am returning it tomorrow as i find it no different than my refurbed discontinued HC20 I got for ultra cheap at the Sony Outlet. Picture quality in my opinion is exactly the same. Handling is the same with the HC42 having more options. So what about the 12x optical - its only 2x more than the HC20. Everything about this camcorder reeked overpriced.I admit I bought this one mainly for the Analog to Digital passthru but after thinking it over it is not worth the extra cost at all. Half the options (still pic, memory stick, etc...) are things I will not use.I honestly feel that this is an overpriced camcorder. I tested a Panasonic and it was cheaper and well if you need all these options it was a better buy to get a Panasonic GS35 (30x optical!)As for the analog to digital passthru - i am going to stick with my old Sony D8 cam for that work. This is just not worth it.

Never dropped nor mishandled. Today, the camera will not take the cassette. I called SONY regarding the problem. SONY will fix it for $201.00 flat rate since it no longer is under warranty. For being such a quality product name and being so costly, one would think that this camera would not break so easily especially after handling it with kid gloves. Even if I would have bought an extended warranty when I purchased the camera, it would have expired by now. Catch 22.

The \\"friendly conversation about evolution\\" is in fact a one sided, missleading, collection of fringe pseudoscience writen by creationists for creationists. In a comic adventure, the reader is led through a debate between a creationist and a evolutionist on the subject of evolution. The side of the evolutionist is not based on fact, but rather purposefully misleads the reader. The idea of \\"Intelligent design\\" promoted in this book, has been banned from the public school science classrooms by the 5th circuit court of appeals: \\"that curriculum proposals for \\"intelligent design\\" are equivalent to proposals for teaching \\"creation science\\".

There is, on the other hand, a massive amount of proof to support the scientific theory of evolution.

The believers in intelligent design do, on the other hand, need to provide scientific evidence to support their view if they want it to be considered science.After reviewing this book briefly I was disappointed to find that there was no scientific evidence to support the belief in intelligent design. I don't think intelligent design should even be compared to evolution until it can actually stand up to the scientific method."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shamelessly biased.","review":"A terrible book. Shamelessly biased towards Intelligent Design Theory from the beginning. Even if the 2 characters were debating vanilla & chocolate icecream, you'd still be compelled to be revolted by the maniacal behavior of the Darwinian Theorist professor.

(I would give it 5 stars.) HOWEVER, the Eyewitness Travel City Map for London is totally different. It is a sturdy 12-page laminated map that folds out into a single sheet. It has very good detail on the central London area that is frequented by most tourists. However, the print is so tiny that I find its usefulness very limited. It is good for getting a general idea of how central London is laid out, but unless you have the ability to read very small print, it is not helpful in navigating the streets of London."},{"rating":"1","title":"An index of London, not really a guidebook","review":"I took this book and Frommers to London. This book lists everything,and yet at the same time can be vague when it comes to directions, prices and if something is worthwhile or not. It's an index rather than a guide book. The Frommer's book was as if someone went to London before you did and came back with the good places and sites that you should go to, including restaurant recommendations that I find to be on the money. I'm going to Italy next month and will be taking a Frommer's guide since it gives me prices, times, and what's worth seeing. And...while the individual graphics in this book are good, overall the book is too cluttered."},{"rating":"2","title":"The travel book you really need!","review":"I have many travel books for London but I have to say this is the best. Updated frequently, it contains a vast amount of information. I found the book to be very acurate with opening times and ticket prices for events, as well as travel directions. If you have never been to London before, you will appreciate the back section of the book which covers the basics (using a payphone, the different coins and notes, airport and train iformation etc). Even though I know London very well now, I still find the book very useful when planning a day out. The photography is amazing as well! This is a must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for running around.","review":"You'll learn more from a Lonely Planet guide, but damn, those things get heavy.

Yes, there are some dated items, restaurants changing hands, but that cannot be helped. And it is heavy, but that is because of the high quality of the paper. If you want a guide to London, get this.

After the first day we didn't bother carrying either one. First and foremost, these are HEAVY - beware, it was a major reason we stopped carrying them. But our biggest gripe was that they simply didn't have that much information. Heaven forbid you want to find a restaurant or a bar near where you are. Good luck with that. And the neighborhood maps covered a tiny area of the actual neighborhoods. The books are wonderfully illustrated and do have really interesting information on the sites they do cover, but it's really limited to the major stuff. These books would serve better as a primer to read before going than something to actually carry around. I will say the pull-out map was useful, particularly the pull-out part."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book, but get the latest edition","review":"I got this via Amazon Marketplace, and did not realize that the version I received was not current. Much of the material, history, etc. remains the same, but restaurant reviews and current events do not. Very good book overall, but be sure you are getting the current publication. Also, some of the print in this book is very fine, don't buy it if you cannot read fine print.

Each boy had his own copy, and they not only read it, but they used it frequently. They enjoyed using the building 'cut away' pictures to find all sorts of details. It was like a scavenger hunt. Finding the buildings, locations and other things they had read about 'back home' was a thrill. One item they enjoyed was the Hyde Park Speakers' Corner. Not something we would have thought of, but it intrigued the boys when they read about it and they enjoyed it when they got there. This book is a great help to people of all ages who are discovering London for the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great resource","review":"I am a novice traveller, but yet a lover of history.

Even my friends who had been to London before were using my maps instead of their own. The introduction, including the history of the city, along with the detailed descriptions of events, markets, and landmarks helped me to have a working knowledge of this vast city. I have never felt so at home in a foreign place. The \\"Where To Stay\\" section enabled us to find a better hotel at a much lower rate after our first two nights, and we had a nice dinner at one of the restaurants suggested. I even got a snapshot of the very same orator at the Speaker's Corner that is pictured in the book. I saw this guide being used by other tourists in other languages, as well. I feel that this book was a major factor in the overall success of my vacation and will use the Eyewitness Guides for any future trips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not what I was expecting","review":"Basically, if you're the kind of person who likes a lot of covers, and pretty short songs, this set is definitely meant for you. I was really excited for a lot of the music because I saw some good names on the back. When I listened though, I felt kind of ripped off because so many songs were just cheesy covers, and I just couldn't see why the originals couldn't be put on the CD instead. To top it off, many of the tracks were extremely short. I don't know if it's just because I'm used to listening to tracks that are 5+ minutes, but I still think a lot of the tracks should have been at least 3 minutes long. Personally, I would say that my favorite CD out of the set was the Havana Nights one. The songs are pretty good, but like I mentioned before, pretty short too. If you're looking for something that will expose you to more Latin rhythms, I don't really recommend this compilation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nitch19","review":"This is absolutely horrible.

It is such a wonderful \\"look back\\" at a great album (my personal favorite out of all their albums). The guys look great and give some wonderful insight to the songs and the music. My only \\"down side\\" to the disc was that they did not discuss every song on the album(apparently for time purposes). Two of my favorites that were not discussed were \\"Lonely in your Nightmare\\" and \\"Last Chance on the Stairway\\". I guess since they were not \\"hits', they were passed by.

This book is written in a very biased point of view and not from a serious and unbiased researcher's point of view. I wanted facts and research , not a lesson in religion. I closed the book empty handed. The book may have an interesting title, but it was too much filled with the author's religious beliefs in a way that a reader that does not share his beliefs might find it a very unpleasent experience.For a more balanced book I strongly recommend \\"The Twelve: The Lives of the Apostles After Calvary\\" by Bernard Ruffin, C.

The sound is just fine for now, until I get a home theater system hooked up. The screen was not bowed at all, as some people have experienced--either they have fixed this problem or I got lucky.As for the DLP v. plasma debate--I had plenty of room, didn't need to wall-mount (where to put the cable box and DVD player?), and didn't want to pay $1000-1500 more for plasma, then worry about burn in every time a 4:3 commercial comes on. DLPs may be obsolete in a few years, but for now, mine works great, and was comparatively cheap. Case closed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Picture, But Major Flaws Including Terrible Bowing","review":"I previously owned a 720p Sony TV and decided to upgrade....big mistake. I received this TV and have since returned it after a week. The picture is nice and pretty dang clear. The bad is that it bows. It is as if something was sitting on top of the TV pushing down to create a \\"bowing\\" effect. It is terrible when you watch movies with the wide-screen (i.e. black bars). Also, you can notice it greatly on the TV Guide channel and any other channel like ESPN or CNN with the ticker at the bottom of the screen.Another problem that I had is that even after adjusting the colors for some time, the reds bled a little bit and were just to bright.The good is that the TV is cheap (price) but also bad b/c it is cheap (cheap construction).I do not recommend this TV. I have since bought a SONY SXRD 55 inch for about $150 more, and it is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Samsung DLP TV","review":"The picture on this TV is distorted and the screen has already been replaced once.

I would have rated this book much more highly had the cover not included the phrase \\"The Greatest Eulogies of Our Time.\\" They aren't. They aren't even close.If you want to read great eulogies, then look somewhere else. The best line in the entire book wasn't actually written by one of the book's eulogists. The eulogist merely quoted him:\\"His brother was worse.\\"And with that, readers seeking great or at least memorable eulogies can simply move on because they won't be found here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bedtime Reading","review":"You'll read this book slowly. If you want to savor each of the imaginative, evocative portraits of 20th century legends. As with a batch of homemade chocolate cookies, better to consume just a few each night with a warm glass of milk. And then fall asleep and dream of what you want to become. The inspiration is ineluctable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational Eulogies","review":"For a eulogy to transcend just \\"celebrity puffery\\" it has to have universal application to our own lives. It has to make us think about how we want to be remembered. It has to inspire us to take a moment in our frenzied lives to reflect and then make a change in what we do every day. Otherwise it's not much more than tabloid hype.The success of this collection of greatest eulogies is that it does exactly that. It's a mix of entertaining anecdotes that bring to life these famous people with inspirational details about their personal, often private side. Deep down inside I think we want our celebrities to be \\"good people\\" and know that they weren't tarnished by the glitter of fame. If you're looking for an uplifting book, I recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Collection of Famous Farewells","review":"This is a book not to be missed!A well-rounded collection of eulogies to famous artists, writers, scientists, politicians, movie stars, and revolutionaries, it not only gives you an intimate peek into the lives of these movers and shakers, but invites you to examine your own life as well. I found myself vaulting between laughter and tears, introspection and amazement. The author has done a great job of culling those remarkable figures from the past century and tracking down their eulogies. From Martin Luther King to Lucille Ball, Bette Davis to Albert Einstein, Amelia Earhart to Dr. Seuss... And the contributors are equally impressive - spanning Madonna to Fidel Castro to Neil Simon.'Farewell, Godspeed' is a book to treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real American woman","review":"Reardon's latest work is an excelent representation of the hunter / gatherer mistique of small town rural america. Under the apple pie and quaint county fair, there is always a story that every one knows but nobody talks about. Mary Culpepper makes her own decisions, for the right reasons or the wrong; at least they are hers. Mary is in the middle of her life, living with her past and excepting her future. Reardon's portrayal of a real woman is excelent. I felt for Mary but its hard to have pitty on a woman who you know will survive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlike the others, I was very disappointed.","review":"Though Billy Dead was one of the best works of fiction I have ever read, Reardon's sincerity is lost in her latest.She is trying altogether too hard.I found myself, sadly, desiring to skip entire paragraphs and when I did, I missed nothing. Then I did the unthinkable. About 80 pages in I skipped to the last two chapters just to get it over with.Much like overacting, she is over exerting herself as she tries to develop believable, empathy evoking characters.Had I never read Billy Dead, I would not read her again. But knowing the talent of which she is capable, I await her next work, with hopes that she relaxes and tells me a story that compels me to read every word."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the eye of the beholder","review":"I personally enjoyed this album and if you like quiet, more subdued emo this album is for you. Often sporting just Carraba's voice and a guitar, the lyrics really will play with your emotions if you leave yourself open to them. Of course, the lyrics can be adolescent at times (ok, most of the time) but seriously, is there a more emotional time than the teenage years? If you don't like the depressing nature of the songs, So Impossible EP is just as powerful but in a happy way. If you like emotionally moving music but are tired of the loud scene of emo, this is a perfect album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything \\"song\\" sounds the same.","review":"Granted there are some decent lyrics here, but D.C. does little to stray from its patented approach and one would be hard pressed to distinguish one song from another.

It was all acoustic guitar and vocals which is real cool, but for this cd singer/guitarist Chris Carrabba took a different approach. He re-did some old songs with drums and bass and acoustic guitars. The drums are only on 2 or 3 songs. But its definatly cool. He did a great job with this cd. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great CD","review":"This Dashboard album was the first one that I had ever listened to and I love it. I have heard some people say that the lyrics don't make sense and that Dashboard is meant for 14-year-olds with no life experience. This is not true. Obviously people who state this in their review do not listen to this kind of music therefore they don't know anything about it. These lyrics are deep and meaningful and they say a lot about relationships. I find this CD to be very relaxing yet there is a touch of 'punk' around the edges. I haven't been able to stop listening to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not like this album","review":"I haven't heard much of Dashboard, so I don't know how \\"The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most\\" measures up to their other stuff. I gave this album numerous chances and could not come even close to relating to the pain this guy is feeling. Here's why: He seems to be spending more time concentrating on how he can make his words fancy enough that he can't actually relate any beauty to me. His voice & its melodrama all strike me as being the tools of a stylistic artist, who while he does feel pain and sadness, is too busy trying to manipulate the listener into feeling it.That is my review - I know that others out there will disagree, but if you really want a taste of well executed lyrics & feeling I suggest artists such as: Palace, Fugazi, Pinback, Sunny Day Real Estate, etc. There's a night & day difference with the maturity you'll find in their work as opposed to Dashboard Confessional's."},{"rating":"1","title":"10 depressing campfire songs","review":"Whenever I first hear an album, I try and have an open mind and avoid making presuppositions based on the first single. In the case of The Places You Have Come To Fear The Most by Dashboard Confessional, however, this proved exceedingly difficult, as I positively detest \\"Screaming Infidelities,\\" even going so far as to vote for Limp Bizkit on MTV2's \\"Control Freak\\" to keep from hearing it. Nevertheless, I decided to borrow this CD from a friend, hoping that there would be some variety to make up for that song.Unfortunately, the rest of the songs are just like \\"Screaming Infidelities\\": off-key campfire singalongs with angst that one would expect from nu-metal. If you want to hear that song ten times over, by all means, buy this album. But as for me, I'll take The Cure when I want to listen to depressing music."},{"rating":"2","title":"FME","review":"Dashboard is awesome and If you liked showoff check out chris from showoffs new band Farewell My Enemy at www.farewellmyenemy.com they are really f'n awesome.Tom"},{"rating":"1","title":"Idealist lyrics captivate thousands w/ redundant romanticism","review":"I heard this album many times at my friend's house and while alone and I see the appeal of it, but I think many of its fans are being attracted by what sounds like an inviting song. I read some of the highly acclaimed lyrics and I found them to be redundant with obscure notions of love that any eleven year old girl could come up with.... On the plus side, they have \\"touched\\" many people with their quips about \\"looking into your eyes and seeing the real you who is alone\\" and other things like that. I think they could be much more creative. The music is just strumming guitar, with coherent lyrics can be good, but this has just become a couple guys with a guitar spouiting out ideas that make whiny teenagers feel better about themselves. This stuff is definitely not poetry, it's the national enquirer of the music business."},{"rating":"2","title":"This ones for the youngsters","review":"This album is okay if your a youngster i suppose... new thing now in today is emo as many people see. I look at it like this, certain things will be popular at different time peroids.

So take a moment and help them out, if they dont want your help let them listen to their music. And as for this album its good for what it is. Very Deep and emotional of his experiences mainly relationships.

I don't understand why DC is so much more popular."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Band is not that good.","review":"I just recently saw Chris Carraba on CNN hawking his music in a acoustic format. I came to the conclusion that he is not a very good singer. He was yelling out the lyrics like an adolescent reaching pre-puberty.

Chris' incessant whining and blubbering about breakups is enough to make even the seasoned veteran of music cringe in sheer horror... Instrumentation in most cases is nice. I will give this CD that. If they had released the CD without Chris whining, it would have been an okay album. Not Emo, Not Rock, Not Good. Plain and simple, you're better off just asking some Girl/Guy one the street to explain the worst breakup they ever had and try to sing it like a 5th grade remedial english class. That should give you some idea of how much Chris really sucks.

After listening to the whole thing, only one word came to mind: \\"ouch!\\" I've never heard so much whining by someone about failed romance. Sure, I've heard breakup songs by the Deftones, Far, Will Haven, and even Sunny Day Real Estate, but all of those songs occupied ONE slot on the record. This is the same concept repeated in every song on the album with slight variations (eg \\"I miss your bed,\\" \\"I heard about your trip and all the cute guys,\\" \\"You keep ignoring me\\"). For God's sake, Chris Cabbera, SHUT UP about your petty little breakup! There are more important issues in the world than you going unnoticed again!If you want to listen to good, emotional, acoustic rock, do not hesitate to buy either one of Neutral Milk Hotel's full-length albums.

I am not saying that I don't like emo-rock, because I do, but I don't like what DASHBOARD has to offer! If you like emo-rock, check out SOMETHING CORPORATE or my favorite emo-band SUNNYDAY REALESTATE, but try to avoid DASHBOARD CONFESSIONAL if you can! Oh, and It was a real slap in the face to see the DC from AC/DC, on the bass drum, to stand for DASHBOARD CONFESSIONAL(you know-the same design and all)!

Chris Carrabba's acoustic guitar, which can be gentle or brutal, is now tempered, in this second album, by drums and bass. His lyrics connect with the angst-ridden 16 year-old inside us all, regardless of age, and gives the words a universality. Whether they are expressing the anguish of break-up, betrayal, (im)possible reconciliation, or separation, the lyrics always cut straight to the core. His music has developed a great deal since his first solo effort, the Drowning Man EP on Fiddler Records, into a fuller, more complete sound that loses not one jot of its emotion. What else can I say? Buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now this is the DC CD to have!","review":"You have to have this CD in your collection.

The best thing about this album is that I was able to pawn it off on a friend, who later pawned it off on someone else.

It is filled with sympathetic similies and emotional metaphors that really sum up to almost nothing at all. I can see how this would fascinate some of America's more romantic teenagers, but I believe that they fall in love with these songs because it sounds pretty, not because it is good music. Essentially, all these songs are people strumming some simple bar chords and singing in not-so-intelligent lyrics about their loves and how isolated they are.Too many people have been hypnotized by these songs because they make them feel that they are part of a deep and emotional experience.

(Being a big fan of the harder bands like Avail and Dillinger 4.) Then my friend played the cd for me again and something in the lyrics struck me as very moving and powerful. The guitar is beautiful and mostly understated which allows his voice to resonate and convey the pain, hurt and confusion these songs are about. You can really feel the longing in his voice and immediately begin to connect with the songs. I guess this would be classified as an Emo cd, but I think it is much more than that. This isn't emotion for the sake of whining about it. The ideas and feelings expressed are very deep and the lyrics are catchy and incredible. I think that any fan of music would love this cd and add it to their list of favorites.

Acoustic guitar combined with heartfelt lyrics make this CD a must-have for your collection. I can honestly say I relate to every song.

He remakes two songs from that first CD on this one to include drums (Screaming Infidelities & Again I Go Unnoticed). The better of these two remakes is 'Again I Go Unnoticed' because the first was straighahead, hard emotion, in terms of singing. The new version includes some contrasting softer singing in the bridge of the song. 'Screaming Infidelities' works better acoustically and that's why it's not as good. As for the rest of the album, it includes more hooks than in the first album and it's actually shorter than that album, but that's OK because you can only take so much of this pure emotion. Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not emo, but a great sound nonetheless.","review":"I first bought this cd because it was recommended by a friend. When I first put it in, I was disappointed with it. It sounded like a bunch of constant whining. However, as time went by, the songs grew on me, and now I truly appreciate Chris Carrabba's voice and lyrics (also the fact that he's really hot!), and the guitar and drum work is amazing. I know that they are not emo, so I don't think they should be regarded as an emo band. Still, this cd is incredible. My favorite songs include The Best Deceptions, The Good Fight, Again I Go Unnoticed, and Bitter Pill. Also, check out their new cd, A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"After a recent break up with the first love of my love, i wasn't in the greatest of moods.

Dashboard Confessional has started the push toward the mainstream for emo. This sounds like it was thrown together with the intent of just selling records. It just sounds bad. Dashboard Confessional has combined Goo Goo Dolls style pop and emo to make this unoriginal record. There is absolutely no sincerity in this record, the lyrics are lackluster and ambigous, and the vocals sound like recycled Saves the Day.

One of the dozen works on the disc, Ecstasy is known to Arab listeners as tarab, reaching a state of joy derived from the music, often linked to Sufi traditions. Racy wrote beautiful long solo for the cello before he joins in on the rim-blown reed flute called nay, to Kaspar's steady beat on the tar. A master nay player, Racy makes his audience feel the wind of the east come out of his wind instrument."},{"rating":"1","title":"unpleasant sounds","review":"Kronos Caravan was a dissapointment and a waste of money.

The author does a simple but powerful job of presenting a set of talents we all had naturally as children and teaching us how to get them back after years of school and work have literally sucked them out of us.

His harrowing experiences of being around women bring it all home.Chauvin emphatically believes it is impossible for men and women to form creative and stable relationships which do not progress to the inevitable climax (i.e. oral sex), or, in his own words (sic): \\"To women love is an occupation.

The quilt has ladybugs on it so these clips matched perfectly. They are clips which isn't exactly the recommended way to hang a handmade quilt which is why we used 4 in total - to distribute the weight and avoid pulling the stitching out. 4 was plenty for a baby size quilt and would probably even work for a larger size. We used 3M adhesive hooks to link onto the hooks at the back making hanging a breeze.

Sam Rockwell delivers an award-calibre title performance. George Clooney has a stylish debut as a director and directs Drew Barrymore to a natural sweetness that has been missing from most of her recent films and Julia Roberts plays against type with perfection-- a small role-- but she steals every scene.

Director George Clooney has a deep apprecitation for TV's pop culture and a wide span grip on this unyielding but doubtful true story, from the autobiography of Chuck Barris who had the audacity to confess to the world that while host of \\"The Gong Show\\", he was a CIA assassin. Vintage takes on \\"The Newlywed Game\\" and \\"The Dating Game\\" sharply define muted sexual psychedlia that was '60s network television. Yet the question remains - was he or wasn't he a hit man for the CIA? Come on, Chuck! Must we say so? We've always loved you! Go ahead and have your little delusion.

I would have told him I could see the influence of the Coen Brothers --he worked with them, after all, in \\"Oh, Brother Where Art Thou\\", which was brilliant-- but that he took this vision much farther, with a perception and a subtlety granted to few. I would hope that Mr. Clooney follows the example set by Robert Redford, a charming actor, but a really exceptional director. We hope to see more of his work, and with luck he will always have this kind of astonishing material as his point of departure, to continue to have us dazzled and at his feet with admiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"<3","review":"I grew up on the Gong Show.

Clooney is the best out of the box actor turned director I've seen in almost ten years. There is no doubt he will direct more and I will be first in line. Clooney's style is very creative and fresh compared to today's computer eye candy movie. You can almost see the directors he's worked with in the past sort of come together. Then we have Sam Rockwell. This man was powerful and driving in the role of Burris. He stole the movie and ran with it. Sam Rockwell is a name and face to be remembered folks, I clearly underestimated him. This movie is a must watch for anyone who loves film or wants to see a different side of Clooney."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful in Every Way","review":"Only the second movie in my life that I walked out of for fear of dying a horribly painful death from bad movie contamination. The story is uninteresting, the acting is unimpressive and looking at Sam Rockwell's butt gets dull after the first 10 seconds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Ordinary","review":"George Clooney continues his run of outs with this effort following on from the dismal Solaris. This time although the movie is less of a dud, he (as director) must take more of the blame. On the surface of it, this movie has all the makings of success combining good actors, an intriguing story and plenty of adult concepts. I was really looking forward to this telling of the quirky life (real or imagined) of Chuck Barris. Despite the promise, this movie simply does not engage. There is no real excitement at any point and you simply cannot relate or empathise with the main character. Others will disagree, but for me this movie just meanders along. Delving a bit deeper, the soundtrack is completely poor also, and this does not help to add any vigour to the wishy-washy plot. Overall, the movie is not a complete waste of time, but you have to feel disappointed knowing what could have been achieved with this raw material."},{"rating":"1","title":"I confess its out of my mind!!","review":"Just want to forget I seen this movie I watch until the end waiting for something to get good, but nothing and I like my true stories ,but not this one .Maybe not in my time chuck Barris a story but not a movie nice try for two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"When I see \\"Cameo\\" appearances in an indication...","review":"Don't believe this movie to be factual, as it has never been documented that this was no more than \\"a way to sell the book itself.\\" Clooney fans will go with great expectations to stare at the SuperStar..however, this movie doesn't deliver.

This book will be particularly helpful for technical people: engineers, scientists and others who have to be logical and analytical to do their jobs, but must transcend that state to be creative and do their best work.So much of the advice in this book is universal.

Well, all I can say for this book is that it primarily focuses on talking about the acronym FAST for writing a book. It repeats the same sentences over and over again through the use of various sentences that is primarily saying the same thing. If you want this book, I suggest going to the library and write on one sheet of paper the word FAST and what it stands for and place the book back on the shelf.

Once you learn and have it the way you want its easy to control. I wish they would take this predator idea and make a really great game out of it. It could be so much. i have heard good things about the PC game AvsP but never played it. Graphics are average and so is the game play. So unless your a fan you won't get much out of this game.

I'm not saying this game is better than the games hinted at above, but it does what it is meant to do very well.

That said, it is absolutely the worst film I have ever seen.I'd rather not relive the horror by going into too many details, just suffice it to say that it was scripted badly, directed badly and, for the most part, acted badly (Bruce Dern, however, did an OK job).The highlight of the movie was at the very end, when Rip Torn, struggling the entire time to portray what he perceived was a \\"Cape Cod\\" accent, suddenly developed an Irish brogue. I'm pretty sure he was drunk.Don't end up on your death-bed, wishing you had back the 97 minutes of your life you wasted on this film. Run, don't walk, and buy or rent something else.

There were two holes in the base, clearly leftover from the manufacturing process. I've invested my money, time and muscle in a new basketball hoop and have nothing to show for it. Lifetime has offered to replace the base. So my only options at this point ALL involve having to assemble another basketball hoop.This was all after having to wait on delivery of a missing part already.I bought the product because of such wonderful reviews of Lifetime. Don't be fooled as I was."},{"rating":"2","title":"good quality product - only drawback is directions","review":"This backboard is of really good quality. It does take a while to put it together, but that's not really a drawback, just a practical reality. It takes two people to assemble, and we spent about six hours on the project. The packaging is good in that each set of parts are divided into separate bags that you open for each assembly step. The downside of the directions is that they aren't as clear as they should be, and there are no quality pictures. I say this because we got it about half assembled and then realized that we has a huge component wrong. We looked back and there was nothing in the earlier directions that would have alerted us to this issue, you really only find out until like five steps later if you happened to get it right, or not. Other than this issue, it's a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating assembly experience","review":"The basketball hoop is promoted as manufactured in the US. Actually most of the hardware is made in China. Two bolts came with a thread that was not long enough and I had to call to get replacement parts. After I received the parts I continued to assemble the hoop and discovered then that two washers were missing to complete the assembly. As I was fed up with waiting, I went to Home Depot to buy the washers. After a week of asembly (and my children waiting to play), I have a sturdy, nice looking hoop but the assembly experience was frustrating. I think that Lifetime should do more quality control."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift for your vegan friends!","review":"I purchased this vegan gift basket for a friend's birthday.

I think it could have been so much more. The characters should have been developed into something really great but they weren't. I am glad I read all of them but I was disappointed in all three. Not a whole lot of depth. I thought the first one started off really good but each book got a little more boring for me. I am not a real fan of the way this writer writes.

Sounds more like a funeral dirge then a simcha (happy ocassion). And definitely agree with the previous review - Wagner doesn't belong on anything Jewish. If you're looking for music for an upcoming wedding - try Neginah or Neshoma Orchestras, Piamenta (if you appreciate an awesome musician), Oif Simchas if you like techno rock, Chevra if you like \\"boy group\\" ala N'Sync. All can be found online."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of the better compilations","review":"Claudio Simonetti, previously member of the Italian band of the 70's \\"Goblins\\", has seen his works grouped in several compilations, of which, unfortunately, this is not one of the best. The songs are: Profondo rosso (deep red), Phenomena, Opera, Demoni (demons), Elucubrations, Suspiria, Tenebrae, Ozone free, Craws, Profondo rosso live.Craws is the only track that can't be found elsewhere, and it is a pretty nice piece with a hectic beat. In other versions, as in the album \\"X-terror files\\", tracks such as \\"profondo rosso\\", \\"phenomena\\", \\"suspiria\\", \\"demoni\\" and \\"tenebrae\\" are great, here they are rather plain. Simonetti's other albums are worth a little search effort, I would pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Altered soundtrack in all the wrong ways","review":"I was aware when I downloaded this soundtrack that it did not contain the original tracks from the films (as you can hear from the samples and by reading who the composer is). That said, I did not enjoy these particular reinterpretations of the originals (all have been altered significantly with added synthetic effects and lyrics that prevent me from enjoying the music). In my personal opinion the effects and added lyrics sound cheap, tacky and are extremely distracting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock on with Sony","review":"This is the second mp3 player I've owned. The first one crapped out on me 2 months after purchase so I was skeptical about getting another. I didn't have to buy this one though which was a plus, and I've been thrilled with it. I recently got back from a trip where I travelled by air and despite how noisy airplanes can be I was able to relax and enjoy my music. It is very easy to program and charge and so lightweight it's unbelievable. I even use it while walking my dogs. The only complaint I have is the headphones it comes with are not that great, but I had my own from the previous player so I didn't really worry about it. To me, Sony has always been top of the line and they did not fall short here, so if you're in the market for an mp3 player this is a great route to take."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camcorder!","review":"Had this camcorder for few months now and it has been put to a lot of use. Compact, light, and easy to carry around. Tons of features which takes getting use to since most of it is touch screen. Battery life is pretty good. Video quality is excellent as well. Very happy with the purchase, and I have had no problems so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Service and Unresponsive....","review":"Ordered product expidited and after a week it was never received. I finally received notice from Amazon that the order was cancelled (by the vendor). My guess is they never had the product to begin with. I'll NEVER use them again.

This toaster burns the outside edges while leaving the middle untoasted. I can't seem to find a perfect setting and am hoping there is a \\"break in period\\" as I no longer have the packaging and therefore don't know if it's returnable.I would not buy this product, it's not worth the $120."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG LET DOWN","review":"I had high hopes for this toaster. I thought that by spending big bucks I would get a quality product. Not so. It toasts my heavy whole wheat bread more quickly on the lowest setting, compared to my old cheap toaster. But it is very uneven. White breads and poptarts are burned on the lowest setting. If you try this product be sure to save all the packaging so you can send it back. It's pretty but definitely not worth the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Malcolm X","review":"This is an outstanding documentary... mostly all film footage of Malcolm X in his own words. He pulls no punches in his indictment of the slavery/segregation experience of the black people at the hands of the white power structure. With equal moral force, he indicted the NOI leader for his sexual affairs. After his pilgrimage to Mecca, he had a new vision of how white people could overcome their evilness. Knowing that he was soon to be killed, he stood his ground and spoke his truth even as the bullets ripped through his body. He was truly an Islamic teacher and visionary of the first order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story!

Repetition has and always will be the best way to learn. I had to wonder how the text might compare to textbooks used on college and university campuses, since I am using the book simply for an online certification, but for now the new knowledge is a head full for me, and probably will be for some time to come. It is very fun to know so much now about all the parts of the brain and the body, and about how all of our bodies function, subjects I had not previously studied in spite of much higher education."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Text for Course","review":"This book was a required pruchase for a course.

I'm sorry but you don't see Champion under so much pressure. Also in this book Samantha's hardly ever mentioned, and she was my favorite charecter. Still this book is better htan the other books in the series.I hope that Joanna starts to write these books again. I'm still a faithful fan and I will continue reading the series. But plese bring Sammy back from Ireland, and please write a superedition about the lost years, that occur in book 24."},{"rating":"1","title":"To unrealistic","review":"As much as the writer wants to deny it, race horses lose once and a while. Ever since number 15, Glory wins his races by unimaginable margins, Storm was \\"lightning fast, piling up victory after victory\\", Champion wins the triple crown and the Dubai Cup. I don't get it. Why don't they lose for once. That's what the racing world is! It's all chance, win or lose. A race horse loses sometimes. Man O' War lost, Secretariat lost, and those were the greatest racehorses of all time. Please. Give them some competition. Competition is the center of racing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's Joanna's words, not Karen's","review":"I thought this book was a little crummy. Karen needs to get a lot more of Joanna's ideas when she's writing. The more Karen starts writing w/o Joanna it makes me feel like Joanna's getting so old she can't write any more. The books, as the numbers get larger, have been dropping out important things, like what happened to the Townsends? I thought they owned half interest in March to Glory. I think they should at least be menchined more than zero times in the books! And also, what ever happened to Wonder's mother, Holly, did she die? If she did, why didn't I get told. I mean, come on you guys, this is tourcher!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They Just Aren'tWritten good anymore","review":"This seris is not going to last much longer. Karen Bentley has taken all of the good story lines out of it and made it like the perfect little life. I remeber that a couple of the books were so good that I would just cry but now nothing goes wrong everything is always perfect. The Townsends are gone and the good characters have less and less of a part. I think the only way to save the seris is to have Mrs. Campbell start writing again and then a Special Edition needs to be written to get everything on the right track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This book was so good! If you like the Thoroughbred books with the most action and excitment, read this book!! I don't know what the rest of you guys are complaining about!!Champion deseved to do well.

Its the best Thoroughbred book until Racing Image, another really good one!! This is a MUST READ!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It just doesn't work","review":"How come when Karen Bentley finally writes a book with a horse running in the Triple Crown the horse wins all three races???? Besides, in the previous books the author can't even get the basic facts right. She calls Wonder's Pride, Townsend Pride, but Townsend Pride was Wonder's sire. Then, Ashleigh keeps saying that Brad had Wonder whipped so that she wouldn't run in her early training. It was actually Wonder's rider,Jocko, who was riding how her early trainer, Jim Jennings, wanted him to ride. Also, when they were having to find a jockey for Glory and later on Honor, why didn't they just ask Jilly? What's up with this missing character thing? Whatever happened to Precocious, Sierra, Fleeting Moment, Jilly, the Townsends, and the others. See what I mean? This series has really gone downhill. -M.D."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent.","review":"i myself liked this book. Whitebrook finally has a Triple Crown winner! I love Champion and I'm glad he won. He's the greatest horse ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fantasy world of Thoroughbred","review":"First off, this book just wasn't planned well. They tried to slide six months into 199 pages and that just didn't work well. By the time we were actually in the Triple Crown the whole thing was completed within three chapters. Suspenseful? Not really. The whole thing was so downplayed. Back with Pride raced it was actually exciting. A second thing, this book just doesn't know what's going on. Post position draws for any race are not run like that in reality. For anyone who actually knows what happens in the racing industry, most of what is written in this book shows how much Bentley knows about racing. It shows that she didn't even bother to actually watch a real race or read a simple racing publication to tell her what races are what and when they are run."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does What I Need It to Do","review":"This magnifier replaces another one nearly identical to it. I'm glad to know where I can get another one in the future when I need one. The price is right, too.I'm blind with some usable vision, though some would label me as visually impaired. I don't do a lot of reading with handheld magnifiers any more, but this one's great to have with me in a pocket all the time. The 9X power is just right.

I have been a professional coin dealer for more than 30 years and have used a variety of magnifiers, from cheap to $100 plus Zeiss lenses. The Donegan glass distorts the image in the dead center of the lens and gets much worse just a little ways out from center. I have similar 2-lens magnifiers that were made in Korea and cost me $36 per dozen, that's $3 each, that blow this glass away optically.

The acting was hideous(in both movies), and the script was poorly written. In the show, there is a little puppet boy named Dudley, who gets saved and tells everybody about Jesus. That part was christian-like, but the other characters, I just can't leave out. They act foolish and giddy, driving around in a car and hitting eachother with bags.

We laugh a lot when we look back, and it's only been seven years. This will obviously be a great book to pass on to children some day. What I like most about it is that we don't have to do much work. Just find a picture that best captures the year, and write a little about the highlights. I am often surprised by what has happened during the year. For busy people, this book is a great way to have the benefits of a scrapbook, but without the work.

It's a wonderful walk down memory lane, and I know our kids and grandkids will love it as well. It's so easy to use - you simply stick in a picture from that year, and fill out a short paragraph to cap the year - where you live, what you did, how you celebrated your anniversary, any big changes that may have happened.

The accompanying CD is absolutely awful. The reading in French does not sound like native speakers. The reading style is very unnatural. The voices of the readers are high pitched, and their attempts at drama are irritating, not entertaining. It sounds as if it is being read by a couple of junior high students, although that is not the case. In sum, I would not choose to buy this even for my children for more than 5 dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun French with a twist","review":"This is the best French book and audio CD I've come across in years. It has a unique approach to teaching French. I love it! The audio CD is wonderful and narrated very clearly by native speakers. Basically, you can study and then follow the French story and listen to it at the same time. I've learned lots of expressions and tons of vocabulary. The grammar sections teach you conjugation of different verbs, lots of idioms, etc. The mystery keeps you going from chapter to chapter -- a brilliant motivator. I thank the author for such a fine book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to learn French!","review":"This book is a great way to learn French, although it isn't for immediate beginners. The book is about a scary story in French with English translations and a few grammar tools to help you out after each passage. THere also is a cd with which the story is read, which is a little cheesy with the voices all read by one person, but is good for verbal learning in different pitches, paces and styles. I wish that there was more grammar in the book to learn from or to write sentances instead of just words, in English and French, but overall i think this book is a good way to help you learn french. I am learning this to help me student teach in France and i feel it is helping me not only with grammar, but fluency and reading. I would recommend this book, because it is a fun and different way to learn French."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it !","review":"I have this cd and I will admit that I like every song on it.I can't say that for very many cd's.

First, I could never get any of my mice (Microsoft Optical Intellimouse, Microsoft Wheelmouse, and Logitech mouse) to be recognized. So, I just used the monitor and keyboard functionality for 7 days. While the switching between machines worked as advertised, I had keyboard problems. The KVM caused typed characters to be missed by the computer or a single keystroke would end up being recognized as 2 or 3 strokes of the same letter by the machine. My only option to get any work done was to slow my typing down significantly. I would not recommend this product and recommend users to pay the extra [money] for the Belkin 2-port KVM Switch (cables included but not built in unit)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot-key switching is not at all reliable.","review":"This unit uses keyboard hot-keys for switching.

I would have view on the screen, and I wouldn't be able to do anything from the keyboard or the mouse, on one of the PCs only. It would work for the other PC.

For example, Startech's Ultra Compact 2-Port KVM Switch (SV211MICRO) supports MS Intellimouse (Pro Version), MS Explorer and MS Optical Mouse.So the upshot is:If you have a generic 2-button wheel-type mouse, any KVM should work; otherwise, you need to look for a KVM that explicitly supports your mouse model or type.

I used this switch to connect my laptop (with a port replicator) and a desktop. When swtiched to the laptop, the mouse just hangs. In the rare occasions when mouse responds, the middle scroll button is not working. After removing the KVM switch and connect mouse directly to the port replicator the mouse works fine.The story is not finished yet. When switched to the desktop, the Video image on the monitor is twisting constantly. The mouse is responding yet the middle scroll button is still not functioning.All the problems go away when connecting keyboard, mouse and video directly to the machines.

This is powered by the existing mouse and keyboard connections.The transition from one computer to another occurs flawlessly. The documentation is well drawn up and then cord length is more than adequate.All in all, this is a much improved model from the kvm switch I have at work. Less bulky and no power required."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for...","review":"I purchased this KVM switch about 5 months ago or so, and it has always given me a flaky performance. Switching between my laptop and desktop has been very intermittent in performance: sometimes it switches, sometimes it doesn't. Also sometimes the scroll lock key doesn't respond when you hit it twice to make it switch between machines. To make it work I have to unplug the switch from all my devices then plug them all back in. It is a very big pain in the rear! Also when I boot up only one machine it doesn't like that.

I tried several different configs, even different mice, with no success. I took it to work where I have 2 Gateway PII400s, and it failed with them as well. Before you blame Gateway, I went and bought an IO Gear KVM for $50, including an audio connector. We use IO Gear 4 port box-style switches at work with great success.

It is designed to be easy-to-read, with larger-than-normal print and plenty of white space, but I rather wish they had made the text a couple of sizes smaller and filled the extra space with useful vocabulary. It's also rather silly to give childish phonetic pronunciations for every word in the dictionary, since German is, in most cases, very phonetic and easy to pronounce in the first place.

Although the bookis 10 years old by now, and certain predictions have already come to pass, mostof it is still fresh and relevant.

Some authors, such as those on Cosmology, communicated well, but then others were far too high-level for a general audience. It was the latter chapters that brought me considerable delight & education when discussing the Mind, Psychology etc (not my favourite subjects I may add).If all the contributors had tuned their work to the same general audience, then this would have deserved 5 stars; if it wasn't for the redeeming work by the psychologists & neuroscientists I'd have probably rated the book as 3 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"It worked very well.

The truth is watered down to cohere most generously with the sensibilities of certain Catholics in America.This book is not loyal to explicit Church teachings. Notable areas of dissent include contraception, the ordination of women, and basically every other tenet of the Catholic faith which is rejected by \\"liberal\\" Catholics.It saddens me that this book is used for RCIA classes.

However, the Vatican, after many years and likely complaints, forced the bishop to withdraw his approval from the book. This is a very, very uncommon occurance, and shows the subtle danger in this book. Just because it selectively quotes Church documents does not mean that it is faithful to the teaching of the Church.

And for those who enjoy tender, heartwarming moments, this book doesn't overlook you, I cried through the last few chapters so have tissues nearby!Author Larry Bohall's talent of entwining mystery, murder and romance pull you into this book from the first chapter and hold you captive until the last page - which comes all too soon!

Once they were installed, I noticed that 2 of the four didn't work properly. Evidently, if you screw them down so that they don't feel loose on the wall, the snap-back mechinism doesn't snap back. I loosened it until it snapped back, but now the outlet cover feels loose.I returned them and got the horizontal safety outlet covers. Those you can screw in tightly and it doesn't affect the snap back. Plus, the horizonal ones have fewer parts. Additionally, the top of the screw that comes with it, is painted to match the plastic.

With that said, it's like no other love story you'll ever see. Dustin Hoffman plays Ben, a college kid who is seduced by a married woman and friend of his parents. Then he meets Elaine, the woman's daughter. He falls in love, and the next day faces a world where his seducer is out to get him, his love, Elaine, despises him, and he hasn't the foggiest idea what to do with the rest of his seemingly-charmed life. Except that suddenly he has a purpose, possibly the first in his twenty-one years: to win Elaine.Every actor in this film is incredibly fabulous-and that is not at all an exaggeration. To rival the acting is the cinematography, which is imaginative, pleasing, and original. One day, perhaps, I'll be able to think of something in this film that could have been better; but it won't be anytime soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't meet expectations","review":"There's been so much written about this classic movie, but I'd never seen it until recently. With that said, the movie isn't as funny as I had expected or hoped. Some of it might be Dustin Hoffman's acting - I like him in other movies, but he comes off pretty annoying here. Part of it might be that the movie pushed cultural boundaries and spoke to issues in the 1960s that don't have as much resonance today. Some scenes were just too over the top - like Hoffman's parents forcing him to go scuba-diving in the pool. I just don't get the humor there.The movie made great use of Simon and Garfunkel songs for the soundtrack! It really becomes part of the film and tells the story. Frankly, it's probably the best part of the movie. It would be nice if more movies weaved pop music in their films.Bottom line: if you liked The Catcher in the Rye (or stories like it), you'll like The Graduate. If you're like me and hated that book, you won't find the movie that exciting either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twisted, Funny, and True","review":"An all around great movie that's message has not been lost, even after 35 years. This is an amazing movie, and is best seen by high school/collage aged people, as they begin to question the ethics of the adult world. The graduate (Dustin Hoffman) returns home from collage a legend, but wants nothing more than a little peace and quiet, a request his parents refuse to accommodate. At his graduation party, Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) drags him back to her house where she attempts to seduce him. Her surprising motive is revealed later.

It's a good film, and I like it, but I believe it was number 7 on the AFI list, and that's just far too high a ranking. A masterpiece of filmaking? Not in my opinion.

And also a great soundtrack with Simon and Garfunkel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here's to you, Mrs. Robinson.","review":"One of the movies that shaped a generation. A dramatic triumph in the form of Dustin Hoffman's debut performance as the feckless Benjamin. Benjamin is the graduate of the title. Fresh out of college, he has a promising life ahead of him. He just doesn't know what that life is. A boy without direction, he falls under the influence of Mrs. Robinson, who just happens to be his sweetheart, Elaine's, mother. When she seduces him, he must choose the path for him, be it Elaine, or Mrs. Robinson. And by choosing, this boy graduates into manhood. A powerful film, whose final shot speaks to today's generation of young graduates, just as it did to the generation 30 years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great coming of age film gets a facelift","review":"This film pretty much defined the 60's in many ways - people keeping up appearances, the awkwardness of coming of age in a time that looked like the 50's on the surface while just underneath that surface people were living in the 70's, while raising the timeless question of \\"What exactly IS love?\\" Although a time capsule in many ways, there is much going on from a psychological point of view that still makes it interesting.

Either way, the movie is incredible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"Pretty much everybody agrres that this movie is a classic. Is it though a five star film? If you judge it from today's perspective probably not. But if you judge it from the perspective of the 60's it is. It talks (via Benjamin) about the new generation that does not know what to do with his life and his fears. Anne Bancroft is not the perfect looking woman, but she does have the capability and, in a certain way, the charm to seduce the young graduate. The film tends to be a bit slow, but again that is judging it from todays stadards and it is not exactly fair. The photography, the music and the perfomance of the cast is superb.

I don't know what THE GRADUATE is supposed to mean. Like 2001 A SPACE ODDYSEY and MIDNIGHT COWBOY, THE GRADUATE does a great job of confusing the heck out of you to the point where you think you must have seen something great. THE GRADUATE is worth seeing (for free, on TV) once, I guess, because it takes you somewhere (an affair with your girlfriend's mother) the movies rarely go. Also, the late Norman Fell does a superb job playing the kid's landlord. Director Francis Ford Coppola uses symbolism well in pictures such as THE OUTSIDERS because his imagery relates to the story. But the director of THE GRADUATE must have thought symbols could substitute for a story. They ought to send THE GRADUATE to summer school, or better yet, film school."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am confused!","review":"Let me see if I get this right about this \\"classic\\" film of the 60's.

Then he breaks off the affair with Ms. Robinson in order to stop the marriage of her daughter. So that he can run off with her.

It was a wonderful movie and one of the first for Mike Nichols and Dustin Hoffman. Plus, it had the wonderful musical contribution of Simon and Garfunkle. Altogether, first rate! Well, I thought of it now and then when I heard the S & G songs on the radio, but that was about it. In any case, my wife and I were shopping at Ross and I spotted it on the DVD bargain shelves. I couldn't resist. My wife had never heard of it, but she was willing to go along with my word that she'd enjoy it. We both watched it last night and enjoyed it immensely. It's an exceptionally well done movie. Very funny. Emotional. A fun (and authentic) look back at the early 60s. We can watch this again and again.

The double entendre jumps out at you as he is expected to graduate from boyhood to fully functioning, sexual male specimen as he is seduced by Mrs. Robinson, his future sweetheart's mother. The social convolutions of Mrs. Robinson, played to the hilt by Ann Bancroft, are indicative of the lengths to which the 50's generation parents would go to ensure the welfare of their college-prepped offspring, their own social behavior notwithstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless","review":"Everyone should see this movie. Hoffman & Bancroft are superb. The supporting cast is believable and deliver outstanding performances. It is a slice of life which is as poignant today as it was in 1967. The scenes in the film not only show what was happening in the late 60's, but serve to capture the feelings and confusion of a young adult preparing for the rest of his life, when the future is not all that clear. The Simon & Garfunkle sound track is a perfect match and serves to evoke all the emotions that the characters are feeling. Ben's mom & dad are hilarious in their efforts to be part of, but not intrusive in, his life. I have seen this movie dozens of times since I was first exposed to it in a film class several years ago and I have not tired of it yet!

The film earned $50 million in 1968, which is number one money maker in that time.Director, Nichols, won the Academy Award for Best Director. The film was also nominated for 6 other Awards, Best Picture, Best Actor and Actress, and Best Supporting Actress. The soundtrack featuring songs by Simon and Garfunkel was gold in 1968 and \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" was number one on the charts for four weeks.College grad (Dustin Hoffman) does what his parents and other people tell him to do including family friend Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) who tells him to have an affair with her. Then he falls in love with her daughter Eliane Robinson (Katherine Ross), and finally finds something he wants to do with his life.I give this film 4 stars because I thought Dustin Hoffman did a good job.

Mrs. Robinson, played by Anne Bancroft (Oscar-nominated), seduces Braddock and wants him to have an affair with her. But, later, Braddock falls in love with Robinson's daughter, Elaine (Katharine Ross, in her Oscar-nominated role), instead. Mike Nichols won the Oscar for Best Director, but the fact is that this movie lost the Best Picture Oscar to \\"In The Heat Of The Night\\" in 1967 is probably a big disappointment just like \\"Raging Bull\\" lost to \\"Ordinary People\\" in 1980.

It kicks in at just the right time and really adds to the movie. That being said this movie stinks. The storyline is absolutely revolting. Can anyone honestly imagine doing what benjamin did? By the end of the movie I couldn't stand him. People make him out to be the hero of the movie, but he is actually just a stupid kid. There were also a lot of holes in the plot. Benjamin seemed too old to be just graduating college, and he seemed too stupid to be 21. Also, I have no idea why elaine decides to go for him after he slept with her mother, many times.

Younger Man, Older Woman, Daughter in between. Ben is a fresh graduate from college home for R&R prior to finding out where he is going in life. Along comes long time family friend Mrs. Robinson, and then Elaine. An odd triangle of multiple personality dysfunctions. The acting is relativly good, especially Anne Bancroft as Mrs. Robinson. The soundtrack is brought to us by Simon and Garfunkle, and has the legendary songs we know from the movie (Mrs. Robinson and Sounds of Silence ect..), but is very repetative and overplayed at times throughout the movie, very distracting at times.

But Neil Young grows on you at many levels. A lot of heart and intensity behind that gentle voice, and melodies that stay in your head.

The album is sparse, with personal, enigmatic, and sometimes bleak lyrics. I first heard this when I was lucky enough to find a used LP in a head shop when I was in college back in the late 90s. Needless to say, the album blew my doors off. I'd already gotten in to Neil, courtesy of a classmate, but this album proved to be a real find. I was elated when it was finally released on CD.On the Beach is probably my favorite Neil song of all time. The lyrics are interesting and the emotion conveyed is incredible.

It toasts the cut face of the bagel perfectly while not burning the rest. I can toast pretty much everything between settings 2 and 3. Why it goes all the way to 8 I can't imagine.

Almost half the album is nothing but lyrical digs on their former co-founder and bandmate. Classy, guys. As another reviewer noted, there is no clear musical direction or sense of cohesiveness on this album, and Dennis' production talents are sorely missed as they were on \\"Brave New World\\". The area most sorely missed is in DeYoug's vocals. Lawrence Gowan, while a talented keyboardist and composer, has a very nasal quality to his voice which left me not wanting to hear any more of him. The strength of the band lay in its two remaining \\"classic line-up\\" members, Tommy Shaw and James \\"JY\\" Young. It seems to this reviewer that they would have been much better off forming a duo or perhaps a new band NOT called \\"Styx\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Styx","review":"The departure of DeYoung De-toothed this band. Styx was a rock band with an original sound. The original sound is gone, the rock is gone. This weak remnant of Styx is proof that DeYoung was more than just a talented vocalist, he was the heart of Styx. With the heart gone, the corpse is in decay. Boring, mundane, heartless, mild.As the poet said, a rose is a rose by any other name. Conversely, Calling a band Styx does not make it so..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Styx!","review":"I'm a long time Styx fan who has been looking forward to this CD for some time. I wasn't sad at all that DDY had left the group because some of his songs from BNW were just plain awful. Thankfully, this CD is a great return for Styx - with almost every song a winner. I have to say though that I can't stand Lawrence Gowan's voice at all, it sounds like a poor imitation of DDY! The songs sung by Tommy Shaw and James Young absolutely rock and sound like the Styx of the 80's that I know and love. The best songs here have to be \\"These are the Times\\", \\"Captain America\\", \\"Do Things My Way\\", \\"Yes I Can\\" and \\"One With Everything\\". Glad to hear that Styx has returned sounding better than ever, but I hope that in the future they skip LG and stick to what they do best. If they are that desperate for a 4th singer - why not Jack Blades? Since he co-wrote \\"Yes I Can\\" and worked with Tommy in Damn Yankess and later Shaw/Blades it would be great to hear him in Styx. Just a thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's what you've been waiting for!!!","review":"The Cyclorama cd from Styx is by far **THE BEST STYX CD IN 20 YEARS** It is a welcome return to the rock and roll stylings of earlier Styx hit albums such as Grand Illusion, Pieces of Eight etc, but with just enough of a \\"today\\" sound blended in that any old or new Styx fan will be THRILLED to hear it. The WELCOME addition of Lawrence Gowan on keyboards replacing DDY adds fresh styling to a couple of tracks that is reminiscent of the addition of Tommy Shaw to the lineup on the Crystal Ball LP. This cd is undeniably a \\"Group Effort\\" and it shows. The songs breath with unity and if you have the chance to see Styx play live, DON'T MISS IT!! They are at the top again when it comes to putting on an amazingly powerful and energetic show."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're Baaaaaaaack!!!!!","review":"You know how when you get a new CD you listen to the whole thing a few times until your favorites come out, then you start skipping certain songs to get to them? Not this one ... this is the FIRST CD I've ever owend where I hear a great song and reach for the controls to hear it again, but before I get to them another great song has started playing. From start to finish this album rocks. It has it all ,,, booming vocals, beautiful melodies, bohemian guitars and drums, blazing keyboards, meaningful lyrics, and the unique sounds of rock STYX without any diversions from ROCK..Give this album a chance and you won't be let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cyclorama","review":"Just as Queen without Freddie Mercury is not Queen, Styx without Dennis DeYoung is not Styx. His voice and arranging are vital.Clearly, as Cyclorama proves, the \\"real\\" Styx was a band greater than the sum of its parts.Styx was one of my favorite bands for 20 years. Imagine my shock, disgust, and anger to see them in concert a few years ago, and not see Dennis on stage -- neatly snookered, I was. I still want my money back. Thankfully, REO Speedwagon took up some of the slack.Dennis' writing did become too sappy in later years, but adults can work through these things -- the spoiled brats that remain with the poor remains of Styx obviously have yet to be able to -- heaven hopes they will find the much needed humility to grow up and try again.Never again will my friends or I spend one red cent on these phony, overstuffed, prancing liars."},{"rating":"1","title":"No De Young- No STYX-no Hits","review":"I would have given this review 1/2 a star or was it an 1/8th Without Dennis this group is terrible!This album is all about sticking to the man who wrote most of of STYX hits!

Takes me back a few years. Sounds the Styx of old. I would recommend this album to all Styx fans. They could have left out the comedy tracks and played some more music.

Guess they are trying to keep up with younger acts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Styx Cyclorama Yuck!","review":"Save Your Money. This CD is not worth the money. There is maybe one or two good songs. Styx just isn't any good without Dennis DeYoung on lead vocals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close, but no carrot.","review":"Sorry to disagree with the review, but after hearing the 1st three songs from the Styx web site, the rest of the CD is very disappointing. Waiting for our time, These are the times and One with everything are very good! They remind you of Equinox and Grand Illusion. But the rest, Yuch!! They should be begging Dennis DeYoung to return and save them. L. Gowan.. I am sorry but he is just BAD, he cannot sing or write! When I saw other reviews and listened to the 3 songs, I was really looking forward to the rest of the CD. But now, I say Download the MP3's from styxworld.com, Don't spend your money on the rest and dream of a perfect world or a \\"Brave new world\\" where DDY was still part of Styx!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You Call This Music?","review":"Styx should be ashamed of themselves for putting out such garbage. Does this CD come with a money back guarantee? It should. I have a complete set of Styx CD's and this without a doubt is their worse effort by far.It's pretty obvious which former member of Styx was the straw that stirred the drink. It certainly isn't any of the present members."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why???","review":"I really hope that they haven't release this.As a Styx fan for well over 20 years I found this album terribly disappointing. Tommy Shaw seems to lost all writing skills in these two Styx comebacks, which is strange since he made may good songs as a solo artist and Damn Yankees and Shaw/Blades member, but still I feel that \\"On my way\\" was the last decent song he have written.I was not too pleased with Brave New World, but at least it had some good moments, and Dennis DeYoung saved the album from total failure with his songs. No such luck this time, songs in this album are totally brainless and idealess mess, and the stupid talks included seems to confirm that they have declined back to childhood level again.This is very sad, since Return to paradise was extremely strong comeback and live album, but they totally failed to carry on after that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is That IT","review":"I can't believe after all the hype and anticipation for this album to come out, That this was the best they could do. The band members had mentioned prior to the release that this was a colaboration of all of the members. I thought there was more musical talent than this. Well, it is quite obvious that the current Styx lineup is suffering terribly over the absence of Dennis DeYoung. The music( guitars, keyboards, drums) sound nice, but the lyrics and the vocals leave much to be desired. I have been a Styx fan since 1974, and I believe that this is probably their weekest effort to date. A good analogy would be, if you were a carpenter and wanted to produce better work, you would not cut off your best hand. I think they goofed on this one. Good luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lack of Class","review":"This has got to be the most tasteless piece of drivel ever created. It is hard to believe that 2 of the band members (Young and Shaw) were long-time members of the Original Styx group which entertained countless millions of fans during the 70s, 80s and early and mid nineties. This was a real class act when Dennis DeYoung was at the helm but I cannot find even one song on this CD that is not offensive to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Complete Waste","review":"I am afraid that Classic Styx fans will find this CD distasteful in the extreme; filled with hostility and bitterness. Among the most blatant slaps in the face to former bandleader and hitmaker, Dennis DeYoung I list the following songs: Killing The Thing That You Love, Do Things My Way, Bourgeois Pig, Fooling Yourself, and Kiss Your Ass Goodbye.It is a sad commentary that the driving force of this album seems to be taking aim at their former mentor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought I was buying a Styx CD","review":"I figured I was purchasing a Styx CD but I was wrong. This is a Tommy Shaw CD with a different label. If you approach the album this way, you will probably like it, but if you approach it looking for the great Styx of yesteryear, you are in for a big disappointment.The couple of Shaw breaks that are in there from Gowan are Beatles knock offs. Not only did he plagerize the music, but his vocals are lacking as far as a lead singer are concerned. He just doesn't have what it takes to lead the band. Maybe it was just a mistake in the recording, I doubt it, but hey, the benefit of the doubt. Anyway, his singing doesn't come across as powerful, it comes across as weak and hesitant.Overall, a large disappointment. The magic that was Styx has been lost. They should have stopped at BNW and left us with happy memories."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic joining of new and old ~*~","review":"This album is an enjoyable kickback to the sound that is Styx, with songs like \\"These Are the Times\\" and \\"Captain America\\" (and even a brief re-mix of \\"Foolin' Yourself\\" with \\"Palm of Your Hand\\") while also embracing a fantastic freshness brought in by each member of the band. The songs \\"Kiss Your Ass Goodbye\\" and \\"Fields of the Brave\\" really showcase the vast amount of energy and talent being held within this group. If you haven't heard Styx lately, buy this CD and meet them again ... for this first time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Styx Album Since The 70s!!!","review":"This new Styx CD will go down in Styx history as one of there best! Most bands like Styx that put out new music these days don't come close to there glory days. This is not true here! Cyclorama rocks from start to finish with those big Styx harmonies and great hooks throughout the CD. If you like \\"Pieces Of Eight\\" or \\"The Grand Illusion\\" you will love this CD. It is classic Styx with a new twist!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Styx without Dennis DeYoung?","review":"You. Must. Be. Kidding.Apparently, \\"Styx\\" found enough time between playing at chicken-gutting contests to record this collection of crappy shots at their once and always leader, Dennis DeYoung. And this bunch will forever be beholden to Dennis for all that they have.That really STYX in their craw, you know.Avoid \\"Stink-o-rama\\" at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"They need Dennis Back!!","review":"Dennis Deyoung created Styx and he still is Styx. Sure the new line-up is a delisiuos blend, but the only original member in the band is JY, the other four (including Tommy Shaw) are just playing under the name and riding in its past glories made possible by dennis. His beuitful voice and tremendous keyboard skill along with his insperational and vastly meaniful lyrics will be dearly missed by all true STYX fans. The CD is GREAT though!, its just not STYX."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are BETTER albums to buy","review":"Your chances of going into a CD store and picking a CD, totally by random, that is better than Cyclorama are VERY good. Painfully mediocre is a hard thing for me to say but, it's true. And when you understand that I bought this at the Styx/Kansas/John Waite concert you can understand how disappointed I was. And I bought the $30 autographed edition,too!I really wanted to sit back and enjoy this album. But it's not going to be a memorable CD and probably will be collecting dust in clearance bins very soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter garbage, nothing else to say really.","review":"I honestly can't get through a whole song off this album without skipping. It is by far the worst Styx album ever. They spend most of the album sending jabs at Dennis Deyoung. And notice that since this train wreck they can't even write an album. How many live albums or cover albums do they think people will buy??"},{"rating":"1","title":"where's dennis?","review":"i couldnt wait for the cd to be released, then when i finally got it, it was less than thrilled. i love tommy shaw, but i was hoping dennis deyoung would have made a contribution. the music is okay, but i think the cd is missing dennis' song writing ability. maybe i just need more listening time, but i dont like it right away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of the best new \\"classic\\" stuff ever......","review":"The band members said they wanted this to be just a damn good rock album all the way through. Well, I'm not sure they accomplished that but they came pretty close. The songs for download off of the styxworld.com web site are the most classic sounding Styx songs on the album (and the best in my opinion). My other favorite song is Tommy's \\"Together\\" which doesn't really sound like Styx but I think it could do well on radio if promoted properly. Some of the other songs I consider to be filler such as Killing The Thing You Live or Kiss Your ... Goodbye. But on the other hand, you can't expect a regular CD to be a greatest hits all by itself. This CD is a good buy and well worth the money.I'm getting tired of all these people whining about band member differences. Like the members of all the 70's and 80's bands never changed. ... they changed quite often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Horrid","review":"Oh my gosh, Tommy Shaw and JY have personally ruined what was once a great band. This album just grates on the ears. They miss Dennis DeYoung tremendously. The songs are uninspired, trite, and in too many occasions immature and tactless with their constant badgering of Dennis. Really uncalled for.Don't waste your money on this - thankfully not many Americans are as I notice it is down to 1685 on the Amazon chart. If you want good Styx buy Paradise, Cornerstone, or Grand Illusion. Or better yet, buy Dennis DeYoung solo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Styx is Dead - Long Live Dennis","review":"Call me a purist, but Styx without Dennis DeYoung just doesn't cut it. Sure Tommy and JY are still there and their vocals and harmonies echo Styx of old, but in between the new members throw it off track to where you don't know who your listening to. And the obvious thrashes at DeYoung are childish and imature in my opinion. They've been my favorite band for most of my life. Unfortunately I've not felt this let down since they broke up in 1984."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never been a Styx fan...","review":"...but this dumb album cover caught my eye the other day while I was in Wal Mart looking for my favorite band (Skid Row). I saw a carrot on an album cover....WTF?"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"But We'll Try Best As We Can To Caaarrrrrry OOOnnn\\"","review":"No offense to any Styx fan out there this is a great CD. Lawrence Gowan is no Dennis DeYoung and that is a fact. But also to those styx fans who don't like the new Styx because Dennis isn't in it anymore let me explain to why. Dennis DeYpung has Chronic fatigue Syndrome and that is aggravated by bright lights. He bowed out of the Brave New World tour and was replaced with Lawrence Gowan. And it is my belief that if you aren't healthy enough to play concerts live than you shouldn't be aloud to make studio albums either.Anyway this is a great CD. Perfect to continue your Styx collection with some really good songs on here are \\"One With Everything\\", \\"Do Things My Way\\", and \\"These Are The Times\\" they make it worth buy it so give it a try sure its not the same without DDY but in the words of him \\"But Will Try Best As We Can To Carry On\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Styx's Album!","review":"Tommy, James and the gang have put together the best Styx's Album since the breakup.

Can not wait for the next new Album."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's With The Carrots?","review":"As with Journey's \\"Arrival\\", I wasn't sure if I would ever buy \\"Cyclorama\\". Honestly, I was afraid it would sound too different. Man, did it EVER sound different!The only songs I don't care much for are \\"More Love For The Money\\" and \\"Palm Of Your Hands\\". A vocals-only version of \\"Fooling Yourself\\" with Brian Wilson? Ech.I wish we could get more JY, now that Dennis is gone. But Glen's great too... 8-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"STYX IS BACK - STRONGER THAN EVER!!!","review":"This is a very creative project by the 5 members of Styx. All songs are a group collaboration. Yes -- they can go on without Dennis - quite well I might add. I liked Styx before, but now I am even a bigger fan.My favorite on the CD is \\"These Are the Times\\". JY rocks on this song. His deep, powerful vocals almost have me mesmerized. There is great diversity in the songs; awesome vocal harmonies throughout. Todd does an awesome job on drums and there are guest vocals on several songs by Brian Wilson, Billy Bob Thorton, John Waite, and Tenacious D. Even a visit on several songs by part-time member Chuck Panozzo.A fantastic job done by all of them. Great CD - IT ROCKS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome album","review":"Cyclorama is a super album. Considering all the controversy over the DeYoung firing, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was blown away. You can play this new one between \\"The Grand Illusion\\" and even \\"Man of Miricles\\" and not notice any difference. JY steals the show, as always, with \\"These Are the Times\\" and the awesome \\"Captain America\\". Nice to see him doing more than just one song. Lawrence Gowan is great, too - his songs echo the social consciousness of DeYoung's work. Bertnik is cool, \\"Killing The Thing That You Love\\" is a terrific song. And Tommy Shaw, as always, does a bang-up job (although I will admit there was a little too much of him on the record).A real Styx fan will enjoy Cyclorama. I can't wait for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most of the music is good","review":"Got the new album today. Most of the songs remind me of the Styx of old. Isn't that what we all are looking for. We like Styx music, we just want new songs. Some of the tracks are fillers I guess. Who wants to hear Billy Bob talk about who ever it is they are slamming. And the last track is a good song but its not long enough, then they fill it with a bunch of guys talking. Overall it is well worth the money. But they could have left out the comedy and gave the fans another song."},{"rating":"1","title":"plants were too small","review":"We ordered these plants in June.

Also, some of the information on the cards is not as clear and concise (Davis's Drug Guide for Nurses is soooo much better). The verbage \\"too scientific\\" and not in simple enough terms so that students can put into their own words the actions, contraindications, etc.Do yourself a favor and don't get these cards.

I've had to bug them for updates, and even with the updates, a few of the function buttons don't work. Also, the key action isn't for me ... the keys are spongy-feeling, and the travel is too long. I also find that the keys bind if you hit them even slightly off-center, which I find rather annoying. But it's a matter of taste ... clearly some people like the action/feel of this keyboard.

All the extra keys work, the programable keys work, it's pretty quiet as far as I am concerned (other reviews have complained about all of these things), but I find no problems. If it lasts half as long as my other Adesso I will be thrilled! The drivers installed with no problem. Identified the keyboard with no problem. I have no complaints, it's great."},{"rating":"1","title":"LIKED IT AT FIRST AND THEN---NO!","review":"I regret having written a rave review for this item a while back. Compared to the Gold Touch this is a real piece of junk. Flimsy and poorly made. After a few months the space keys and the shift keys all started to rebel (even though the keyboard was kept clean and dust-free) and I have a light touch. Trying to press the failing shift keys damaged my pinky fingers until I could no longer type on it at all. I would stay away from this model. It's cheap for a reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT QUIET","review":"I bought this keyboard to use w/my Mac b/c of the great reviews and because it was SUPPOSED to be quiet.

And the keys seem strangely sized, especially the space bar and bottom row of keys.Honestly I wish I hadn't gotten rid of the packingm because I went and picked up a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic 4000 and am much happier with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Driver for Mac OS X 10.3 does not work","review":"I installed software and downloaded the updated driver; the keyboard function keys won't work.

Should spend a little more and get a Shoenhut or for $10 you could get a toy piano that sounds better than this one. Very tinny sound, completely out of tune (why do they bother even assigning a note to the keys?), and lid is attached with screws AND glue so the only way to get to the metal rods to attempt to tune it, even after the screws are removed, will be to crack the wood casing getting past the glue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor build quality","review":"Bought a similar pink version of this grand piano for my daughter's 3rd birthday.

The piano arrived in fine shape. The piano and bench are sturdy and well made when you put them together properly. The sound is just like I remember a toy piano should sound. Notes are not perfectly in tune like a fine instrument, but tuned within reason to the notes of the scale, including sharps and flats. Most importantly, our little boy just loves playing this piano. Hopefully it will inspire him to continue and so it is as great an introdroduction to music as any other toy, including the electronic toys, we have purchased for him. I also liked that he wasn't able to pull off the keys try as he may. They just kind of become locked when he trys to do that and can be put back in place by minor adjstment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality & Sound","review":"I bought this piano for my 15 month old daughter for Christmas 2008.

After 45 min. the RF IN stopped working, so Magnavox needs me to MAIL in the TV for replacement. This is the worst attempt of HDTV I ever seen. It is like a no name brand that should be blank. I would not buy a Magnavox anything Digital Video display again. Everyday the set looks as if it ages 1 year and if it last longer, that would be the only good thing to say. The TV sounds as if lightning is going through the speakers and is as bad as the display which looks like lightning struck it.

And cheap to buy! For that application, a TV in the kitchen for background noise and occasional real watching (cable, not HDTV, though the TV is HD-ready), the TV is adequate. The picture and sound are fine, contrary to what other reviewers have said. Perhaps I got lucky. But I don't push this inexpensive, moderate quality set to do what it probably can't do. It does what I need and that's it. It turns on, stays on, has a decent picture and OK sound, turns off, and hasn't broken. And, it takes up a lot less room and looks good.UPDATE NOV. 2010Four years after purchasing this TV, I am here to say it continues to do its job - keeping me entertained and informed in the kitchen!

They would issue an RA for the television to go back. I had already disposed of the packaging and I expressed concern for shipping the item back as I did not have the original shipping container. I asked if they could just send me a new Television, charge my card and I could then send the old TV in the shipping container of the new TV. They would not do this. I am stuck with the old TV and the Pixel dot on the screen due to this fact.

For $300 or so, I didn't have high expectations, but this product came in lower than low on reliability, warranty and customer service. I'd advise steering clear of all Phillips Magnavox stuff.

Be realistic in your expectations. If you want a home theater with surround sound and big screen HD-quality, well then, go out and spend $5,000.

They sent it back saying nothing was wrong. THEY WERE WRONG! Now I was told to send it back again(we pay the $25.00 shipping again) and they will send me a new one! I agreed to pay the first $25.00 but didn't feel I should pay it again when they didn't fix it the first time! They refused to budge.

Dancers also could gain something by reading this book, as it will make them more aware of how exactly they should place their bodies to make movements in the pas da deux more effective.

Brief and therefore not as rigorously argued as his longer works, he makes his case for what studies of the humanities can be, in fact need to be in the 21st century. While making only cursory swipes at his usual opponents (Bernard Lewis, Harold Bloom)his book is more celebratory and admiring of the writers he has emulated and been influenced by: Eric Auerbach most prominently. An elegiac summa from a writer who will be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and nuanced","review":"Despite its size, this brief collection of lectures comprises a nuanced and compelling argument of how to rescue the humanities from their growing marginalization and irrelevance. Calling for a return to philology and criticizing the jargon-laden obscuratinism and relativism of much of contemporary humanistic practice, Said nevertheless maintains the benefit of close readings of texts and a multiculturalism that consists of expanding the canon rather than tossing it out all together -- in contrast to the willful ignorance of other cultures advocated by the likes of Harold Bloom and Bernard Lewis.Said also updates and expands on his views of the intellectual in public life which he touched upon in the series of lectures \\"Representations of the Intellectual.\\" I found these parts quite interesting. However, if you don't hold the same views as the Old Left, you will need to substitute your own discontents for some of his particulars."},{"rating":"2","title":"I lucked out!","review":"Certainly I have imagined winning the lottery, even though I have never purchased a ticket. Perhaps it is the voyeuristic aspect of learning about someone's amazing stroke of luck that appeals. For those who simply want to kick back and enjoy a good read this is the book. It's part reality and part fantasy and all fascinating. Each story, and the variety is good, takes a chapter making this an easy book to pick up and put down. The writing is lucid and incorporates some of the humorous observations that make the author's previous books so enjoyable. The stories of luck as a phenomenon without any deep psychological explanations other than occasional researched and credited observations is just about all that one wants from a book of this kind. An interesting and entertaining read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"With respect to Making Weapons, Talking Peace","review":"I'm not sure why the graphic juxtaposes Making Weapons, Talking Peace and Race To Oblivion: A Participant's View of the Arms Race, unless the latter is an earlier subset of the former.

Making Weapons, Talking Peace is an autobiographically oriented recollection of York's involvement in the nuclear arms race and in the related domestic and international negotiations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good/Produces bad toast","review":"This toaster looks good on your counter and is very sturdy. However, the toaster's raison d'etre is to produce toast, and at least mine produces very inconsistent toast. When I set the toaster on 3 (out of 8) and put a piece of wheat bread in, it is usually 'well done' on the side that faces the center, brown on the top part that faces the outside, and barely done on the bottom part that faces the outside.The bun toasting feature, which works pretty well, is its only saving grace.My Sunbeam toaster that I bought for 15 dollars was better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"partly good","review":"i really like the look of the toaster, and it does a nice job; on one side. the toasting elements on one side in each slot do not fully heat up so it toasts one side more than the other - will be trying to get it repaired, or likely, will have to get a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice, poor quality","review":"Bought one 3 years ago. Within a few weeks, the rubber foot \\"melted\\" and rubber kept getting on my counter top. Then the foot finally disintegrated.

Do not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Toaster in the History of Bread","review":"This a great looking toaster. Kudos to the designer. The engineer who designed the inside should be shot. The thermostat is set so high that at the lowest setting it almost burns a Pop Tart. Any setting above three and a half burns bread. The bagel setting doesn't work well because the outside heating element is always more powerful than the inside element. Hence bagels take forever (It turns off the outside element). Bread/waffles burn on one side and aren't crisp on the other. I look forward to posting pictures after using this toaster as target practice.One positive...the slots are a great size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for bagels","review":"I am delighted that this toaster can actually toast frozen bagels properly (brown on outside and hot in centre). The slots are actually wide enough to put half a bagel in without forcing. While it browns toast evenly on both sides, the bottom is slightly browner than the top, which drops it a star. But otherwise its great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book for leaders","review":"Some leaders are good at their field, however some lack of the Emotional Intelligence.

Serious scholars of intelligence (social, emotional, or practical) don't really take Goleman very seriously, and it is sad to see \\"hype\\" and attention Goleman gets.As regards Mr. Goleman's recent escapades into leadership all I can say is that what he has recently discovered has [already] been discussed previously by many scholars of charismatic leadership (and related theories of inspirational, and Pygmalion leadership)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed the Learning","review":"This audio book allow me the time to learn while running errands.

This is a simple book with a simple message behind all the rhetoric. Complicated no, higher level wording yes. Here is the real core of this book, \\"We know our workers have emotions, let's make them feel good emotionally and they will work their tails off for us\\". This book is a mass market item for the much less numbering persons in charge to be able to apply the principles. However the book is good for the current generation reader to help them be a part of it all. That's why I rate it super, an average person can benefit from this. Another book advertised and recommended here that I bought, which helped me much more, especially concerning moving ahead with emotional intelligence, SB 1 or God, Karl Mark Maddox, missing out on a great aid without this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No need for warm and fuzzies for needed leadership","review":"The premise of Primal Leadership, based on Goleman's popular \\"Emotional Intelligence\\", is that people need to be made to feel good to be lead. Actually, this is not true: often times leadership is getting what needs to be done when people feel awful. Those being lead need just to believe in their contribution to the endeavor, and they can act accordingly. For a superior, much briefer description of leadership, see the Harvard Business Review's recent article \\"The Work of Leadership\\", or the work of ISVORDilts.

I really liked Zigman's first book -and was hoping for the same with this one, but no such luck really. It started off funny - and at points I could relate all too well to the fears the can arise when an ex pops back into the picture for some reason. But then, it got a little bit too extreme. I almost could feel myself squirming in my seat, embarrased for Elise's character and what she was doing to prove Donald was cheating. I know girls that have taken things to this extreme, and it's exactly what I hope I NEVER am like. What started off innocently enough just took a really bad turn - if anything has told me how NOT to act in a relationship! Dont waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Downward Spiral Into Jealousy and Doubt","review":"They say there is an audience for almost every book, but you better check this one out carefully before you decide it's for you.

Life is too short -- move on, find something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick, Fun Read","review":"Anyone who has been insecure in a relationship will appreciate this book. Although I've never gone to the extremes of Elise (thank goodness!), I certainly could relate to her overactive imagination and the stress that goes along with having an ex show up mid-relationship. The horror that I would feel if my friends suddenly started to like the ex would absolutely mirror that of Elise!

However, when I cracked open the book, I discovered what others here warned me about. I did notice at the back of the book a note stating the type face in which she wrote the book, but different is not always good. It was horrible. Huge run on sentences with about 10 commas thrown in. Come on, what sentence needs 5-10 commas? Special type face or not, she should have stuck with what she knew and written this book in a way that would appeal to other chick lit readers.

With a main character, Elise, who isn't fleshed-out or sympathetic, and a story -- she obsessively spies on her fiancé, Donald, and his ex-fianceé, Adrienne -- that is one-dimensional, not to mention awkwardly constructed, the novel belly flops. Other than a detailed list of streets in northwest Washington, D.C. and occasional forays into the coffee shop of Politics and Prose, there is nothing to recommend this novel. Laura Zigman should atone for the trees that died to print this atrocious tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"Like other reviewers, I believe this effort does not measure up to the author's first two novels. What I loved about those two books is her ability to weave really astute and insightful observations about life and love into her stories. I kept waiting for that to happen with this book, but it didn't. This is meaningless fluff from an author who is capable of much better.This is slapstick comedy with annoying, one dimensional characters. There may be a small laugh or two along the way, but those don't make up for this completely unbelievable plot.Skip this one and read her first two novels. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Liked It","review":"Reading these other reviews and realizing they are a bit harsh, I feel the need to defend what I thought was a pretty good book.Yes, the storyline is a bit thin, however, the characters wonderfully three demensional and you can't help but like them. Is Elise neurotic and distrustful? Absolutely. But I think my fellow reviewers are focusing on the \\"feminism\\" aspect of the story instead of just taking it at face value. This is just a fun, quick read that basically takes one emotion we have all felt, jealousy, and turns it into a farce. My advice: Don't over analyze this book and take it as it is; a light, funny read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment, though at times quite funny","review":"I expected much more from this book. It sounded promising. While reading it, I came to feel as if the main character was actually psycho in her pursuit of the ex. Also, I kept waiting for something really BIG to happen and turn everything around. But the pages kept turning and turning with no such luck. The ending proved better than the rest, but not enough that I would recommend it to anyone. In closing: Not a complete waist of time, but I wish I'd read something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elise? Intelligent?","review":"She's a paranoid idiot, really, and her much-vaunted \\"intelligence\\" doesn't do anything to save her from her vicious -- and self-created, for the most part -- cycle of jealously and self-loathing. She's not Bridget, okay? Not even CLOSE. Bridget was crazy. Bridget was original. Bridget was laugh-out-loud funny. Elise is none of these things, and Zigman's writing makes it all too clear that she is trying to make Elise ALL of these things...It's almost complete [junk]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't do it for me","review":"I found this book to be kind of an annoying read. Probably because I wasn't a fan of the main character and didn't like how Zigman played out the story.

I am amazed how she continually creates fantastic characters who are so honest and likable, even if they do some hurtful things. Ms. Thacker acknowledges through her characters that everyone has a past, but that past can certainly be reckoned with. I find a great theme of forgiveness throughout the novel, one that by the end, I find myself feeling forgiven and refreshed along with the characters. I feel their pain and their trauma as they live through it - Ms. Thacker deserves all the credit for making these families live through some events that are very real, hitting very close to your heart.

Finally i have to say that the battery is great...i can use it for 4 days with regular use and continues working.CONS:The internal memory is poor.No USB cable included.Pictures with low resolution(but normal in cell phones of its kind)This phone is still BIG and heavy considering some other models.For the price, durability and apparel this one is a good choice.I've never made friends with nokia in the past, and i regret, beacuse this is a very good choice if you need a hard-everyday-use phone...simple and firm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Phone Ever!!","review":"I've had this phone now for two years and I love it still!! It does come with two different covers, and the stencil to put your own background picture. It also has given me great reception no matter where I have been. The battery has lasted the longest. I have even bought other phones and still have switched back to this one. It's durable and completely satisfies all my needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works as advertised, but bottle almost empty","review":"I bought this to clean up a huge mess I made in my kitchen.Yes, the product works as advertised. It definitely does de-bond superglue, albeit in very small increments. However, the bottle was almost empty when I got it, and the applicator brush was terrible. I ended up buying a different de-bonder, which acted in an identical manner, but offered more several times more product for a similar price.The most important thing, though: My kitchen table looks like new again."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOES NOT WORK","review":"DONT WASTE YOUR MONEYI tried on super glue , crazy glue , tried rubbing continuously , tried leaving on for days .It just doesnt work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of $$$$","review":"I bought this to remove a bit of superglue that my cat actually knocked over on my kitchen island..I followed directions and let it rest and scrubbed with a toothbrush etc....no results and not even an improvement...THUMBS DOWN!!

I love the storage on the bottom I keep all my sons blankets and sheets in there. It is just the right size and fits snuggly in the corner. I do however have the same problem as another mom. My son likes to scoot himself diagionally and ends up sleeping with his face against the wall. But his nose does not press against it and the walls are ventilated so I dont worry to much. I have cats and the canopy works perfect in keeping them out of the sleeper. The sheets are very pricey at about 15$ each one of my complaints. I like the fact that the matress has a wipeable surface. It is so much easier to clean. I would recommend this product to anyone; as well as grandparets who are looking for something when thier grandkids come to visit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great peace of mind","review":"Having lost a neice to SIDS, I was very nervous that my baby would stop breathing at night. This co-sleeper got me through the first 5 months because I could reach over and check her breathing any time during the night. I could sleep or nap right next to her without fear of rolling on her.She would not sleep in it until she was 3 weeks old, but after that, she was just fine. I would definitely use it again if I have more children."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice looking but smells","review":"the product smelled like chemicals when i took it out of the box.

I love that I can set the ipod on top and watch podcasts/videos while listening through the radio's speakers--and the ipod can be charged while docked. The radio comes with a few ipod cradles to fit different models. The clock display can be dimmed or turned off, which is a great feature.

Not too many out there that play & charge the Ipod, have a radio, alarm, and remote! Up until two weeks ago I would have given this item 7 stars! But suddenly no sound - for the radio or the Ipod. So now what? Still under warrantee (barely!) so I could ship it back to manufacturer but now I'm wondering if the Timex Ti700 is as great as we thought. Will probably do some research to see what else is out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great - IF YOU'VE GOT PERFECT VISION","review":"After reading the other good reviews of this product I ordered with high hopes. Unfortunately somehow no one has mentioned that the digital face on this is dark gray on light grey and impossible to read, no matter what light setting, if you have any vision problems. The contrast is far too low to be distinct enough once glasses are removed.There has also been no mention that I read that it does not work with 3G (third generations) Ipod devices, which is clearly stated on the cover of the instruction booklet.So, if you have perfect vision and a pre-third generation I-pod, then this might work for you. It didn't for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is garbage","review":"I have owned this clock for about 4 months, and the first 3 were just fine. After that, it stopped working properly with my ipod. Nothing I did fixed the fact that I could no longer wake to my ipod. To add to that, its buttons have recently changed operation (eg. the \\"set alarm\\" button now changes the display's brightness, the snooze button does not function). I would highly suggest purchasing a different product if you plan on using your ipod in this clock with frequency."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great baby wash","review":"This is the best product -- no stinky fragrance and seems to help ease cradle cap and baby acne.

It doesn't give you step by step lessons in learning the language. It's all over the place and outdated.I only bought this book, as it was required for my class. As it turned out the teacher wanted us to get a different book because she felt that this one wasn't very good. She was very right! Her reccomendation was for the greatest Spanish learning workbook I have ever come across...Get the book called 'Spanish Verb Tenses' by Dorothy Richmond.

With this price it is hard to beat. However, it constantly leaked in our tent. We wanted to believe it was condensation, but there was always ice and never water in the cooler and it was just too much water to come to any conclusion other than it was leaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coleman 70qrt Extreme Cooler","review":"I purchased this cooler specifically to take camping with us in Yosemite. I needed a cooler that would not only fit in the bear proof food lockers, but also a cooler that would keep ice for several days. This cooler worked out great. We used two 10lbs blocks of ice and froze about six of our 1-pint water bottles. We rotated water bottles throughout the 4-days we were there and on day-5, there was still a small piece of ice remaining in the cooler. The trick is to keep the cooler lid closed as much as possible and store the cooler in the shade and/or under a blanket of some sort.The Negative; Coleman needs to have available removable food trays to keep food out of the melted ice. Many years back, Coleman had food trays available for many of their coolers, they need to make them available once again. When camping, food needs to stay dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hinges broke after first use!","review":"This cooler served us well in terms of keeping food cold for a 3-night camping trip in 2010, but the hinges broke on the last day, making the lid something you have to remove every time the cooler is opened. We are very disappointed in the quality! Everyone using a cooler in the wilderness for days needs to get that lid back on the cooler ASAP. Working hinges are a necessity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, keeps ice for days,","review":"This thing is amazing, it kept my 2 liter bottles filled with water than frozen....well fully frozen for 3 days. I think it could'v'e gone 5 easily. Also kept crushed ice for 2 days, which is crazy to me. No more buying block ice. Just reuse old 2 liter bottles, milk jugs and juice containers with tap water. Put crushed ice in zip lock bags and have cold drinks 24/7. And I did use this in the summer, 100 weather."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delivers as promised- but needs better handles","review":"Got this to replace our leaky old Coleman from ages ago...Loaded up with frozen food and ice for one week of family camping...Still had ice after 4 days- amazing!But only 4/5 because the handles are pretty flimsy.They didn't break on this (first) trip, but I can see them breaking in the not-so-distant future with regular use (and then I will replace with cord/rope)Despite this, still excellent value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke on Second Use","review":"DO NOT BUY!

Worthless piece of junk IMO."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd look some where else.","review":"I bought 2 of these coolers and one came in with broken hinges. I never got a reply when I sent out the form to have it replaced. Several weeks after I purchased them, the same cooler was available at Wal Mart for $5.00 less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Performed as Expected","review":"I bought this cooler for tailgating at college football games. The cooler worked great and the cup holders are incredibly useful on top. The cooler can hold ice for days and is a little easier to clean with the spout. You can continue to spray water in and not worry as much about dumping it out, meaning you would have to be outside. This makes cleaning near a sink easier...not necessary a fun task though.The cooler is also rugged and I pretty much got my money back when I sold after I moved. For the money, not a bad cooler, these things tend to always be more than you would hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cold cooler. Needs better handles.","review":"I used this cooler only once before one of the handles broke off. I am going to replace it with rope and PVC and that should do it. Other than that nice cooler that keeps drinks cold and ice from melting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep foods cold in hot weather","review":"We're quite conservative when selecting, buying, using products -- which means when we needed to buy a cooler to last 4 days, we bought one that advertises five. We wouldn't buy a 5 day cooler to last 7. So, I can't tell you how much longer this cooler lasts past 5 days. It does remarkably well under five days, in 100 degree heat. By the end of the trip, the cooler was still cold as ever.The handle did break off after only a few uses. The plug that holds the handle in place popped off and my husband couldn't find it. Coleman sent replacement plugs immediately and now it works just fine.The cup holders on the lid came in handier than I expected. The only drawback to this cooler is the lack of wheels. Ice and drinks can make it quite heavy. Fortunately, my husband is willing to lift it.This is the only cooler we have that can keep food cold for a five day trip in hot weather. Great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and functional.","review":"Large, drains easily and keeps the ice frozen for a few days. I don't think it would last a week unless you use a ridiculous amount of ice, but overall a good large functional cooler. The handles seem plenty strong too, even though I read a review that said they weren't. I think it's a well made product. Not pretty, but it works. Price was fair and cheap shipping too. Thank you Amazon. This was a life saver when my fridge broke.

The artwork of the Indian is particularly insulting. The historical endnote about the ET&WNC railroad is interesting, but the author and editor used very poor judgement in presenting such negative images in a children's book.

The Odyssey set up was very accurate, it determines the distance of the speakers from a test sound. I measured the distances and compared it to what it said and it was right on. Even my old rear and subwoofer sound very good with this receiver. Stereo sound with just the two Beta 50s sounds incredible. HDMI switching is great.

I now own a Pioneer Elite, cost more but I am very happy with it and it has worked for 3 weeks now.Amazon's customer service during these problems was 5 stars except for the times I was obviously hooked up overseas and there was a definite language problem; but even so the people I spoke with could not have been nicer - just had to call back during the day to get my issue resolved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Receiver","review":"Onkyo TX-SR805 7.1 Channel Home Theater ReceiverJust got this receiver and I have got to say that it is probably the best value out there as far as A/V Receivers go.

My only caviat is that they should include at least an iPod cable (Pioneer Elite does) or offer the docking station at a discount.

The amps and the Audyssey setup is accurate and easy. So what is the hitch? The problem is with the DSPs onboard the 805. For Blu Ray and HD sources (Especially HDMI 1.3a) there is a pronounced and visible lip sink delay. Extremely annoying with HDMI based Blu Ray yet very hard to notice with standard DVDs. Amazon has been slow to refund as well. Looks like customer service has been offshored a bit too far...So keep this in mind, great price (Unbeatable price) yet headaches in your future unless somehow OnkyoCan fix this with a chip swap or drive to the service center.http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?p=11463542The Yamaha RX-V1800 and the Pioneer Elite X92 (wishing I chose this one first) do not exhibit the issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Support from Amazon, Onkyo after 30 days stinks!!!","review":"37 days after I hooked this receiver up guess what happened?

Only option is to have it repaired!!! So off to the repair center it goes, once I get it back it will be stored in its box where it cant do any damage to my family or me! Waste of $670 bucks!!!

I love the various listening modes and I am still playing with the Audessey feature and like what it does and how it brings out hidden and subtle passages. Yes, this unit gets hot, but so did my previous unit. This is a fantastic receiver for the money with high quality amps and features!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock solid Receiver and bang for your buck winner","review":"I have had this receiver for almost 6 months and Onkyo has again made me a solid reciever. I have had no issues at all and Amazon was first rate in the shipping of this to me.It's very heavy though and as sme have experienced, it can get very hot if not well ventilated. I solved this with an aftermarket AV Cooler which sits atop the receiver and exhausts air out the back of my enclosed cabinet. You won't go wrong with this unit and will have nothing but smiles on yours and your guests faces when you hit the power key.

I couldn't be more pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Onkyo TX-SR805 Rocks!","review":"My Onkyo 805 arrived yesterday evening and after making the required hookups the set up was easy. The Audyssey MultiEq made speaker calibration a snap. I watched Casino Royal last night in the glory of uncompressed audio through my Blu-ray player and wow there are so many crisp and smooth sounds that I was completely unaware of that exist on the BD. The sounds are lifelike and unaltered, the way the movie director had intended.I got up early this morning to try my ipod collection through the 805. I have a wide range of musical tastes. From Country, to Classic Rock, Modern Rock, Alternative, R&B;, Pop and Rap. Its been five hours straight now and I feel like I'm in heaven with the incredibly accurate sonic production obtained from this receiver.In the $1K price range I don't think there is a better receiver out on the consumer market. Onkyo has definately hit a home run on this unit. I've become an Onkyo fan for life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality and power","review":"This receiver has everything a great HD theater receiver needs. 3 HDMI inputs allow for 3 different high deffinition items to be run through the system. 7.1 Channel Surround Sound provides for great sound that is ahead of its time. Not alot of movies are in 7.1 sound yet, but it will come and when it does, this system will not be outdated. Setting it up was a breeze with the microphone. Just place the mic in the middle of your room and the system automatically configures itself for the best output. The remote can control everything including the Dish receiver and my xbox. My wife commented on how easy the remote was to use. I bought 16 gauge monster cable speaker wire and Cerwin Vega speakers with a JBL subwoofer. The system sounds great. I don't think I'll ever go to a movie theater again!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 in a row were defective","review":"Wow. I read up on this receiver and was impressed by the features in this price range. Boy, was I psyched to receive this baby in the mail. It arrived. I let it acclimate to room temperature for over 24 hours. I hooked it up. It died after 1 hour. Wouldn't even power on. I figured I must have gotten a bum receiver and opted to exchange. Amazon was very fast in getting the second unit to me. It arrived. I let it acclimate to room temperature for over 24 hours. I hooked it up. 2 of the 3 hdmi inputs were shorted out and this thing wouldn't even recognize that speakers had been hooked up to it. I sent it back. I will take my refund and remain sated with my aging, yet functioning, Pioneer receiver. Hooray for brick and mortar stores and in-store demo'ing. Boo for buying online."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure and Refined POWER!!!","review":"I just got this little gem delivered today and I can't be happier!! Wear your lifting belt when you pick it up though! Hookup is easy and surprisingly un-cluttered for the vast amount of connections in the back. Powered on and was blown away by how loud and clean this unit will drive my speakers. I have a pair of Polk tower speakers that can knock down walls now! Pure audio option is great for movies when my theater is dark and the THX sound options work well for gaming. The only drawback to the unit is the video upconversion. My tv is 1080p, but the unit only goes to 720p.... my tv has an upscaler anyways so I just let the tv do it! If you care anything about sound and do not need an incredible upscaler, then look no further than this reciever. Easily the best for under $1000."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I have never written a review before but after experiencing this inferior product, I had to. After waiting for a long time for this receiver to be released it was a big disappointment. I have received a total of 3 of these. 2 died and so far number 3 is still running but the front display doesn't work. The feature set is impressive but only if the receiver works. It runs extremely hot and the sound is not as impressive as it should be. I had a Harmon Kardon AVR230 that performed better. I purchased this receiver because of the HDMI switching Audyssey sound setup and THX certification. I can't believe that receiver originally retailed for over $1K. I guess that's why it's plummeted down to under $700. After this one dies I am getting a Marantz SR-8002. I will never buy Onkyo again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Waiting","review":"After about 1 week, it lit on fire and stopped working. I returned it with free return shipping (Thank You!!). I told the person at your Warehouse that I would prefer a new one and was told they were out of stock.

Still waiting on confirmation of my returned funds so I could purchase another from a different vendor. I would still prefer another unit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good action, but a week story line","review":"I have always liked the authors books, but since the end of the cold war it seems the plots have been getting more manufactured and lack believability. This novel is the worst example so far of this tendancy. The idea of the Idaho National Guard taking on the regular army is ludicrous. Dispite these issues there are a number of well written action scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the 10,000","review":"I'm 10 pages shy of finnishing this novel and it's been a struggle. I wanted to like this book as I have read all of the Scott Dixon novels right up to The Ten Thousand (haven't read Code of Honour and not sure if I will bother). The book started out great but went downhill fast. Aside from the thin plot and over abundance of underdeveloped characters the book is rife with editing errors. I'm not sure if the errors are due to the publisher or the author, regardless of fault they detract from the novel in a most annoying manner and destroy any flow to the novel. I really enjoyed Mr. Coyle's previous novels, both the Scott Dixon ones and his civil war series and I can't believe he could pen such a poor sequel in light of his previous great works. I feel cheated and wish I'd spent my christmas gift card on a different book. I will be very reluctant to pick up another novel in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A True Disappointment","review":"Harold Coyle was once a very good writer. However, if you're looking for another Team Yankee or The Ten Thousand, you're going to be greatly disappointed.

Mr Gandle, did you actually read the book? The militia didn't do or take credit for the bombing, and the army did not initially act against the militia.

Anyway, I'm having great fun reading it, especially since I can look out my office window and see the Gowan Field battleground. I'll be passing this on to some of the NG members who work here."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is borderline ok","review":"I just finished this book and I was glad I was finished. The editing was lacking as well as the plot. The author failed to develop the story fully, didn't provide sufficient background information, and used military terms specific to the Army he didn't define. The action parts were also limited."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened?","review":"The best military author I have ever read, now is recycling ideas promoted in other stories into this book. Original ideas are lacking throughout. His fear that the Civil War books would hurt him was proven unfounded. . It didn't-- the last two books have."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slow and laborious read","review":"I had never read a Coyle novel and seeing that he was a graduate of VMI I was intrigued enough to pick it up. What a mistake. The dialogue is tortuous to read. Additionally, for the author to get the story to where he wants to go the reader must accept many illogical assumptions put before her from beginning to end. One of the most annoying character developments is that of Jan Fields. Some how we're to believe this woman is the greatest mother, wife, reporter, and patriot the world has ever seen. I would like to have seen at least one character flaw or two in her, or in one of the other \\"good guys\\" in this drawn out scenario. Instead, they're all saints and the sinister governor and his conniving attorney general are all evil.My recomendation: Don't bother picking it up. Perhaps some of his other books are enjoyable and worth the time, but I won't be taking any chances any time soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Guide is good for its time","review":"The Essential Guide is a very good guide to the characters of the Star Wars universe. Unfortunately, this book was written before the release of the new Star Wars prequels, so you won't find any info on those movies in this book.

Good buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great resource","review":"The Essential Guide to Characters is a great guide of all the characters from the original trilogy and the expanded universe. It's a greate resource for anyone who wants to know about specific characters, and for fanfiction authors who are interested in getting to know the history of a character they want to include in their fanfiction. It's definately great, and would be a great addition to the collection of someone who considers themselves a know-it-all, or someone who enjoys writing in the Star Wars universe.

But the more I read the more I wanted to know, it's like they say on A&E's Biography, \\"Every lfe tells a story\\". It also gives you the fine details about major charaters,things like what Han Solo was doing between Star Wars and The Empire Stricks Back that prevented him from paying Jabba, to the lives of characters seen only for a moment in places like Jabba's palace and the canteena.

With the Star Wars Universe continually expanding, it is impossible to get all of the characters in, and there were a few that were missed. Also, for the biographies of the really important characters, such as Luke, Han, and Leia, the guide would go through the entire Trilogy to give information on their lives. I'm not sure how that could be avoided, however. For more characters, but in less detail, I'd check out the newly published (Summer '98) Star Wars Encyclopedia, which covers everything and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS BOOK IS GREAT!!!!!!!!!1","review":"For all of you who need to know more about the charachters, this is the book!!

Creepy, creepy children. Beau (a bit creepy) and his sisters (not so creepy) visit their grandmother (kind of creepy in her own right) on Gull Island every summer. Their cousin Sumter (way creepy) visits at the same time. Beau and Sumter form a friendship mostly based on their secret place, Neverland, where they perform rituals and play increasingly bizarre games, and where Sumter grows ... well ... creepier and creepier.This novel was chilling and very good. I'll admit, I'm a sucker for creepy-children-coming-of-age-stories, and this one does not disappoint. Sumter is an absolute little freak, so if you also like creepy children stories, then Sumter is your boy. A very worthy addition to the creepy, out-of-control children sub-genre of horror stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"'You got to feed god so's it won't eat you first'","review":"There's just something especially creepy about nasty little children.

If only these shallow-San-Fransiso-yuppy-women could understand their irritating mothers, maybe they could have a successful relationship with a man. Right? Fortunately, Tan takes us back to China for most of this novel and writes an epic of tragedy and beauty. Amy Tan has taught me a lot about Chinese culture and history. I love her characters (especially the mothers). I always feel as if I can actually hear their voices and accents. This book is well-worth reading. If you are an Amy Tan fan, this book is very similar to her others, so you won't be disappointed or surprised. (The Kitchen God's Wife is still my favorite.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"If you are at all familiar with Amy Tan then take my word for it she has done it again. If you arent familiar with this author, this book is a good one to start with. This book has a multigenerational dimension that is not only entertaining but touchs a need for connectedness in each of us. Amy Tan opens a window into a world that westerners have never known and helps us to see into the hearts and minds of others and to come away knowing that we are all the same, yet different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old same old","review":"Up to now all Amy Tan's novels have followed the same formula:(1) Mother fled to the US from China around 1949 when the communists took over.(2) Daughter raised in America hates Chinese culture and mom's superstitions.(3) Mother and daughter did not get along or understand one another.(4) Mother reveals all secrets left behind in China when nearing the end of her life.(5) Mother and daughter thus make up and daughter comes to appreciate her Chinese heritage.Reading one of those books is Okay, but two or more is just too much! Please! Show some fresh ideas here!Also for those of you who are fascinated but unfamiliar with China, do take it as a drama instead of could-be real life story. The book feels to me more like Chinese food in America - Americanized to be appealing to the general audience - If you want authentic taste, go read some original Chinese works and meet some real Chinese people!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bonesetter's Daughter","review":"This is my favorite Amy Tan novel... The story begins with Ruth, an American born Chinese, who has struggles with her aging mother Lu Ling. As Lu Ling's mind begins to fail, truthful memories from the past come out and begin to intrigue Ruth. At the same time, she hires someone to translate a packet of Chinese notes that reveal her mother's background. The story of Precious Auntie and the upbringing of Lu Ling in a poor town in China are simply fascinating. The reader will easily get drawn into the story. As Ruth discovers the true spirit of her mother, she is able to make peace with some of the quirks and and superstitions that caused pain during her childhood."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Picture Worth a Thousand Words.....","review":"If only photograph could speak - telling the story of a woman, a family, a culture, a history, a village, a country, a continent, a war, a life - then it would be a photograph worthy of a novel by Amy Tan.

I just couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid piece of work.","review":"The story stared off quite slow, but really pulled itself together by the middle, remaining strong to the end.

I listened to the unabridged audio version of this book and both readers were solid."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed","review":"I love Amy Tan's first 3 books. This book, however, was a major disappointment. I don't know why she chose to switch from her beautiful first - person style to third person? The book seemed to have lost a lot of the Amy Tan's special charm and was a lot less beautiful, interesting, and profound than the first 3 books. I think this may have something to do with her switching to a new editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible writing style, boring story","review":"The members of our bookclub recently read this book and unanimously agreed that it was a waste of time and money. Amy Tan's writing style is uninspiring; she writes very matter of factly, leaving no room for imagination to the readers. The story line, as many other reviewers here have commented, is poor. If you are looking for interesting and well written novels on China, try 'Wild Swans; Three daughters of China' by Jung Chang, or an older classic 'The good earth' by Pearl S.

But this book appears to be written by someone who's trying (poorly) to copy Amy's style.

When her mother is diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, Ruth realizes that it is time to put her life and family together.Ruth has the packet translated, and discovers her mother's history. These are things she never knew, but which help her understand her mother's feelings and emotions. Her mother's history is undeniably tragic, yet strangely provides hope for both mother and daughter.Tan has succeeded again with a compelling story of the bonds that tie mothers and daughters, especially those with cultural differences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed big time","review":"Having enjoyed Amy Tan's previous books I was looking forward to a rich, enjoyable read. However, I find myself struggling at the halfway point with this book. I simply find that I don't care much for any of the characters or their problems. I would have been better off re-reading \\"The Joy Luck Club\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginning good, middle ok, towards end bore me","review":"All of Amy Tan's book are the same: mother-daughter conflict and reminscing the past in China.I enjoyed the beginning to middle VERY MUCH, but when it got towards the middle-end to end, I wasn't too interested in it anymore. I wanted to stop reading it, but I had to find out what happened, so I skipped a few pages and went right to the end.I thought this book would focus a lot on her mother's illness, but it was more about her childhood. It remind me very much of Adeline Yen Mah's \\"Chinese Cinderella\\" or \\"Falling Leaves.\\" (\\"Chinese Cinderella\\" is a good book by the way.)I feel the flashbacks could've been cut short. I feel the ending could be better too. If you want to read a good novel with Alzheimer's in the story, read Nicholas Sparks' \\"The Notebook.\\" Beautiful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wordy Amy Tan","review":"Alright...I loved Joy Luck Club, I struggled through Kitchen God's Wife, but this was really really tough. I mean Ms. Tan is pretty wordy in this book. She goes on and on about Ruth, this disrespected self made victim. The psychology of this book in unreal. There is so much unexplained symbolism that your head is spinning trying to figure out where she is going with it. In my opion Ruth should not have been the focus of this story because frankly she is boring. I am reading this book as part of a a book club (my pick because I loved Joy Luck) but now the ladies in the club are sending me hate mail, because they can't get past the first few chapters (Some have described it as painful).No disrespect to the greats but this ain't no joy luck (Sorry Amy Tan)"},{"rating":"1","title":"How much for a Kindle edition????","review":"I like Amy Tan's books. But why would I pay so much for a Kindle addition when in truth, most of her books can now be found in remainders bins for $6.00 or less.

It was a little raunchy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging, yet not very convincing","review":"I was reading in a recent interview with the author, that Amy Tan's latest novel is based a lot on her own family's history. Maybe that is why the novel is so engrossing. Staged in San Francisco and in China during the first half of teh century, the book walks us through the life of three generations of women. As usual, Amy Tan is brilliant--a plot that has its twists and turns as well as a psychological perspective into what makes us what we are.My only disappointment is the kind of unexpected and seemigly quickly written happy ending. I have no problem with happy endings, but there needs to be a more thorough explanation on how it happened. On the otehr hand, in the interview I read with the author, she said that is how the actual real story ended..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameless rehashing","review":"Amy Tan could be such a delicious storyteller but she sticks to the same theme because it has so far proved to be a commercial goldmine for her. At least, that's my guess because there is no other explanation. Still, after her three similarly-themed books, I thought and hoped that she would write something new. Especially when for five or six years we didn't see any new offer from her. But was I disappointed!It's not even worth going into the book, because it's like rereading The Kitchen God's Wife. It's as if Amy Tan convinced herself that her readers want to be fed the same old stuff again and again. Her new book is nothing but a shameless rehasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"No disapointment from this Tan Fan","review":"Tan's ability to bring the reader in to the character portrayal of Mother Vs. Daughter is amazing. Surely this is a theme that she enjoys writing about and it's obviously a non-wasted talent for her to do so. By the end of the novel, I found myself caring deeply for Lu Ling and mourning her loss of memory through Alzheimer's, concerned for Ruth in her quest to find \\"Precious Auntie's\\" real name, as well as despair for Precious Auntie and her eventual tragic fate in the family history. This, my second Amy Tan novel, did not leave me disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!","review":"I loved this book.I loved how the present twisted into the past.Only once Ruth understands her familiespast does she start to understand herself & her mother.Over the book her relationships change with everyone.It is beautifully written & I love learningthe Chinese superstitions and how it changed the path of her family.This is for the good and the bad.I would highly recommend this book.I will be reading some more of this authors books!I give this book 5 out of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"Ruth Luyi (all that you wish) Young discovers that her mother is suffering from Alzheimer's. She moves in with her mother to ensure her safety.In the bottom of a drawer she finds the papers her mother had given her years ago - her mother's story of her past. It starts out, \\"These are things I know are true..\\"What a beautiful storyteller Tan is. Her strength is when she transports us back to China and we are there with Liu LuLing (remain true) and Precious Auntie making inksticks for the family business. We can see, feel, taste, smell all the surroundings.Ruth struggles to remember the name of her true grandmother, and it escapes her until the right set of circumstances stir the right memories to cough it up. I was disappointed by the wrap-it-all-up fast conclusion, I felt a little cheated. But overall a fantastic read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Read","review":"This is the first of Amy Tan's books that I have read, and I REALLY loved it. The book is a study of the relationships between a woman, her mother (a Chinese immigrant to America), and her grandmother. The Bonesetter's daughter is the Grandmother. The story is told from the Granddaughter's perspective, as she is dealing with her mother's impending Alzheimer's, and as she is going though some relationship problems with her long-term American partner. I really enjoyed the total immersion into Chinese culture that comes through the mother's and grandmother's stories. Amy Tan combines an intriguing story of Chinese and American-Chinese cultures with issues that many American women in their 30's and 40's are facing. An extraordinary book. I look forward to reading more of Amy Tan's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amy Tan shows her talent","review":"As usual, i loved this Amy Tan book. I love all of her books.

It was full of description of the setting and the time-period. I thought that this book was a great portrayal of a mother-daughter relationship. It shows how they can get through almost anything with the power of endless love and thoughtfulness. I felt the characters were easy to relate to. They were very realistic and thoughtful. Tan made their lives seem very real, with everyday problems and the thought of happiness. I loved how Tan weaves the characters thoughts and feelings into the story of their past. I think that everyone should read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Kind of Mystery!","review":"\\"The Bonesetters Daughter\\" by Amy Tan was definately my kind of mystery! Page after page of suspense and tension. But then again this is a story by a writer that I have been in love with for a long time (her writing anyway).The characters are very realistic, the dialogue right-on, and the plot a real page turner. Who could ask for anything more?\\"A 'High Five' on a job well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved The Bonesetter's daughter","review":"This is a wonderful new book by Amy Tan. I was intrigued just by the title. The bonesetter is a doctor who creates powders and potions using dragon bones to heal ailments. I love reading about Chinese women too. This is the reason I bought this book. Luling is a strong woman who raises her daughter Ruth by herself after outliving 2 husbands. Luling is the daughter of a mute nursemaid whose identity is unknown to Luling until after her death. I loved reading about how Luling grew up in an orphange. She finds love and a vocation in the orphange. This is probably the most touching part of the book. Ruth Young is a ghostwriter who takes on the responsibility for her mother's care after she develops Alzheimers disease while juggling her career and other demands. This is a very enjoyable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two stories","review":"Amy Tan did it again. She manages to give us living inside old China and at the same time, the difficult relationship with her mother in modern times. It's not a fast moving book, but if you're interested in relationships and how the past affects the present,and appreciate good writing, there is much insight in the book. Any daughter with an aging mother can relate. The mother's story is a fascinating glimpse into a girl growing up in the former China.From the author ofThe Winter Years of World War II"},{"rating":"1","title":"Here we go again","review":"It seems that when Amy Tan wants to write a book, she pulls out her previous manuscript and then just changes the names of the characters. I really like her writing and it's really a shame that she just can't get past her own life, or whose ever life she keeps repeating over and over again. There's lots of fresh ideas and material out there, but Tan just keeps plugging away at her old and really tiresome formula. This is the last Tan book I will read, unless she truly comes up with something new. Otherwise, why waste time and money rereading something you've already read--what is it, three times over now? I think she's written three other books besides this one, but it gets confusing because they're all nearly identical."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disappointed","review":"I am a fan of Amy's Tan's, but this book was a big disappointment. As other reviewers have said, it's just a rehash of the same old materials. And she doesn't write well in the third person. Her first person writing can be in a simple style, because it lends itself to the diary feeling of her books. But in third person, it lacks substance. I was curious as to the dedication at the beginning of the book. In it, she states that she gives credit to her grandmother and mother for anything good, but she will try harder next time. I wondered if she herself doubted the quality of this book. The middle (the mother's voice) is by far the best part--the ending is of a \\"slap you over the head with what you should have learned\\" variety, and the relationship between Ruth and Art just plain isn't interesting. I wonder if Tan has run out of things to say. Perhaps this will be her last book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"no exactly","review":"I'm sorry this is not a review about the book, it's about the purchase.The book is used by look good.However, the cover is not the same, I believe it's from an older publication, which was not mentioned in the sale description."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've had better......","review":"Definitely not one of Tan's best novel.

I started reading it last summer, and I finally gave it up 1 year later, leaving it half-done. The plot is very similar to her other books, the same ghost, spirit stuff. It always start with a mysterious relative who believes in the existence of ghost, and the main character used to have conflict with her.

Amy Tan never fails to amaze me with her masterfully written novels appropriate for the melting pot we live in, today. This book is detailed, poignent and emotional. It has body and a three-dimentionality found in very few contemporary writers, today. Through the pages of the book slept a story of a girl, her mother and her mother's mother. Turning the pages awoke the story and unfolded the tale long put to bed- wonderful! The characters are full of life and full of energy.

It is rather a spiritual approach to death that grew out of the author's relationship with a loved one who died prematurely. I found it a breath of fresh air because it turns upside down a lot of the traditional negative ways the Western world looks at death. The author says that if you are suffering too much, you probably have misconceptions about what death means. She came to new conclusions about death from personal experience and shares them in a very moving and generous way. Because of this, the book can perhaps help you cope in a much deeper and more satisfying way than the rest of the stuff you're likely to find out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear, concise","review":"This book addressed the concerns on death and dying.However, the only thing I disagree with the author on is that a grieving person can go to just \\"sadness\\" instead of \\"grief\\" by just reading her book and making a change just that quickly.In reality, I wanted to just be sad, but my body is still undergoing a lot of \\"grief\\" that my Dad died last year.The things she wants us to do are not easy at all to do.

She never explain how to reach and help a person that is in a terminal condition, or how to explain to him/her that death is unavoidable. In fact, I read the book in less than one day because I didn't want to return later to finish it.

We don't own a widescreen TV, so maybe it's unfair to evaluate. Nevertheless, we regard video and sound as poor and there were no subtitles, chapters, or special features.

Directed, as well, by the latter, the film also stars dancer/actor George Dr La Pena. Assisting the stars are young dancers of breathtaking ability. The entire company deserves high marks! The slight story of former lovers (Swayze and Nieme) brought back together for \\"one last dance\\" is merely a device to allow the cast to show their balletic ability. The most haunting image of the film is provided by the shots of a solo Swayze dancing in a darkened studio amid wnd-tossed gauzy curtains. The Swayzes had tried for years to interest Hollywood studios in the film, finally producing and releasing it on their own. An insightful audio \\"making of\\" track provides interesting details.

I may have enjoyed five possibly ten minutes of this movie. Those few minutes would have been when the dancing was good and the performers kept their mouths shut. The story line and the acting made me want to vomit. Sorry but I hated this movie and an it was not worth the rental fee I paid. There was very little excitement or proper romantic tension in this film and I really felt like shutting it off.That being said there are probably people that relate to these character's and their whiny dispositions but I did not. It was a story of lost love. The love of dance was lost and lovers were torn apart and brought back together but the people where just not likable in my opinion.

And I have always wanted to see Patrick and Lisa dance together. How could this movie be bad? Oh it was. The story left a lot to be desired, the acting by the two main characters was so stilted (yes I understand it was meant to be - but no hidden passion even came across), even the dancing between the two - there was no feeling there until the end and even then it was as tho they didn't like each other much. So I guess if the was the intention - it did come across. However all the other dancers were wonderful to watch! That part I loved. I was fasinated with how ill Patrick looks. Raspy voice, gaunt. And what's with the cover picture? Never once did I see her in that outfit!I think the best part of the of the movie was Patrick's song in the credits.

I can cook anything with these 3 pans.I have recently changed to Induction cooking. This pan works wonderfully and I had a lid that would fit it in my cabinet. This pan feels balanced. It's not thin, just a nice weighted feel without being too heavy. Clean up is a breeze. I was a little concerned about the roughness of the finish inside the pan. It's a little rough feeling for a reason, I'm sure.

Therefore we see an indepth look at the passengers responses and calls to lovedones. Imagine receiving a phone call from a loved one to say that their plane has been hijacked after seeing planesfly into the WTC on TV???Obviously being a movie made for TV, it gathered less publicity than United 93.

He also asked, \\" Don't you believe it's me?\\" Most telling smoking gun briefly glossed over in this film is the fact that the crash site was a crater about 30 ft. in diameter and 10 ft. deep with small pieces of light aluminum scattered around.No engines, tail section, wings, seats, bodies, luggage, nothing you would find at commercial airliner crash site no matter what the angle of impact. The first responders said, \\" There's no airplane here, let's look in the woods for it.\\" The plane was never found in the woods or anywhere else.

I agree that we must move on, but it saddens me that conspiracy videos about 9/11 have now been made and when I talk about 9/11 to my friends they act like it wasn't even a big deal.

True to the Gonzo hertitage, Hands of Time is a really enjoyable fusion of country, rock, R&B, folk and jazz with a couple of East indian sounding tunes that utilize sitar, tabla and other Indian instruments. The recording techniques are modern so the mix and fidelity is a lot better than their 1970s recordings but that magical style that the Gonzos created is still happening. Unfortunately missing from the mix is Gary P. Nunn who penned the group's signature song \\"London Homesick Blues\\" which became the theme song for the TV series Austin City Limits.

She now lives there with two other women, all rumored to be lesbians together. Did they murder him together? The chief of police puts one of his younger detectives on the case, although he handled it himself when the husband first disappeared. Then there's a whole younger generation of children from the big house, now all university age.

There are no cliches here, no walks through the charming hedgerows. This is gritty and modern, and it taps into some of the most uncomfortable issues of our day--namely, bigotry and the willful blindness it fosters. Eilis Leyne explores similar themes, with strong female protagonists in the new culture-war thrillerWicked Gods."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great find","review":"I've read more British mysteries than I can count and after awhile they all start to blur, but this book was a real stand-out! The plot moves along quickly and yet the writing has substance, and the mystery was so compelling that I finished it in a day. Also, the romantic tension between Anne and Andy was great and amazingly well written...usually romances in the middle of mystery books leave me with a sense of \\"Yeah, yeah, can we please get back to the actual story now\\" feeling, but this one was so intriguing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ice House","review":"It was an O.K. book, and I liked the characters. I think the author can be proud of this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"read this book!","review":"this is definitely worth reading. the only thing about the book that bothered me was the picture on the cover didn't match the image in my head of the mansion. besides that, this book was amazing! the characters are very well developed, walters constantly keeps changing the rules and keeps you guessing til the very end. having read some of her other books, i would have to say that this pattern is consistant thru all her books and makes her an author worthy of the awards she's won. just remember...nothing in this book is quite what it seems..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent suspense with strong female characters","review":"Walters has delivered an great suspense novel, with believable charactersand witty episodes. Three women share a house and are all under suspicion ofmurder. They differ from the small village in their wayof being / living their life, and this (among other things)rises suspicion. The murder detectives are displayed with humour and warmth,and several episodes concerning one of the detectives homophobia is especiallyfunny (and raises an afterthought). Very well written, witha plot and story that keeps you reading on a bit longer than intended..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Implausible and sketchy","review":"I picked this up on a whim and kept reading with with the hope that it would improve as it went along. No such luck. Walters creates sketchy characters that ring completely false and plops them down in an English village that's about as lifelike as a shopping-mall display. Nothing anyone does makes sense, least of all the \\"romance\\" at the center of the book. A few vicerally disgusting moments toward the beginning make for a throughly unappetizing stew of a book. Won't be reading anything else by this author any time soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A juicy mystery full of character and complexity.","review":"Poor McLoughlin's world was already turned upside down!Sergeant McLoughlin hates the world in general, and women in particular after his wife has run off with his best friend. Now he is assigned to investigate a woman characterized by the entire community, including his boss, as a husband-murdering lesbian, and her 2 female \\"friends\\". How can he be objective? Thrust nose-to-nose with 3 women that he figures for man-haters, it is painful and poignant to watch him, resisting all the way, fall in love with one of them, and in like with them all. And gradually, the truth emerges..."},{"rating":"1","title":"the Ice House","review":"If you like the english mystery genre you will love the Ice House. I read this book several years ago and wanted to get a hard back copy for my library. Re-reading the book again reminded me why I became a fan of Minette Walters. Ms Walters always has enough psychological twists and turns to keep you guessing until the end, and with a smiedgen of romance, great characters you can care about and enough tension to keep you turning the pages, it is a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gem of a murder mystery","review":"This is a gem of a novel, a well-crafted story of mystery filled with wonderful characters. Three women: Phoebe, Anne and Diane - a coven of lesbians, according to gossip- live in a manor house, secluded. Three murders: Phoebe's parents who died in a car crash many years ago; Phoebe's husband who disappeared 10 years ago, and whose body was never found; and a newly discovered body in the ice house on Phoebe's property. But were all of these, or any of these actually murders? And who is the man in the Ice House and how did he get there? This is a page-turner that has as much to do with discovering the complexities of the three women as who if anyone has been murdered and by whom. Add to that a couple of overzealous detectives - one chief inspector who is convinced of Phoebe's guilt and one detective sergeant who is driven by both the charms and the mysteries of the women, especially Anne. One of the best I've read this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it","review":"Well, it's undoubtedly one of Walter's best novels. The best, I think, is \\"The Dark Room.\\" The only drawback I find is that the main female character(s) is quite recognizable and keeps appearing on the pages of the author's every novel: a strong-willed woman maltreated by a wicked man and/or suffering from the unhealed wounds of the past. However, you have no time to think about it for the plot and Walter's brilliant language rapidly lead you through the cobweb woven of human sins and hidden poisonous desires. It'a a plasure to read, indeed. I've read all Walter's novels (published, of course) and can assure you that it is impossible to predict (based on the previous experience) who is the murderer."},{"rating":"1","title":"too basic","review":"This is a very thin book, and contains only the most basic beginner information regarding a few beginner stitches and such. Overpriced for what you get, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Great book for teaching kids. Projects are just right for a beginner and are interesting to children. Book in great condition and was received quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much marching","review":"There was too much marching and clapping here. It seemed like that was all we were doing for half the time. She would teach a step, we would do it a few times and then march some more. It would have been more enjoyable, interesting and more of a workout to just do the actual steps more. Some of the steps were difficult or confusing to learn, mostly because the camera would focus on the upper body of Suzanne so we couldn't see the whole step being done. Also, I just don't think this is a hard enough workout. If I'm going to take the time to exercise, I want it to be worth my while. This doesn't do it for me. I do like Suzanne's on screen personality and the music is good. I've used Suzanne's The Fix and like it much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"The instructor is really spastic, and the camera focuses on her upper body so much that you can't hardly tell what she's doing that you can follow along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful!","review":"I just love to read it on the back porch in the summer. It creates wonderful images in my mind!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved the book and buy it for all my friends","review":"I received the book for my late summer birthday and can't wait to use the \\"lanterns\\" on our patio next summer. I think the font she created is beautiful and recipes delightful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty as long as you don't eat it","review":"A friend recommended this to me and I fell in love with the quaint artwork. But when I buy a cookbook, I do so with the intent to cook, not to gift it to someone else. So I've been disappointed with the lukewarm results from a dozen of the recipes. Just this week I prepared the New Lane Peas and the Clam Fritters and was completely underwhelmed. Peas were a watery bland mess and the clam fritters were completely tasteless until I added additional seasonings. So if you want to give this book as a gift as other reviewers have done, go for it but please don't give it to someone who actually knows something about food. Susan's a much better artist than she is a chef."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool as last night's dishwater","review":"If this were a drink, that's what it would be. With a sprig of iceberg lettuce, and a film of palm oil. This is another of those books that makes you wonder whether the reviewers quoted on the book jacket could possibly be talking about the same material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Few Gems, Mostly Paste","review":"With all the hype that \\"Invisible Circus\\" and \\"The Keep\\" have gotten, I thought that beginning with some of her short stories, would give me a better insight into the type of writer Egan is. But, I found myself very disappointed to the point where I don't think I'll read anymore of her stuff. Her stories are all written under the same style and except for the names of the characters and the places they are in, they seem to all follow the same pattern.Her stories are always about boredom, the paean of the rich, and contain enough ennui to fill a Paris Cafe. The stories about woman who have married for money are almost funny. The \\"what have I done with my life\\" and \\"what is my true identity\\" can give you a terminal case of melancholy.Because they all have the same basis bottom line, with a loud sigh, after a while they all blend into each other. They're probably a lot better if you read them one at a time as part of a magazine. But for me, blah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool as a cucumber","review":"I felt like I should like these stories, but the writer never engaged, nor involved me enough. The writing was \\"correct\\" but lacked heart and any real artistic vision. I picked up the book in great anticipation, and sorry to say, I felt duped. Conclusion: a perfect thesis, but hardly a work of art."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment.","review":"Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I found these stories irritatingly tedious and trite. The author never quite manages to find a pulse in any of her subjects."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only dating book that really works!","review":"Right away, after following just a few of the tips from Romy Miller I was getting men stuffing phone numbers in my hand, men turning to look at me and asking me out...and I didn't even need to say a word. She basically puts very simple and powerful information in your hands to have men chasing after you. I can't imagine ever needing to read another book on dating again. Within 48 hours of finishing the book a man I knew and was crazy about from a year ago showed up, approached me and asked me out. Crazy coincidence maybe, but I can't recommend the book highly enough. It worked for me and I just know now it is the women who have all the power and men should be chasing us! Good luck to y'all. This book is the bible on attracting men's attention and having them want you. Thank you, Romy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Good read. Author talks about some good points that you can immediately implement. I'd recommend it for any woman who wants to get more dates and attention for men."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reading","review":"As with all these types of books you take what you want and leave the rest. I thought this gave some excellent validation to some of those \\"best woman\\" ideas that sometimes get lost when we get tangled in an emotional web. I don't know about it being the criteria for getting the best man but it sure reinforced the best woman that I had somewhat forgotten about"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 1/2* Very Disappointed","review":"The elements of a great mystery are here. A book that interweaves the issue of slavery, the questions around Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings, and the imperatives of the Lewis and Clark expedition with a story about a serial killer sounds promising, but the book does not deliver...There's simply not enough suspense or mystery here, the writing is often annoying, and the characters aren't very interesting. Perhaps some will enjoy this as a light read. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"I was expecting a regular Scarlet Pimpernel novel, rather than a collection of Scarlet Pimpernel stories. I was disappointed with my selection. I had hoped to get more insight into the actual League, but the stories did not reveal any new information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent short stories","review":"Collection of short stories about Sir Percy Blakeney's adventures outwitting the French Revolutionary Government. And, among the stories: \\"The Traitor\\"--- What would happen if the Scarlet Pimpernel had a traitor among his league? Would he escape with his life? Also includes: \\"Sir Percy Explains\\" after all if you had been tricked again wouldn't you like to know how?, \\"Needs Must\\"--,and \\"A Battle of Wits\\" where Percy goes to retrieve some diamonds before the Revolutionary Government gets them, and others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Reader","review":"Chauvelin seeks him here, he seeks him there, many, many times. The League of the Scarlet Pimpernel has a different structure as the book is a collection of short stories or escapades about people that the elusive Pimpernel himself has helped to rescue, along with his intrepid band of adventurers.So, if you want a small dose of Pimpernel action now and again, this one is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely excellent!","review":"This is a wonderful, effective meditation CD. The tracks are short, clear, and easy to follow. The music in the background is incredibly beautiful. The topics are deeply meaningful, without using language that is overly spiritual or complicated -- this is a good CD for anyone! It is calming and whole-health-inspring.

I'm wondering if I can return it. For the most part I like it but he has you visualize cutting you finger. What was he thinking. It's like some guy in the mail room wrote it. I can't believe he created such and unconscious visualization. Do not buy this product unless your willing to move around this section. I'm very uncomfortable with the creation in my visualization of cutting my self and to recreate cutting my self over and over??? not me.

I still have the vinyl, it's still in awfully good condition. I was 17 going on 18 when it came out -- and I was psyched. A NEW Neil album! I'd seen him in October, 1978, the Comes A Time/Rust Never Sleeps Tour, I'd devoured Zuma, Tonight's The Night, Decade, Rust, Stars & Bars. And ... God, was this a let-down! Listening to it, now, 25 years later -- it has no freakin redeeming value. The songs from 74, 75 (and what are they doing here, anyway?) are the only ones worth salvaging (Little Wing, Old Homestead). Save your money -- buy some Neil CDs that matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"His First Worst Album","review":"Let's face it Ol' Neil is somewhat of a split personality. In the case of this album he must have smoked way to much bad pot and mellowed to the point of rotting. If you like this album you will love Silver and Gold, another burned out country western collection. Face it folks, we have Neil the rocker who is by far one of my favorites, then we have Neil the burnout cowboy. If you like Zuma, Freedom, Rust Never Sleeps, and the jammin' stuff stay clear of this collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad to have this one again","review":"Back then, a lot of us were left scratching our heads over the oddly Reaganite-sounding title track on this one. (Not that I object to Reaganites; what was odd was to hear Neil sounding like one.) But I'm glad to have the album on CD; it's far from Neil's strongest, but most of it is good.Like other listeners, I prefer the acoustic \\"side\\", which includes the last few cuts from _Homegrown_ that hadn't yet been released (that's why the copyright dates are all over the map). \\"The Old Homestead\\" is marvelously surreal, of course, and it's still one of my favorites from this release. \\"Captain Kennedy\\" (based on a variant of the same traditional melody Stephen Stills used in \\"Know You Got to Run\\") is another good 'un.And I still like \\"Union Man\\". Take _that_, AF of M.It's not my favorite Neil album by a longshot. But it's not just for completists; there's good stuff here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under-rated release","review":"I think \\"Hawks & Doves\\" has been one of Neil's most under-rated releases. He does a lot of great story telling in this bunch of tunes like on Captain Kennedy, The Old Homestead and the funny Lost In Space. It also pays hommage to the hard working American Laborer with Union Man,Comin'apart At Every Nail and Hawks & Doves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid album","review":"Thin, weak, and boring.

Since the cd is only 35 cents, if you;re really curious, go ahead and buy it, but within 3 days you'll place it back on the sales block for less, maybe a quarter. I am writing this review in 2007. She's been singing in 3rd rate dives for over 18 years now. She's poor, she's white, she's talented, and she can sing. So what's wrong? Her material sucks! She may be famous in the NYC underground, but it's hard to pay the bills on fame and crumbs. Still, I rank her higher than Yoko, Putanna Madonna, Xtina and britney.

Then the bubbles in the non-stick coating disintegrated, and the bottom of the pan became pitted where it is in direct contact with the heating element on the stove.

I liked this CD better than I did their first title 'Tangerine Dream' (see my review). Here, you get the lp's initial eleven tracks + an added six bonus cuts. Very nicely done on the CD reissue. Tunes I simply could not get enough of were the tripping title track \\"Faintly Blowing\\" (honestly, it's out-of-sight), the should-have-been a hit \\"Snapdragon\\", the wonderfully penned \\"A Story From Tom Blitz\\", \\"Black Fjord\\" and \\"I'll Kiss You Once\\".

My daughter was also disappointed that the dolls hand she holds the leash in you can only remove the wire not the handle to rhe leash.

For some reason, there are 2-1/2 renditions of \\"Four Holes in the Ground.\\" The most interesting material is the earliest (which, oddly, also has the best sonic quality), with covers of King Crimson's \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\" and Jethro Tull's \\"My God.\\" Fans of PFM's live improvs will find several long jams here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just an Index","review":"I bought this because it said complete in the title.

This quickly turns into a media scandal as dating a known mutant is a controversial career move for the Britney-copy. Ian Churchills colerful and playful art fit the story very well. On of the issues is drawn by a different artist in a much more moody but effectful style.

I can see it would be difficult if you were trying to move from another library. The only problem is the battery keeps running down all the time even when he's not using it.

I run 15-25 miles a week so this is a problem for me. Fortunately, I already had the ear buds from the Rio I just tossed.2) The battery is not replaceable. If it dies, you toss the unit.3) You have to use their software to load music on the player. No coping mp3 files right to the player.

This is not included and runs around $25.From the product specs, I misunderstood that a Mac with USB 2.0 would work with the supplied USB cable. USB will ONLY transfer Memory Stick data - not MiniDV data, which is where you'll record most of your video. The only place I found this documented was in the \\"Troubleshooting\\" section of the manual. In other words, Sony considers their poor OS support to be a user problem....

She's more comfortable in her car seat! It's also very difficult to get the side rail down.

I have just been pulling the bassinet up next to my bed; it is way less work. 3. I am apprehensive to purchase the leg extenders, which we need to make the co-sleeper work like it is intended to, because another reviewer stated they made the product wobbly.

I tried to put extra padding which worked ok, but still not great. 3)Once she was bigger it would have been nice if this converted to a deeper thing like a pack and play to use in the living room, but the bassinet part is fixed.

I complained that it was the wrong color, and they sent me the wrong color again. The baskets are for code 92211 are \\"Antique Walnut\\", and apparently the only color the Winsome company has. Look at the company website, and you can see how bad the baskets look with the espresso frame. We looked hard to find a storage unit with baskets we liked in espresso to match other items in the room, and this is was a huge failure. Now we have to see if we can send back the frame we put together, since it came before the basket. Look elsewhere if you want espresso."},{"rating":"1","title":"these are junk","review":"The picture and description make them seem like they are something they are not: strong heavy duty and attractive.

I later found out that it was a gift from a dear friend, I heard how upset that she was in losing the basket that I took it upon myself to try to find another one th fill in the hole that was the gift basket on it's way to the land fill. Your product fit the bill, she said that it is a good product, a little darker than the other but a good product. She was trying to find a replacement basket too, never dreaming that it could be found at Anazon.com.Sincerely,JR from Jersey City, NJ"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality & color are OK but not great.","review":"Bought these baskets about 2 years ago. The quality and color were nice then! But I have recently order 2 more and unfortunately the quality and color has diminished. The 2 recently purchased baskets did not match each other in color. One looked stained and the other looked painted. The quality of them didn't match either. One had loose and sloppy weaving around the top. What happened to there quality control? Sorry I don't recommend these baskets. And for the diminished quality, I have to say they are overpriced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wished I'd listened to a previous reviewer","review":"As a previous reviewer had noted, these baskets have a funny, musty odor. I am using them in a closet, and the closeness of the area makes the smell worse. I have sprayed with Lysol spray several times with no luck. I have had them for a month now, hoping the odor would dissipate, but it hasn't. For the money, I am disappointed in the quality of the baskets...the construction is just okay and there are some rough edges (they don't look like the picture). I could have done better at WalMart. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the Heart","review":"I have worked in the medical field for many years and the knowledge that this author presents about living with this disease is very heart warming. Even for the person with no knowledge of medicine the author puts it all in lay mans terms and does it in a very open and feeling way.

The better songs on the cd are Tommorow's gonna hurt, My own few words, robots (ok),Greyman (thats because I like cats and this song actually isn't that bad) and Noggintoboggan3, (ok). I wouldn't recomend buying this CD at all, unless, of course, you really want too..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk!","review":"Same thing as others experienced. Handle falls down. I own 3 Parisa faucets, purchased in 2005. Had to replace all 3 cartridges. Now kitchen one is doing the same again. What good is a lifetime warranty if they won't answer the phone. They say they are having a high call volume every time I call. Either lots of people need warranty service, or they have 1 employee. I think they are hoping we will just go away. This company is owned by Black and Decker, another cheap product company. I am considering buying a new faucet at the store, then removing the cartridge and replace it with my bad one. Then return it to the store as defective, the store returns it to PP for credit, and PP is stuck with it. That is what they deserve, and maybe if they get hundreds that way, they might fix it, but probably not. No telling why they cannot ask their Chinese suppliers to make a better product. Bottom line, don't buy from PP."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give it 0 stars if that was an option!","review":"If I wanted a cheap kitchen facett I would have bought one!Not even two years with this facett and I've had it. Who cares about good customer service. I would rather have good quality to begin with. I have no water pressure with this facett, but great pressure when the spray head is removed. Price Pfister has sent replacements twice. So what! it still doesn't work now it's leaking from below the sink. Replace cartridge? Why??? it's not even two years old and it's been replaced twice before. I received a survey email from Price Pfister about three months ago wanting to know what I thought about this product. I let them know! There was a place where they ask if I would like to be personally contacted, I said yes, gave them 3 ways to reach me and have never heard a thing back. This is cheap crap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem with cartridge assembly","review":"I purchased this unit (534-70SS) 15 months ago, and the first problem occured about 10 months after I purchased it. The water would be constantly dripping slowly when the faucet was turned off, and as days went by the water dripped more and more. I called them, and they sent me the cartridge assembly, but after replacing it, the handle wouldn't stay up when I turned the water on at slow flow setting. I called again, and they were nice enough to send me a brand new retail packaged unit without shipping cost to me. I replaced it, and it worked for the past 5 months, and now the handle again wouldn't stay up at low flow setting. I guess I have to live with it until another problem surfaced. It came with life time warranty, but what good is it if I have to replce the cartridge assembly (or the whole thing) every few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well made","review":"I purchased this faucet years ago. The really liked the look of it and thought it should be nice for the price. (Back then it was $249.00) When I took it out of the package I was surprised by how cheap the materials were. After it was installed, we noticed right away that the water slowly turns off if you have the pressure set less than full blast. It is real frustrating to try to wash small items. Apparently I am not the only one who's had this problem, so I would never recommend this faucet to anyone. I really wish it worked better, I do think it's a real attractive faucet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice styling","review":"This is basically a very nice product. It looks good and is easy to use. It is lighter than I expected, which makes it feel somewhat cheap in the hand. Faucet broke within the first week. It took me awhile to figure out how to contact the manufacturer. Then I was on hold for over a half hour. However, once I got through it was effortless. They sent me a replacement part no questions asked...and I got that very quickly. Overall I am satisfied with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Price Pfister Poor Quality, Poor Customer Service","review":"I bought this faucet in 2005 thinking Price Pfister was a better quality brand. The mechanism never worked as smoothly as I thought it should have, but recently began really being hard to work. In a matter of days, it basically quit completely. The major home do-it-yourself center I bought it at did not have the replacement cartridge. I called Price Pfister and they will send a replacement, but I have to pay shipping and handling and it will take 7-10 days. So I am without a kitchen sink for that time! Or I could pay extra for expedited shipping. So for the price of shipping they have lost a customer. I wouldn't recommend buying anything Price Pfister."},{"rating":"1","title":"4th Faucet in 51 months","review":"We purchased this faucet in May 2006. It leaked by March 2007, when I called to complain, I was told that was a common problem. Price Pfister sent a replacement faucet. The Ceramic Disc Cartridge failed in August 2010. The replacement part Price Pfister sent was defective. I am now requesting another replacement part. That makes the 3rd problem with this faucet in 51 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Too Good","review":"I bought this faucet 4 years ago and I'm considering replacing it soon. I am going on my 3rd cartridge - which they send for free. Aside from replacing the cartridge frequently - which is a headache to deal with - I do not like the design.I like the concept of a pullout with a one-handle design. My main complaint is the design of the spray-head and tubing that runs to the water lines. If any watet is present (from hand transfer)on the spray-head, it tends to run down the tubing and onto the cabinet floor below the sink. I place a small bowl under the sink to catch these drips, which helps, but I don't feel like I should have to do this for a nice faucet.I am now more informed about design and know what to look for next time in a faucet."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"I purchased this faucet at a local home center about 14 months ago. After about 5 months the head began to drip down the tube and then down the flexible snake into the cabinet. The company honored the warranty and sent me a new one right away. This one began to do the same thing after about 3 months. I am now on my 4th faucet head and it is even worse. The water squirts out the front as well. This is a piece of garbage. Instead of fixing the poor quality of design or workmanship, they probably figure it is cheaper to just keep replacing it. Sooner or later I will have to replace this with a quality product, another manufacturer of course."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Flow, Won't Stay On","review":"I too am disappointed in this faucet. We remodeled the kitchen and bought this faucet which matches nicely with our other stainless steel items. But the flow is very low (yes we have plenty of pressure coming in), and as noted by others, the faucet shuts itself off if you try to have it on any less then full. We're shopping for a replacement now."},{"rating":"1","title":"falling faucet handle","review":"I want to complain about the handle which falls down and inadvertently turns the water off. You have to turn on the water at a high flow rate so that the handle will not fall. I also understand that other people have had this problem, It's quite annoying. I am now contacting the manufacturer to either send me a new faucet that has this defect eliminated, or send me a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken & Without a Kitchen Sink","review":"We bought this product about 15 months ago. Worked great for about 14 months, then the spay adjuster/selector on the bottom started to leak. Being the procrastinator I am I didn't look into getting it fixed because the holidays were coming up, and figured it could wait a little while. Now the whole selector piece has come out & as a result the sink is no longer able to be used!!! We'll see what customer service at the local store says, this unit is no longer available locally, so I'm hoping for a credit tward a new brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but advanced","review":"Ordered this book because it was on the reading list for our homeschool co op. my son was in third grade and It was over his head.

In fact, you should know a fair amount about Italian cooking before you try any of the recipes, because otherwise who knows what you'll end up with.

This book may be too much for a beginner. However, for the serious graphics developer, this is a must-have reference and handbook all-in-one. Before seeing this book, my favourite hard-core computer graphics book was \\"Computer Graphics\\" by James D. Foley and Andries van Dam. This \\"black book\\" does an better job when it comes to the Microsoft Windows-specific approach of doing things. From page one it jumps into a direct explanation of topics. It cuts through the chase when it comes to developing high-performance applications. The examples are in C++ however as a Delphi developer, I used it effectively in a major project that involved both video capturing and image processing in the medical software industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good background","review":"This book, though it contains an occasional typo, seems to be reasonably complete for an introductory class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Author's explanation","review":"Naturally, being the author of the text of this book, and a fan of Graham's photography, I give it five stars--but also because the review format insists that I rate it.(Another example of the domination of the machine. Otherwise, I would have left the rating blank.)To avoid any confusion, it should be noted that the photographs by David Graham were taken before the contents of the house were removed and that the book is, in fact, a catalogue for his current exhibition in Philadelphia.Graham used my essay on the Kellams, which also appears in my book Against the Machine, as text, arranging his photographs in the sequence I speak of in the essay.There are only a few copies left."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alone Together","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this book. I read a review for it in my local paper and was so intrigued I pre-ordered it at least a month before it became available. I checked my mailbox each day and when it finally arrived I read it and looked at the pictures for maybe 30 minutes. I'm not sure how I missed this, but I was expecting a life story, not a breif narrative with photos. The photos were lovely, but as the narrative, simply left more questions than were answered.

The first half-- following its hapless anti-hero through a series of escalating mortifications--is a great, funny read--Chalmers possesses a real mordant wit. However, the minute our hero steps foot onto the super-heated tarmac of deepest, darkest Central Florida, the book spirals into a surreal gumbo of tooth-breaking violence, tin-eared dialogue, and every \\"Suhthun\\" stereotype known to man. Being a Floridian myself, the factual discrepancies rife in this book were jarring and distracting.

Real time data and enhanced code reading is also a benefit of the manufacturer specific feature.The use of the buttons/navigation with the scanner isn't the most intuitive, so you must read the manual to ensure you take advantage of the scanner's abilities.I would buy it again, but I will admit i'm disappointed that the product information from Equus/Innova doesn't specifically tell you that GM, Ford/Mazda and Chrysler reap the most benefits from the tool. I also own a BMW, so i'm disappointed I can't use the tool for all codes/diagnostics associated with the BMW."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool","review":"This is a very nice tool. I find that I can use it easiy for the most common tasks and that's the main thing I care about.Some of the more advanced features are not so intuitive and I'm one of those dumb customers who thinks it should be. I think the best-designed tools include an owner's manual for reference sake, but the tool should have an easy enough interface that I don't need to pull out a book with my dirty hands.I think they tried to save the cost of a couple of buttons by giving some of them double or tripple duty and thus making it so you need a manual to know how to get where. I still like my new tool a lot, though. It does everything it says it'll do, but don't lose the manual!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great code reader","review":"Tool works great. Going online and finding answers is great. One problem with the code reader is that the pc link cable that comes with it doesn't fit today's computers. You have to buy a 9 pin to USB cable. They are easy to find but it is just that you can't hook up to the pc until you have this. Other than that, this thing is awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, great data","review":"This scanner gives you everything you need to help diagnose problems with your car. Unlike the cheaper scanners that only give you a code, you can view real time data and see the effects of changes you make to confirm the operation of sensors and computer controls. The only reason I give it a 4 insead of 5 is that a couple of times, I plugged it in and the screen just went white. I couldn't reset it for about 10 minutes but it seems ok now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product and great value","review":"Don't settle for just a simple code reader. The Live Data portion of this is what saved me bringing my vehicle into a professional shop. By looking at the Live Data at idle and again at cruising speed, I was able to determine two O2 sensors were not functioning properly. The DTC was not tripped but the voltage was causing the system to run lean. The 3130 is worth every penny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced, way overpriced ABS upgrade, old technology, You can buy cheap software for your droid that works better","review":"Do not waste your money. These do not even have a USB port. They have an archaic serial port and you must buy an expensive serial adapter for your laptop. The ABS upgrade is priced ridiculously at $100 and you cannot even install it without buying a special adapter. You can buy an actron scanner that does ABS for less. Or literally for $4.99 software and $13.99 for the bluetooth adapter, you could use your droid to scan everything but ABS. The droid software is more straight forward, easier to use and does real time date which you can CUSTOMIZE. I am sorry I wasted my money on this relic. Look up Torque Pro on Android and you will see what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Equus 3130 is TOPS!","review":"The Equus 3130 is a fantastic product!

However, the Equus 3130 has a serial PC cable on it. The last year I saw any new laptop computer that had a serial data port was 2000. Everything these days has USB. Secondly, if Innova allowed its products to be updated by use of a web browser, then buyers would not be forced to use Microsoft Windows. Wow, being able to use a Macintosh or a PC! What a forward thinking concept, only in existence since last century. Clearing (that is, resetting) codes should be a one-button operation but sadly is not. Is there any technical or engineering employee in this company under the age of 30? I'll bet Innova management has a cracker barrel in the board room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful what you buy","review":"It is being advertised that this product works on all cars 1996 and up, but that is a complete lie! I have a 1997 Toyota Corolla and it does not work on my car. The reason is a little thing that they do not advertise on this website and on the box of this product and it is that IT ONLY WORKS ON CARS THAT ARE MADE IN THE US AND CANADA ONLY. My Toyota Corolla was made in Japan and I cannot use it because the connector does not fit on my car's connector. Hopefully, they do change their ads so that they will not disappoint any more customers. Also, if you do buy this product, it may be best to buy the adapter cable because the cable that comes with this product does not fit on all laptops and some computers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work with a Mac","review":"I have a Mac, not a PC.

Waited for two weeks for the scanner to be delivered. Five days after the scheduled delivery date I verified tracking number with USPS they said they had been notified item would be shipped but item had not been shipped.

I had to purchase a separate usb-serial adapter, which is an extra needless step..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value for the Features","review":"OBD II scanners can be purchased in a very wide price range. This model is on the inexpensive side and has the features that I want (Live Data, DTS reset, and code interpretation) and none of the features that I couldn't use (ABS codes, OBD I). This product works well. It is easy to read and simple to use. It has some Live Data recording ability that can be triggered manually or by a fault code. OBD II scanners have become a needed tool for the home mechanic and this fits my needs so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product with Great Service from Amazon","review":"I've had this product for four days and it has already paid for itself. I was able to retrieve and clear the diagnostic code from my 2005 vehicle without a problem. This product autolinks to your car, establishes the correct protocol, and returns the DTC (Diagnostic Trouble Code) almost instantly. Taking the vehicle to the mechanic every time the car's check engine light comes on is not only expensive in terms of money, but also time. My specific problem let me be aware of a sensor that I could fix myself...without tools. This tool is a gem to have in your garage for OBD-II vehicles. As far as my experience with buying through Amazon, this particular tool was $30 cheaper than buying it through my local auto parts house. And...with Amazon Prime I had it in two days with FREE shipping...can't beat it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a charm!","review":"I purchased this unit primarily to diagnose our 2006 PT Cruiser's Check Engine condition that happened out of the blue a while back. There seem to be so many variations of this type of device and it took me a while to settle on one that I felt would do the job for all of our cars. I have a 1995 Dodge Neon that had the pre-OBDII ECU and I wanted to be able to read it as well. This unit does both cars well and has also worked on a 2001 BMW M Roadster.For newer vehicles it provides both the codes and plain english descriptions. It also captures any event data that can be reviewed after the unit has been disconnected from the vehicle. It is fairly simple to use and comes with a case to keep everything together.If you have to deal with vehicle manufactured since 1995 this is the scan tool for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use","review":"I bought this when my BMW M3 started throwing codes which turned out to be a bad intake cam sensor. This scanner is so easy to use that there really is nothing to do but to plug it in to the OBDII port and read the what it says on the screen. At first I regretted not getting a BMW specific scanner like the Peak Research ones but a few years later, I had an unfortunate need to use it to read the codes from our Toyota RAV4. So in the end, it worked out pretty well for me. I would recommend it to any grease monkey out there and of course to the pros."},{"rating":"2","title":"PUPPIES LOVE THEM AND THEY'RE GOOD FOR THEM TOO","review":"I breed Dobermans and Mini Schnauzers and have used these biscuits for the puppies chewing needs when they're cutting their baby teeth since my first litters were born. It's a positive chewing item for them and nutritious as well. When my puppies go to their new lives with their new families I always include a dozen or so of these biscuits along with other things to make their transition as easy as possible. I like the fact that these puppy biscuits have no dyes or other flavors added and recommend that the new owners avoid the other flavored biscuits(even prior to the peanutbutter scare a year ago!). I personally don't like the idea of dyes in food and treats because some of then can bring about allergic reactions and judging from the reaction of all the dogs and puppies- these taste so great they don't need the other flavors to enjoy their nutritious treats!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Aged Technology","review":"Please be aware of a few facts about this item. It only operates on FAT formatted disks which leaves out most of the larger capacity portable USB storage media. It only works using USB 1.1, a 12 megabit/sec transfer rate. (The current standard, USB 2 has a 400 megabit/sec transfer rate). I purchased it to transfer images from my camera card backup drive to a portable DVD drive. This unit fails to recognize either unit. The product, delivered 3 days ago (APR 2007) has a sticker on the bottom stating it was manufactured November 2004.I'ts possible someone may have a use for this item, but for most consumers with relatively modern portable storage devices this unit is not useful in the slightest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abba treated with the respect they deserve!!!","review":"Carl Palm takes a subject some make take lightly, and reveals them as the complex creation that they are. Although the author has a high reguard for his subject, he is never fawning or heavy handed, which results in a very objective, yet personal text. Not only informative as a study of Abba itself, but as a study of the pop music business. Without ever exploiting their private lives, we are taken into the world of four unique creative individuals, their working habits, motivations, and songwriting genius. It is a pleasure to read a book that treats great pop music with the depth and understanding it deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"An ABBA Fanatic","review":"I very highly recommend this book for those who are interestednot only in the public but private sides of A,B,B, and A.

It was a joy to read this book and learn some of how they song crafted, and the trials and tribulations they went through in the throes of stardom - the opening chapters on each member were a delight, too, and I'm glad Palm didn't skimp on their formulative era either - I was especially surprised to read about the scorn and negativity ABBA felt from their own country, as if the whole nation had decided collectively that they weren't \\"cool,\\" taking their cues from the country's music press. A must for ABBA fans or even anyone who has a mild interest in them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Factual biography by knowledgeable writer","review":"An authoritive, definitive thorough bio from ABBA historian, C.M.Palm.Palm covers the entire careers of the four members of ABBA.Palm discusses all the major issues of their careers, and sheds light on some unfamiliar territory such as the story of Frida's father, and B&B;'s rift with former manager Stig Anderson. Palm is a dry, but highly factual writer. Because of his association with Universal Music, Palm tends not to dwell on the negative aspects of the four members of ABBA, but neither does he whitewash the ABBA story.I did find myself disagreeing with some of Palm's assessments of ABBA music. Palm tends to give only fair to bad reviews of much of ABBA's group & solo work. A new paperback version of this biography was made available in 2008. The \\"revision\\" consists primarily of a new nine-page afterword, bringing the continuing ABBA story up-to-date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a book!","review":"I read this book 2 times and i stll enjoy it.

First, the SonicStage software never worked properly. I installed about 100 symphonies at one time without any difficulty, but on several different occasions, whenever I tried to add a single new symphony to the unit, the software could not find the 100 already installed even though they were all present according to the unit and any could be played. Each time this happened I was forced to re-initialize the hard drive, erasing the symphonies already on the unit and requiring that they all be added again. Second, the display has no backlight, making it almost impossible to see the display in daylight. I often had to cover the screen with my hand to see it. Another complaint (admittedly minor) is that, if I turned the unit off while it was playing a particular work and later turned it back on, the unit would resume playing that work.

However the key thing is this: When I thought about buying an MP3 I envisioned coying my cds and dropping them into the MP3. I envisioned dragging and dropping music from other sites I have bought music from.NONE of these things were true for this player.Instead I got SonicStage who decides if my own cd is worthy of a transfer or not!I don't think so...

However, because their previous hard-drive based player (NW-HD5) produced the best sound I'd heard, I admit to being anxious to see what they'd come up with next. Unfortunately, Sony decided style was more important than boosting capacity as this model is a relatively paltry 8 GB, and that is just not enough. The NW-HD5 was 20 GB. I was expecting more this time, say 30-60 GB. If Sony had been SMART enough to heed this, I would have ordered one. I am disappointed. However, kudos for design. Sony is usually cutting-edge in that regard (with the exception of their AWFUL remotes). NO SALE, Sony.

The best thing is that the juice tastes exceedingly fresh. I tested it for juice volume against our centrifugal juicer and truthfully it's about the same when it comes to hard veggies like carrots. That it juices leafy greens and wheatgrass really well is the key here for me as centrifugal juicers just don't do the job well with those items.The fact that you can grind coffee beans, grind meat, make pasta, ice cream, even make your own flax oil, etc. with this juicer makes it worth every penny!I try to buy things that are 'Made In America' and if I had done my homework better in that area would have bought a Champion juicer as the Samson is made in Korea but we decided to keep it anyway. Next time we'll get the Champion.Overall I recommend this to anyone that wants truly fresh, non-oxidized juice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great juicer","review":"I've owned many juicers in the past.

When I tried on those new khakis, I found that the waistband was two inches below my navel, and that they bulge out in the front like a balloon. Now even the sales lady agreed that the old ones which I was wearing were a far better fit.If you are over 50 and prefer pleated pants, you are probably a bit over weight like me, and I think you would not like how these things fit.This is a problem for me because I liked that I did not have to think about it, just buy Izods in my size.

I'd imagine it's from sitting down all day, but still, I've never had a pair of pants do that before, or since.

I couldn't find any Izod info that states it. In my case these are 36'' waist by 32'' inseam. I am 6' 2''. The pants have a shorter rise than I would like.

Billed as \\"based on Gospel truth,\\" this story definitely reflects the 1950s in its simplistic, idealistic tone. The characters are rather Cleaver-like, but there is an underlying message of salvation.The author supports the notion of the pre-tribulation rapture, as do the authors of \\"Left Behind,\\" but the emphasis on the torture of newly converted believers in this work is particularly striking. The rapid spiritual change in some of the characters is not necessarily adequately explained, especially if this is meant as an evangelical piece. But in all honesty, I found most effective the very accurate-seeming and brutal depictions of the torture of believers at the hands of the antichrist and his minions. We all know from the Apostle Paul's life that this is not some fairy tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary but true!","review":"It's awesome!

It's meditative. Each time I use it, I encounter a different experience, perhaps because my mind is in a different place. It's a healing \\"time out\\" from stress.I think I got more out of it because I listened to the explanations of the process first...maybe it just made me more suggestible, but it helped. BTW, this is also available as a cassette...pay extra and get the CD!

I certainly learned a lot, and most of it was even interesting.The book is set up chronologically, but I actually found myself just subject-surfing the index.If I have any complaint, it's the writing style has a bit too much \\"hero-worship\\" of Welles. Don't get me wrong: I love the man, but recognize his flaws, and the book occasionally delved into apologetic on some of those matters.

I am not Catholic, but I am interested in reading about other religions and I thought this book would be a good insight into an average Catholic child's upbringing. I was extremly offended by this book. It's nothing but an anti Catholic/Christian book. There are stories involving homosexuality in this book. In one story, two teenage boys makeout inside a church. If that's not offensive, what is? The stories portray Catholic schools as cold, hard, abusive places that children fear. This book does nothing but perpetuate old sterotypes. The only story I really enjoyed was the one about the little Afrian American girl that decided to work so she could pay her own way through Catholic school. If you're a Catholic or Christian, avoid this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"a competent if unremarkable crime novel","review":"'Glitz' is actually one of the more enjoyable Elmore Leonard novels I've read. Too often the author gets overly enamored with gangster talk and too many offbeat characters, much to the detriment of the story. In 'Glitz' the story, about a cop chasing down a killer in the shadows of casinos of Atlantic City and San Juan, is fairly tight and believable. The characters are quite vivid and diverse. However ultimately the book has the feel of a good 'Miami Vice' episode; lots of punch but nothing that really lingers in your mind after it's over.Bottom line: certainly an okay read but nothing out of the ordinary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to forget","review":"I read this book in one day. I waited another day then read Elmore Leonard's \\"LaBrava\\". An hour after I finished the second book I hardly remembered anything about either one of them- they are both just so easy to forget. I'm afraid the reviewers who claim Leonard is so great at characterization have never read a really good book or have spent too much time in front of a TV. It is not that the writing is bad, it just doesn't have any depth. The best thing I can say about Glitz is that the bad guy is really creepy, and that's a compliment. But that's not reason enough to spend money and time on this kind of fluff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Too Much Hype about this guy","review":"When I bought this book, I believed I was going to read the cream of the crop of crime novels. It isn't. The main character lacks charisma big time. The villains lack charisma big time. Hell, not even the girl has much. The only really cool character is the ex-football player. And he's a secondary one.Why do I even give two stars? Because, I must admit, I'm very afraid to give this guy less than that. He certainly did his homework and knows a lot of the cop slang and settings he describes. But that's a very common flaw, to put a lot of accurate information on a BORING plot.For great crime fiction, do check on James Elroy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Home From Home","review":"As with the great majority of Leonard's books, certain qualities can be taken as a given. The dialogue is vibrant and snappy, and the characters and plotline feed off each other - as is true with all great thriller writers - proving that the only things needed to power a story are the failings, weaknesses, vanities, and reluctant ethics of the characters themselves.The central issue here is the dance between Vincent Mora (a Miami based police officer, convalescing after being shot on duty) and Teddy Magyk (a devious degenerate who Mora helped put away). With Puerto Rico as the expertly sketched backdrop, and all the secondary characters drawn with economic verve, if this novel falls just shy of the writer's best work it's because of those standards he's set for himself, and shouldn't be any barrier to enjoying this vivid work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay, 4 and a half stars","review":"If I remember correctly, this was Elmore Leonard's breakout book, and at the time long books were in fashion. \\"Books by the pound,\\" people in the book biz used to call them. I have a feeling EL's publisher encouraged him to write long this time, and I think the book suffers a bit for that. So I'll knock off a half star from my rating for verbosity. Still, it's a wonderful read with colorful characters, wry humor, and great dialogue. And as an extra bonus, EL tackles new locales here--Atlantic City and Puerto Rico instead of his usual Detroit and Miami. It's a classic hardcase good guy vs. wacko bad guy tale, and what could be more satisfying than that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"This was my first Elmore Leonard novel. I have seen the movies based on his novels which made me curious about his writing. I will read more of his novels. I thought this one was a good suspense novel and appreciated that the characters were flawed, even the heroes."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 1st Leonard Novel","review":"After reading Horning's \\"Mystery Lovers Book of Quotes\\" I decided to branch out from Sue Grafton, P.D. James, etc. & try on some different authors. Elmore's \\"Glitz\\" & \\"LaBrava\\" got good writeups so... Interesting. This book has a strong story without lots of unnecessary details (or padding). The main character & his friends are very sympathetic IHMO & their relationships seem to click well. I'd like to read more adventures of Lt. Vincent Mora. The \\"bad guys\\" are a bit stereotyped with little psychological background or explanation. But the \\"gray area\\" folks such as Jackie Garbo & the Donovans seemed a bit more fleshed out. My favorite character is the Moose. IMHO the strength of the book is primarily in the characterization. Leonard seems to project a definite yet complex image of each using very little description. Also, the plot is made interesting with the various venues and supporting characters. I enjoyed it and intend to read more of Leonard's works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great writing chops don't make up for lame plot, characters","review":"I was dazzled by Leonard's writing here, but as the story progressed I didn't feel any simpathy for the sleazy characters or feel very intrested in the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"CamRon Comes Again With Another Horrible Album.","review":"Once again I don't know why I do it to myself...why do I even try to listen to a CamRon album?

His lyrics are garbage because you can never understand what he's talking about. His doody doody, luey, gooey rhyme style is just that... doody doody. His production is even lame on the album when usually Dipset releases have good beats at least. I'm so glad I burnt this cd and only because someone asked for it.

This is one of those albums you really have to grow on and understand the swagger of Harlem. Theres are many gems on this album such as the Intro, Living a Lie, We Make Change, War, and Triple Up. This is definately up there with the best albums of 2006 thus far, although we are still waiting on several albums yet to drop such as Lloyd Banks, Young Buck, JR Writer, The Game and Fat Joe.I definately recommend this to anyone who lives around or in New York City as it has a real east coast swag to it.

All are impressive, but none more than the K330 and 570 sonatas. In both, he articulates the slow movementsquite clearly (as usual) but also dramatizes/reveals the pathos behind the overt simplicity. His principle rivals/peers here are Clara Haskil in K330 and Claudio Arrau in k570. Arrau's was less labored than in some of his later Mozart and his K570 disc also included the sonata k576 and the B Minor Adagio K540. If one finds these Arrau interpetaions too heavy, I would recommend Brendel or Ingrid Haebler. Brendels K331 here is excellent. Ditto his A Minor Rondo, k511, a dark work which I consider Mozart's second greatest short work (after the B Minor Adagio)Peers: Haebler in all four worksK 330: Haskil (Philips), Larrocha (RCA)K331: Brendel (Philips Duo version), LarrochaK570: Arrau, LarrochaK511: Arrau (Philips), Serkin (Sony"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brendel Remains Our Finest Interpreter Of Mozart","review":"Alfred Brendel demonstrates that he is our foremost interpreter of Mozart in this splendid CD of several of Mozart's piano sonatas and the rondo. His performances are replete with both brilliant technique and keen musical scholarship which fans of Alfred Brendel have come to expect. Brendel's playing is elegant, without sounding at all Romantic; I suspect his phrasing remains consistent with Mozart's intentions. The only negative note is the audience's applause at the end of each piece; otherwise, the sound quality is what you'd expect in a well balanced studio recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"battery life sucks","review":"Easy to install and go.

Finally after almost two months without a plant I finally got in touch with someone at spring hill that knew what was going out. I found out that the plant would not get there because it was out of it's growing season and I would have to wait until next season or I could be refunded my money, but it took a while to get refunded on my statement. I would recommended to anyone ordering that you find out the availability is first, as well as order it WAY before you think it will arrive.

If you ever read any of these old court diaries, you come to appreciate a good picture like this because the women who wrote these books dwelled, almost obessivly on what they wore.The clarity and quality of the writing is this slim volume is very good, as good as what you will find in the pillow book of sei shonagon.

This is the breadmaker for the occasional bread baker- once a month or so; if, however, you are like me and wish to have homemade bread on a regular basis, this product will not stand up. During the 3-year warranty period I went through about 7 breadmakers. This is another drawback: the 3-year warranty is only good from the original date of purchase, so if you need a replacement breadmaker, the replacement doesn't come with a new guarantee. Not only that, but Cuisinart's policy is that the customer pays the shipping costs for having a new breadmaker shipped and the old one shipped back to the company. I do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paddle comes loose all the time=poor bread","review":"After wearing out a Breadman machine (I make bread fresh every other day) I got this machine and have been very disappointed by the quality control of the bread pan and paddle. We are now on our 2nd paddle and bread pan because the fit between these two items is very poor. More often than not the paddle comes loose during the kneading cycle resulting in very poor bread. Cuisinart are sending us yet another pan and if this does not fix the problem then we are going to return the entire item and look for a model with better QA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuisinart CBK-200: Flawed Design","review":"If you're looking for a bread machine, keep looking. While this model offers some nice features, the design of the pan is awful. During the kneading cycle, the pan comes loose. When it does, the machine keeps motoring away, thinking it's kneading the bread, while the whole thing makes a racket.Don't even think about walking away from it during the kneading cycle. Plan on standing over it, or better still, holding the pan in for the half hour or so that kneading takes.Once the kneading ordeal is over, the machine can make a nice loaf of bread. The interior will have good consistency, and the crust a satisfying crunch. Just don't think of this machine as one that can operate unattended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stumbled right out of the gate...","review":"After reading tons of reviews and doing a lot of research I bought this for my wife for Christmas. I pikced this one because she bakes 1-2 loaves a week and is a serious bread maker. Five minutes into the first use (using one of the simple recipes provided to test) it made a loud screech and broke. The paddle wouldn't turn. After playing with it we got it going enough to finish the bread (which was good by the way). But it was clearly broken - I suspect the drive belt came off. Maybe we just got unlucky but my wife had been waiting for a new machine and we are very frustrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drive mechanism is junk","review":"Out first unit lasted about a month, then the paddle stopped turning. This was returned to the store. The second unit did a little better, it lasted well over a year of twice-weekly use before the paddle stopped turning. I took it apart (not too easy, they used tamper resistance screws to hide the shoddy design) to find the problem. The problem is simple, the large pulley that turns the paddle is plastic and cracked and broke where it meet the paddle shaft. Really a piece of junk! Be nice if I could find replacement parts online.Other than that, it was a decent machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive","review":"Extremely versatile and quite convenient. The thing I dislike is that the paddle doesn't knead the dough enough so the bread comes out stiff. Also, the machine shakes considerably while kneading so make sure you place on a stable platform.

If you can follow the easy directions, you can make your own fresh bread with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Stopped Working....","review":"I liked this machine fine for about three months, then it suddenly started making squealing sounds (so loud I'd have to leave the room).

After about 30 minutes I plugged it in again, and nothing happened.I called Cuisinart and they made me try a couple of things, but still nothing.

Drive me crazy and I have to continuously reset it, pause, restart, over and over to the point where I'm wonder if it's not just as time consumer as to make it myself.The other thing, with the manual, and other breadmaker books - there is never a simple recipe for white bread. there's always some extensive list of ingredients that most people don't have and for weekly (most common) use, having recipes for dill sundried tomatoe whole wheat rice flour old timer jam bread is just pretty much a waste too.When the machine works, and I know have a basic recipe to follow, it's great.

The second loaf, a Sally Lunn bread, was already burned with 18 minutes left in the bake cycle.

I got this as a gift for Christmas in 12/2010, and have used it once a week since then. It works well when it is working, and as long as you use bread flour the bread comes out nicely. However, the hinges are made of plastic and broke within the first 10 months. This in itself is not a show stopper, as the lid stays in place while making bread, it just won't prop open. Then in 5/2012, after 17 months, the motor started stalling. The good news is that the warranty is 3 years, but the bad news is that there is a $10 fee plus you have to pay return shipping, which is $25 for standard UPS.

I liked that you can remove the blade (when you remember)But, after about 6 months the plastic hinges that holds the lid in place have cracked and broken off so it no longer stays in place. Each time we open the bread maker it falls off. Since it is really hot you easily get burned.I called Cuisinart today to request a replacement. Well it is going to cost me. They charge you for shipping you a new unit and then you have to send the old one back at your own expense.

This was a birthday gift in september and I have yet to have a successful loaf, not for lack of trying or experimenting.

I got mine today. i did everything the book said. added the ingredients exactly as the book said and plugged it in. the LCD did not light up. but i heard a click. So i plugged it out and tried another outlet. Heard a click again and nothing. It wouldn't even beep. Well i am returning mine and after reading of the heart aches of the other bread making persons here. I will get a different bran. Black and Decker or something. B&D doesnt go with the decor, but I am sure I will not have this let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Order From Etronics","review":"This item was promised to be here by December 26, 2006, it is now January 20,2007 and we have not yet received the elusive Bread Machine. I will never shop with Etronics again!!!!! Count on it. It was a Christmas present for my wife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bread Pan pops up","review":"Got this as a gift and the first time I tried to use it the bread pan kept popping up off of the paddle drive. Some tweaking of the tabs was in order, but for the second loaf it still popped up. It isn't automatic by a long shot, and is definitely not worth the hundred bucks street price. Buy a bread maker from a reputable Japanese company instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuisinart Bread Maker","review":"This bread maker is the worst one I have ever used. Not long after the 30 day return period expired, every loaf I made sank. Tried every tip in the book to no avail. Had to pay an extra $30 in postage to send it back and receive a new one. The replacement one was defective as well. The bread pan wouldn't completely lock in once the machine started up. At least this time I didn't have to pay shipping to send it back. Now I'm waiting for a third replacement. That's what you get for buying something made in China. Doesn't matter how great the brand name is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuisinart CBK 200","review":"I have made probably a dozen or so loaves with this and I was quite happy with it until a few days ago when it stopped kneading altogether and just made a clicking sound. After reading reports of belts falling off, I tried to look underneath by removing two screws and shining a flashlight in. Everything looked fine so I called Cusinart and instead of giving me any help they said I had voided the warranty by removing the screws so I was out of luck.I will never purchase a product made by them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great So Far!","review":"I just used my bread maker for the first time last night. I made a simple french loaf from the cookbook. The bread came out perfectly. As other posters mentioned the knead cycle was a bit noisy but other than that I have no complaints. This is my first bread maker so I don't have much else to compare it to, but I have many other Cuisinart appliances and all are top notch. Also the 3 year warranty is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only a few months old and machine has no power","review":"This machine is only a few months old and already there is absolutely no power to the machine. Last time I used it (approx a week ago) it worked fine. I went to turn it on today and there are not lights and apparently no power. Other appliances work in the same outlet, so it is the breadmaker. While it worked, we really enjoyed the bread. Quite disappointing for it to fail so soon. I'll be returning it to the store and may not replace it with the same machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointed, even after Trying Again","review":"I was so excited to receive my breadmaker. The first time I used it, I couldn't pull the bread pan out of the maker. So I had to use a spatula to get the baked bread out. I sent it back. Amazon was really good about sending me a brand new one at no cost to me.However, after baking three loaves, I'm ready to return the second one. The machine is SO loud, no one can talk in the kitchen or dining room when it's working. I am no exaggerating. One night I programmed it to make bread in the AM...it awakened me at 3:30....my bedroom is upstairs. I'm frustrated and totally disappointed and can't believe I have to go through a second return. Doesn't Cuisinart test these machines before boxing them up??? Or does Amazon buy overstock \\"lemons\\"??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy at ALL!","review":"Product never baked any bread ... unless you count a crusty top and a doughy bottom, bread. The first time I attempted to make bread, the pan shook loose until I bowed the sides a bit. The second attempt at bread made me just waste more ingredients."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it's the high altitude...","review":"Maybe it doesn't work as well in high altitude (Denver) but I have tried to make an edible loaf of bread out of this thing many times with no success. The loaf is either a brick or raw. Following the recipes exactly or making modifications according to the rather vague high altitude instructions didn't help. Besides, it is not all that hard to bake bread from scratch without a bread maker and you don't have funny shaped loaves with a hole in the bottom of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brick of Bread","review":"We purchased this breadmaker after our old one broke. We have had this breadmaker for 2 weeks and I have attempted multiple loaves of bread with no luck. They turn into little hard lumps that do not rise. I have even bought new flour and yeast hoping to resolve the issue but this last loaf is again not as good as our old breadmaker. I'm disappointed with this product. Both my sisters have this breadmaker and love it but I can't say the same thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for making wheat breat.","review":"We recently purchase this machine and just sent it back as we could not get it to make a decent wheat loaf. It made white and gluten-free loaves just fine, but it over cooked the wheat bread. It also did not mix the bread very well. If you are wanting a easy put the mix in and wake up to fresh loaf of bread this is not the machine to purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bread Maker","review":"I am very satified with the Cuisinart CBK-200 Automatic bread maker. It is easy to use and it has alot of nice features. The bread turns out very nice. If there is one complaint it is that the crust gets a little burnt even on the light crust setting. There are a lot of good recipes in the manual and they are easy to follow. I would recommend this bread maker for those out there looking to make their own home made bread."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Performance","review":"I am very happy with this bread machine. Really love the ability to remove the paddle before baking. The only thing I would add to this product is a lamp inside so you can view the progress of your bread. Haven't tried the mix in feature but am looking forward to it at some point. Recipe book included is okay but I would like to have seen more tips in changing up the recipes a bit. I read the reviews before purchasing and I have not experienced ANY of the negatives represented in the comments. I owned a Welbilt machine before and may have gone with that brand again if it were available but since I have had good results with other Cuisinart products, decided on this one. Great product for the price paid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome bread!","review":"I bought this breadmaker because it had a gluten free setting. I've made it several times now and it is awesome. I will never buy the dense, hard, nasty store bought gluten free bread again! The gluten free bread is like...well, normal bread! I have zero problems with the breadmaker. The only gripe I have is that the gluten free recipes that come with the machine are kind of odd, so I just went online and found a bunch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't try it again..","review":"I received my first breadmaker and had problems with it making a lot of noise. I checked how I inserted the bread bowl, tightened, etc. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. After having my son and husband try to get it in tighter, having no success, I decided to get it replaced. Amazon was fantastic. They sent me a new one and it had the same problem. I contacted Cuisenart. They listened over the phone and said it was definitely not supposed to sound like that so I sent it back again. Amazon was wonderful. I traded it in for a different model. I won't try this brand again."},{"rating":"2","title":"good bread maker, lousy fan!","review":"I have a number of cuisinart products and like them all. The bread machine is fine and does a good job. I have made a number of things with it and they have all turned out. I love bread and usually make it by hand and prefer it so. But since I bought this machine I am tempted to take the lazy way out and just make this way.If I have any issue with it, its the fan. This is a convection bread maker and in truth is the reason I bought it thinking it would be faster and cook more evenly.I own a Cuisinart convection oven that I like much so I assumed the bread maker would be equal to it. But I find the fan is noisy and I wonder just how effective it is. This may be just perception as it sounds not only loud but weak like its not turning all that fast,The bread does come out evenly baked.I will also add that it came in on time and in great shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"I have had other bread machines, but none quite like this beauty!It is so very easy to make terrific bread, now I do not even buy bread.The downside, it is large and during the mixing and kneading process, very noisy. Fortunately my laundry room/pantry adjoins the kitchen. I fill the bread maker pan in the kitchen, then put it into the machine and close the kitchen door. Perfect bread every time! The cookbook that came with it is great also."},{"rating":"1","title":"CUSINART CBK200 LB CONVECTION BREAD MAKER","review":"I Purchased this item from a local store - I tried it 3 times and the bread was awful - makes a loud noise while operating and bread is too thick and heavy.

Horrible customer service from Cuisinart.","review":"I got this machine as a present. I made one loaf which came out well. However, I can't get the pan out of the machine. I call Cuisinart customer service and they were no help. The rep was rude and refused to help me initiate the warranty. I was so disappointed. I am returning the machine and getting a different one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned it for another","review":"I had this machine only about 3 weeks before it stopped working. One minute it was plugged in. I unplugged it for about an half an hour then plugged it back in and nothing. It was completely dead. Nothing worked. The digital display showed nothing,there were no lights on. Dead. I tested the outlet, tried different outlets, nothing.I was already disappointed with the machine. The low carb cycle cooked too long and we had to remove the bread before the bake cycle ended to keep it from burning. The French bread came out so hard that it was impossible to bite into. I am returning it an getting a different bread machineI gave this product 2 stars instead of one because of the great customer service I got from Cuisinart. It has a three year warranty. I would not hesitate to purchase another Cuisinart product just not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuisinart Bread Machine","review":"Just got my new Cuisinart bread machine and made my first loaf of bread. BURNED, BURNED AND BURNED! I used lowest setting too.Just sick for I read that this is a problem after I ordered it and it was on the way. Sure enough! Wasted good ingredients too! Will try again, but hate to risk losing expensive ingredients!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too loud, unpredictable bread","review":"This thing is louder than a Sherman tank. I bought it from an Amazon-owned site that is a *hoot* to shop on, so it was a refurb. That said, we had to get rid of this one because it was way too loud. We like to awake to bread in the morning, and this thing was so loud it would wake up the dead. Also, the bread made from the recipes in the instruction manual was just average at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I made four loaves with this machine and ended up selling it and buying the Zojirushi. It's too fussy and the flour would often stick to the sides and not mix. The Zojirushi is twice as much but has two paddles and so far I have made 3 perfect loaves of bread. So if you want to save some money and you don't mind fussing with the machine and the contents then get this one but if you just want to dump everything in and walk away spend the extra dough (pun intended) and get the Zojirushi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for dough cycles, but burns bread!","review":"I love this machine for the dough cycles, especially the Artisan Bread Dough Cycle. We love making these breads and dipping them in seasoned olive oil. However, anytime I have tried to use this machine from start to finish, the crust has come out way too dark. If I try to bake any kind of bread with a higher sugar content (like Panettone), the crust actually burns!!! So, I use my 12 yr. old Panasonic to actually bake bread. I just bought my daughter a ZO for her birthday. I think I might just treat myself with one of those myself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bread maker","review":"I have been happy with the results of using the machine for various types of bread and rolls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice But Not Perfect","review":"This was my third brand bread machine purchased. The Cuisinart CBK-200 makes lovely bread, is sturdily built, has a nice three-year warranty as opposed to the usual one-year, and has the best recipe book of any breadmaker I've ever had. I just had a couple of things I didn't like about it. I didn't like the non-backlit digital readout being on top of the machine, because it was very hard to see. I also didn't like the tiny viewing window. Lastly, I thought the machine was quite noisy when kneading. For those reasons, I returned this machine. I'm not sure if the noisiness was due to the normal performance of the machine or if it was a defect of this particular one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuisinart Bread Machine","review":"My first machine was a small Panasonic, so I'm not new to making bread. I like all of the features of the Cuisinart, but the machine is very noisy with very loud klunks. That doesn't bother me, but the problem I have is that no matter what cycle I use, with the light crust setting, the machine always burns the bread. The bread looks great until about the last 15 minutes, then the coils get red hot and my loaf turns black. Today, instead of cinnamon bread I pulled out a black hockey puck. This is very disappointing. I'm going to try to exchange the machine for another one and hope for better luck because the features are very nice, the pan is non-stick, and the beeps to alert you to ad mixing ingredients and to remove the paddle are number one on my list. Perhaps the quality control does need some attention, but I'll keep trying until I get a good machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trouble with design","review":"My family purchased this machine as a gift since I was baking so much bread in the old machine I had found from our wedding. The first thing you will notice with this machine is it is VERY LOUD! I got used to that and was enjoying the bread it produced. Then the bread pan kept popping up during kneading; you have to pause the machine and put the pan back in, so you have to stand in front of the loud thing for ages. Next the motor started to seize; you have to manually un-stick the motor! I called customer service and they sent me a replacement. The new one worked fine for a while but the bread pan started popping out again. I called customer service and they sent a new bread pan. That lasted for a couple of cycles, but has now started popping up again!!! I will call them one more time to let them know that this machine has serious design flaws. My husband thinks it is because I use it way more than the average customer, but I feel if it is made well, there should not be problems!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke on Second Loaf","review":"I used this product to make pizza dough the first day I got it. I was making two large batches(2 lbs). On the first batches I was forced to scrap the flour from the corners to incorporate it and on the second loaf the unit died because the paddle was too weak to push the knead the dough. I have a lot of Cuisinart products which I love but clearly this product was not made to the typical standards. I have used numerous other bread makers which worked much better than these. There is a much more limited selection of bread makers today and because Cuisinart is a typically good brand I choose them; clearly a bad decision in this case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bread maker...even for gluten free bread!","review":"We are a gluten-free household, and this bread maker is great! It even has a gluten-free setting. We make bread 3 times per week, and it has been great every time. I highly recommend this product. (If you're looking for a good gluten-free bread mix, try Pamela's!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I got a dud, but...","review":"this unit was a major disappointment for me. About 75% of the time I use bread machines, I use the dough cycle and make specialty bread. This was the case with my first time with this unit. I needed to make a large quantity, so I had my two Panasonic units as well as my new Cuisinart for the job. All three were given the same ingredients, in the same quantities and put on the dough cycle. At the end of the appointed time, I had two nice pans of dough (the Panasonic units), and one pan (in the Cuisinart) of soupy paste, with half an inch of unmixed flour along one side of the pan and a smaller amount along the other sides. I had followed the directions, but it was just a flop. I was able to salvage the dough by hand mixing and letting it rise, but that is hardly what one expects to have to do when one owns bread machines. Again, maybe I got a dud, but this unit was a major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burns bread--poor build quaility, included recipe books needs a QC","review":"I think this machine was rushed to the market too quickly. The bread machine has a plethora of nifty features, but the build quality is noticeably poor (ours came with a dented handle and lid screws that were inserted in a crooked fashion.) It burns any \\"fancy bread\\" (we had good results with one loaf out of five and that loaf was plain-Jane French bread), and the recipe book needs a good quality control check. The first recipe we attempted, cinnamon bread, did not include adding any liquid ingredients. I watched the paddle sift dry ingredients like a monkey stares at a basketball until my wife improvised and added a little liquid to the mix. Regardless of her valiant efforts, that loaf turned out looking something like a dense door stop. Forgive me, but while I shop for a better bread machine, Cuisinart may try going back to the drawing board."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality seriously lacking!","review":"I bought this machine partly because of the name - Cuisinart, known for a good product - and partly because of the gluten-free setting. The gluten-free breads always sunk. The first machine died after about 1 year and the replacement machine lasted about 1 1/2 years. Definately not worth the money. Something is seriously lacking in the quality of this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuisinart Convection Breadmaker Avoid it!","review":"After 7 loafs of bread the machine stopped kneading. Contacted Cuisinart and machine is just out of warranty. They do not repair machines and sell no parts to repair the mechanism ie belts.Basically told me to junk it. Cuisinart is not the brand they once were and now mass produce in China with little quality control or service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor bread maker","review":"Tried two loafs. The first (cinnamon raisen Gluten Free) didn't seem to rise during the rise cycle, and didn't seem to rise during baking. Turned into a heavy strange tasting loaf. The Second loaf was standard white bread. Unfortunately, it fell during baking and the machine burned several sections on the sides and bottom. I believe the temperature of the machine was off. Mixing is poor as there was a lot of flour in the corners that never got mixed into the dough. Either way, not worth the money, especially when there are better machines available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad news","review":"I got this as Christmas present from my kids, and so far it's been a total wash.The paddle, has yet to succeed in mixing the indrediates, that stay seperated, or end up stuck to one side.The directions are confusing, and the controls are inflexable, save your money, time and frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious Flaws","review":"I received my bread maker over the weekend and was so excited to make homemade bread for my husbands birthday party. The first loaf did not rise at all. The mix-in button would not turn off which seemed to have messed everything up. I tried to stop the cycle with about 10 minutes to go and pressed cancel and unplugged the machine. When I started my next loaf, the settings were jammed and the timer still read 10 minutes left. The Cuisinart support person told me that the only way to re-set the machine is to leave it unplugged for at LEAST half an hour to an hour! Two hours later, it hadn't re-set so I was told the machine must be defective.I was really excited about this machine, I own a lot of Cuisinart products and this is one really has the nicest look for my kitchen, but I just don't think I will buy another and risk throwing away pounds more of my organic flour! With no way to STOP the cycle, I just don't think it's worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAJOR problem--the kneader \\"sheds\\" pieces of itself in to the bread","review":"If you don't mind cutting a 3inch squar out of your finished product, just to get all the GRAY COLORED bread (seriously...it comes off of the kneading attachment)out of your finished baked good, by all means buy this thing. It works well, easy to use, but about 1/4 of your loaf will have to be discarded because of the GRAY MATTER.this has to be a health hazard...I've used this machine several times in the six months since buying it, and I'm ready to give up and buy a new brand all together.

Guess I'll call the delivery man instead.I suppose I'll try again another time, if I can find the heart to bother with it. I wish Cuisinart had tried again to work out the kinks in either the recipes or the workings of this piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs improvement!","review":"I was very disappointed in this product. I made two loaves of bread with it and they were both burnt with the light setting. I have had 2 bread machines before and never had this problem so I returned it.

The loaves do not turn out uniform, the cover broke off after 1 year. The whole wheat setting does not produce evenly mixed and symmetrical loaves like my panasonic. The yeast and ingredients added later do not get mixed up evenly. Do not waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another one with pan problems","review":"I bought this because I have other Cuisinart items that I like. I was a bit worried about the comments with the pan not staying in but figured it couldn't be too bad as my 16 year old Panasonic didn't even have anything to hold it down, it just dropped in and worked. Boy, was I wrong- after a month my wife could get it to hold in place after about 5 minutes of fiddling around. Now, neither of us can get it to stay, I force the end of the handle through one of the hold down holes and leave it at that. Not great but it kind of works. Otherwise, I am happy with everything else about it but I'm afraid I'm advising not to buy one, it's definitely not worth the hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away","review":"I've just tossed this breadmaker and bought a different brand. The first few loaves I did (sweet breads) burned on the bottom and cooked unevenly. I saw this in previews reviews, but I played the odds, and unfortunately, I got a bad breadmaker. I followed the recipes to the \\"T.\\" I have since made other loaves (not sweet)...white, wheat, etc. They come out much better and I definitely don't have the burning issue. However, I want a breadmaker that I can use for all purposes. I would recommend that you stay away from this one. Not to mention, the customer service at Cuisinart is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bread pan will no longer snap into place","review":"I have only had this machine for 2 years and seriously it has only been used maybe a dozen times.

In addition to that, the electronics don't work unless I unplug the machine after every loaf I make. The worst thing about it is that I only make dough every 10 days to two weeks and never use the bake option.How can a machine that's used so infrequently fail so miserably in such a short amount of time? This is my 3rd bread machine in 10 years, so I certainly know how to maintain a machine and this one just doesn't hold up."},{"rating":"1","title":"A machine you should only use once a month","review":"I have owned this machine for 3 years and for the first year and a half it worked beautifully. I used it at least once a week and took good care of it, following the maintenance instructions. It stopped working and Cuisinart replaced it for the cost of shipping the faulty one back. I used the new machine for another year and half, using it once a week and taking good care of it. I used the machine for the dough cycle mostly, baking it in a loaf pan because I like the shape better and it still stopped working! When I asked Cuisinart, they wouldn't replace it because the original machine is out of warranty. I have been unable to get a full warranty period out of once machine.

On the first attempt to make bread, the machine sounded like a threshing machine. Of course the bread was a failure. The pan had come loose from the cup it sits in. On the second and third attempts, the mixing paddle came loose and embedded itself in the loaf of bread. In all tries the pan came loose from the mixing cup on the spindle and the machine had to be put on pause and the pan reseated. I DID NOT purchase this from amazon.

Given that I can make great bread from scratch and this is my 4th breadmaker, I can only conclude that this machine is very poorely engineered. Even the recipes do not reflect what the mainstream of most consumers want to bake; it's fine to dealve into the esoteric artisan loaves, but maybe after you have covered off the basics such as rye bread using realistic ingredients."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far I'm very pleased","review":"So far I've made about four loaves in my machine, and many more dough (pizza, rolls, and specialty bread).

I wanted the bigger, horizontal loaf, so that's why I decided to order the Cuisinart. Can't get this one to vary the thickness/lightness of the crust at all. It's always too heavy/dark. The size of the pan really needs two kneading paddles. As it is, with one paddle, there are lots of dips and swirls even in plain old white bread, which should have an even texture. Never had a loaf absolutely fail, but for the money, the size, & the claims made by the manufacturer, this one should work better. Thanks to Amazon's great return policy, I was able to return it with no hassle at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I am so disappointed in this product that I just spent another $29 to return it to the company. The overall performance was a much poorer quality than bread machines I owned years ago. Out of the eight loaves I made, only two were marginally satisfactory. I followed the directions precisely and used brand new high quality ingredients but even with a simple loaf of banana nut quick bread, the flour was not well mixed into the batter. I had really looked forward to some delicious bread from this machine, but after this unfortunate experience, I think I'll just go back to the tried and true hand kneading method!I would definitely not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"mzeinstr","review":"i got this bread maker 2 years ago, which isn't that long ago considering that you do not make bread every day. first, the pan started banging around about 1 year into it, not to mention all the flour that collects in the corners of the bread pan, then just the other day, the paddle quit working. i ordered a new paddle, that didn't help. we took it apart and found that the belt wheel is actually made out of plastic, and this is what turns the paddle. needless to say, the plastic part was worn out and as far as i can find, it can't be replaced. so i would caution anyone buying this bread machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but!","review":"This is a great bread maker. Make sure to use the correct flour and it should make great bread. I have noticed the setting for the crust is almost non functional. I would guess that with a convection bread maker it may be difficult to build a true temp adjust from dark to light crust. It's not too loud and doesn't burn bread so if your does then get a new one. Love the fresh bread without the yellow 5 and other preservatives in it. Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design - works well for a while","review":"For as long as it lasts the CBK-200 works fairly well. The normal crust setting seems too hard for wheat bread, but light works as long as you still like a rather substantial crust. Maybe it works better with lighter breads. The little paddle doesn't look like it mixes very well, but eventually seems to get the job done. A wooden spoon helps get the flour stuck in the corners, but probably isn't really needed.A major flaw is that the large secondary belt driven gear is very cheap plastic held to the shaft by friction. Since bread dough is usually very stiff, the gear will eventually start slipping, rendering the machine completely worthless. Taking off the bottom plate and tightening the shaft bolt may help a little, but the cheap plastic of the gear will eventually give way. There doesn't seem to be any service parts available, making this a \\"use for a while and then throw away appliance\\". Purchased at Ross for $40, which seems like a good price for the quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Beeps and Buttons but Burns the Bread","review":"I owned a Cuisinart CBK200 for a few weeks and was very impressed with all the extras that it was capable of doing. I loved the stainless steel finish and the horizontal baking pan. It was a heavy duty machine that didn't make a lot of noise while mixing the bread. I loved the bake only feature as well as the backup power failure feature. It had real buttons and not the touch pad which was also a plus. It had plenty of timer beeps to let you know every phase it was going through. So why don't I still have it? Well, it burned up every loaf I made no matter what setting I used. If they could only get the thermostat working right, it would be a winner hands down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cusinart CBK-200","review":"I purchased this breadmaker approximately two years ago. Since that time, I used it once or twice a week, but not every week. About 6 months ago, the paddle assembly began to deteriorate. It is now totally inoperable. When I contacted Cusinart about the problem, they indicated that they would replace the paddle assembly upon payment of a fee of $23.00 plus shipping. I do think that given the cost of the breadmaker the life expectancy of an operable appliance should be more than two years, especially with intermittent use. Given the short span of use and with Cusinart's response, I certainly won't buy another Cusinart breadmaker and will reconsider purchasing Cusinart's products, especially if the company is not willing to stand behind its quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great, long time machine","review":"I have had this machine for 13 months -- yes just past the warranty. I make bread at least once a week. For the first year it worked ok. No major problems to speak of. I always set the crust on light and it came out just shy of dark. The clips that hold the bread pan in were always the weak point of the machine though. They aren't designed very well. Sometimes when the bread was done it was very hard to get the pan out. It was too hot to mess with much and didn't want to let go. Now it appears that the clips will no longer hold the pan in. As the bread is kneading the pan keeps jumping out of the clips and making the most outrageous noise. I fear I am going to have to buy yet another bread machine. Probably will go with a Zojirushi -- definitely not another Cuisinart."},{"rating":"1","title":"breadman","review":"poor product---soon ---7days after use the control board stuck . the heat element is not adequate and I am disappointed .........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I bought this breadmaker based on the reviews here. Unfortunately, my experience with this machine has been a big disappointment. The loaves are consistently caved in, the bread texture is inconsistent, and the crust is thick and hard. And yes, I have consulted the troubleshooting guide, but nothing has helped. Also, the pan simply will not stay snapped in place. One reviewer, admitting that this is the only breadmaker he's ever had, said that this is a machine you cannot just set up and walk away from (somehow, this was suppose to be a plus). Unfortunately, he's right - when in the knead mode, I have to stand there and watch the pan so I can snap it back into place when it pops out. This happens several times over one loaf. For the trouble it is, I might as well just make it by hand. I don't like writing negative reviews, but I'm pretty annoyed by this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has worked pretty consistently so far","review":"My wife and I got this for our wedding shower, and have been thoroughly enjoying it. Tried out not just the recipes from the manual, but another cookbook my parents got me. Delicious, warm, fresh bread every time - never had any real problems so far. Sometimes the loaves don't rise quite as much as other times, but I think part of this may due to our measurements not being quite so exact. I would highly recommend the Norpro bread slicer w/ crumb catcher along with an electric knife that has a bread blade to get nice, even slices on this machine's bread."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sold on this breadmaker","review":"The Cuisnart CBK 200. I have not been able to make a light loaf of bread. All of the loaves turn out very dense. Even after closely following the instructions.

After googling reviews on this bread maker, I found out that numerous customers had the same faulty issue with the Cuisinart CBK-200 and had to return it. I guess I'm in the same boat. Too bad!

There is room for experimentation, though, too. There is a \\"beep\\" sound to let you know when to mix in other ingredients. The recipe book gives you SO many ideas, it's hard to imagine running out of bread to make.

We noticed right away this machine was so loud! Much louder than our old Hitachi bread machine. The bread is always inconsistent with this machine, too. The crust is incredibly thick and tough. We've been making our own bread for five years now, so we are experienced bread makers. We had to tweak and tweak our recipes to get them to turn out right, and even then we never knew what we'd get. We gave up ever finding a whole wheat recipe to work in this machine. The seal on the bottom of the pan gave out this week. Instead of just ordering a replacement pan, we're ditching this machine to find something better. It's definitely not worth the $200 price tag my mother-in-law paid."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am having trouble liking this bread maker!","review":"I agree with the negative review that is prominent on the page here. I have make 10 loaves at this point and not ONE has turned out correctly, or even tasty. I have made bread for many years and have had no problems with other machines or in doing so by hand. I wanted a bread maker to make the process simplified thus allowing me to have home made bread for my family more often. This machine has made me so frustrated and I just want to return it, which I am going to do tomorrow. I don't need to go into details, but suffice to say my loaves do not rise, do not cook properly and I saw a crow trying to lift a piece I threw in the backyard for the birds and he couldn't get it off the ground.

It has many choices and I like using the various sizes, 1 lb., 1 1/2 lb. or 2 lb. and light, medium or dark crust. And of course the 'dough only' cycle is great too and will be handy for pizza dough. It's quick and easy to operate, a breeze to clean, doesn't heat up the kitchen area, cools quickly, keeps it warm if that option is chosen. It has a delayed start.

It was a present for a family member who was SO disappointed! I had to send it back and got a Panasonic, since one of the reviewers did the same thing, and the Panasonic works fine.I don't know if I got a defective machine or if my stepdad just didn't do it right but after 4 loaves he'd had it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burned crust & noisy convection fan","review":"The first loaf I made in this machine was baked on the medium crust setting. The resulting crust was hard, thick, and burned. The second loaf I tried was baked on the light crust setting. The results were similar--hard, thick, and burned, although not quite as black as the medium setting. Another drawback to this machine is the convection fan which can be quite noisy.On the plus side, the kneading paddle operates at a relatively slow speed and doesn't throw flour all over the interior, especially when adding additional. The beeper feature for removing the paddle is a thoughtful touch. Not only do you not have a paddle imprint in the loaf, but the paddle is much easier to clean than when it bakes in the loaf. Though not essential, I also liked the side handles.Overall, this machine is unacceptable. Burned bread just doesn't fill the bill."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a very good machine","review":"This was my third bread machine in about 12 years.

I used the bread book that came with it and made the simple white 2# loaf. Two days later I tried to make bread again and it wouldnt work.

I was harsh with my rating because it was priced higher than others i was looking at and subsequently disappointed in this brand name.Since I wrote the previous review it's my belief that the only SERIOUS problem is the CONVECTION feature. If shutting off the convection fan was an option I think it wouldn't always burn the crust. I feel that the other complaints I had could be worked out by trial and error.

I give book a rating of five out of five stars, but I wouldn't recommend that children ages ten and under should read it because of the blood and gore."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exciting page-turner for the summer, or anytime!","review":"Alten has crafted a tale with all the elements of a summer page-turner. The characters are well-developed whether they are heroes or villains. What I liked most about them is that they are not stereotypical. The villain of the piece is one who provokes valuable questions in the reader's mind. It's these questions that sometimes challenge the heroes in the story to question their own motives. The book is also big on action. It uses bits of submarine tales, espionage, humor, and a touch of sci-fi to keep the reader hooked. There a are several twists which will keep you guessing right until the end, but don't look at the last page!!!All in all, I had fun reading this book and felt like I got my money's worth. We all work too hard to plunk down our money for a book that doesn't hold our interest. Goliath held me from page one. It's exciting, fun, and thought provoking. Buy the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT Clancy","review":"I wanted to read a book from Alten for a long time. I'm interested on sea adventures, and his books looked promising. I finally picked up Goliath. That wasn't a very good move. This was incredibly boring, to my credit I have to say that I finished the book, but it took a lot of effort. I can't believe people are comparing this to Clancy!. Two starts, just because maybe I picked up the wrong book by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've Got To Be Kiddin'","review":"This book was absolutely terrible. It is memorable as one the few books I've ever just thrown away without finishing. Preditable and absurd.Where do I get a refund?"},{"rating":"2","title":"great concept","review":"i liked this book. although the concept has probably been done before i applaud the aurthors imagination. you have a computer built to learn and grow who ultimately believes she is a supreme being. she was built in order to keep the peace and her ultimate solution for doing what she was programmed to do is shocking. very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cyborgs. Why did it have to be cyborgs?","review":"If there's one thing Steve Alten has, its range. He's able to constantly surprise in his books. Even to the point of making old, used plot twists seem new. As characters change alliances, it almost feels as though its the first time you've seen this happen in a book. Its hard to see what's coming next. Goliath is really an interesting book. Its filled with characters that are constantly changing, mutating, becoming something more than what they started out as. If I could make only one complaint about this book, it would be the amount of gore and gruesome imagery. But in fact, that's hardly a complaint at all. It helps to draw the reader into the story. It isn't often that a book has such a power to move me. Even if its moving me in an uncomfortable direction. I would suggest Goliath to those looking for a good action/adventure story with believable characters and a story that seems to keep evolving right along with the submarine's AI, Sorceress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leaves me breathless","review":"I don't believe the score of 5 stars is enough for Goliath. For me it deserves at least a 10. Never have I read such a thought provoking book which encompasses so much of what is happening in our world today. Although this may be sci-fi, after Sept 11 you realize that there are people in the world who will stop at nothing to get what they feel is right in their crazed,feeble minds.Steve Alten has written a masterpiece, one that grabs you in the first chapter and doesn't let you go until the last page is turned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Alten Masterpiece","review":"If 2001:A Space Odyssey and 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea are classics, then this book will definitely be one. Steve Alten writes a great story. He makes it seem very realistic. It's really interesting witnessing the computer's (Sorceress) evolution. I also enjoyed the interaction between Sorceress and Gunner Wolfe (one of the main characters). I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good thriller!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!!","review":"Other's have already posted plot summaries so I will skip that. The plot is not too far off target, but the characters are wooden and flat. Thrust into a life threatening situation, former lovers Rocky and Gunnar are allegedly working together to stop terrorists on board Goliath. Unfortunately, Rocky spends her time berating Gunnar for a past offense and preaching the American Way. Meanwhile, Gunnar is too wrapped up in the past, albeit violent and scarring, to appeal to this reader as a wounded hero. She is blinded by patriotism and he is burned out, struggling to get thru the day. The villian, Covah, is written sanctamonious rather than menacing.I've read Alten's other books and this one was boring boring boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steve Alten's Goliath is a thrilling adventure book!","review":"Steve Alten's Goliath is a fascinating story of terrorism and technology that keeps you reading from the first page to the last.A futuristic sub that has it's own mind is only on of the main characters that makes Goliath so enjoyable. The character of Gunnar Wolfe is very interesting and adds to the story.But the main character is the sub Goliath. A stealth submarine that has it's own brain that allows it to \\"think\\" and \\"learn\\" is down right frightening.Goliath also has the sub plot of a two halves of a failed marriage attempt forced back together to help stop a killing machine that they helped create. All in all this was a great read and I would highly recommend this book to all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Military Thriller","review":"This military thriller about a monster of the United State's own creation is a Science Fiction story with a few realistic scenarios. Alten keeps the pace fast while giving us the technology information needed. This isn't always easy to do in this type of novel, but the author masters it with great skill. This reader nearly sympathized with the villain, Simon Covah, for his initial goal seems like a good one on the surface. However, the reader is shown how easily good intentions can spin out of control when humans play with great power.Chrissy K. McVayAuthor of 'Souls of the North Wind'"},{"rating":"2","title":"a very very good action book","review":"This book about a person who wants violence to be gotten rid of in the world through threats of violence;; it is a very good book.

Nice faucet, but the sprayer broke off after 2 years and they don't carry the parts. I'm really disapointed because the design of this is perfect and I can't bring myself to buy another to have it break again. It would be different if the parts were available and I could fix it, but these days all these companies care about is the next new model and they don't bother supporting their junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality ---- broke twice","review":"I love the look of this faucet, I love the functionality of this faucet. I hate that in the 2 years I have owned this faucet, the pullout spray has broken twice. The problrm is a design flaw in the faucet head where you go from stream to spray. There is a plastic piece in there that breaks easily. Our home is not a high maintenance home, just 2 adults. It's not like the faucet was abused. The first time I had to track down the part and it cost me $129 to fix it. Now the piece isn't available, so i'm shopping for a new faucet. Don't Buy this faucet!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very readable translation!","review":"I find Msgr. Ronald Knox's translation of the old testament more readable than most translations, despite the \\"thee's\\" and \\"thou's\\" that are left over from the mid-20th century.(They were never a thing that bothered me anyway.) Knox immersed himself in older Greek, Latin and Hebrew translations,and made copious notes referring to these translations, as well as to any corrupt passages in them. This makes his translation (and notes) more helpful than any others I've read. I'm really pleased to have it, and am using it well."},{"rating":"1","title":"A political lecture","review":"Masculine armed soldiers with square jaws and jet-propelled ships invade a lush planet inhabited by dewy-eyed tadpole creatures who rely on green energy to get around.

The highlight of the movie is when afore-mention evil-whte military guys murder a (alien flying) whale.If you like having your children exposed to bigoted, nature-worshiping, anti-military propaganda disgusied as children's entertainment than you will love this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diamond in the rough","review":"This movie was great. It was the first 3-D movie I ever went and saw. Due to the horrible job done promoting this movie not many people even saw it. Which is fine because my friend and I had the whole theater to ourselves. A private screening at a public movie theater of one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Most people won't like this movie because it makes us humans out to be the bad guys. The movie was great. Animation for being made with the money it was made for is excellent. The message great. If you are one of the ones who didn't get to see this in theaters, which I'm sure most of you reading this are aside from a few scary moments which may disturb younger viewers this movie truly is a diamond in the rough."},{"rating":"2","title":"sleeper","review":"I vaguely remember seeing trailers for this film but never got to see movie!

The story was good and the action was great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"In the same league of Delgo ...but better !!","review":"I like all computer animated movies...especially the ones that are trying toslip by unnoticed. There were the days where a movie had to play at the theater to be worthy. But now there are so many...and the theatres reallycant acommodate them all. This year...first we had Dragon Hunters whichfared pretty good...then Delgo which was good enough to want to watch it again...and now we have Battle for Terra. The animation is great, the characters are voiced by lots of actors/actress that we know, and the story isvery interesting, kind of a invasion movie....but this time the humans arethe invaders. Yes its a keeper, and can/will be watched again soon.enjoy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was I watching the same move as the others who reviewed this story?","review":"The story \\"Battle for Terra\\" is not the animated film one would want their children to see.Mankind has destroyed Earth and two other planets in the solar system because of the desire for independents from each other.Now mankind is on a search for another planet to live on. The first contact with the Terrans is a sneak attack upon their world, a world that has found how to live with nature.A takeover on the rusting old spaceship by a U.S. style military is depicted as the bad guys. The hero in the story, a soldier who turns on and kills the military leaders who are hellbent on destroying the Terrans.It is my opinion that this very colorful animated film has no entertainment value, but an abundance of propaganda it does have."},{"rating":"2","title":"War of the Worlds","review":"My son, who is 13, loves this movie and calls it \\"war of the worlds: the alien's point of view\\". The story is well written and the message hits home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battle for Terra","review":"as expected, video arrived fine, product met expectations, but the video itself - awash with cliche isms - not one of Pixar's best - in fact, it's not even Pixar!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I waited a long time to purchase this film because it wasn't available here (USA) in Blu-Ray for a long time. I could have spent lots of money and got a German version, but I waited. And I am glad. This is a great family film. I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avatar might have taken some ideas from this.","review":"Now before I review the movie, I want to clarify that I don't think James Cameron actually stole ideas from this movie, but Avatar is basically Dances with Wolves and Battle for Terra rolled into one. As for this movie, it was a pleasant surprise. I rented it for my son, because he thought it looked cool. After watching it I realized this was an amazingly done movie with a lot of character and heart. My son said, \\"Wow, dad that was really sad.\\" And when I asked him if he liked it or not he said it was amazing, but just unlike any cartoon he had ever seen. In a way he is right. It was definitely more dramatic than most cartoons I've seen. I definitely recommend this movie to all sci-fi lovers, and who knows maybe anyone will appreciate the simple lesson that it teaches, one that resonates in such movies as Dances with Wolves and Avatar."},{"rating":"2","title":"DOES NOT DISSAPOINT","review":"THIS MOVIE HAS AN EXCELLENT STORY LINE AND IS ACTION PACKED AND VERY ENJOYABLE FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS ALIKE.

I had the unfortunate experience to watch this unbelievable awful film. If you are able to get past even the basic laws of physics then you are in for an hour and twenty minutes of pain. Clearly the films writers and director are deep down inside ashamed of themselves or really who they perceive the human race to be. The idea that someone would turn on their own kind because of a brief interaction with a alien race is disgusting.Their sad lack of writing, direction, and deep down self loathing, are what kill a movie with excellent animation and potential. the fact a studio released this movie after viewing it makes me sad and believe morons run the studio."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible & cheap animation","review":"Not worth your time or money, it's animation is on par with those bad CGI Saturday morning cartoons. Complex moving objects in every scene just highlight how poor the art direction was"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Little Movie that came out 2 years BEFORE Avatar did","review":"There seem to be some who think this movie copies Avatar. It is actually the other way around. This movie came out in 3D in theaters 2 years BEFORE Avatar did. It's certainly interesting to compare the two movies and see how the plot lines and main characters in Avatar bear an extremely close resemblance to the ones in this movie. You can decide for yourself which one is the real \\"knock off\\".This movie itself is a wonderful gem with a lot of heart and interesting story line as well as very good animation, action and battle scenes. At least in this case, the human's ruthlessness in trying to take over the planet and terraform it, in spite of the fact that this would result in the death of all the indigenous life forms including the intelligent and peace loving Terrans, is a simple matter of raw survival for what's left of the human race.Overall a very good movie and worth adding to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting take","review":"There's nothing all that new about the story itself. It's Avatar, and so many stories before that. The thing that makes this movie superior to the Miners vs. Blue Cats adventure is that there's a real believable motivation for the human characters. It's one thing to be rapacious going after natural resources - of course we would do that, because we do that now - but at some point, we would just cut our losses and go home. If the humans in Avatar didn't have that option, if there was no Earth left, then you'd have the much more complicated moral and ethical dilemma of this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"That tree has to go, and those little floaty things too.","review":"A heavy handed MESSAGE film set on high for indoctrination. Can't let the little tykes figure things out for themselves. Let's make it perfectly clear (didactic in the extreme): who are the bad guys and who are the good guys? Anyone? You there, in the back row.Personally, I found their approach to the subject matter more troubling than their sloppy sentiment. I like my cartoons a little less brutal, thank you. And why are the villains always the military? A little imagination in that regard would be greatly appreciated.Did I like anything about it? Well. It was pretty to look at. Dazzling in Blu-ray. But it was weird that the little tadpole aliens looked more \\"real\\" than the plastic looking humans.The little robot easily stole the movie.Not a keeper as I couldn't stand to watch it again...I barely made it through the first sitting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must See","review":"The reviews for this movie were glowing, so I decided to give it a try.

We should all take it to heart!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just brilliant","review":"I love this movie. It literally touched my soul. The animation is so beautiful. Characters are very interesting. Especially a gentle being~Molla and that human(main character).I disliked him at first,but liked at the end.And another human female in this film is quiet interesting character. She is like Molla in my opinion, just human. The ending was brilliant, but sad. Will not tell why. Watch it. I don't want to spoil anything. Some people in reviews claim that this film is boring. It wasn't for me. Not at all. I was fascinated by it. And even had some tears at the end. I hate the destructive nature of humans. But this is so true about us. I wish we were a peaceful race.Life would be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album, will be one of your favorites.","review":"This is a great album for fans of bossa nova, fans of Jobim, or music that puts you in a good mood and relaxes you.

The result is a spastic pop-malange that is more suggestive of North America, not South (-with the exceptions perhaps of the songs 'Tide' and 'Caribe'). If you are seeking more of that etherial, evocative, misty emotion feeling of Wave, you may be dissapointed with 'Tide'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Asian Health Secrets Review","review":"Letha Hadady's video Asian Health Secrets explains in an easy way how to balance the five elements in one's diet according to the Chinese principles of health..

I bought the Retro and was disappointed as soon as I got it out of the box. It felt cheaply made. I charged it up and gave it a try anyway. First I tried the pop-up trimmer on the back and quickly gave up on that because it was harder to do sideburns than with my older model. Then I got into a shave and within 5 minutes I was putting it aside and going back to my older shaver. The Retro wasn't digging in as well as my older model, which meant I'd be spending more time shaving.This has to be Panasonic's worst attempt at a razor. It's more like a toy for kids who are starting to sprout peach fuzz. I would value this at a $20 shaver, not the nearly $130 I paid for it.

Groundbreaking, innovative, hummable, danceable - though I admit I've seen Scottish dancefloors pause in confusion during the five-second-or-so pause in 'I Travel'. One thing this album wasn't, was singable. The lyrics are dense and sung in the voice Jim Kerr used before he wanted to only sell records - a deep, robot-with-a-defective-voice-box that heightens the impact of the music even while making little intelligible sense.

Some, like Piccirrilli, get almost interesting, but in the end, you wonder why you read them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great phone for home office or small business.","review":"I bought one of these for my home office a few months ago and liked it so much, I purchased three more for my business office. They work just fine. I especially like the separate headset jack button on the phone (no need to lift the handset). I use an inexpensive Panasonic KX-TCA60 headset (about $15) and it works perfectly. This phone is also available at Costco's website for $120 and can be returned for a full refund if you're not completely satisfied.I'd have given it five stars if it had a built-in answering machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works ok....except for the speakerphone","review":"I bought five of these for small business use. We like to use speakerphones a lot. Since sound does not typically pick up well from even a couple feet away I plan on sending them back once I find an alternative. Sometimes it does pick up ok, although faintly for the person on the other end of the line. Other times, then report that my voice is not only faint, but also cutting in and out.The speaker itself does not put out sounds in very good quality. You will turn up the volume trying to hear better and it will become distorted, like a cell phone speakerphone. So not recommended if you plan on using the speakerphone a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems with speaker phone","review":"We have had continuous problems with this phone. We bought the phone initially because we wanted a phone with a good speaker phone option. However, the speaker is giving us many problems. If we make a phone call using the speaker phone, the person on the other end does not hear our voice. We must pick up the handset before the other party can hear us. I wrote to Amazon and explained the problem and they immediately exchanged the phone for a new one. Unfortunately, the same thing is happening now with the new phone too. At first I thought this may have something to do with the phone service, so I called the phone service in - but they verified it is not the service. If you are buying this phone for the speaker phone, stay away!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Phone stops ringing","review":"I have a VOIP setup with voicepulse. This phone works great as long as I don't assign phone numbers to the presets. When I do it stops ringing after a few days. The lights flash indicating an incoming call and I can answer the phone if I notice the lights flashing but it doesn't ring. If I reset the phone to defaults, erasing all presets, then it works OK. I got a new one from AT&T and it does the same thing. I love the headset button to switch between speaker and headset. Let me know if you know a workaround."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, a Functional Product","review":"The AT&T 974 is a good small business phone. There are only two problems with it, and these appear to be common with all of the AT&T small business multi-line phones. (1) AT&T frequently introduces new models and discontinues the previous ones. Unfortunately, they do not make the intercom, and some other features, backwards-compatible. So, if you want to get the most from your system, you have to upgrade all the phones in the office. This model is discontinued, and it's replacement--I think it's the 1074--causes all sorts of problems with the 974s in the office (intercom, transfer, hold, for example). (2) When you're on a call, there should be an option to mute, or partially mute, the ringer on the other lines. It's distracting to have the phone ring at full volume when you're trying to talk to somebody else. You can press the \\"do not disturb\\" button, but if you forget to turn off \\"do not disturb\\" when you hang up, you'll miss subsequent calls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Features With Poor Reliability","review":"Two issues I had were:1. When connecting to a Vonage line, Caller ID did not work until after I completely powered down the phone, including removing the backup batteries.2. The headset volume was always too loud even when the volume was set to the minimum setting. I had to hold the phone away from my ear.The phone is full featured and seemed ideal for my small business, but it's going to get replaced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speakerphone Problem on 4 of these","review":"I have four ATT 974's. All the speakerphones cut in and out, making it impossible to have a conversation. Anyone looking to sit on conference calls will be disappointed. Other features are pretty good, but the speakerphone problem trumps the rest. I do not recommend this product, but good luck finding a decent one, I've tried many others with no satisfaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comments on hte phone","review":"The phones are pretty good but I am having a little problem with a gate phone which I connected to one of the lines"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun.","review":"My nephew loves it. These starwars transformer toys are all very cool. Be careful though--once you buy one, the receipient will definitely want a second sw transformer to play with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supergrass will never top this one.","review":"To begin things, I have heard that Supergrass denounced this album, saying that they should have had a proper producer and that the songs have too many 'sections.' But I think the sprawling qualities of the songs are what makes them so fantastic. 'Supergrass' sounds like an arena-prog rock masterpiece that knows no boundaries. All of the verse-chorus structures seem fresh and unpredictable. 'Beautiful People' and 'Faraway' are totally mesmerising. If you don't like it, you've got bad taste, plain and simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Big Let Down","review":"I bought this album in the stores the day it was released, and a week later Supergrass was to play in DC. I was excited for the show and excited for the album. After listening to it about 5-6 times, my fiance and I bagged on going to the show and haven't listened to the album since. It really let me down. \\"Moving\\" is an EXCELLENT song, exactly what I expected from the album and fooled me into thinking the rest was gonna be great. \\"Pumping on your stereo\\" is semi-tolerable, \\"Jesus came from outerspace\\" kinda sounds like something from the Rocky Horror Picture Show, and everything else is just a let down! They have officially LOST their edge. Give me \\"I SHOULD COCO\\" and \\"IN IT FOR THE MONEY\\" any day, but leave this one alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the old Supergrass?","review":"Man, I was really disappointed with this. And the funny thing is, a lot of (cruddy) critics are saying this album is so groundbreaking and crap, but it sucks! Supergrass is suddenly a trend, the \\"cool\\" thing to listen to, which sucks, because now they're cocky bastards. BUT getting back to the album- umm... well, I SHOULD COCO was unbelievable, and it's hard to tell that the same band did that album and this new self-titled one. I would definitely suggest getting I SHOULD COCO or IN IT FOR THE MONEY over this. I would suggest buying 10 copies of I SHOULD COCO over this. Give em away, it doesn't matter, just don't waste your money on \\"Supergrass\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dopey Grass","review":"This is a horrible CD. Money poured down the drain. I can't make up my mind what it is I hate the most about their CD:the music? the lyrics? everything? It's really unnerving, seriously. You can't relax to it, sing along, or anything else. It was making me really jittery, I had to turn it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Listen in London Did it for Me!","review":"Last August I was visiting London and brought along a radio to listen to the local music. They played a new release called \\"Moving\\" by Supergrass, a band I'd never heard of before. One listen was all it took for me! I wrote down the name of the song and band and finally bought the CD. It really surpised me to find that now, a year later, they were releasing pretty much the same CD in the U.S. and opening for Pearl Jam! Maybe I should be a record producer cause I knew they were talented from the get-go...anyway, the songs are all great and I agree with everybody else--these guys need the recognition they deserve! I dare you to stand still when you listen to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"British invasion continues","review":"What Oasis owes The Beatles, these guys owe the Rolling Stones. Their sound is very '70s, very guitar-driven, very accessable.\\"Moving\\" and \\"What Went Wrong (in Your Head)\\" have a disco beat that screams for leather knee-high boots, gold chains and nylon. \\"Beautiful People\\" takes the same beat and lays harder guitar over it without making the sound too heavy.The Rolling Stones are present in spirit in nearly every song, though the lead singer doesn't so much sound like Mick as feel like him.The laid-back \\"Mary\\" makes you wonder why the mellotron ever went away.A nice counter-balance in your CD changer for Travis, the other Brit pop band of the moment. Where Travis tends to the mellow, Supergrass begs to be turned up loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"yeh for supergrass","review":"From the very start this album hooks you with the first track MOVING. Rather than talk about the album song by song, which would far exceed the maximum of 1,000 words, I have decided post a picture. I figured that a picture is worth a thousand words and would save lots of time... Perfect!... I have just realized that you can't do that. If you could though, I would post a picture of a gold fish, or a golden retriever. Or perhaps a bar of gold, because that what this album is. GOLD! It is chalked full of tracks that you and your frieds can lesten to, or dance to, or pogo stick to. This is definitely some of thier best work. Thank you for reading my review, I hope it was very helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Rutter Requiem and Magnificat","review":"Lovely music for the Easter season. Beautiful choir, soloists and orchestra. The CD has been a good learning tool for a musical performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rutter's Magnificat","review":"I have been affiliated with the South Hills Chorale in Pittsburgh, PA, for many, many years. The first time we sang Rutter's Magnificat, a number of years ago, it was unavailable via CD in our local record stores (we wished to use it as a practice vehicle). The Chorale sang it this past Christmas (2009), and I was overjoyed to find it via Amazon, directed by Rutter, and sung by the Cambridge Singers. The piece is exciting, energetic, melodic, and incredibly beautiful, with a Spanish flavor. I enjoyed very much turning up the volume, absorbing the dynamics and energy, and practicing while listening to the CD. Rutter's music is inspirational, and this particular CD showcasing this particular piece of music is very well done. In my opinion, people who do not readily accept (or admit to) any sort of leaning toward classical music would be able to (indeed would be eager to) grasp this work with enthusiasm, joy, and understanding. Magical. Excellent CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous music","review":"This is a wonderfully nuanced & beautiful recording of this work. I don't understand why no one mentions the Lux Aeterna -- Donna Deam's rendering of the solo sounds purely angelic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing vocal performance","review":"Though the instrumental performance is adequate, I was quite disappointed with the choral performance in the requiem. The group's diction is not together, several of the soloists are weak, and the overall balance of choir and orchestra is not even."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice easy listening","review":"For people who are looking for nice easy listening, this is a CD that can be added to their collection. However, for those looking for a serious musical exploration of the themes of life and death, Rutter's Requiem falls far short of the standard set by previous composers. For the most part the music is too saccharine, inundated with cliches that remind the listener of Hollywood movie soundtracks. The Sanctus even sounds somewhat like Christmas music.In terms of the performance, the orchestra and choir do a very good job, and I applaud the choice of soloists -- very effective singing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A piece of beautiful mourning.","review":"It is haunting, yet beautiful. It fully portrays the agony of death and moans of aching hearts. By far Rutter's best work. The listener finds a bit of the composer's soul locked inside these pieces. A piece of a soul yearning to be released in the moaning of the cello and the wailing of the voices. Out of the Deep is a beautiful lament Psalm and was masterfully set to music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling Fine Treatment of Sacred Texts","review":"Rutter certainly stands consideration as one of finest choral composers of our time.Here his desire to take on Requiem and Magnificat are reverently approached with new settings not heard before. This is composer's considerable talent on display, performed admirably by Cambridge Singers and London Sinfonia.Not since Bach have we heard such delicate, powerful music surrounding and uplifting such sacred words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great work by a living master~","review":"I performed 'Magnificat' piece with mass festival choir a few years ago at Carnegie Hall under Mr. Rutter's baton.A wonderful piece. Hard not to get emotional and stay focused when the key changes happen at the end. 'Requiem' is very beautiful as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Requiem/Cambridge singers","review":"Beautiful music. I first heard this played on public radio and put a lot of effort into tracking down the recording. The music and performance are stunningly beautiful and parts of it move me to tears. The one big problem that detracts is the very inconsistent decibel level throughout that requires frequent adjustments of the volume control."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"this book is great for sociology and the theories that are in the sociological world. definitely a great book for class or for someone who is interested in sociology"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sociology: A Global Perspective","review":"the book was in great shape, didn't arrive as soon as I thought it would"},{"rating":"1","title":"a little more info next time.","review":"this was a free teachers addition.

Just when you become engrossed in the feeling...it's over and onto the next track.A lot of this music appears in the movie also, which is why I bought it.

The others who reviewed this soundtrack were negative towards \\"The parts with just scary sounds\\". Pay them no attention. To me, these parts are just as much music as the more melodic tracks. Perhaps even more. This is what sets the ambience and atmosphere for the entire game, and frankly, the only reason I'm not rating the soundtrack a full 5 stars, is because of the lack of ambient noises. This is some great stuff, but check out the soundtrack for the first game. play it in the dark, with your headphones set on max - it'll scare the wet stuff out of you..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Helpful!","review":"This book may be of limited use if you are planning a wedding and do not live in the Boston area. I do live in the Boston area, however, and bought this book hoping that it would provide a comprehensive list of reception sites. The list is anything but comprehensive. For example, there are about four hotels listed for Boston receptions. I looked at 12 in Boston alone!

Vysotsky's sings with love, anger, frustration... all around he sings and plays his guitar with heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat disappointing","review":"I was very intrigued by the almost Cyberpunk plot of the novel, done by a female author. Certain aspects of the plot were done quite well, and I would call them quite fresh, however the climax was not up to par, nor was I impressed with how the story unfolded toward the end. An interesting and quite short read, but not on my top 10 list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bore","review":"This is one of the most boring science fiction novels I have ever read. The story just kind of plods along. I may as well of stared at a wall for a few hours as to have read this.Avoid. It's overrated. Nebula award? Oh boy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Not Dig It","review":"This book was well-written enough that I didn't trip over my eyeballs or anything, but frankly I didn't see the point. Slumming rich gal works at a sewage plant, spots safety violations, and sleeps with her boss. This is entertainment? This is science fiction? Slow year for the Nebulas, I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh! Boring!","review":"I read so many good things but even if I had not, I would have been disappointed...it is slow, the characters are cold, there is no excitement in the first 100 pages (I did not finish- I had to grit my teeth to get that far)...it was dull dull dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"be warned","review":"i was very disappointed in the book, and amazed that it won a nebula. the science fiction aspects are minimal and mainly related to near-future waste management methods. the narrative borrows split-time techniques developed and far better utilized by many others. the story line is obsessed with graphic lesbian encounters. perhaps i was spoiled by having read 3 phillip k dick classics and gene wolfe's masterpiece \\"the fifth head of cereberus\\" before this, but this seems like a minor work of limited interest and a short shelf-life. spend your money and time elsewhere. be alerted: several aspects of the book are frankly explicit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow River","review":"This is my third book read by the author. I could not follow the book much at first and felt it was disappointing. From other books I have read by Nicole Griffin I have enjoyed the characters which was why I thought this book would be good. I found her latest works to be better. The author gets into details on describing scenes which at times are a bit too lengthy. I ended up skipping most of the book and reading the last chapter to see what happened. Very disappointing with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book.","review":"This book has romance, lesbian love scenes, and industrial espionage, but mostly its about sewage treatment. She describes a future when toxic metals and pesticides can be removed from wastewater by genetically manipulated bacteria. It was very interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"A fan of good writing should avoid this like the plague. The analogies used are some of the worst I have ever read, and the descriptions are often bizarre, misplaced and poorly planned, with the images invoked bearing little power or relevance. Examples include a river so black it is purple and images that open her mind \\"like a can opener,\\" calling up a truly mundane kitchen utensil. Comparing the character's mind to that of a crocadile leaves me nothing but confused. A good example of bad writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Half fantasy, half nightmare","review":"Finally, a novel that manages to entertain a cyberpunk audience while dealing with intense interpersonal relationships. It's a fast read despite being remarkably heavy at times... not a book for children or prudes.In some ways, the book is a cyberpunk fantasy. Living on the edge, working as an underground technologist, has a certain appeal. In other ways, the book is a nightmare of imprisonment, both physical and mental.Well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"The rich and the poor","review":"Slow River is a masterful exploration of the difference between the rich and the poor. The language is beautiful, the scenery is immersive, tangible and fragrant, and the characters are painted fully into life. I must compliment the author on her language skill, a quality so very rare in modern literature. Although there are quite a few lesbians in the novel, this is mostly irrelevant to the storyline, despite what other reviewers seem to think. The novel is not about sex, it's about character and self-discovery. It's about the contrast between patrician Lore and the poor people around her, like Spanner and Magyar; the contrast between their character and view of life, between their occupations and their goals, and between their moral codes. It's about why and how the rich stay rich and the poor stay poor, and why Lore couldn't stay in the gutter where she was cast, while Spanner couldn't leave it. If you like books that make you think, you should like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"hair products","review":"I have become a fan of Goldwell products!!!

I read the first chapter of this delightful little book in a diving collection and was instantly drawn to Cousteau's narrating style. Modest and touched with humor, he describes the creation of the aqualung (scuba) and his early exploits with it. Early photos of underwater creatures are amazing. My copy is from the late 1950s and I hold it carefully. It is a physical and figurative jewel to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"An influence","review":"I first read this book when I was about 15. I begged my mother to sign me up for a SCUBA class shortly after and I am still diving 25 years later. I have re-read it about 3 times since then and still keep a copy on my shelf. There is still something very captivating about the early days of diving and Cousteau's descriptions of the silent world. The explorers in his book indulged in a pioneering activity under the nose of the occupying Nazi regime and set in motion the evolution of underwater adventure that millions enjoy today.The Silent World is easy and enjoyable to read. Most of the photographs are hard to see compared with the vast amount of underwater shots available today. However, when you consider the time period these photos were taken combined with the daring of these early pioneers, you can't help but be impressed.This book produced an enjoyable influence on my life and I am sure it will on anyone willing to learn about the early history of underwater exploration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting book.","review":"This book is a wonderful read and a great reminder of how far we have come thanks to people like Jacques Cousteau."},{"rating":"1","title":"nudnick","review":"VERY MEDIOCRE AND TOO SENTIMENTAL.

The day the 1st part of the mini-series was starting. I bought the screen play at 11:30 AM and it was so good that I had read the entire book before the TV show started! I also thought it may be hard to read, because of the format, but it wasn't, it was another great one from Stephen. (A big, BIG, step up from the awfully drug out \\"Bag of Bones\\".) Glad to have the old Stephen back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great work by the master of horror","review":"The only reason I would not give this book 5 stars is the reason that someone else had brought up. Why didn't Linoge just go in and take the kid away instead of putting the townsfolk through all of that misery. This brings me to a couple of conclusions. One, a recurring theme in King's work of testing your faith against an evil most horrid. We have seen this theme in 'The Stand', 'Salem's Lot', and 'The Shining'. Which brings me to the other conclusion in that the ending (which most people hated), the people of that town got what they deserved. In taking the easier of the two roads out they lose the child. Where, if they had stood up to Linoge and put all of their faith together, things might have turned out different. I commend Mr. King on presenting a trying and extremely tough decision for people to ponder. What would you do in their place????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Suspenseful at first, then annoying.","review":"Does advertising sell? Yes, it does. I'll admit, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this. (Stephen King books and I are old friends.) But what started off as legendary Stephen King suspense turned to annoyance with Linoge's repetitive, \\"Give me what I want and I'll go away.\\" Ooh, spooky scary. It would've been OK, if Linoge said it that first time, and it also would've been all right if King left it alone with the first 3 murders, but no, it had to go on and on and on. \\"Give me what I want and I'll go away.\\" Even after the constable asked him what he wanted, Linoge chose silence. Well, he had his chance. I couldn't even finish Storm of the Century. Instead, I made up an ending in my head, that I probably would like better than the originally ending anyways."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pathetic salute to millenial exorcism of self-soul& King","review":"Millenium does it better-Frank Black.Without any high & mighty. I felt King addressing himself throughout -the battle within himself played out in a dreary TV \\"Movie of the Week\\". During interviews on such luminous programs as \\"ET\\" he slumped in his chair with fake WOW over the wonders of TV verses cinema- how \\"you really have the time to tell the story\\"-over six(6) hours in fact-My Gosh I've never seen so many ads!I'm sure it all boils down to just over two hours of actual screen time.I've enjoyed a few things he's done in the past -a spiritually positve book I once read in a time of...that's another & MY story. Storm of the Century was wagon-jumping incoherent,& deeply dissatsfying:evil triumps because humans are all a bunch of jerks & not even a decent therapist can \\"clean all wounds\\" (Ouch!)..I really hope a decent writer like King can re-evaluate his artistry & audience & remember the only true sin is letting yourself down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with what he wanted","review":"I appreciate the necessity of community-wide idiocy of Little Tall Island's citizens. Without that, there'd be no story. Lots of blood without gore is also a nice touch and a Stephen King movie hallmark. Art-blood, if you will. All through the story, the wind is howling and \\"blowing houses down.\\" We get the wolf motif the 1st night Linoge bears his fangs; then on night 2 we are told of Biblical Legion's invasion of the pigs ... on night 3 I waited for Linoge, faithful to the fairy-tale version, to finally tell people what he wanted them to give him so he could go away: THREE LITTLE PIGS.

First, for those that praised the book, thank you; I agree one hundred percent. For those who gave negative reviews based on the formatting of the text, remember this: everything comes in different packages. If the world consisted of constants, without deviating from the norm, wouldn't it be a really boring place to live. Accept the change, for this particular novel, or next time read the small print (perhaps you would have seen the disclaimer about the manuscript style format). Don't judge the book by the way the material was delivered but by the content within the delivery. My recommendation to you, negative reviewers, is to put the book down and watch the mini-series. Perhaps reading the manuscript style format is too taxing on your narrow minds."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked the book-especially the ending!!","review":"I really enjoyed the book. I've read all of King's books and really thought this style was refreshing. It read real fast, just like most of the novels and I found the ending to be VERY enjoyable.

If you, like me buy a book because Stephen King is the author; stop and look inside. This is a screenplay and is formatted as such-which makes it impossible to read as a novel. Took my copy back to store for a refund as soon as I realized what an arrogant thing he/they had done. I suppose there are those folks who would buy his grocery list,if he published it-I will no longer be one of those type.If you didn't see this on TV,wait for the video. Disgraceful to see a fellow Mainer go New Yorker"},{"rating":"2","title":"WE want to read a NOVELIZATION !","review":"I want to read a NOVELIZATION ! Because, Screenplay is not translated in Japan. But, this story is appears a NOVEL over the recent King's novels. I love this story very much !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed at little tall","review":"One of the worst most complicating movies that I have ever witnessed. All the big hype leading up to the third night was very disapointing. The ending made no sense what so ever.

This movie disapointed many fans and could of been played in one sitting."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is awful","review":"I'll have to agree with all of the other people who were disappointed with this book.

I may try to watch the movie though."},{"rating":"1","title":"WATCH OUT!","review":"THIS IS NOT A BOOK! This is a screenplay for the movie, nothing more.

He definetly is the BEST!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, boy...He goofed","review":"Let me start out by saying that I have every book ever written by Stephen King... I love the guy! His work is consistently tense, and scary! Except for this one. I don't know what happened, but Stevie goofed. This story disgusted me. The reason is say this is because he let the bad guy win! This would not be a problem, except for the reason the bad guy won. Those of you who have seen it know what I mean. I can think of a hundred more evil, and more likely ways to end this tale. This is not the best way this story could have ended. However, I DO have to give him snaps for thinking up a terrifying story basis... He has NEVER failed at that. Over all... I'd like to say that this in not a film or movie that I would ever want to experience again. I feel aweful for saying so, but it's the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a major disappointment!","review":"Warning! This is the screenplay of 'Storm of the Century' and reads like a play!

I guess I missed the fine print"},{"rating":"2","title":"Half read it but...","review":"I'm reading it right now and I find it an enthralling story, yes, Linoge is a creepy character and it just keeps you wondering. However I have one complain that infuriates me?. Why should Mike Anderson, being a talented man as he is, marry a woman so plainly stupid like Molly?. This character definetly repulses me from continue my reading. The overall is Ok, it's fast paced and creepy but this character IMHO damages the story. I only hope she dies before the end of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clive Barker is Better","review":"I've read many of Mr. King's books and I believe the reason they are so long is because he spends a great deal of time talking about trivial things such as the color of eyes, shape of eyes, length of hair, color of pants, etc. In this book Croatan is mentioned at least twice (and in the movie), but neither explains what a Croatan is! It's a werewolf! If you want true horror and excitement, try Clive Barker and I would suggest your first experience with Mr. Barker be \\"The Damnation Game\\". It's FANTASTIC!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef!","review":"Too many unanswered questions: who is the bad guy? why did he choose that island? why did he kill people? why did he have others kill themselves? where did he come from? he has immense powers - why didn't he just take one of the kids? why did he have to call the town meeting to \\"ask\\" for one of the kids?In other words, King put absolutely no thought into writing anything plausible - he was merely out for the shock value.

I was surprised, however, how good the movie and the screenplay actually were. After seeing the movie, I bought the book and could not put it down, even though I knew what was going to happen. It really grabs you, while you feel for the townspeople and decision they have to make. The ending is disturbing, which I suppose it what Stephen King is trying to accomplish.

While I wouldn't say this was a terrible novel, I also wouldn't say that it was in any way memorable. Because of the wonderful dramatization on the audio cassette, I passed an afternoon at work more pleasantly, being entertained by the acting skills of the readers. However, if I'd been merely reading a text version of this story, I wouldn't have finished it because the plot did not interest me enough to deserve my full attention. The characters are too typical of a mystery novel, the prose style unremarkable, and the ending not too exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"rather weak","review":"Normally I love these winners of the Richard Wilbur Award, but I found Krisak's book to be rather weak. Disappointing because Rhina Espaillat and her Powwow River Poets are usually quite good, but Krisak's poems left something to be desired. They didn't sizzle or pop, and quite frankly, I didn't find the technique all that great either (I think he needs to take a long look at his line breaks).

They could be really good, but their music was jumbled and garbaled. It seemed they wrote these songs quickly. The choruses aren't catchy like Mxpx or Slick Shoes.

The pictures are just great, her drawings, all her friends and family come to life. I could go on and on. I'm just so glad that I have it. I learned more about Eva Cassidy with the angelic voice.

If you don't have to read it, then DON'T! It will bore you to death."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent fact-based story on Queen Elizabeth I","review":"This was a hard book to put down! It is filled with interesting facts about the English monarchy. Christopher Hibbert does an excellent job giving the reader a feel for what life was like during the reign of Elizabeth I. After reading this book, I learned much about this very unusual woman and gained a better understanding of how her strength, intelligence, and cunning enabled her to command the respect and love of her people. Christopher Hibbert also reveals a very fascinating human side to a legendary, historical figure. I highly recommend this book to lovers of English history."},{"rating":"1","title":"A somewhat laborious book, with little insight to Elizabeth","review":"Perhaps I was expecting too much of this book when I began reading it; I had hoped that this work would provide an interesting and intimate portrait of Elizabeth, as well as a clear account of the contributions of her reign. However, the book did not succeed at doing either. The book provides some interesting events of the period, but too often keeps the reader at a distance from the Queen. Through cumbersome and lengthy sentences, and boring verbiage, the author loses the reader in the reader's attempt to maintain an interest in the life of Elizabeth I. Having finished the book, I reflected on what I had learned about Elizabeth and found that I had more questions about events that were discussed in the book, than I did before I read the author's account of those events.I highly recommend that any reader looking for a detailed and balanced account of Queen Elizabeth I look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"A somewhat tedious history of a wonderfully interesting life","review":"Mr. Hibbert's work includes many pertinent facts, but set down in a somewhat tedious and less than interesting manner. I felt this work did a fairly poor job of describing Elizabeth in context with her time, her problems, the intensity of the religious conflicts of the time, her youth, her relationship with Admiral Seymour, and many other important items. I feel Ms. Weir's work is more interesting, and better done."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy book on a fascinating subject...er, Queen.","review":"The Virgin Queen is a very readable, comprehensive \\"herstory\\" of Elizabeth I.

The book is huge, but it belabors very basic concepts, and is achingly slow - the first chapter has a 'what is a computer' section. I don't really find the CBT bit that much more useful than an ordinary book. It's mostly just pages of HTML viewed in a browser, with a little audio.

On Two CDs there are about 4 tracks that are good but the rest are boring. 90% of the tracks on the two CDs are repetitive grooves that have very little going for them and you quite simply loose interest with one track after two minutes waiting for something to happen and it ends up being 7 minutes of the same thing. You fast forward to the next track hoping to find something good and end up finding the same theme again and so on and so on. As I have said there are 4 tracks that are good but this CD's front Cover hails it as a Brilliant House Collection. It is far far from that and not worth the money"},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece!","review":"It's funny that I'm taking the time to pontificate on this album, because, as a middle-aged (43) man, my taste generally runs toward the postpunk era (think Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr, Pavement). However, I will always maintain a soft spot in my heart for the \\"new wave\\" bands who basically got the whole \\"alternative\\" thing started. Honestly, I played New Gold Dream non-stop for about 3 years straight (and still do).

A perfect example is the opening track \\"Someone, somewhere in Summertime\\". Just because a CD is labelled \\"Digitally remastered\\" doesnt mean you are necessarily getting a better product over the original CD. Often the remastered CD is just a volume higher so that when you put it on it might sound better because it is really loud. I'm just not convinced.

Their mother and grandmother set the pace for their race to fetching and often practical pieces of the past, and they're holding their own with personality and cheer. The book's style and wit make Alligators a fast, fun read, and for those of us of a certain age, the usually loving references are still relevant to our own idea of who we were and who we are.

I'm very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunk-a-Junk","review":"I loved this coffee maker when I first bought it two years ago. It's nice not having a carafe - coffee doesn't burn. After about a year the lights on the front of it stopped working. Shortly thereafter the auto-off option stopped working. This morning it wouldn't even turn on.

When I called cuisinart to discuss my situation, and mentioned that this is my 3rd dead \\"coffee-on-demand\\" and it seems to be a common problem, then insisted on me \\"focusing\\" on my current coffee maker.

Easy to clean, somewhat difficult to put water in the reservoir, and the dispenser needs to be a bit taller for a \\"to-go\\" cup to fit. That said, I recommended it to friends. Ironically, we all have the same problems---after 1-2 years of use it will leak from the reservoir and the dispenser will drip as well. It now seems to have developed an electrical short in the 2nd year of ownership. I think we're going for a Bunn but will surely miss the absence of a caraffe.

But, be prepared to purchase again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Water!","review":"This is an absolutely wonderful product and very beautiful.

I had one a few years back that was ideal and after it broke (and manufacturer no longer makes that model) I have struggled to replace it. The Cuisinart on-demand coffee maker is not the worst coffee pot, but certainly not the best. It is difficult to fill...and for $100 a coffee pot is should be VERY easy to work! The basket is too small so grounds are ALWAYS in the coffee (real nice when we have guests over and I serve coffee full of grounds). Also, I wish the coffee would stay hot longer than 2 hours.There are some nice features, including the removable tray (easy to clean) and the lever to dispense the coffee.Otherwise, move along - not worth the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware!","review":"Unbelievable! We have a lot of things we liked about the Cuisinart DCC-2000, but we just had our second unit fail on us. They averaged about 18 months before breaking per unit.

Cool, right? Not really; the \\"HALF PRICE\\" charge is $99 which is $22 more than Amazon charges for the unit new. I'm very disappointed with Cuisineart.

Well, sort of. The \\"auto on\\" and timer functions stopped working within a few months, but we simply lived with the inconvenience. Now, as so many others have reported, the \\"on/off\\" switch has simply stopped working rendering the machine totally inoperable.

I'll never buy cuisinart again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This stopped working after 7 months","review":"I purchase this coffee maker 7 months ago. When I went to use it this morning and it was completely dead. Some complete electrical malfunction. Called Cuisinart and was told they will not cover it under warranty because it was purchased from Big Lots even though I was told when I purchased it that the warranty was the same as if I purchased it anywhere else. Needless to say, I would not recommend this coffee maker. I expect a whole lot more that 7 months when I purcase something and I expect the company that manufactured it to stand by it. I will never purchase a Cuisinart product again. It was clear from talking to Cuisinart that they weren't surprised that it completely malfunctioned and I couldn't have been more unimpressed with a company. This is way too expensive a product to have such a poor lifespan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor customer service","review":"I really liked this machine initially. It did exactly what we wanted. The problem is it's longevity. Mine failed after a year and a half. It simply won't turn on. When I called customer service, they blatantly lied and said there were very few problems with this model. They continued by saying if I had not kept my receipt for the last year and a half they would do nothing. I wish that I had reviewed the commentary here before I purchased it. That being said, I will never purchase anything from cuisinart again. They have lost my business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible design","review":"This thing was designed by idiots! Coffee grinds splash up into everywhere their not supposed to go and the whole inside has to be cleaned after every use. The coffee reservoior has an openings at the bottom between the \\"double wall\\" which is a place you cannot get into to clean. After you use it for a few times these dried up coffee residue flakes come out when you wash it. God knows what stays up there that you will never be able to get out. I wouldn't be suprised if people get sick from disgusting residue that you can't get to in order to clean.

The coffee it brewed was so-so, and it didn't keep the coffee hot. But she kept it, and used it (I think to keep me from feeling bad). Then, it started leaking. Not water like some other reviewers' machines, but black coffee. A little bit at first, but then four cups of coffee on her butcherblock countertop. It's now stained. It still leaks large amounts occasionally, and the Cuisinart is being kept on another surface now. Whenever I see people looking at this machine in the store, I warn them about it.

First, the hole to pour the water in is very small (think silver dollar diameter). If you enjoy wiping up water spills this model is for you! Secondly, mine shut down within one year of service. After several calls to the service center I was eventually told to send it in for repair. The kicker was I was asked to pay for shipping both ways.(keep in mind less than one year old).

My DCC-2000 has now failed a third time, after another year of use. Unfortunately, Cuisinart only honors the limited warranty of their defective product to 3 years from the original purchase date, and will not replace it again.So this is a fine product, if you don't mind the cost and hassle of replacing it every year, up to 3 years.

There's an option for how long you want to keep the internal heater going from between 1 - 4 hours. Those that say the coffee goes cold after 2 hours didn't change it from it's default setting.... This makes by far the hottest drink I've had from a coffee machine.This more than lived up to my hopes.

The plastic tank holds the brew basket as well as the coffee and both are removable for cleaning. Full featured with LCD clock, auto start, and adjustable warming time. The most expensive coffee maker we have ever bought but it is well built and most importantly it makes great coffee.UPDATEHave to downgrade my rating to 1 star.

I really liked it a lot, my husband hated it. I think I just liked the way it looked more than anything. However for the $100 it cost I really would have thought it would have lasted a lot longer than 2 years. It says it's done brewing halfway through and you have to turn it off then back on about 5 times before it finishes making the whole pot. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because I did really like it when it was working properly"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks and stains counter top, stopped working","review":"Worked well for maybe 6 months then started leaking on my granite countertop and now does not turn on.

This is number 3 of this design/model for me ... yields an amazing cup/pot of coffee EVERY Time .. I Truly, love it!However, be prepared to replace it within 12 - 14 months (sometimes 6 months - even with regular filter replacement), as this design is notorious for Leaking.Cuisinart is aware, but frankly, uninterested.Purchasing the product thruough Amazon is a wise choice. They have an amazing interest in both their customer(s) satisfaction as well as product(s). I NEVER have/had a problem. [Sadly, Cuisinart is not so interested nor professional]That said, This particular design/Coffeemaker is a hands down - 'Run don't Walk' item in my book, albeit problematic upon leaking -If you truly demand an excellent cup of coffee ... grinding fresh beans at each use, you won't be disappointed. Even if you don't grind beans, it will produce an absolutely amazing pot of coffee for you at each use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good coffeemaker...","review":"So far so good.

The first just quit brewing after about 9 months or it would leak coffee from the resoivoir while brewing. This was not daily but periodic.Bought a 2nd. Worked great a little bit more than a year. Now, problem is the lever that dispenses the coffee from the resoivoir is clogged or something as it only dispenses at a very slow pace. Have cleaned numerous times to no avail and have used the vinegar etc.Not sure what I will do. I may buy the DC 3000.Anyone else have the problem with the lever dispensing very slowly?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great coffee... Just quits in a year.","review":"Second one of this model. 1st lasted about a year, no refund, just bought another just like it. Coffee is fantastic - tastes better than any maker I have used.

Will not buy another."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I knew how to get my money back.","review":"I was hoping to get the best cup of coffee and that's why I went to a Cuisinart.

I read reviews saying that it dies about after a year, and I can't believe that it did to me too. I made sure to decalcify it, get new filters, wash the basket thoroughly, etc. Then, a few days ago, it just won't turn on. When I decided to buy it, I did saw some refurbished units on sale at O.com but decided to get a new one instead. So, you might want to try a refurbished one in case it dies, then it won't cost too much on your end.When it did work, I like the timer and that it keeps coffee hot for some time, much better than a carafe system. The taste of coffee was okay. I just bought an aeropress to replace this, just tired of machines at the moment. The taste I get from the aeropress is much better than the cuisinart. The other thing that makes a big difference in taste is when I used a milk frother for my lattes.Anyway, just had to warn Amazon coffee maker shoppers that this machine might not last that long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Last Long","review":"I loved this coffee maker, and the fresh taste even 2 hours later. However, after 10 months, it needed replacing because the machine would no longer uptake all the water to brew, so I would have to turn it off, then on again, approximately 5-6 times to brew 8 cups of coffee. I have since read other issues with this, so if you're going to buy it, buy a new one, with a 3-year long warranty, rather than refurbished, with only a 30 day warranty. Even given how much I like this coffee pot, I will not be buying this kind or brand again, because for this much money, it should last longer than 10 months!"},{"rating":"2","title":"convenient, makes good coffee","review":"This is our second DCC-2000. The first lasted about 3 years before the electronic controls quit working. We like the fact that the coffee doesn't \\"cook\\" on the hotplate after it's brewed. We also like the method of dispensing, and the taste of the brew (we use 1 tablespoon per cup, plus one extra per batch...e.g. 9 Tbs for 8 cups). We keep it on the kitchen counter, and it's within reach of the faucet/hose, so filling the container with water is simple.I notice there are several changes in this (2010) model vs. the 2007 model: different electronic controls layout, different finish (the painted silvery surface is easier to clean than the stainless sheetmetal in 2007), the brewed coffee container formerly had a flapped spout & now it doesn't, and there is an improved method of catching condensation when you open the lid. AND THE PRICE IS ABOUT $30 LOWER!We'll just have to see if the electronics hold up for longer than 3 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great product with TERRIBLE reliability","review":"Third one I have owned just died, and like the other times I had not kept a receipt and they said it was manufactured more than 3 years ago so it was out of warranty.

My old Braun and Krups worked for years with no problems at all. Check out other reviews - there are known problems with this model that Cuisinart won't or can't fix.

You can't see from across the room if you have coffee left or not, you can't swing the pot to the table to fill up cups, and you do have to find a separate jug to fill it up with water (rather than using the carafe).

Obviously, there is a KNOWN defect and this product should be recalled and discontinued. Each time Cuisinart agrees to ship me a new one (if I pay the shipping) and also pay shipping to return my old one. WHat a bunch of baloney and guess what I've never once returned the old pot.

It was so young and taken too soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much money for its value","review":"Well, this coffee maker lasted about 2 years. Then it just died -- no warnings. It made decent coffee but not particularly better than the Mr Coffee coffee maker that I used before it (and am now using since this Cuisinart died). The carafe-less attribute was a mixed blessing -- travel mugs don't tend to fit under the dispenser so I had to get my coffee in a regular mug and use a funnel to get it into my travel mug. The best thing about the Cuisinart was the 4-hour shutoff feature. I suspect that it'll be a long time before I buy another Cuisinart coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"I have loved this machine, but it is now dead after less than three years. The coffee was good and it remained hot - a problem with drip machines we've had. Reading other reviews there is an apparent defect that Cuisinart knows about. I called customer service, but without a receipt they informed me based on my serial number my unit's warranty expired several months ago. They offered me a 20 percent discount on a new unit. I have request a supervisor get back to me and will see what happens, but sadly I do not feel we got our money's worth out of this unit and would caution others against buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!","review":"Worst piece of junk I've ever purchased!

Unfortunately, the switch went out after about 6 months of use. (6-8 cups of coffee per day) The other scary thing is that the coffeemaker would turn on, but the water wouldn't pump.

Now almost 2 months later I'm told it's still backordered and they have no idea when I will recieve it. Asked for a full refund, and after talking to 3 service reps was told they would issue a refund if I sent them a copy of the receipt. Refund will take 3-5 WEEKS! I asked what would I get quicker, a new unit or the refund and of course they have no idea. Don't buy this unless you're willing to deal with horrible customer service.

On top of that if and when it breaks good luck dealing with customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective - even warranteed replacement didn't last","review":"Great coffee - agreed. However Cuisinart has blown it on this model. After just over 12 months of great coffee it died. Had to spend $10 to get them to ship a warranteed replacement. Well, just over 12 more months and guess what... died again. Ok, we use it daily, but $30 coffee pots have lasted us 5+ years. They would not replace it - apparently the original lasted on the shelf long enough that the 3 year warranty had expired and thus poof.Try somebody besides Cuisinart for coffee makers - especially avoid this model at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coffee maker, overall","review":"I've had problems with it leaking, and no I do not pour water into the maker in the dark, but the trick I found is pouring it very slowly while kneeling on a bar stool at the precise angle. Of course the only place for the coffee maker in my kitchen, is on a counter that is higher then average kitchen counters, and I can't really see into the coffee maker without standing on my tippy toes. You have to get the water directly into the hole and if you miss, you have to realize it ASAP and empty the drip tray before that gets full, or grab a towel. But otherwise it works great and cleaning it is pretty simple. All the parts are removable, so I just take it apart wash each thing, put it back together and walah! magic clean coffee maker. Of course I forget to clean it until I realize the coffee no longer tastes like coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Potless Coffee Machine","review":"I love my new coffee machine.

Auto timer so my coffee is ready to drink the moment I awake. And auto shut off that I can control how long the coffee will keep heated before turning off. It also has a setting for when I am making less than 4 cups of coffee.I loved this coffee maker from the moment I was first exposed to it visiting my sister-in-law. And I am glad to be an owner. The cost is a little high, but worth it in style. It works well. Shipping was fast and way ahead of schedule. I would recommend this coffee maker to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"coffee maker","review":"As usual Cuisinart comes up with ingenious ways to facilitate life, this beauty makes great coffee and keeps it warm without becoming overcooked, the dispenser is a gem and avoids spills, BUT, if you want the most coffee out of this machine, make sure you get a water purifier, and invest in some of the charcoal water filters that are recommended by cuisine art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good coffee but bad design","review":"Just like so many others...it quit working consistently. Unplugging and replugging would reset it, most of the time, but... Anyway, I called today and, since the coffee maker is on backorder, they waived the shipping fee and, instead of having to ship them the coffee maker, all they want is the cord. Hopefully, the replacement will have been redesigned.Called again today, still on backorder. I was offered the 14-cup with a carafe as a replacement and I took it. Better than waiting forever...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low quality and Unreliable","review":"I have had this coffee make for just a couple years and I have had to have it replace under warrenty for the electornic controls that would just stop working.

Again, sent it in under warranty. Paid the $10 again and the cost of shipping it to Cuisinart. The third one just broke today after approximately 6 months. I give up! Even under warranty, I can't afford to keep paying the shipping costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"My problem with this unit is it's unreliability. I love the concept, and when it works - this thing is the best coffee maker I've ever owned. Unfortunately I've now gone through 2 of them. Each time they just stop working. I'm guessing it's electrical - either a switch, or something with the heater. It's too much of a pain to send it back to get serviced. I hoped my first one was a lemming, but my second one has just done the same thing. Googling I found this is a common issue. Shame - if they could solve that, this thing would be unbeatable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had high hopes for this coffeemaker. I was replacing a beloved Krups which finally died after 4 years of constant use. I don't like scorched coffee, so I wanted a thermal carafe. My husband doesn't like the slow pour typical of thermal carafes, so I thought this might be a great solution. It's not. It does pour quickly. However, the \\"thermal\\" coffee reservoir is useless. One can program the heat plate to stay on for up to four hours, and the coffee stays HOT and burned tasting. I have mine programmed to stay on for one hour and the coffee is too cool to drink after 90 minutes. This machine would be a reasonable choice for someone who wants a lot of coffee ready to serve quickly all at once, but it's not a good choice for someone like me who likes to drink their morning pot over a four hour morning. It's going back and I am going to get a more traditional thermal coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"They ain't what they used to be, don't buy it!","review":"I bought mine six months ago.

No flavour whatsoever, it's ok, but nothing to write home about...But this is not my main complaint, I would have kept the machine anyways, once I bought it... The problem is - 6 months into using and it died on me, or well, sort of. It has power, and the warming element at the bottom of the coffee reservoir is warm when power is applied, but the maker will not brew a fresh pot of coffee. Probably there's something wrong with the thermal fuse/device. Anyways, the product comes with a 3-year warranty, but do I want to get throuhg the hassle of replacing it only to get another one that might last me other 6 months?

They look great but they are so overpriced and are truly no better than a Mr. Coffee or a Hamilton Beach.

They either start leaking, or simply stop working. Sadly, I am now looking for something else. I am very disappointed in Cuisinart products, which used to always be high quality, but are now, just junk. No better than the cheapest model of any other kind you can buy at WalMart, maybe not even as good. Beautiful coffee maker, but a piece of junk.

Period. So we asked a friend who is a coffee lover what his coffee maker is, and he said...the DCC-1100 by Cuisinart! We bought it, and it makes great coffee. It is not as cool looking.

It is exactly the same as a coffee pot with a carafe! There is a hotplate inside that heats and scorches the coffee just like a coffeemaker with a carafe would! Cuisinart could have insulated the internal carafe, but they didn't. Double-walled means to plastic walls. This does zero to keep the coffee warm. Also, the water goes through so fast that you have to use a huge amount of coffee!!! I use 4 heaping double scoops to get 3 cups of strong coffee. I used three rounded double scoops in most other coffeemakers. I am giving away the $90 Cuisinart as I hate scorched and weak coffee.I also ordered, and sent back before using, theHamilton Beach 47665 BrewStation Plus 12-Cup Automatic Drip Coffeemakernone of these units actually have a real thermal carafe as I would think of the word 'thermal'.

I was tired of breaking coffee pots and this has been a great solution. The only warning I have is place it on a surface that can take some condensation. For some reason the steam gets trapped and then condenses on the counter (below the maker). We have ours on a tiled countertop, so its no big deal. But if your coffee maker is placed somewhere that water might ruin the surface, this might not be the one for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love my coffee maker","review":"Until I got this coffee maker my husband and I would always battle eachother about the coffee pots. I enjoy coffee my husband is an addict. He can never wait till the coffee is done brewing before he gets a cup. The \\"stop dripping when you remove the carafe\\" coffee makers are just a bunch of hooey. I would get coffee spilled on my counter all the time. Not a problem with this product. Plus it makes a great cup of coffee. The only thing I would change is the size of the opening you use to fill the pot with water. I do have a problem with spilling water on the outside of the pot. (especially at 5:00am.) Other than that, I wouldn't part with my coffeemaker. Whenever this one decides to go to coffee heaven I will DEFINATELY get another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks","review":"Perhaps I got a defective one, as I haven't seen a lot of comments on leaking here, but let me say this. I bought this yesterday at Bed, Bath and Beyond. Brought it home, started it up and saw a little water coming out on the bottom, where the grate thing is that you set your cup on. I thought it was just a bit of condensation or something. This morning? At least 1 cup's worth of water under the machine after I brewed coffee.As I said, perhaps mine is defective, but given the design, I'm worried this could happen again, so back it goes. I'm glad I didn't order it online this time; returns are easier this way.It did make good coffee, but the fact is, it looks to me like it would leak sooner or later anyway, so I'm not going to replace it with this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"DCC-2000 Coffee Station","review":"I bought this coffee maker because it used a tank instead of a caraffe - eliminating the possibility of dropping / breaking glass. The single cup dispense leaves the other coffee warm because it is surrounded with heat instead of being heated from the bottom and cooling as it rises in the caraffe. The bad thing is after light use .... the programable feature stopped working. Now, it it won't even brew coffee when it is turned on. I cannot believe I spent all this money on a coffee maker that only worked 18 months. I should have stayed with my old workhorse coffee maker.

I was so excited about the lack of a carafe and for several months, this coffee maker exceeded my expectations...until it quit working. Some days it worked, some days it didn't. Some days it took 2 hours to start a brew, some days it never started.I called Cuisinart support, who told me to use a vinegar/water solution because my problem was a clogged hole due to mineral build up. We went through a gallon of vinegar. It didn't help.They've not responded to me and we finally just went out and got a Mr. Coffee coffee maker for half the price because I can't go without my coffee.

I bought one of these coffeemakers (for over $100) but it stopped working after approximately one year. Since it stopped working, I have twice contacted customer service at the Cuisinart company but not had any response regarding my warranty. I wished I had spent more time reading reviews and knew that it had a history of failures before I purchased this coffeemaker. I would not have bought it knowing it would only work for a year. I bought it because I liked its clean design, because it is easy to clean and because I trusted the Cuisinart brand.

Prior to using this coffee maker we had tried other brands including caraff and auto dispenser. We prefered the auto dispenser as the coffee stays hot without the burned flavor. The other brands of auto dispenser dripped after use and made a mess we had to clean up daily. Although this coffeemake cost more, it is by far the best value for your dollar. No drippy mess!! Easy to fill and use and easy to clean. It also has adjustable strength, and auto on program. Love this product!!!!! and would highly recommend it to serious coffee drinkers.

Look around at reviews, this product is notoriously unreliable.OK, got an update. Went to the Keurig and we we only use it when we have company.

It died completely ten months after the first day of use, after making an average of a pot of coffee a day.This unit is large, hard to clean, and the stainless steel finish DOES show fingerprints or marks, so be prepared for lots of buffing and polishing.I have given up on electric coffeemakers and have purchased a French Press coffeepot, which serves my needs well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not working after only 3 months","review":"After only three months, the On/Off switch is defective, rendering the machine inoperable.

It's a very small office with not many coffee drinkers, so one was used 1-2 times a day, the other just once/day (and not every day). While they lasted they were great-- great features and made great coffee. The one getting the 'heavy' use lasted about a year before it just stopped working. The other one gave out a month later. I don't think it's asking too much for a coffee maker to last more than a year.

I say plunge because I've never paid more than $30.00 for a coffee machine before. WELL! I didn't have this for 18 months and it is acting up. One morning it makes coffee, the next morning NO coffee, and my morning coffee is very important to me. (You all know what I mean) I want to drop kick this crap into the garbage. And I took good care of it. I did the vinegar clean out, and brought the carbon filters. Washed it each time, etc. I will never buy another one of their high priced products again. Oh and my husband brought a different model of theirs for our apt. in NY. It's the one with the thermal carafe and that crap DOES NOT keep the coffee hot as they claim. It's back to Hamilton Beach for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The design flaws drive me crazy on a daily basis.","review":"The only reason and point of using an automatic electric coffee pot is for convenience and ease. This is not the coffee pot for you.I have never had an automatic coffee maker with equipment so cumbersome to wash and clean and messy to deal with.The ridiculously tiny opening to the water reservoir makes it impossible to pour water inot, and always spill water all over the counter, even when using a spouted measuring cup to pour the water.DO NOT leave the pot on for more then 30 minutes, BURNT tasting plastic flavor coffee.

With the first one, the program brewing stopped working, and the second one would only work when it felt like it, both after about 10 months of use. When you go to fill the resevoir, water spills everywhere, no matter how hard you try not to, so we kept a rag by the coffee maker at all times. The brewing temperature and storage temperature were just a little too cool for me. You can't fit a travel mug under the dispenser, and it dispenses rather slowly. The display is practically unreadable in low light ( I would keep a flashlight right next to it ). If your looking for a coffee maker just like this, but perfect in every way, look at the Hamilton Beach 12 cup programmable brew station, and read my review.

I checked it out thoroughly to see if I had done something wrong, but I hadn't.Is there a company in the world today that cares about quality anymore? I think Cuisinart should pay me for the time I've wasted trying out their defective products. Their quality control staff are obviously asleep at the wheel and if they don't wake up soon, the competition's going to take over.Anyway, I'm moving on and will NEVER buy another Cuisinart product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was the best ever, until it died!","review":"Love, love, loved it until it died.

We have not been married for three years, the length of the warranty. I guess if anyone gets a Cuisinart product for a gift (even if there is a known defect), they are out of luck.The representative was condescending and sarcastic, so I asked to be transferred to a supervisor. She was more professional, but not very helpful. I told her that we were newly married and still need to buy many more kitchen accessories. I would be inclined to do so if I could depend on the customer service. She didn't seem to care about keeping a customer. I guess return customers are not a concern for them.

For $99, and from a name brand like Cuisinart, this should not be happening. It's a great design but with this issue it's just a shiny metal cube and not a coffee maker.That's great that Cuisinart will replace it, but why would I want to spend $20 in shipping (and how much on buying coffee at a store until the replacement arrives) just to get the same model with the same problem.

I would have to say to all those folks who are having problems to be sure you are using it properly. People are complaining of water dripping down the back because of filling issues. Use the water hose from your sink. The water that comes down the back, 99% of the time is from the condensation after the pot has brewed. The simple fix for that is to tap the top a couple of times before you open it. I brew about 3 pots a day with mine and have never had one problem. However, I understand like all electronics there are going to be some some duds. I am sorry for those who have received one. But overall for the price the design and the flavor that comes out of this machine, I don't mine buying a new one every 3-5 years.

The coffeemaker leaks when you fill it regardless of how careful you pour (even with a funnel) and the spout drip leaks constantly, which makes a mess in the morning you do not need. It is a beautiful design but Cuisinart needs to fix the design functionality. This product's quality is not in the same category as their other coffeemakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still crying over spilled coffee","review":"I used to be in heaven every morning when this machine made delicious coffee before I even awoke. Perfect cups of java available alll morning! Alas, my joy only lasted just shy of one year, when I woke up to coffee all over my countertop and floor. And no matter how I treated my (ex-)love, the leaking would not stop. So, I feel used and abused. To fall in love so deeply, and then to so abruptly end our relationship without any warning... I wish I had never met this cuisinart coffee-on-demand. My heart is broken over spilled coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY !!!!! will quit working with no recourse","review":"Cuisinart Coffee-On-Demand Coffee MakerDo not buy this coffee maker.

Not what i'd expect for something that didn't get harsh use, nor even daily use. I called and spoke with their customer service people who told me 'too bad' it's outside of the warranty, thus there's nothing we can, or will do.Rant: Stop making crap, that lasts a few months outside of the warranty. This is why people have the 'throw it away' mentality these days. Yes, it's just a coffee maker, but for $100, it should at least last 5 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke in 1 year","review":"it broke in one year. tried to send it back and they said since this is my 2nd one i am out of warranty. they said they had no idea what the problem is and this issue is unique and nothing has been reported as a known issue. I had the same problem as the 525 other issues that have been report from all of us. the thing just stops working. Does not brew and the does not turn on. oh one other point. The support person said i should de-calcium the unit by putting in 6 cups of white vinegar to 6 cups of water. this will fix the problem. its like telling me the reason why the car won't start is due to the tire pressurePiece of Crap if you asked me but if you want a coffee maker that does not have a caraffe this seems like your only choice"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pretty and Expensive Piece of Junk","review":"So, how long did it last? Only eight months. Unfortunately, I read the negative reviews here AFTER I bought it. I started using the paper towel trick to stop the leaking down the back of the machine right away; I kept it clean; I bought the expensive extra filters; I used filtered water. But yesterday, when I turned it on, nada. After about an hour it finally kicked in. It did the same thing today, so I'm junking it. I suppose I could try programming it to start an hour before I get up--but how long will it last like that? Considering the negative experiences reported by people who have tried to get the manufacturer to make good on the warranty, I don't think it will be worth the hassle.It was pretty cool at first--great tasting coffee, and I liked the dispenser idea. But, ultimately, this coffeemaker is a waste of money. Shame on Cuisinart for not making a better product. They are obviously relying on their name to sell a substandard product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuisinart DCC-2000 On Demand","review":"When it works, I have found this product to be a very good unit. However, my SECOND DCC-2000 just failed. I had assumed (yes, I know, key mistake) that the first was a fluke. However a little research on this site turned up information on a basic design flaw with the unit. It appears that condensation that gathers on the lid of the unit can run down to the electronic control circuitry and cause a short that eventually causes the unit to fail. Both of my coffee makers failed after about 8-12 months. The unit is too expensive to be a throw away item after a year of service. When working, this is an excellent maker. The coffee is very hot, and stays hot for over 2 hours without burning. It has a large capacity tank, and makes a good tasting cup of coffee..... when it actually works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greta coffee","review":"I've had this coffee maker for about two years. It is a little clumsy to set up coffee to be brewed (the loss of one star), but well worth it if you drink as much coffee as I do. Once it is set up, it has clean, neat dispensing.

Although it appeared to brew just fine, it suddenly quit working. I returned it to the manufacturer, who replaced it with another one. It stopped working within 3 months. If that's not bad enough, the dumb thing leaks all over the counter. For the price of this machine, I expect much better performance. I just ordered an electric percolator from Amazon and wish I had done so before buying this inferior machine.

However, the unit I got is defective as it only works about half of the time. The so-called warranty will cost you at least $25.00, every time something goes wrong with it. Cusinart will ship you a replacement for a fee of $10:00 for their efforts and you must deal with the return packaging and cover postal costs and insurance to send back the defective unit. There are no local service places you can take it to get fixed at.I don't know how often these units go bad, but I have a hunch that its pretty often. That must be why you have to pay shipping or they'd go broke.

Like everyone in the other reviews of the DCC-2000, I loved the look of the machine, but after only a few uses of each of them, the coffee started to taste rank. I'm so surprised so many other customers got good tasting coffee out of their brewers. It seems as if old grinds get trapped somewhere and the coffee tastes burned. I even took one of the coffee makers completely apart -- screws and all -- to try to figure out where the old grinds and foul taste were coming from. I found no clues and now one of my machines is ready to be tossed in the municipal landfill."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE reliability!","review":"Love the concept, makes great coffee when it works but has serious reliability issues.

After 4, maybe 5 months max, the machine completely ceased functioning - for no apparent reason. We have not followed up to have it replaced. And it's not that I don't think they will replace it. The real problem is: I don't want another one. I know it will just break again. After this machine kicked the bucket, I retrieved an old Braun coffee maker I had saved from college (thank god).

I got to the point where I had to put in five cups of water for four cups of coffee or I'd end up with half a cup of coffee for my second cup. Also I had to put a piece of plastic under it to hold the water that accumulated under it. Six months later and the replacement has refused to turn on.

Like other people have pointed out, when you open the lid, water pours out of the back onto the counter from all the built up condensation.Cuisinart is suppose to be associated with high quality appliances, but not in my opinion. You would be better off spending half the money for a Mr. Coffee. Cuisinart stands behind their products and promptly replaces the coffee maker, but my gosh, why would they keep making this thing and replacing defective ones with another one which is just as likely to fail in a couple of months? It's just plain stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful machine... while it works","review":"Mine last a year and a half. Now is completely dead.

Many who have felt my disappointment are probably saying to themselves, \\"Hey, I would have loved to get 14 months out of this piece of junk\\" given some of the shorter life spans I've seen.To be fair I think it makes very good coffee. All machines take some trial and error to find the right amount of coffee to use for your taste. So, as far as making coffee it does this well. As far as keeping it warm it does that well too. That is until the burner goes out. While it will still brew, it no longer keeps it warm.

As with anything there are going to be pluses and minuses but we've always felt the positives outweighed the negatives. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because from the get go, we couldn't figure out why the designers wouldn't have made it taller so you could put a travel mug under the spout. A large coffee mug is about all that will fit, nothing bigger. We got used to filling a regular mug and then transferring the coffee to our travel mugs..but it was definitely a design flaw in our eyes.

After a cup or two, she puts the rest in a travel mug and she's off. We both like really good coffee and this does a great job for us. The design of the DCC-2000 is about perfect. You can clean it in a snap. All the parts touching the coffee come out easily. You can use the gold mesh filter or paper ones. But the most important thing is the taste.

I thought I may have over-filled the machine, but the water level only read 10 cups (out of 12). I found that whenever I put ANY water, even 4 cups, it leaks right out the bottom. Also, there is a slit in the back on the top that the water will splush out if you move the machine the least little bit. THEN, there's the filling-your-cup part. If you like big mugs like we do, then you will have no idea how full your cup is when it's under the spout. There is no light, you can't see the coffee coming out, and it's complete guesswork. Also, I use a travel mug every morning, and it doesn't fit underneath, so I have to get a short mug, fill it, then pour that into my travel mug over & over until it's full.

You have to take the grid catcher out.Now, for the title of my review. After one year, the electronics started going off. I have to unplug it and plug it back in to turn it on.

If I could, I would rate it less than zero stars. The coffee maker worked for exactly ten days. During those ten days, it brewed excellent, exceptionally hot coffee. On the eleventh day, however, we found water everywhere (on counter and dripping down the cabinet); the little bit of coffee that had brewed was ice cold (with \\"On\\" button brightly burning).

Now that's not a warranty. It would never hold up in a court of law. They need to trash their design and start over. Stop buying their products so they will listen to us - the CONSUMER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a machine that I like...","review":"I have purchased many coffee makers over the last 20 or so years, found one that I liked the most and it was discontinued. I do not appreciate dribbling carafes that spill when you fill up the maker or spill on the counter when you try to fill your cup. I like auto timer and programming, coffee is ready when I get up, auto turn off, love hot coffee too. Well this station has all I need and want, to enjoy my coffee. The on/off switch doesn't seem like it will bite the dust (like the other station I had) either. They also put a water filter in it for me. You can't go wrong with this machine, worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoyed tremendously - at first","review":"Loved the concept of this coffeepot - found it easy to use and clean BUT had to return (2) models because they both leaked all over the place. The first leaked water; the replacement leaked coffee. Reading other reviews; it seems quality control may not be a frequent problem - but is a consistent theme...maybe you will be luckier than me! After the 2nd return I bought a Hamilton Beach with a similar set-up - it works great, is \\"tall\\" enough to handle a travel cup, offers hands free operation when filling your cup AND cost a whole lot less. My advice - skip this one and buy the Hamilton Beach!"},{"rating":"1","title":"coffeeless","review":"Bought it April 2006 broke down Feburary 2007, looks like I am going to need all three years of that warranty!UPDATE, contacted Cuisinart, they replaced the unit had to pay a $10.00 fee, and received a replacement.

Purdie, VK2TIP's Review","review":"I was more than somewhat fascinated upon my initial perusal of the book for review to find it is literally, Complete Plans, Step-by-Step Illustrated Details. Very little electronics involved as such, next to no soldering.For a robotics enthusiast here's a complete set of plans to create something your friends will envy. Your own butler named \\"Questor\\" by the author, David R. Shircliff.If you want to build a robot, don't want to become involved in heavy electronics, are adept at basic mechanical construction then I recommend you definitely consider buying a copy of \\"Build A Remote Controlled Robot\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really a 'Robot' at all","review":"The author's introduction goes into detail about the orgin and definition of the word 'Robot' and how it applies to this 'Showbot' project. However, the machine outlined in this book is not a robot in that it has no onboard sensing or decision circuitry at all. It is a remote controlled roving person shaped device complete with vacuum cleaner and beverage dispenser. If that's what your looking for this is a great book, but if you want to learn about robots capable of autonomous actions, look around some more - I recommend 'Programming Robot Controllers' or 'Building Robot Drive Trains' both from the Robot DNA series or even 'Robot Building for Beginners' as a better starting point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot Summer Nights Just Not Hot Enough","review":"With a title like Hot Summer Nights I expected some passionate, romantic summer fling instead I got just another boring romance between two boring people. Frankly, this books just didn't have enought passion for me. Although Quentin and Bobbi were likeable enough characters, there was nothing about them that made me want to root for them. In fact, Ms. Anderson spent a lot of time on the facts regarding prison life than she did on developing any passion and romance between the characters. Now I like my books Brenda Jackson and Rochelle Alers hot and this book had only one love scene and I almost missed it, it was so short and frankly dull. This book just does not deserve the word \\"Hot\\" in its title."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT WAY TO LEARN FIDDLE","review":"I bought both Volume I and volume II of Kenny Kosek's Learning Bluegrass Fiddle videos, which I believe are the same as the DVD's. I am planning to order the DVD's so that I can rewind more easily. I found Kenny Kosek to have a very good teaching method, is relaxed, and he keeps you interested. Practicing and being patient are important. That is why it is so nice to rewind what you just see and play it again. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to learn to play fiddle. He's an incredible musician."},{"rating":"1","title":"Artificial","review":"This book evokes wonderful images of the nature and culture of Brazil but the story it tells, of the instantaneous romance between a black slum dweller and a rich white girl is trite and unrealistic. Updike often tried to hard to show his knowledge about Brazil and its history while neglecting to move the story forward. A final effort at in-depth thought comes too late to redeem the many artificial qualities of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"just awful...","review":"i was hoping to be whisked away on a garcia marquez-type fantasy journey, but instead i got some simplistic and idealistic brasil from some old timer. blech."},{"rating":"2","title":"Updike Reads Updike on Brazil","review":"Updike reads his own inimitable prose in a story about two lovers in Brazil. Don't turn this one on with your kids in the car - it's full of explicit sex, but beautifully-written sex it certainly is. The story shows a panoramic view of modern Brazil, from its huge cities to its wild west. The two lovers make their way through this landscape in a sometimes-unbelievable fashion. But with Updike, believable or unbelievable doesn't really matter all that much."},{"rating":"2","title":"very colourful and intense","review":"I bought this novel after seeing it mentioned in colin channer's \\"waiting in vain\\" This was a very colourful novel and I loved the way updike stuck to the theme of love throughout thick and thin. Though I was thrown off or rather unimpressed by updike's fling with mysticysm, the irony of tristao end, and updike's boldness with sexuality is superb writing but I must say more than anything else updike's ability to research and colour a scene overshadows his raw writing skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rabbit sucks","review":"Never a big fan of the great WASP male writer that Updike is , or was, I am pleased to see that so many also thought this book was awful, on a number of levels. For me, just the hubris to call the book Brazil, as if it were the last word was offensive from the get-go. Then add all the Portuguese words in italics sprinkled through to give some authenticity ---please . . . Someone gave me this novel before I moved to Brazil in 1997. It is so far-fetched as to be insulting. The only good thing about this book is that it inspired me to write my own book, a memoir of a real country, with amazing people and a fascinating history, an incredibly vibrant culture and landscapes too fabulous to be invented. Updike was really the ugly American on this one. RIP, gringo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never takes off","review":"Perhaps Updike has read too many adulatory reviews of his work proclaming things like 'Updike is a master, he can do anything he wants'. He took a short trip to Brazil and wrote a novel about it. Unfortunately, this is a challenge too far for the granddaddy of American letters. His use of the Tristan and Isolde myth to create a tale of two young lovers: a lithe, poor street boy and a privileged girl is full of wistful cliches about glistening sand, Marxist politics and mahogany tight skins entwining in feral sex. Updike's Brazil fails to convince as his portraits of East Coast America do. The reality is far more complex and wilder than can be done justice by Updike's polished pen."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 Stars if I Could...","review":"As many of the other reviewers have already stated, this is a terrible book by a writer we have come to expect much more from. As I read through this novel, I felt myself hoping that I would hurry up and finish it, it was so awful. The story of Tristao and Isabel is unconvincing and comes across as a poor attempt to write a novel that many others have already done, much more successfully. The attempt to venture into magical realism is a complete and utter failure. The only strength of the novel lies with the depictions of poverty in Rio and at the mining camp the two lovers escape to. I dislike this novel so much that I wonder if I can write anything coherent about it. Suffice it to say that you should pass on this book and hope that Updike never attempts something like this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor and unconvincing","review":"Brazil tells the predictable story of Tristao and Isabel, the ill-fated lovers, and John Updike is an able writer with clean and polished prose. Unfortunately the book is full of quite a lot of nonsense, including some very poor dialogue, and combined with the hard-nose realistic style, the end result is rather frigid. But my chief complaint is this: When someone calls his book 'Brazil' it should be safe to assume that the author has something important and truthful to say about the country. Updike's Brazil is stale and stereotypical, and none of the characters are even remotely believable as Brazilians. He misses the most important point about Brazil althogether: Its people are warm, caring, both passionate and compassionate. None of this comes through. This book is really not worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am an Updike fan, but...","review":"This couple enjoys intense and non-stop love while being brutalized for years, but then they change skin color (he becomes white and she turns black) magically and the world becomes friendly and they prosper materially. But now he feels lost as a white person and walks out of the book in the last pages. The reversal of fates and feelings is based on racial identity...somehow this is thin gruel even for a fable. This novel is not recommended for first time Updike readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Get What You Pay For","review":"I purchased this because I figured it couldn't be TOO different fromNuFace Microcurrent Toner for Lifting and Toning the Faceother than the brand and price.

Approximately 2/3 of the time when the light was consistently on, I didn't feel ANY stimulation. And because most of the time I felt no stimulation at all, I would turn the intensity all the way up and it would be shocking because it would be immediate and not consistent--that in itself might actually damage the skin..definitely give uneven levels of \\"therapy\\".I gave the product the benefit of the doubt.

Like my title says, why bother?Okay, maybe you must really have to know about every obscure cult mystic from 1653, but hey, whatever you like. Just don't bore me telling me why I should know this stuff. Because I dont."},{"rating":"1","title":"James Randi- a man of faith","review":"After reading this book, I realized that Mr. Randi and many like him are as faith-based as the people they debunk, ignoring all evidence that fails to match the required result. Scientism and rationalism, in Mr. Randi's case anyway, are in fact deeply held, emotionally driven beliefs, like so much of what he rightly attacks.There's much out there in the way of easy targets for Mr. Randi's rationalism; I simply would prefer he also turn the \\"dogs of doubt\\" on themselves every now and again. He debunks everything except the religion of rationalism- his own sacred cow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"There is a lot of misinformation in this book. Many points he tries to make in this book are based on inaccuracies which does nothing to support his case. And although he does do a good job attempting to expose the hoaxes out there, someone that knows better wouldn't wonder if this book is not a hoax itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"An invaluable overview","review":"James Randi is one of the most respected writers giving a skeptical view of claims of the paranormal. In this book, he covers a huge range of topics and hence cannot do any in detail. But there's enough on each topic so you have a single reference where you can do a quick check and then go to more detailed books (like some of Randi's others) for the topics about which you want more. This knowledge needs to get out - or people will go on believing the pseudoscience because there is a lack of alternative explanations. I hope Randi keeps writing and making a noise around the world on this crucial topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply excellent, educative and funny","review":"Yes, some people get upset because Randi uses a sarcastic tone in his writing. But that is just part of the fun of reading his books. This Encyclopedia is an excellent book for starters in critical thinking. By explaining how crop circles are made, the secrets of Uri Geller, the Bermuda Triangle \\"phenomena\\" and other supernatural claims, you will be in touch with the information deprived from us by the media (just look how many times Fox-TV transmitted the \\"Alien autopsy\\", but they only transmitted once the program about how the hoax was made). Excellent reading. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting film but not the opera","review":"This happens to be one of my favorite operas--I have 9 DVDs of it--and this is an interesting adaptation in a very good restoration. But as one early critic said, in this version the opera has really been turned into a play with a few songs. Felsenstein has made a lively innovative film for its time (1970) but the opera itself is all but lost in the process (there is lots of added spoken dialogue). One-third to a half of the gorgeous music (in the latest longer restored versions of the score) is missing. The better dubbed film version is by Powell and Pressburger (1951, now in a superb Criterion Collection edition) but lovers of the music will need one of the filmed theatrical performances--and I personally would recommend the new, wildly untraditional Olivier Py sex-driven performance from Geneva (2008), although newcomers might want to start with something more down to earth like Domingo at Covent Garden (1981)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice juicer!","review":"I've had this juicer for the longest time and didn't use it because the first thing I used to make juice with it was celery and it was a real mess.

He is one of my favorite writers. \\"The Outlaw Trail\\" is no exception. It is the story of Sam Bass, a young boy who tried to go straight but fell into the wrong hands. He tells his story on his death bed. He died at the age of twenty seven. He was a Robin Hood type to many people. I would recommend this book to anyone who like western historical books. Jason Manning is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Olga does it again!","review":"This is a lovely, lovely bra. It supports, lifts, and minimizes, creating a flattering shape underneath clothing. The wide straps are gentle on the shoulders, leaving no ugly marks after long periods of wear. The back doesn't ride up, and the three hooks serve as a strong anchor. The plunging lace neckline is invisible even under a tight t-shirt, and dare I say it, looks pretty sexy.

You won't be disappointed with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst vietnam book","review":"I will just say that this is by far the worst book on vietnam which I have personally read. It isn't so much the content, although it does come across that the author was possibly over the top as far as being arrogant, but the poor writing style. He attempts to lead us through the history of the Bravo Company often times via long portions of quoted conversations which attempt to give the blow by blow of what is happening, but instead end up being long boring narratives which left me somewhat lost. Cut to the chase and let me know what actually happened. I would say this is a valid attempt to write a book on a exciting topic that just simply failed because the person writing it isn't an author himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one's a whiskey ...","review":"This was one of the worst books I have ever forced myself to complete (actually haven't completed the task yet). I am not surprised that most of the people referred to in the book would not allow Hemphill to use their names. He sounds like a nightmare in the jungle. His arrogant and pompous attitude came through loud and clear. I have friends who were in Vietnam; one whom was in the same area during Tet and none of them talk about their experience in this manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Bye Winter Blues!","review":"I was skeptical about all the claims that I had read, but decided to give it a shot. I've now been using it for a month for about 20-25 minutes per day right after I get up. It took a few days for it to really work, but I feel so much better! I sleep through the night, whereas before I would wake up at least two or three times a night. I don't feel like dying when I have to wake up, my overall mood is much more optimistic, I'm less anxious, and I have been exercising nearly everyday since I now have the energy too. Also, I used to drink coffee every morning to help me wake up, but I haven't had any in almost 4 weeks now because I'm wide awake by the time I leave for work. My husband has noticed a difference in my attitude also; he says I complain a lot less. This thing is amazing and I would recommend it to anyone who has similar winter difficulties to mine.

If you do decide to try this product, I would suggest putting only a little bit on one side of your face and see what happens.

If history is a holograph, then so is film because film is also composed of different layers of textuality. The surface texts of most films are constructed out of a limited number of conventional mass modes of discourse (plots), whereas the subtexts of films consist of a variety of sociohistorical discourse contests (themes) such as politics, social consciousness, revisionist history, moral messaging and existentialist themes. \\"(The \\"score\\" rating is an unfortunately ineradicable feature of the page.

It dates itself, but it is , to the quote the ad, TV WORTH WATCHING.This four disk set is all 26 episodes of the first season of ED. The neat extra features of this set is audio commentary on the first episode with Alan (Wilber) Young and Connie (Carol) Hines.

The songs on \\"Can't Buy a Thrill\\" are catchy, tuneful, and exquisitely played. Songs like \\"Midnight Cruiser\\" and \\"Dirty Work\\" have a sing-along feel that belies their underlying irony. This is the most \\"rocking\\" of all of Steely Dan's CDs and seems more influenced by early 70s rock and Rhythm and Blues than their later albums in which they would move in a jazzier direction. I especially like the female trio of Clydie King (who sang back-up for the Stones), Shirley Matthews, and Venetta Fields who lend vocal support on \\"Kings\\" and \\"Brooklyn (Owes the Charmer Under Me).\\" The ace guitar work is provided by Jeff Baxter (later of the Doobie Brothers) and Denny Dias who give the songs a dynamic edge. A great introduction to Steely Dan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Buy a Thrill","review":"Folks, DJ's are sampling/mixing \\"Do it Again\\" in 2007!

You have probably already heard the classic rock radio staples: \\"Reelin' in the Years\\", \\"Do It Again\\", and \\"Dirty Work\\".

And yes, all mixes need to be chilled for 8 to 24 hours, and 24 hrs. for the bowl. If you do not like the wait, don't buy one and just get your ice cream from the store. But personally I have NEVER had better ice cream , it is worth the wait. I have made all kinds, full of fat, less fat, sugared, and sugarfree,ice cream, gelto, sorbet,and have been great. And add my own fresh fruit,makes such a differance , I will never buy store ice cream again! Have you ever read the ice cream box ??

I keep the freezer bowl in the freezer all the time just in case I want to make some at the last minute. I find that it only takes about 20 mins to have the ice cream frozen and ready. Of course, you do have to follow the instructions which say to chill the mixture in the fridge for a while. If you don't, then it may take longer and not set up as hard. I usually make it ahead of dinner then when it's finished I put it into a container and put it in the freezer to serve for dessert. It does make some noise but not excessively. Still don't want to hear it while eating dinner. It's pretty easy to use and pretty easy to clean up afterwards. Love it.

I just got through making 2 different batches (peppermint and strawberry) for a church gathering.The ice cream comes out a little soft, but just stick it in the freezer for a couple hours, you've got delicious homemade ice cream with no mess involved making it.

As such there is much in it that calls to mind earlier works. To me the Tempest is reminiscent of A MidSummers Night Dream. The themes of separation, betrayal and forgiveness and restoration are prominent. It is relatively short but contains summation of themes that are found throughout Shakespeare's works.I have always enjoyed the Folger Library edition of the plays. The use of explanatory notes on the facing pages is incredibly helpful and allows the narrative to be followed with out the need to page back and forth when a phrase requires a quick refresher.

That makes it perfect for pulling up to the guys with the bass pulsating out their subwoofers and giving them something else loud to listen to. Disc 2 provides material that's easier to incorporate into worship and to give expression to God's immanence.

This is their third album after the Burdon years and it very well may be their best. Along with Mandrill, Funkadelic, Stevie Wonder, Curtis Mayfield, Tower Of Power and many others, War composed music that was in retrospect, the American creative counterpart of the lofty idealistic music of British progressive rockers like Yes and ELP.

Pointless for us. Perhaps as a mosquito net it might work. The added reaching through the opening made it very hard to get the baby out for feedings, so really, it was up for about 24 hours and we took it down and used the mobile over the changing table and the rest went into a closet, where it still sits today. Sigh. Just a gadget, not useful for us. LOVE the co-sleeper though! GREAT concept. Co-sleeping w/o bedsharing makes even grouchy pediatricians on the AAP happy. ;) Our babies still ended up in our bed most nights though, practicing Dr. James McKenna's Safer Bedsharing Guidelines...

Coltrane simply sat in as a backup horn during a few sessions in the late fall of 1957 for other recording artists. He takes solos, but only a few.

Frankly, Sharif's actions toward Bryna put him only a notch above his skank nephew who was Bryna's \\"master\\" in the first place. Sure, there are moments of sensuality, but when it came to romance, it just wasn't happening.Still, one has to give the author kudos for her research into the Arabian desert, the desert tribes, and Africa in the early-19th century.

If you are looking for a true look at the world of skating, look elsewhere. This book contains more information about Japanese manners, the Japanese mafia, and Japanese social structure than about skating. What is written about skating is terribly stereotyped and does nothing to change the image of the sport as hyper-competitive, filled with tormented athletes and coaches and people only engaged in the quest for the almighty $$$.

Even though it's for a small to medium room, I went for a bigger model because I do smoke a lot. Even after the first 1/2 hr of operation, I noticed a much improved air quality in the room. It's very quiet in low (hardly notice it), a little noisier on medium, and just a bit noisier on high. Compare that to a window unit a/c.

It's been running off and on now for several months and I just recently replaced the charcoal prefilter. And that filter was a mess. I couldn't believe the crap that the filter caught floating around in the air we breath. 'Though the prefilter was gray with grunge, the permafilter still looked fairly clean.

A primer rather than an in depth artistic analysis, it's geared towards the general reader and it does a fine job at that.Da Vinci's life is followed from his small town upbringing by a father who was a notary (in the European sense not the American) and hence held a status higher than the average peasant or townsman.Serge Bramly attempts some psychoanalysis of Da Vinci and if there is a main weakness to the book in my opinion it is that. His explanation of art workshops in the Renaissance era is interesting and informative. To be commended is his description of Da Vinci's relationships with his workers, friends and family. But best of all is Bramly's explanation of the relationships between the nobility who financed his projects and Da Vinci.An informative and enjoyable biography; Leonardo: The Artist and the Man is worth a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"We thought we had mice","review":"It is good quality, but the sounds are light sensitive and my son keeps misplacing the pieces.

He has since then stopped trying to place each piece in the puzzle and is not even amused by stepping on it any more. Overall, this toy lasted 3 days.

My mother has a noise making puzzle and she loves it. However, the other puzzle makes sounds by closing a circuit, not by light sensors. She has quickly learned that she doesn't have to do anything but smack at the puzzle tray to get the sounds to go off. Instead of teaching her how to do a puzzle and associate the sounds with the pictures she has just learned to beat on it. And, as other reviewers commented, because of the light sensors it can make random sounds all the time. As of now we still have all of the pieces, but when we lose one (which I'm sure will happen.) then we will have problems. It is already annoying that when I walk past the puzzle during the day, and cast a shadow on it I am going to hear a random noise. However, the sounds aren't too loud or annoying.

And as I mentioned in the title, this puzzle is LOUD so you can hear it throughout the house! Also, the kitten piece doesn't sound like a meow at all and the parakeets \\"squawk\\" sounds closer to fingernails running down a chalkboard.I'd be over it if this was one of his favorites. But our son doesn't favor this particular puzzle over any other.

When I take a sip, the tip of my nose gets squashed against the lid, and my nose is not at all large.As someone else mentioned, it has an interior lip around the upper edge and when you rinse it, water gets caught in there and dribbles back down when you set it upright, so there is always a puddle at the bottom. The only way to get it out is with a towel. The mug is narrow and it's hard to get your hand down in there. I am a woman and my hands are average size.The lid is hard to position, too.

I still use it, but it takes a ton of time, water, and effort to wash it, because the only way to remotely try to wash it is to force a jet of water under the rim space all the way around the opening, and hope it gets everything out. It's not my highest priority right now, since I only use it once or twice each week, but I'm not pleased with it at all. If they would just seal that space I would consider it an excellent cup.

I brew coffee in the morning and pour it into the mug on my way out the door. Here's the thing:I drive a motorcycle to work. I toss the mug full of coffee into a saddlebag and ride about 11 miles, accelerating, braking, leaning side to side, going over bumps and jolts. By the time I get to work, the mug has been tossed all around and is laying on its side, but not a single drop spilled. Of course, the first two times I did this, I put the mug in a ziploc bag to be safe. Both times, the mug and bag were dry as a bone, so I stopped bothering with the bag. The seal is THAT good.There have been complaints about how long it keeps drinks hot. Yeah, it's not all that long. Maybe an hour after I get to work, the coffee (if there's any left) is somewhere slightly above lukewarm. So I took off a star for that. Otherwise, no complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for me!.

I use these units ceiling mounted - a longer cord, with the power switch closer to the plug would make sense. I use them with a timer, so once they are set up (with an extension cord), you can pretty much forget about them.

Best of all, we're getting nutritious, consistant, easy meals and snacks and half the work is done for us.

I am a Hedgehog owner and I disagree with many of the handling tips - such as \\"always wear gloves\\" - that Mr. Kelsey-Wood recommends. An interesting note: all of the photos show hedgies being held without gloves. This book has a lot of glossy pictures that are not related to the text on the page. This confuses the reader who may be looking for an illustration of the text being read. It is not a very well organized book and should not be used by a novice Hedgehog owner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good pictures, bad info","review":"This book is totally inappropriate for anyone looking for how to properly care for a hedgehog. Pictures shown have no relation to the text. For example, a picture with a person holding a hedgehog with bare hands has a caption that says to always hold hedgehogs with a glove- which isn't a very good idea. It obviously wasn't edited very well- some parts are very redundant. Mr. Kelsey-wood obviously didn't put very much time into content- more effort went into photographs. The photographs, however, are great. If you want a book of hedgehog pictures, this is a good one. If you want a book with content on how to take care of hedgehogs, you should buy another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good photos, terrible information","review":"All of Kelsey-Woods' books have terrific photos, but poorly organized and often inaccurate information. Sections on hedgehog diet recommend foods that are high in fat, low in protein -- exactly the opposite of what a hedgehog needs. He also recommends the use of gloves while handling hedgehogs -- a true no-no if you ever expect your pet to bond with you. The habitats shown in the book are not large enough for an active hedgehog.This book is widely distributed, and I am sad every time I see it displayed in a bookstore. Hedgehogs all over the country are receiving sub-standard care because of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visually Stunning","review":"There are some really outstanding photographs in this book, but the scope is somewhat limited to Turkish belly dance. The wonderful photos and illustrations are accompanied by text that seems to indicate a single theme as the author's focus: sex. In my opinion, he's a little single-minded on the idea that belly dance is a sexy dance. Also, don't expect anything but Turkish dance to be discussed in any detail.If you are interested in history of this form of dance, skip this book. There are better ones. If you're interested more in the photos, you will not be disappointed (some of the costumes are quite inspiring!). I rate this book 5 stars for the photography, and its breadth. For the written part of this book, 2 stars. That averages to 3 1/2 stars, but I really love the photos and illustrations, which I feel outweighs the unsatisfactory writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Feast for the Eyes and Soul","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed recently reading \\"Oriental Belly Dance\\". It gave a great history of belly dance in Turkey and a very enlightening overview of the meaning of belly dance to the people of Turkey.

Belly dance is a celebration of womanhood and life! The photos of Turkish belly dancers new and old were a feast for the eyes! Great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"This is the perfect book for a belly dancer that is interested in the vintage and old world styles and looks.

I was hoping that this item would make it easier to floss between my back teeth, but had no such luck.I actually find it more difficult to floss in general using the Flosbrush compared to the old-fashioned method. I even went as far as to try wrapping the floss that I normally use around the head of the Flosbrush. This proved that the problem was with the actual Flosbrush and not the floss that they provided.I think the problem stems from the fact that when you normally floss you pull the floss down, between your teeth. With the Flosbrush you are *pushing* the floss down and this simply just doesn't work for me.Keep in mind that my teeth are packed in pretty tight, so if you never had braces or still have sufficient space between your teeth you may not have the same problem.

Decided on the Jet vs. Delta due to the positive reviews of the Jet, and having owned Jet/Powermatic tools.This jig is borderline crap.Borderline meaning I can probably get it to work after I speak with Jet this week to get parts that actually work. The quick release holding device doesn't work-period. Hoepfully Jet can get me the \\"non quick-release\\" device.Other issues such as the alignment fence does not go to 90 degrees due to poor design/oversized washers. But I can get that to work.The slignment of the jig to the saw blade is crude, to say the least.

The compositions are sumptious and make such good use of piano, strings, percussion, synthesizers and human voice in a wonderful harmonic fusion.

It may sound homely but this music really gets you on the train to work in the morning!

I am a semi-pro keyboard player, arranger, composer, and producer, and I have a few other melodicas. The problem with the red and green models is that the keys are sized such that they have spaces between them, which makes it quite a bit more difficult to achieve fluid fingering. The only reason I could imagine justifying the purchase of either of these models is if you happen to be a collector -- in which case you have quite a lot of superior models to look for before these!

But I have seen him live in New Orleans. After a smoking set, he shocked me and all in attendance by coming out for his encore without his guitar, and singing acapella, a spiritual hymnall, the Son House style. That element of surprise is heard on Gone To Hell. John achieves his own style on this recording while clearly influenced by some of the greats of the Delta Blues. He has a scaled back sound, with usually only drums and bass backing him, but occassionally keyboards too. The songs are not francy, but original. They have momentum. The only thing fancy is John's slide work which is done appropriately. Johns vocals are gritty, yet soulfull. I think Tom Waits fans would like this artist. I like John Mooney because he is a skilled original artist who honors his roots, and that is reflected in Gone To Hell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spidey through the eyes of his supporting cast!","review":"I've read a lot of Spiderman stories.

But life has stopped being good for Harmony, and nothing in her life - her career, her lovelife, and especially her daughter Pepper - is going right. But she's a trooper, and nothing gets her down for long.

Well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of Larry's Many Trashy 80's Novels !!!","review":"I have read many of McMurtry's works from the 80's and find them to be quite trashy and immoral and other such nonsense. However, why do I keep reading his second rate novels??? Because I love the way he writes. Sure his plots are thin and his characters are rarely upstanding in everyway (not to mention having the same characters with different names and the old ladies in his books always die of cancer, etc.) McMurtry wrote quite a few of these little ditties that take only hours to read...but worth it if you like words........"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whose Kidding Whom?","review":"By setting the price for this extremely short novel, that was written decades ago - $6.00 more than the paperback - Simon & Schuster makes it clear that they don't want you to buy the kindle edition.I suggest you give them what they want.$13.52 for the paperback is also highway robbery, so I suggest you pick it up second-hand.The Dessert Rose isn't in the same class as classics like Lonesome Dove, Terms of Endearment, etc. but it's still vintage McMurtry, e.g. The Last Picture Show, Texasville, Dwayne's Depressed...BTW while were on the subject of Larry McMurtry - who got an Oscar for the screenplay - I highly recommend Willie Nelson's classic: I Ain't Goin Down on Brokeback Mountain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book at the Right Price","review":"I enjoyed this book, mainly because of Larry McMurtry's talent for drawing characters.

It never becomes clear what demons Gilbert is wrestling with, she doesn't seem to really learn anything from her travels, and the big questions of life are barely even hinted at, much less seriously engaged. Having sugary Julia Roberts play Gilbert only makes all of this worse. And to top it off, the movie is drainingly boring, with even the scenery failing to generate interest. In short, the movie lacks both substance *and* style.I hope the book is better than the movie. More importantly, I hope the real Elizabeth Gilbert has more depth than the shallow character presented to us.Not recommended, not even to waste time ... on second thought, maybe this movie would work well as a sleep aid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrrrrrring","review":"This movie was one of the most long, drawn out, boring films I have every seen. 2 1/2 hours of my life wasted.

Heck I'd rather watch an Eric Roberts film (even Sharktopus is better than this) than sit through this again. The film's lame premise is a woman's voyage of discovery through different cultures that results in a revelation after she gets nailed by some Brazillian guy.

This film satisfied me largely in this aspect.Beautifully shot, with a soundtrack that is \\"sans faute\\".The film does not portray Liz as an idiotic waif who throws herself head on into the place wherever she goes.She appears to be detached from the situations involved.In the Indian ashram, she readily accepts with a large smile to do PR job, foregoing meditation.The scenes with the chaman in Bali is downright funny. The chaman's delivery of philoshopy is countered by humorous comments by his assistant which seems to confirm the mild charlatan aspect.The films does not take itself too seriously, despite the underlying heavy \\"searching for a sense in life\\" theme."},{"rating":"1","title":"How does this work?","review":"I love a film or book about an active, engaged woman, but Liz is no Scarlett.

What the heck was wrong with her first husband or James Franco or her lovely uptown loft? All middle-aged women looking for life's meaning should have it so hard. They should also have the money and the looks to travel the world, eat pizza, and run into Javier Bardem (without a cattle gun).

I was completely disappointed and bored. I was relieved when it was over. Even Julia Roberts couldn't improve on the shallowness of the characters. I completely agree with cinemagirl's review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with the movie","review":"I loved the book. It touched me deeply. I have read it, listened to the audio book (like 10 times), and bought many copies to give to friends. It was the story of a spiritual journey and a woman's search for survival, emotional health, and balance. It rang true and the characters were believable and real. (Especially Richard from Texas!) The book never touched on anything even vaguely resembling depth or spirituality. It was fluffy, disjointed, and an insult to the book. I so looked forward to seeing it and was SOOOOO disappointed in this pitiful, fragmented movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"badly done","review":"Okay, I didn't read the book, but whatever magically transformative life journey this Liz character truly experienced certainly does not come across in this film. Everything feels utterly staged, phony, and artificial. The acting is boring. The storyline is boring and the flow is painfully choppy (now we eat. now we pray. now we love). This directing is horrendous (did we really need all the closeups of Julia Roberts eating spaghetti? Okay, I get it. This is the \\"eat\\" part). I am glad to see I'm not alone for a change in bashing a bad film. Several scenes just made me wince at the insincere, artificial quality. The character does come off seeming a like a spoiled princess who thinks this weather-beaten old spirtitual advisor character can help transform her life. Sorry not buying it. Please please please! No more tedious, predictable, stale films like these. One star for James Franco for the eye candy value."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just wasted a 140 min...","review":"Waste of time, I knew I did not want to see this movie and I am glad I waited for the video so at least I did not waste my $$ too.Never had the desire to read this book, I think the Author is selfish and needs to get over her self.

When I looked at the packaging it was mis-printed and said the running time was 4hours and 46 minutes and it really did feel that long. To be fair, the first portion of the film that took place in Italy was okay, but the rest of it was dull as dirt. I am sure there are those who really enjoyed it, but I was not one. Sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly boring","review":"I'm a big fan of Julia Roberts and James Franco and am truly surprised that either of them would attach themselves to this schlock. The main character Liz is a self absorbed bitch. I kept thinking it has to get better. The ending is going to be great. But as predictable as any chick flick, she falls for \\"the guy\\" like that's the only salvation available. So much for finding yourself. It's an awful movie. And as it seems that's a common opinion. I only wish I would have asked more people before I wasted the 2+ hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eat Pray Love - Pass","review":"In short pass. I watched this drivel with my mother over the holidays thinking it would be a wonderful chic flick with beautiful travel cinematography. It was terribly boring, no great travel shots and a waste of our time. Neither my mother nor myself are fans of Julia Roberts but thought perhaps this movie might be fine because of the travel. I only paid $1 from the kiosk rental but still not worth it. Save your money and time - even if on sale. I agree with another reviewer the companions in Italy were the most interesting part of the movie but never really developed the characters. The reason for the main character's up and leaving husband - the hopping in/out of bed from husband to flaky actor to sensual Javier Bardem. I could not emphathize with the character. Too self absorbed and she brought the unhappiness upon herself. For a similar chic flick I'd rather watch Under the Tuscan Sun which had a nice ensemble of characters that were allowed to develop; not Eat Pray Love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just as bad as the book","review":"The only reason I watched this movie is because I thought it would be a time where the movie could exceed the book, as the book was so spectacularly awful. I couldn't have been more wrong. Same self-centered drivel, same narcissistic brooding, and the movie drags at the same god-awful pace of the book. A couple hours felt like 10. I had to take periodic breaks just to regroup and steel myself for the next 15 minutes, at which point I'd break again. It's just terrible. I should have just given up on it, but didn't want to waste my money, fatal mistake. I will never get those hours of my life back, and I loathe the producers for that. I have no idea how this book became such a phenomenon (well, yeah I do, thanks Oprah), and it's a pity that because of that, a terrible movie was made from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't even finish.","review":"Why, oh why, did so many ladies sing the praise of this book and movie? Do I really know that many stupid, dull women? This movie was so lacking in story depth, character (which I understand is what the character was lacking in the beginning, but still!). Sure, it was visually appealing - which is why I gave it 2 stars. If I'd stayed longer for the male rear nudity, maybe it would have gotten 3 stars but I doubt it. After 12 minutes in my daughter and I already wanted to turn it off. And just over and hour we couldn't take it anymore. I think maybe you had to have read the book first to have bonded with the main character. Alas, this movie was made without realizing that most of their audience did not read the book first and we were not going to simply love the movie because Julia Roberts was in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really slow and dull","review":"This movie was not at all what we expected.

I don't share Ms. Gilbert's outlook on life and found the movie to be self indulgent and self-pitying much like her book. The acting is good and the travel scenes are a visual feast. The time before and including her stay in Italy is the most interesting--after that it gets wacky. An intelligent, educated, wealthy woman seeks answers to life's questions from toothless sages in impoverished countries. Am I missing something here? I loved Viola Davis as Liz Gilbert's best friend. The beginning of the movie is interesting and draws you in--then it gets to be a slog--too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eat pray Love Review","review":"I came out of this movie and completely broke down. I realized for once that I was not the only one experiancing this. Afterall they made a movie about it. So I must not be alone. Secondly I had advice on how someone else overcame this. I want to purchase it and watch it over again, until I get it. The message is crucial to so many women and I would advise young women to learn from this. I cannot say enough good about this movie.

She was right and it helped my healing begin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very uplifting journey!","review":"I watched the movie and was so intrigued by it, I went and bought the book.

With so many actressess to pick from, i am sure another would have made this a decent movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh goody, let's make fun of Americans again...sigh","review":"I didn't hate it. I do find it difficult when American actors agree to dialogue that attempts to state American stereotypes as fact. Apparently the American idea of fun is to drink too much and then spend every evening in front of the idiot box...mmm, not terribly accurate. The story is uninteresting. It seems that Liz in incapable of being alone, period. She seems to have a bad habit of expecting others to fulfil her happiness, she doesn't seem to have the ability to do the work and find it on her own. Therefore, she inevitable ends up miserable and can't seem to figure out why. She is a moron. I will give credit to Roberts for allowing herself to be dumpy through almost the entire film. And she is no longer trying to NOT use her trademark laugh, which is nice. Overall, if I had the resources to do what she did, I would have spent my time more wisely."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"I haven't read the book, but i'm sure that it's very good...

But this movie was way too long and just too slow. They could have cut it a lot to make the story move along better. It almost felt painful to finish, but I had to get to the end. Not the worst movie I've seen, but very far from good. Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow; no value to real life.","review":"Oh please - what were they thinking?? Another little rich girl gets sympathy for not having everything she wants in life, and applauded for focusing solely on herself. Jumping from one man to another to fill her own emptiness - oh poor baby. If she could travel where she wanted, and eat what she wanted, and enjoy her money, that's fine; but to actually write a book and have a film about your boring self is another thing.No worries about job, money, responsibilities or obligations to others - no wonder she experienced ennui. Now she's even wealthier for publishing the nauseating drivel about her useless life, and we're expected to think of her as courageous and deep. No way.Oh, she leaves the men, but she's the one who's \\"heartbroken\\"??? I'm not saying she should have stayed with them if she didn't want to, but the entire story is so ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"A silly chick flick.

I kept watching hoping that it would get better, but it didn't. The whole thing left me with a very bad taste in my mouth. I hope that there are not a lot of Liz types out there.

It is merely one lustful scene after another. I've tried several times to make it past the first 10 minutes without success. I've skipped around in the movie trying to detect a reason why Julia Roberts would waste her time and mine with such trash. I have many of her movies and most are good to great.The only thing I can think of is that perhaps she was a bit restless in her own romantic affairs. It is clear to me why Garry Marshall declined to be the director. He is a wise person.At least it had one positive effect if I understand correctly. I read that she found and converted to Hinduism while filming this movie and I think that is a profound benefit for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eat Pray Love","review":"I enjoyed this movie, that is why I purchased it through Amazon.

I started working on my laptop during it, it was that bad! Julia Roberts' chararcter never gave me a reason to care about her, much less about her wanting to go on a year's self pity trip. The dialogue was excruciating to hear. I want a refund for 2 hours of my life I won't ever get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad adaptation of a good book","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the audio book narrated by Liz Gilbert, and I'm a Julia Roberts fan, so watching the movie seemed like a good idea. Unfortunately, this movie adaptation is really, really awful. I forced myself to watch up to the weeping Richard scene at the ashram. That was the final straw; totally out of character and not in the book. Do yourself a favor, read the book and forget the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome movie but terrible copies!","review":"The first dvd I received had problems with the picture. Pixels swarmed all over. I returned the copy for a replacement, no big deal.. but when I received my new copy it was doing the exact same thing! I would think these copies would be better tested before sent out especially on a second go around. Disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stared with horror at Robert's swollen upper lip the whole time","review":"The book was insipid. The movie was worse. And, I could not stop staring at Julia Robert's obviously injected upper lip the whole time.

This movie is equally as horrible as the book. If you're curious about the film, I would save your money and check it out from your local library.The main character is shallow and self-absorbed. The acting is horrible. In this film, Julia Roberts has only two expressions, the blank stare and the blank stare with a cheesy smile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eat, Pray, Yawn","review":"I still cannot believe how utterly boring this film was.

Poor script and surprisingly poor acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much There","review":"This is a silly trifle of a movie.

My title for this review says it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time","review":"Julia Roberts, best selling book, Italy, India, Bali..great combination?Not so much. The story is really weak. There are no great life moment revelations, nothing particulary especial aboout Julia Robert's character.No further exploration to all the other characters. You really dont get much more than you can see in the movie trailer, so save you some time, watch the trailer and look for something better two do with two hours of your time.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snore, Yawn, Fast-Forward","review":"This is one long slog of a dull and pretentious film featuring an equally pretentious, narcissistic twerp who dumps her husband for no good reason and goes on a soul-searching journey in three different countries. She prays a teeny bit, eats some stuff in Italy, talks to a spiritual guide in Bali, and spends an inordinate amount of time in an ashram in India. But so what? None of it amounts to much, and it's so dull that I could hardly stop yawning. I found myself not caring at all what happened to her or to anyone else in the story. I hit the FFWD button on my remote several times because I just wanted it to be over quickly.What a waste of the actors and the locations.Ryan Murphy did a great job with Nip/Tuck and Glee, but he simply cannot handle a feature film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Julie Roberts Movie, but not her fault","review":"Julie Roberts is a talented actress, and as such, she should have known better than to do this movie. I read the book, which was tolerable at times, and other times just the author going on completely self-centered, bipolar mania rants. The movie was far worse and far more dull. The main character's selfishness comes out more as well. By the title and plot of the movie, you would think the main character is out to find herself by losing herself in other cultures and finding solice in spirituality. But in reality, she is on a vojage to Neverland to escape her problems like a teenager fleeing impending responsibility. The movie portrays the irresponsible side even stronger, which makes the character completely unrelatable. All the parts of the book where the character somehow makes progress to \\"find herself\\" and has moments of spiritual progress have been cut out of the movie. This movie is rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Julia Hits Rock Bottom","review":"I'm not a prude, a chauvinist, or delusional, as my old reviews will prove. This book is irrelevant because 99.9% of men will never read it. A 45 year old in rapid succession: divorces against her husband's pleas, rushes into bed with a new guy whom she quickly hates Then she travels around the world, eating 10,000 calories a day without gaining an ounce, embraced by crowds of loving warm new friends, confided in and mentored by wise old men, and rushed into a 2 week sex marathon by a Brazilian stud with a heart of gold. Yes ladies, celebrate all your crazy decisions. A long string of male mentors and lovers will magically fix you."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE SCENERY IS NICE...","review":"OK, so the meaning of \\"Eat Pray Love\\" is to not work on your relationship (dumping your partner/spouse in the process so you can go \\"find yourself\\"), travel to Europe where fabulous people will automatically befriend you, meditate a lot but don't let go of the emotional baggage, do one nice thing for a less-fortunate, and snag yourself a hot rich guy with whom you have awesome sex. Wow, how shallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...........","review":"This has got to be one of the worse movies I have ever seen. Please don't let you wife or girlfriend talk you into seeing this. Take a pillow, you'll need it when you fall asleep. Very little story, very little plot. Very little anything worth watching. It will probably be nominated for ten Academy Awards."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star or less","review":"I've read some excellent spot-on 1-star reviews here of \\"Eat Pray Love\\" that I couldn't really improve upon. The shallow, self-centered Julia Roberts character certainly deserves all the vitriol and criticism thrown her way in these reviews and I'm happy to see many are women. The sad thing is, this type of self-entitled solipsistic person really does exist. Don't think so? For a dose of grim reality, just read some of the 5-star reviews in which Roberts' character is seen as inspiring. What a sad existence it must be which leads one to see this character as a role model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book, awful movie adaptation","review":"I loved reading the book. It brought me to places, ideas, tastes, smells and feelings of each experience Elizabeth encountered. It was nuanced with her challenges and internal struggles. I was really looking forward to an evening with this movie and a glass of wine.The movie was a great disappointment. Julia Roberts portrayed her character with very little depth and I actually never cared for Elizabeth. I found her whiny, needy and stupid. There was also zero chemistry between Elizabeth and Felipe.This was 2 hours of my life I will never get back. And I feel it soured me on the overall book experience also. ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined the book!","review":"I read the book and was surprised how much I liked it. Very honest and amazingly wise. Then I saw the movie. What a mistake Gilbert made to agree to it! It made her awakening experiences trivial, her honest emotions sentimental.

Julia Roberts still looks good in jeans even at her age, and that's where anything positive about this movie ends. A film about selfishness, self-indulgence and nothing else.

The book was really thick and full of information and I believe Ryan tried to summarize the book focusing only on the important things ( which I'm sure was not the easiest task ), so eventually the movie looked like couple of random scenes were glued together :D . however I enjoyed the movie it has good cast and great sceneries."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as the book","review":"For those of you who have read the book save your money.

Whether its New York, Italy, India, or Bali, everyone loves her more than she loves them, and she dumps them all. What a concept. Glad I rented it, I think JR should send me the buck back.If that's not enough, she makes sure after dumping her New York husband, who loves her deeply, but really shouldn't if he had any self-respect at all, she proceeds to get herself laid every which way but loose from some guy in Bali, after which she gets a bladder infection, which probably should have been Syphilis, Gonorrhea or worse.

I speak no Greek. The staying power of this album, for me, has given the idea that words get in the way of songs. If you speak the language, after you've heard a song a few times, you know it perfectly. If it's in a language you don't know, you never get it memorized. Nothing ever gets in the way of the feeling, the emotion. The sound of her voice communicates better than the words of the song. In fact, the words of the song diminish the communication. In other music of hers that I've heard, her voice is just beautiful; in this one, you hear her heart.You can hear samples of a few of the cuts from this album if you go over to her Passport album. Then come back and buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The very best!","review":"You like Nana Mouskouri? You've never heard her sing until you get your hands on this 2-CD album.

Searching for a book to read at the library last week, I stumbled upon this book 'Chloe'. The description sounded interesting enough, so I picked it. I wanted to like this book, really. It started out okay, I loved Theran, but that was about it. I had a hard time liking any of the other characters, and it felt that they had no emotion or real depth to their characters, with the exception of Theran. But about the time Chloe and Minnie started modeling, I was feeling like this book had no point and was going nowhere....very slowly, and I got bored with it. A few times I put the book down and had to ponder 'what is the point of this story?' and 'why should I care for these characters?', and after that I just had no desire to pick it up again. It seems to me it could have been a good story if it had a more interesting plot and a little more excitement to the characters. But it just fizzled out way too fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dismal failure.","review":"\\"Chloe\\" is most definitely going on my list of \\"worst books read.\\" It was if author Lyn Cote simply did not know how to design her main character, Chloe, or any of the other characters. No one had any depth or interestingness to him or her. The book spans nearly ten years, giving plenty of time and opportunity to showcase characters' growth, but Cote failed greatly. There was no development or explanation as to why these people turned out as they did. It was a mystery that wasn't interesting. There was no one to look up to, relate to, or like...it was as if Cote didn't like writing this story. A huge disappointment.

There were no interesting experiments. I could come up with more interesting things that kids could do with colored sand (try adding store-bought food coloring to sand and mix it up) and cheap plastic colored film.

Two other pleasant surprises were \\"A Song for Athene\\", the haunting melody I recalled from Princess Diana's funeral - very mysterious and moving.

Being a choir alt singer myself and having sang the piece a few times, it pierces my ears to hear the altos out of tune IN THE FIRST LINE OF THE CHOIR SCORE!!!!

I'd forgotten how powerful this thing is with new batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"Disappointing, it has a nice feel and all, but the vibrator is really weak. Also the switch is placed terrible, when you are turning it down, or off, it's very easy to unscrew it and have the batteries fall out. The switch is literally on top of the place where you screw the cap off. Also it's tough to turn, and really hard to adjust when it's in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superball","review":"Pros: Good Vibrating power from low to high settings. So far after many months and battery changes it has been reliable even with water based and silicone based lubes. It wasn't expensive.Cons: Too hard, not very pliable, not really jelly like as title would lead you to believe. It seems more like really firm rubber similar to an old school superball. Mrs. doesn't enjoy it; says it's uncomfortable & usually hurts. Not sure if it's the shape of the head or the girth being larger than the rest of the shaft before the head/tip which seems weird to me. It actually makes the tip/head seem rather small in comparison to the rest of it. All of this is hard to see from the stock photo, but more easily observed when in hand so buyer beware.Other Thoughts: For us it's better at massaging the exterior than the interior. Perhaps, I will just melt it down to make a large superball."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy","review":"This vibrator is exactly what you pay for, cheap, weak, and rough.

This has several speeds. The low speed was fine for me. It stimulates the clit great with some lubricant, so buy some if you don't have any. I use Pink Water. It's water-based and doesn't irritate. I would like caution that this product is made using PVC (a type of plastic) that can harm the body. Use a condom with this dildo: non-lubricated ones. Most lubricated condoms use a silcone-based lubricant, and silcone can destroy the toy. Dildos made of PVC can be cleaned using mild soap and water, but it's best to buy a spray on sex toy cleaner. That will help keeep the toy free of bacteria. One thing I found out is that it is possible to spread STDs via dildos, so put a condom on your toy, and have at it.

The ridges at the base that are supposed to give clitoral stimulation didnt do anything for my girl but i believe it simply doesnt work for all women the same way.

I understand that author's make mistakes, but that's what editors are for, right?The story of Trilby and Thorn was beautiful. They were in love, but both thought the other was still in love with someone else.

If you don't use shortening for health reasons, you won't be baking any of the cookies in this book.Most of the recipes call for liquid Sweet n Low. Again, if you don't like the taste of sacharin, you probably won't be tempted to try these recipes.Clever cooks might be able to substitute powdered sucralose and some extra liquid for the liquid sacharin, but again, why spend extra time modifying existing recipes when you have so many other resources and can easily find recipes that don't call for things you don't want to eat?"},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll like this cookbook if you like fake bread","review":"I was very open minded when I bought this book based on the high ratings that others gave to it but when I tried a few of her recipes and tasted the dishes I thought I had made an error in the recipe. I thought...how can people eat food like this? I would rather go without bread than have to eat this! Most of her baking recipes are made with the same basic dough and so any thought I had on the other dishes being better were dashed! I returned the book. There are better lower carb cookbooks than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tastes Bad, No Filling","review":"I've been cooking low carb for quite a while and was really excited when I found this. Well the joke was on me. Most of these recipes are dry, dry, dry. They also call for sweet-n-low, which is sacchrin and leaves an awful aftertaste. splenda is a much better choice as it measures, cooks and tastes like sugar. the rest of the ingredients (which were VERY expensive) just taste gross. buy this so-called cookbook at your own peril!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great recipes!","review":"This book has been such a lifesaver for me.

I just wanted a hard copy of her version of One Night in Bangkok to play on my fairly nice stereo, since I find MP3's generally don't sound as good.WHAT A MISTAKE. This 1996 'remaster' sounds horrible! The MP3 version of this song sounds much better. The whole CD is bass heavy, sounds slightly muffled, and distorts on the challenging sections. It sounds like a CD-R made from crappy low bit rate MP3's made in 1996, and that probably exactly what this is. I'm appalled at the sound quality on this disc.Don't waste your money on this. Try to find an original copy of the disc if you can.My question is, where does the better sounding MP3 come from??"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Night In Bangkok by Robey","review":"To be perfectly honest I only bought this because of Robey. She was one of the stars of FRIDAY THE 13TH: THE SERIES. And I was curious. Though short in the number of songs (8), it is well worth the listen. Songs are disco. Though not a big fan of the disco I found them very enjoyable and entertaining. Probably dued to Robey. What a voice. Sounds like that chick that was on FRIDAY THE 13TH: THE SERIES.

The guys, who named this release after a street in Cleveland, play rock & roll the way it's meant to be played. It's gritty & raunchy yet the songwriting takes it to places that most groups could only dream of reaching. Fans of groups like DMZ, The Lyres, The Oblivians & Flaming Sideburns would do well to check this out. Unfortunately they only released one more album after this one (it was excellent also)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Building Toothpick Bridges","review":"I was disappointed by this book because it was not what I expected.

I would not recommend this book to anyone looking for instructions on how to actually build toothpick bridges."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I needed- or as much as I needed","review":"This is a simple pamphlet of about 32 pages. It has very little in the way of actual instruction in the making the bridges. It would be good if you can make a bridge but have no idea how to explain the process to kids. It talks about a job each student in a group would have, has some reproducible copyfree pages, but no instructions on how to make a good bridge. It does mention different kinds of bridges, but only has pictures of the sides, no visuals of the decks. I wish I had been able to see a copy of this \\"book\\" before I bought it. I could have saved $8."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good group project","review":"We were looking for a book that shows how to build a toothpick bridge for our homeschool co-op to use. This book does not show the specifics of how to build one certain bridge, but it does show basic setups for several different types.The real strength of the book is that it shows how to set up teams to build the bridges, with easy to follow instructions and lesson plans. The book even shows how to make a competition out of it and shows how to test each bridge to see which one is the best.Great book for our needs as a group, and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great techniques and articles","review":"This book provides both theory and practical applications.

This book has an attractive title for design researchers. I expected it to be a manual that might be useful, for example, to PhD students in design. But it is not. It is hugely disappointing. It has usurped the title \`design research' for what is largely innovation management prattle.It's a book for designers, not students. But I'm not sure what designers would get from it. Inspiration to engage more in user research? Perhaps. Encouragement to delve deeper into research methods, and to learn more? No; because the references and further reading are extremely limited. For instance, two potentially useful chapters, overviews of quantitative and qualitative methods respectively, have just one reference between them, and that's to Cooper's The Inmates are Running the Asylum, in the qualitative methods chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choking hazard","review":"I enjoy some of her earlier work but this one is misleading, in particular for those wishing to study (methods of) design research.

Thoroughly entertaining!","review":"This book was every bit as wonderful as the first two; perhaps moreso!Words can't begin to describe the depth and magnitude of this book, which chronicles what happened to Khan and the rest of his followers with such astonishing detail, it's as if it actually happened and that these are the diaries of one of the survivors of the disaster of Ceti Alpha V rather than documented accounts by Khan and his wife, Marla McGivers Singh.You will be riveted from start to finish, with more twists and turns than you can count; it'll leave your head spinning, your fingers eager to turn every page as soon as you're finished with the last and your heart deeply saddened in many instances regarding Khan's agony and the depth of his madenss to follow.Even more saddened you will be when the book comes to an end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seemless!","review":"Just finished \\"To Reign in Hell\\" and loved it.

The writing is superb and imaginative. For those who want to know what really happened in the years after Kirk's first encounter with Khan, this story by Greg Cox fills in all the gaps. From the establishment of the first settlement on the planet, to the destruction of Ceti Alpha VI that led to the demise of Ceti Alpha V, to the discovery of the nature of the dreaded \\"Ceti eels,\\" to the death of Khan's ex-starfleet wife, Cox paints a complete and vivid picture of this great tragedy in the history of Star Trek. The first two books in Cox's Khan series do a great injustice to this superb ending novel, but this one more than makes up for the loss. If you haven't read any books in the series (The Eugenics Wars) by Cox, you might skip to this one so that you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but subtle","review":"I ordered this album after reading some great reviews, and at first I wasn't sure about it. I enjoyed it, but I wondered how many times I would actually listen to it. Well, the more I listen, the better I like it. It's quite different from most of the other swing albums on the market -- the band is small, so it doesn't have that \\"big\\" sound. The songs are all great, the vocals particularly tight, and the music rewards close listening -- it's not big, but it's complex and delightful. My favorite is \\"Is You Is Or Is You Ain't My Baby\\" -- it gets better every time!

I have highlighted many lines of sheer poetry, the words are intense, packed full of life, and in a short amount of space- so much is described, revealed. This book is about a female college student falling in love with a female teacher but that description does not even come close to describing what the book is about. It is about longing, love, desire, beauty and passion so strong it seems to transcend the \\"normal\\" boundaries. I love this book and will be reading again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's oh-so-boring!","review":"I can't believe I am the only person who found this weird book boring.

Six times in one paragraph in less than that many sentences? Surely there are many places where a pronoun would have fit much nicer, considering that you've already used the proper name so many times on that page already. I'd have to check out her next work in a bookstore where I could preview it before buying; I wouldn't have ever purchased this had I known what it was like to read. But then again, it was a penny book, so all I really paid for was shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Backward and forward...","review":"This book took me by the hand and pulled me thoroughly and honestly through first love. I gobbled it up in a few hours, completely enveloped in Flannery and Anne's world. It sat with me for weeks. The storytelling is wonderful. One day I found myself reading it from the end to the beginning and still able to feel the loss, the promise and the enthusiasm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"I read some good reviews on here so I figured I'd give this book a read. It's an easy read, I zipped it through in 1 night. It jumps right in, the romance begins within the first few pages and 1/4 of the book is character development and development of the relationship. 1/2 of the book is just repetitive lust. It was exciting at first, but it became the same thing over and over for 100pgs or so. I began to get very bored with the exhaustive redundancy. The last bit of the book, well, I won't spoil it. It's not the best book I've read, it's not the worst either. If you're looking for erotica, it's in this book for sure, but honestly I just couldn't wait to be through with it and was disappointed by the ending. I was essentially dis appointed by the whole book. Give it a read though, it may be your cup of tea. I think it needs a lot of work to be a full, complete, enthralling, erotic piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated it so much I gave it away!!!!!","review":"I should have listened to the poeople that wrote reviews and said negative things about this item, but I bought it anyway.

Not only did it take forever, but would toast only side with the other side white, with one third burnt.3.The door did not open easily, you had to pull down hard, unsafe to do when the oven is hot.4.The oven was 50 degrees off.I did like the feature that the outside surface remained cool while in use."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it worked, it would be great","review":"Hi, Just a note to all of you reading the glowing reviews of this toaster-oven. The first one we purchased died within 150 days, which is good, since it was still under warranty. We took it to a repair shop, waited 2 months, and received a replacement. The second one died within 90 days, and I simply cannot waste my time with such a poorly constructed device. When it worked, it was great, we loved it.

Jerky toast - that's what I want in the morning! This was a problem from Day 1, but I thought that I'd solve it by turning the thing on for a few minutes before putting bread in for toast. Occasionally this was an acceptable strategy, but many times the oven would shut off the top element.I never could figure out how to get the heating elements hot and keep them that way. Additionally, I only once ever saw the bottom element get to a dull red hot, so I don't know if it ever was fully on. I don't know who the genius was at DeLonghi who designed this, but I'd like to tell them that YOU CANT TOAST BREAD ON LOW HEAT!!.Note: I purchased this toaster oven from a brick and mortar vendor, not Amazon.

The knobs in display are already loose. The knobs also looked like they are not in the exact places they should be. They are not in the center of the \\"knob place\\", a circle a little lower than panel.All in all, I don't feel like it's a high quality oven.

However, at 13 months it just stopped working in the middle of toasting a piece of bread. No warning, nothing, just turned off and wouldn't turn on again. Beware - if you read the reviews you will see that several of these stopped working at 13 months - just one month after the warranty ends. We live in Chicago and can't even get it fixed. To find Delonghi service we would need to drive to another state! We had a great Delonghi but got this new one to replace the battered 15 year old one but now we are kicking ourselves.
