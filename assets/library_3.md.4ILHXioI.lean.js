Lasting power is average, it morphs shortly after you apply it, not unlike many others we have used. Beware that Liz Claiborne products for men all use the same base,[many manufacturers use a common base]so that their other fragrances have similar characteristics, the nose knows.

Strong scent at first (not overly musky) but turns into a clean fresh scent that will last a good part of the day. The price is another pro of this product. About $20 on sale can't be beat by many other good colognes. Great Value! The reason I'm giving it 4 starts instead of 5 is because this is not the best I've tried.

It contains more detection in its first section than The Hound of the Baskervilles, with Holmes (off-stage for much of The Hound) actively investigating the murder at Birlstone, and drawing his ever-fascinating deductions from raincoats and dumb-bells; indeed it is the only pure detective story among the four, with the reader given every opportunity to solve the crime. Although the solution is justly famous, it is but a variation on \\"The Norwood Builder,\\" at much greater length. The second half of the tale concerns the doings of the Pinkerton agent Birdy Edwardes in the eponymous Valley, terrorised by the Freemasons, a gripping and powerful account which is perhaps of greater interest than the detection."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE VALLEY OF FEAR","review":"'The Valley of Fear'. A real page turner but what makes it most memorable for me is not that Holmes is at his best, but Conan Doyle is. After reading this book I recommend you to read this book because it was a suspense story. The whole story moves around Mcginty who was a big criminal in the valley of vermisa also called the valley of fear. There was only one person who could face to that criminal and his name was Jack McMurdo. He behaved as a gangster and he had taken many risks in his life and he was not afraid to take more risks. Don't miss 'The Valley of Fear'. It's terrifying, exciting, and best of all, real."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Story That Is Hard To Figure Out - Though Very Short","review":"The Valley of Fear is the last of the full Sherlock Holmes novels (the remaining books are short story collections) and it is also one of the shortest. Overall, it was more of an extended short story than a full novel. However, it was still very deep in that it was one of the more difficult to figure out the mysteries in the Sherlock Holmes universe. In fact, the last half of the book represents the first Sherlock Holmes story where I wasn't able to figure out what was going on until the end. A fun read that you can complete in a single session."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sherlock Holmes with an American story line","review":"This is one of the longest Sherlock Holmes stories (along with Hound of the Baskervilles, The Sign of Four and A Study in Scarlet). The story begins in the English countryside with the apparent murder or suicide of an American at his estate. The reader is then taken to America in flashback, where the story leads up to the events in England. Indeed, Holmes and Watson are not the central characters for a large segment of this book, which is unusual in the series.The story concludes back in England with yet more plot twists, including the unseen hand of the evil, and longtime Holmes nemisis, Professor Moriarity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissatified","review":"A terrible rendition of a Holmes story.

There are several factors why a woman can skip her period and it has NOTHING to do with pregnancy! It can be due to stress, change in climate, hormonal imbalances, even a plane, train or boat ride can delay it or have it come early. Dobson should have referred to a MEDICAL BOOK instead of going only on his false assumptions!Now I am surely convinced that the man is a pervert!

Unlike other similar titled books, Solomon takes the approach of dealing with varyious personality types from different perspectives - form a subordinate, peer, or boss POV.

This is perhaps one of my favorite books, ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Role Playing Games, Anyone?","review":"Written back in the days when Dungeons & Dragons was at it's most popular, this is a book about a teenage boy who gets caught up in the character he plays in a role playing game based on Irish mythology. It is a thrill of a book with many twists and turns. The lead character may just be a bit insane but he is not completely off his rocker. The things he sees may not be real but there is deffinately something strange going on in this town he and his mother have come to live in. John Coyne puts together a great tale of seemings and dreamings. What is real? What is fantasy? \\"Hobgoblin\\" comes to a close with a very satisfying end. All is explained, there are no loose ends. I highly recomend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine light suspense reading","review":"I bought this book years ago as a light read to laugh at - thelaugh was on me! I still have it and enjoy re-reading it from time to time. It makes one want to find a copy of the game\\"Hobgoblin\\" to play.

I'm a huge fan of travel books, so I had high expectations. The author uses language well, but goes off on so many tangents that you quickly forget what the chapter is even supposed to be about. Each chapter is supposed to be about a certain memory or theme, but instead he will start off telling one story, then switch to a seemingly unrelated Hindu legend, then to another story, then on to something else.

There is nothing mild about the music these guys put out, but it is good clean fun at a higher decibel! These are pretty much cover songs of some great classics, to include their signature \\"Walk Softly On This Heart of Mind\\" and \\"Oh, Lonesome Me\\". There are also some stinkers here as well, such as \\"Let's Work Together\\" and \\"Spirit in The Sky\\"....They really dont sound much different than their original releases a decade earlier. Personally, I feel the band died after the Brothers Phelps left the group as they were the real talent, and their \\"solo/duet\\" project was actually quite good. While I can say that I'm glad Country Music did not go down the same road as the Kentucky Headhunters, it is refreshing to see these guys have fun with adding a little electricity and noise to some old standards.

For those who are looking for an objective, common-sense way of dealing with teenage cultural issues, this isn't it. The author starts out well enough, pointing out numerous examples of manipulative and over-sexualized advertising and programming aimed at kids and teens, but by the middle of the book, her extreme right-wing agenda is so obvious, it's hard to keep reading. Being slammed over the head page after page with self-righteous hogwash just isn't my idea of parenting advice. The author is so self congratulatory about her efforts at keeping her teenagers home and apart from anything their peers might be experiencing, it makes you wonder how these poor kids are ever going to survive on their own. I wanted to like this book, but I just couldn't get past the blatent manipulation of facts and figures to further her own extreme messsage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"This book is boring, repetitive, and not at all insightful. The author describes some problems with our culture- too much sex and violence- but offers no thoughtful suggestions. She basically talks about what a great parent she is because she generally shields her children from such odious things as Janet Jackson's nipple.Lastly, I don't understand why an editor didn't delete the completely overused phrase \\" a culture that has gone stark raving mad.\\"Waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where has Hagelin been?","review":"This sounds like a book from the 1950s when consumer advocates were telling us about dangerous products. Is there anyone around who is that naive about \\"dangers that lurk everywhere\\"? Maybe there is. I think the reason she wrote the book is because all the information is so readily available.

But I made an exception of this one and just threw it in the garbage. It is just awful. The woman offers no constructive solutions except the platitudinously inane call for \\"goldly families\\". I enjoy a good right wing ranting tome most days of the week, but this one is just so bad, so devoid of ideas and lacking in \\"values\\", you just want to weep.

Hagelin also strives to stress that parents must take responsibility to be their children's primary role models.But the casual format of this book often rambles without scoring direct hits on the points she tries to make.

The only problem is when you pull the cord out of the housing, try and get it to rewind back in. You have to play with it every foot or so because the cord binds up and will not go back in side. You have to actually feed it as if you were the guide on a fishing reel. This is serious serious problem. Like my air hose, the cord should fly into the housing with no snag.

I can go there, but in moderation, and to me that album exceeds tolerances.This album sounds as if upon reflection, he thought the same thing. It still piles up the sound in places, but with so much better a sense of placement and balance over the course of the disc, and contrasted against sections of greater subtlety of texture, melodic development, and progression.

She soon realizes he is a monster, but must meet Leopold Stokowski, her \\"white knight\\" before she can leave Pat. Although she spends a decade with Leopold and they have two sons, she is miserable in this marriage as well, living much of it alone. Her dreams appear to be largely ignored. She finally finds the strength to save herself as the story ends.The book is a true testimony to the value of ghost writers. She has such an exciting past, but instead of interesting stories, we are forced to wade through her boring, mundane descriptions of being bored or unhappy in a life most people would never be able to dream of having. We all dream about what it would be like to be rich and famous. This book doesn't satisfy and doesn't make Gloria a sympathetic character either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable and good quality","review":"I purchased these sock for my workouts.

Why?It's simple really - these socks dry in minutes. Seriously. Wash them in a sink with hot water and soap, rinse em out, give em a good squeeze and then slap them against something clean (bathroom tile walls, a rock that you've washed off, whatever), and in 10-15 minutes they're almost totally dry and soft. I'm in an area where dryers are very rare, and I wish I had nothing but these socks. They're very comfortable and they last a long time - my 2 pairs of these socks that I brought with me have lasted probably 100-200 miles worth of walking, and aren't getting threadbare or worn.Phenomenal socks for travelers in foreign countries where a washer and/or dryer are rarities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This is a great quality product for a reasonable price.

This book emphasizesnorth Korea as unpredictble and crazy while there is no mentionabout US negotiating strategy, which I suspect is part of the problem.I give a low mark just because there is not much opposing views or alternateobjective presentation.

Or, is it about all the great music her Annie is being exposed to? And all the non-toxic cloth diapers that Annie wore? And that her sweet little baby butt never touched a baby swing? Moving about with baby is just a launching pad for the author's general opinions about raising a kid in general. (And, she only has one child, so she gets to over-think EVERY aspect of parenting...)Were you the type of person who travelled the world with just your backpack and camped under the stars without a tent?

Half of what she presents as amazing insight is actually obvious to anyone with a brain, and much of what she states as fact is actually not. Hers is the voice of someone who is four years into raising a child and thinks she has it all figured out.

Anyone interested in this topic (and anyone that calls him/herself a Christian should be) will learn a great deal by reading this, and perhaps have their minds opened to alternative ways of seeing and thinking about the most important subject there is.

This is great for beginners because she thoroughly explains each pose and the proper form. The routine itself is slow and relaxing in pace, so that you can feel all of the benefits of each pose, and a wide variety of poses are explored. The transition into and out of each pose doesn't really flow and it's awkward at times. The background music isn't great but it could be worse. There are NO other exercisers in the background, which I loved, because I could really focus. This is a great, thorough introduction to yoga.

It was just right for me starting out, Leslie talks but more appropriately for this kind of instruction (no whoops or hollers); and because I've never done yoga, I appreciated her instructions along the way. I felt so stretched and rejuvenated afterwards. She takes it slow and explains all the poses.I was disappointed when it ended because I wished it had been a bit longer. This DVD has definitely gotten me into yoga; I'm looking forward to doing it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Take this DVD for what it is, Yoga for beginners, and you'll love it. I've done yoga a handful of times and was always frustrated because I'm not a flexible person (yet). Leslie's routine is very, very basic which made me feel like I could actually do it and it feels great! The actual workout portion is only 15 or 20 minutes which means its quick enough to use this as a stretch after your usual workout.

She knows how to bring all elements of a love story together. Humor, sex, character development. Interactions with secondary characters settings.

The girl is the embodiness of stupidity. How can a girl that looked after her family for years be so silly and jump to ridiculous conclusions where her husbant is concerned? I am in the middle of the book and I don't think I'll have the courage to finish it. Alec is ok, but Jamie is the worst heroine I've met in a book.

First of all, Jamie's father let her go pretty fast for a father who was determined to hide her from the Scots. Secondly, she sure got used to being married to Alec pretty darn fast. Finally, the dialogue was terrible. Jamie really annoyed me consistently throughout the book.

I thought the last Twilight book had that same sort of annoying type of storyline, but this book makes Stephanie Myers look like Jane Austen. Anyways, it had it's moments, mostly just some minor steamy sex \\"scenes\\" and while I appreciated the tiny,tiny..... tiny bit of medieval European history that was offered, the characters were all so two dimensional, uninteresting and well.... cartoony (if that makes any sense?)

About the book...I think I especially loved how JG slowly phased us through the growth of the main characters' relationship. I absolutely adored this Scottish Alpha Male (Alec Kincaid). I only wish there was an epologue giving us some insight to Scottish Laird Alec Kincaid and English born Lady Jamie Jameson life after all the hoopla dies down. Just a teensy weensy taste??!?

I never felt myself in anguish for the characters, nor was I laughing overmuch at any humor, nor was I in much suspense, nor was I overcome by the romance. Nevertheless, I was never bored and found it an entertaining story and I held affection for the characters. It just seemed to lack something to make it great. I understand the connection the author was trying to make with the stepdaughter, but it just didn't seem genuine. Also, a lot of Jamie's incidents just weren't that realistic to me. Many seemed pointless and didn't go with the story. Seemed a little aimless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Julie Garwood novels","review":"Julie Garwood novels are perfect. The right touch of romance and intrigue. You won't be able to put them down. The only down side is that I can't get anything else finished if I start reading one. Love Julie Garwood. Her characters are warm and wonderful. A feel good kind of book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bride","review":"This was my first Julie Garwood book. I loved it so much I had to buy a2nd copy when I wore the first one out reading it over and over again. Ifyou enjoy a little humor in your Historical romance this is one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bride Was Great!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. You will laugh like crazy. The relationship between Alec and Jamie has respect and you fall in love with them, while they fall in love, which few books have, and boy did they have chemistry together. I really liked that they had the conflict of their countries and languages, It added a lot and made me again laugh. I will have to say, I am a huge Judith McNaught fan, and these scenes were not as descriptive as her books, but still great story and a great read! In the book, Alec calls Jamie \\"wife\\" and she gets irritated and starts calling him \\"husband\\", you smile through the entire book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING","review":"Julie Garwood has outdone herself! The book is incredibly romantic and funny. She is a genious when it comes to providing intrigue and mystery without making you crazy waiting for the point. She gives just enough to keep you interested without making you anxious. Jamie and Alec are perfect! Do yourself a favor and READ THIS BOOK"},{"rating":"2","title":"exceptional","review":"this has to be my favorite of garwood's books.she is my favorite author and i have read a good many authors.the bride is a very funny and enjoyable love story. the detail is excellent,you feel as if your exspericing everything the charcters do. i hate the who they hate and love who they love.I almost feel as if I'm there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, fun story.","review":"This book was a joy to read. I loved all the twists and turns. I have to admit, the murdered turned out to be someone I hadn't thought of. I love surprises!This is a fun read and a good story. The only reason I did not give it five stars is because I have read a few books that Garwood has written that I enjoyed far better. Honor's Splendor is by far my favorite of her reads. If you enjoy a fast-pased story that has you mesmerized from the first page, you will love Honor's Splendor.The Bride is a keeper as well and if you pick it up, you won't be able to put it down.Keep up the good work Ms. Garwood!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I laughed,sighed,and cried joyously","review":"This book was one of the best I've read! Jamie was a joy, I found myself smiling and shaking my head over her innocence and schemes. (But Alec promises not to lose his temper) HA HA! Delightful! I found Alec truely wonderful. Strong, sensitive and the dreamiest man (wish he were real). Believe me you will laugh, the way the supporting characters come to her aide is so hilarious. Yet I promise you they will make you cry. I finished this book a few days ago and have found it difficult to get into another one. It is one you can add to your collection and treasure for years to read again! Maybe, just maybe a trip to Scotland is in order! :o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bride","review":"I just love Julie Garwood. She is brilliant, original, and funny with a deep insight in to the feelings of people. This book is no exception."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC, BEST I HAVE READ","review":"I LOVE ALL OF JULIE GARWOODS BOOKS. THIS IS THE BEST ONE I HAVE READ. SECOND AND THIRD WOULD BE THE PRIZE AND THE SECRET. KEEP THESE KIND OF BOOKS COMING!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can I give more stars?","review":"The best in characters, setting, plot, suspense and everything else. I adore Julie Garwood and this was one of her absolute best.If anyone knows a writer who writes a scottish romance as well as Garwood-please let me know!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bride - misleading","review":"I ordered this book after I looked through the sample via Kindle. The first part of the sample represented a story line about a modern day career woman - and an interview that she has with an arrogant, wealthy man (who tries to rip her clothes off!) However, when I received the Kindle book the story is about a young English woman forced into marriage with a Scottish man in the 17th century - not a modern day woman. I don't know how this happened but I contacted Amazon Kindle immediately and they withdrew this product from my Kindle. So please be warned - this story is about a young English woman in the 17th century, not a modern day career woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's So Great About It?","review":"I feel like SIMON COWELL and I'm sorry, but I just don't see what was so great about this book. It was boring and the plot was very weak. Need I say more? Well, I will. I usually love this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book made me chuckle a few times.","review":"I like books that make me feel what the characters are feeling. If I burst out in tears or laughter I think the author has done a good job of reeling me into participating with the characters. Ms. Garwood succeeded in that. I like it when I close a book with a smile on my face. It means I enjoyed reading it. Ms. Garwood succeeded in that also. The only part that was predictable for me was when the herione was talking to the Scottish King, but I can easily forgive any author a small amount of predictability. I will save this book to read again someday and that is the ultimate test of a good book for me. Is it one I will keep and read again, or pass on not caring if it ever returns. This is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a story!!!!","review":"I have been hooked on Julie Garwood books for a few months nowand I can say The Bride has been my favorite thus far. I loved Jamie,she was so strong and willing, and made you happy to be a women. She never let her husband get to her and when he did she let him have it. She was also very cunning. Alec was also a wonderful characture. He was strong yet lovable and caring. This book was a true work of art. I love how Julie knows her history along with giving a sensual, loving story. This book tore at my emotions and made me fall in love with her work."},{"rating":"2","title":"alec and jamie are ordered to get married","review":"we should all get ordered to married a man like alec. jamie is wonderfully funny,beautifull and no pushover. their love is what wishes are made of. run dont walk to your bookstore and grab this book even if its in someone elses hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reprint of one of Julie's BEST!","review":"Okay, Julie Garwood fans! This book is a re-print. However, this is one of the BEST stories from Julie EVER.By order of the King, Jamie and Alec marry, but it is not exactly happily at first. Alec refuses to call Jamie by her \\"man's name\\" and Jamie wears black to her wedding. Through many twists and turns, Jamie and Alec learn to love and respect each other. If you enjoy Mercy and Heartbreaker, see where Julie got her start with this EXCELLENT novel. Also, you must read \\"The Wedding,\\" the sequel to \\"The Bride.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Garwood Book!","review":"\\"The Bride\\" is just another example of Julie Garwood's flair for writing truly enjoyable stories. While some may complain that her stories all follow the same formula. I find them all different in their own ways. What her books do have in common, are strong heroines, gentle (at times,thick-headed) men, and interesting adventures throughout. In this story, our heroine, Jamie, is forced to marry Scottish laird, Alec Kincaid. While he see the marriage as an act of duty, he soon sees that he feels more for his wife than he wishes to admit. This story has a little of everything, romance, a murder plot, and a few surprises sprinkled throughout. I highly recommend this, and every other Julie Garwood book, to anyone that enjoys romance novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Story","review":"I read this book in one day..Yes, its another love story but i loved the characters soooo much and thats why i thought this book was great. I definetly recommend this book to people who love romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"never bothered to review a book before","review":"But I could not pass up the chance to review this book. This is my favorite all time book, next to Whitney My Love. It was also the first book I looked for when I purchased my first Kindle. I was soo disappointed that it was not available at the time. I just saw it today when I was pre-ordering Julie Garwoods new book. I loved all the supporting cast. You are drawn into a family with all the problems and misunderstandings that delight and surprise. I laughed and smiled all the way through this book. \\"Don't build me a box\\" has become a well worn phrase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Great Book. One of my favorites","review":"I love all of JG's books, and this was definately one of her best. Jamie was wonderful, I loved her as soon as she was introduced. Alec was one of those all time heroes that stay in your mind forever. Wouldn't it be nice if we all had heroes like that? The plot was spectacular, and the twist at the end was amazing, i didn't see it coming! Read this wonderful love story, it will be a \\"keeper\\" on your book shelf forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised!","review":"I've never read a book by this author but picked The Bride up on a whim just before a flight and I found it to be a genuinely fun read. Alec is very sexy in a macho sort of way, and Jamie is quite endearing though a bit of a scatterbrain. The romance was good. All in all, it was entertaining and made the flight pass quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jmorris","review":"Absolutely, this is my favorite of all Julie Garwood's books. Great characters and story, But be warned, this is at least RERELEASE number 2! That's the only reason I didn't give it a 5-star rating. Paperback versions at a fraction of the cost are available in most used bookstores."},{"rating":"2","title":"i loved it!","review":"this book is so full of wonders.i love the way brenna is.and the leading man ,makes you wish you where kissing him.julie is awesome.she truly puts the story full of romance.hummor,sex and makes it a wonderful book to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"absolultely wonderful!!","review":"Julie Garwood's books are a positive look at women and how they can change the lives of everyone they met, even alot of people that often go unnoticed. Her books are entertaining and captivating. I have read most of her books and look forward to the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get ready for a magical time in the Scottish Highlands!","review":"\\"The Bride\\" is the first novel I have read by Julie Garwood. It is a wonderful, romantic adventure story featuring a strong, courageous heroine by the name of Jamie. Jamie is a delight from the beginning. Her love, Alec, is strong, fearless and an absolute sweetheart. I fell in love with Ms. Garwood's description of the Scottish Highlands. I also enjoyed the author's wonderful sense of humour which is evident in the dialog between her very colorful characters. This is a must read for those who like adventure, romance and strong female heroines!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are much better ones out there...","review":"I've read a lot of books in this genre and I have to say that the dialogue in this book is immature and the storyline is simple to the point of being dull. I was hoping that it would improve as I made my way through the book but the opposite was true. I'm surprised that this book has achieved the high rating that it has. I certainly didn't like it. Take my advice - read \\"Outlander\\" by Diana Gabaldon. Far superior writing and story with a similar theme."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this get such a high rating?","review":"I don't normally review that often but feel that I need to warn people about this book. I read around 1-2 books a week and it's rare that I can't finish a book but this has been added to the \\"crap\\" folder on my Kindle. The heroine is described as pretty much being this amazingly talented superwoman kind of person, your initial introduction to her makes it seem like she is brilliant at everything she does however the reality is that she is the most annoying character I've ever read. She is constantly \\"fishing\\" for compliments and at one stage in the book even the hero asks her to stop making him repeat himself to her, it felt like I was reading the one conversation over and over. I will never read any more of Julie Garwood's books after this introduction to her work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding?","review":"Stunningly awful. I kept expecting the hero and heroine to learn to speak something other than caveman. Their conversations were the most stilted agonizing irritating dialogue I have ever read. I suppose she was going for a silent dark machismo with Kincaid but Jamie couldn't articulate a sentence or a thought. Even when his personality changed dramatically for no real reason he still was stiff and unsympathetic although no longer dark and brooding. I was shocked to find this on people's romance list. The characters were shallow and the story predictable. The sex scenes needed work as well. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry - not a very good book","review":"I have tried to find some major arguments in this book, and failed. Scolnicov only describes and describes and describes; she will never help the reader with a clear passage that will tell him how all the nice passages that surround him are connected. Or are they? It seams that she is almost afraid to say something directly, and the outcome is a confused reader and a minor book. A poor contribution to womankind."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite movie","review":"I used to watch this movie with my mother as a child. I still love to watch movies with my mother. This movie is my favorite. As a kid I always wanted to be the hero(heroine because I'm a female) in a movie. This movie was awesome it's still awesome today. I hope this movie never gets a remake because I believe you can't beat a classic. The King Kong movie remake was good no lie. Not all movies need a special effects update. I believe this movie will age well because special effects didn't make this movie the storyline and characters made this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's an outrage that this film isn't available on DVD yet!!!","review":"I haven't used a VCR in 3 years...and that was just for some classic porn.It's a shame that the next generation of children (and adults) are not able to enjoy this movie yet.

The kid from E.T is in this movie (Henry Thomas who played Elliott) and once again he pulls a great performance. This film is great entertainment for the whole family! The only reason I didn't give this DVD 5 stars is because there's no menu and it would've been cool if it had special features and such but other than that, its a good little movie one should watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cloak & Daggar","review":"This is a totally enchanting movie, in which I feel Dabney Coleman exhibited that touch of greatness that transcends the boundary from a good actor to a great actor.Beautifully filmed in San Antonio, the story line is very believable and hangs together quite well.Of course, there is a deeper meaning to the movie. It is the touching chronicle of a transition from a child's world of fantasy to the world of reality. The make believe hero in Davie's mind, Jack Flack, is supplanted by the real hero, the real hero being one that was always there for him - his father.At the end, when the transition culminates, if anyone doesn't shed a tear of both sadness and happiness, they probably have a heart of stone.This movie, to me, is a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, thank you!","review":"I used to watch this movie as a child and am happy to share it with my son. Love it. Thank you!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good family film - with memories","review":"I had first seen this film on TV, and loved it. It was not only a good family film, but it brought back wonderful memories of San Antonio, TX, where I grew up. All of the great locations were carefully included in the story line:The Alamo, the Transit Tower (that was the name then), The Chinese Sunken Garden, and a small quick glimpse of my oldchurch, which is now close to, if not on, the Hemisfair property. The San Antonio River was also prominently shown. It was a wonderful tour down memory lane - a 53 year old one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spy vs Spy","review":"Along the same lines as \\"Last Action Hero\\" we see a boy enthralled by the actions of a hero. Instead of a cop played by Arnold Schwarzenegger its a secret agent played by Dabney Coleman. This is a fun movie. If you liked Spy Kids you'll like this. If you didn't like Spy Kids you'll love this since it is more realistic. Good casting, scenes, and music. Great for the whole family but boys and men will enjoy it most."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER RECEIVED PRODUCT","review":"I ordered this for a Christmas gift.

My account has been charged and I would like a refund. I've never had a problem with anyone on Amazon before and am very disappointed in this transaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purchase Cloak & Dagger by itself!","review":"\\"Cloak & Dagger\\" is an outstanding movie. It was typical 80's so it's a little corny, but it's a good story with no foul language or explicit scenes nor innuendos. It provides some insight into children's hearts who've lost a parent. Very heart warming and very well put together. And who couldn't love the location? San Antonio is a beautiful city and the scenery is spectacular. Good family viewing. Cloak & Dagger is a 10 Star movie.\\"The Wizard\\" on the other hand leaves a bad taste in your mouth and should leave a bad soapy taste in the mouth of the child actors who starred in it. I purchased it as a double feature with \\"Cloak & Dagger\\" for my daughter. After previewing it, I was unable to let her watch it because of the foul language and sexual innuendos through out the movie. It was a cute story, which would have worked, had the producers left out the filth. This is not recommended viewing for children...or anyone for that matter. The Wizard owes me some stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to follow.","review":"This film was about a magician posturing as a military man. He lures the antagonist into a ring of lies, deceit and espionage all the while appearing and disappearing at his liberty. This film was very confusing. The choice of traits given to the magician were very odd. He popped up at the most inopportune times. This may have worked for a comedy but there was really nothing funny about this. Why the military uniform? This was just stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank The Lord!","review":"I have loved this film for I don't know how long. Michael Murphy is top notch in the villain role and Henry Thomas and Dabney Coleman will win over your heart.

However I was put off when I checked the back, and only Wizard has SDH (English subtitle for the deaf). I bought it anyway as I wanted to replace the last few remaining VHS tapes I still have.The Wizard is subtitled as labeled on the back (English only, no other subtitle language). Cloak and Dagger does not have subtitle or closed captioning :( I really want to get rid of my old VHS collection but companies like Universal are too cheap to make it all in closed captioned or subtitled for the deaf.The lack of subtitle or closed captioning for half a DVD set and the lack of any other extra feature is why I am giving this one only 2 stars. It would have been 1 star if The Wizard wasn't subtitled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please put this on DVD soon!!!","review":"Keeping this short and to the point, this is a great film that I would like to see on DVD. The whole Alamo scene is great and when the hacker guy breaks the code is good stuff. Of course the important family unity lesson is good for everyone to relearn every now and again...This is a good movie that should have come out on DVD quite a while ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOO BRIEF BUT STILL A GOOD INTRO FOR BEGINNERS","review":"This book is short,true. But I think that for beginners, it's a good book. Of course, it doesn't rank with \\"The awakening of intelligence\\" or other books by K., but it's good for people that don't want to go too deep into the subject and just want to learn more about K. In addition, the small format is practical so you can carry it and read it during the day, at moments when you feel most \\"ready\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Brief To Do Krishnamurti Justice","review":"This is a tiny, tiny (89 pp.) book is far too brief to dojustice even remotely to a thinker like Jaddu Krishnamurti. The sizeof the book is only 3.5\\" x 5.0\\" and the longest excerpt from any of his talks or writings (the book is composed solely of such snippets from his other work) are very short -- 2 pages at the most -- and they fail to give an adequate understanding of the breadth and deepness of Krishnamurti's mature philosophy, one that in my opinion, is one of the most important streams of contemporary thought, and one which surely deserves more than such a tiny volume is able to convey. It's cheap, but not worth the price. Get one of his larger and more complete books if you are interesting in finding out what this brilliant and very genuine man had to say. Any less than that would be doing injustice to the integrity of his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meditation: A way of life","review":"Many years ago a poet friend visited me at my little hut in Old Mesilla. He had a book tucked into his sports coat. Thinking that it might be some cheap Western, the kind that espouses old West values, like Louis L'Amour,I asked him what it was. He brought out a small copy of \\"Meditations\\" by J. Krishnamurti. He said, \\"Soemthing to remind me from time to time.\\" He never said what it reminds him of, but I could guess since we often talked about Krishnamurti. \\"Meditations\\" is not Zen. It is not mysticism. It is moment-to-moment awareness of what the mind does. The mind that more often than not functions totally without any insight into itself. This is what meditation does: it is the function of the mind that is aware of what it does moment-to-moment. This is what the small book \\"Meditations\\" reminds us to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"the history of a comic legend","review":"This book is dope it tells of steves life in a very readable way.

(I am about 3/4 through)Red Rabbit starts off well, introducing us to everyone as per usual, getting the individual stories rolling etc.. but, up to now, nothing has really happened. This would be fine if it were full of suspense and intrigue, but unfortunately it isn't.Dialogue and characterisation are first rate as ever, but the fact is, I am a bit disappointed.I am in a position to judge this novel against Tom Clancy's other work as I have read ( and in many instances, re-read) all his past work..Advice : Clancy fans, buy and read this one, just for completeness' sakeNon-Clancy fans, buy and read Hunt for Red October, or Red Storm Rising. After you read either of these two go and indulge in Debt of Honour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I have to disagree with all these reviewers. I love this book. Filling in the blanks of what happened between Patriot Games and Hunt for Red October was a great idea, given that Jack Ryan in the present Clancy Universe is President. I find this book to be imaginitive, and a page turner. I just hope he gets back to John Clark again, I would love to read on some of his adventures in the cold war."},{"rating":"1","title":"No.","review":"If I recall correctly, I may have read the first few pages of one of Clancy's earlier \\"novels\\" until my gag reflex kicked in and I began to go into a massive, boredom-induced seizure.I have not read this \\"book\\" (and I use this term loosely, because Clancy's tomes of ennui are more torture devices than anything else) but I think it will suffice to say that it involves one or more of the following:1. Jack Ryan and his never-ending quest to involve himself in sticky situations with bearded men who wear hammers and sickles prominently on their clothing.2. Espionage.3. Russia.So if you're pretty sure that you lack either a soul or a personality, there's a fair chance you might enjoy this \\"book.\\"P.S. JACK RYAN WINS IN THE END!!!! HAHAHAH SPOILER!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH! Save your money.......","review":"This is an extremely poor offering from an author who has written some excellent and thrillling books. No plot to speak of, slow moving, poor or no character development, and a main character (Ryan) who becomes less likeable the more I read about him. He is complaining, boring, predictable, and profane. Save your hard earned dollars on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Successful Writers Syndrome Stikes Clancy","review":"It appears that Tom Clancy has been struck with SWS (Successful Writers Syndrome). Typical of so many successful writers, Tom doesn't appear to have to respond to an editor. He can write as much as he wants, whether or not it advances the plot or develops characterisation. You can know how the book will end by page 17 and yet still get paid lots of big bucks. Sorry, Tom. It's harder to write a short book than a long one and I don't think you broke a sweat on this one... and I'm a FAN! There may be a modestly interesting 125 page book in here but I doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Introspection doesn't work for Clancy","review":"Clancy fans will be disapointed in this latest attempt. Known for lots of detail (propeller cavatation, flying drones) in previous novels-he has given that up in this one. Instead almost every character has repeated periods of introspection as a substitute book filler. Believe me when I say that introspection is not what Clancy is good at.The book is slow, the characters attempts at look back foresight are tedious (Gee, the new shortstop for Baltimore-Ripken- looks like he is going to be good).Oh, and by the way, I apologize for the late review but I picked this book up and put it down several times before I finally waded through it.Give this book a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"major disappointment","review":"As a huge Clancy fan, this is by far the worst. No suspense, forced dialogues and a feeling that Clancy needed to somehow fill 700 pages. Look at the large letters as a means to make it look \\"big\\".If Clancy does not come back on track with his next book, he will loose lots of - still - loyal readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"red rabbit","review":"618 pages of BORING. Just not up to his standard. Seems like length has become more important to Mr. Clancy than quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paid by the word?","review":"I've read all of Tom Clancy's books and this one is by far the most mediocre. It almost seems that he was being paid either by the word or by the weight of the manuscript. He uses big words where they are not very appropriate as if he was using the thesaurus on his computer. The story is predictable and not that exciting. If he wanted to write a book about baseball teams he should have just done it instead of using it for filler. Altogether very disappointing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sir Tom Clancy, the Verbose","review":"The political rehtoric is horrible. If Clancy wants to make a difference and implement his political views he should run for office. I'd vote for him, but I'm not going to buy his books again. This must have been a \\"contractually obligated\\" book because it reads as if he wrote it at gun point. The plot is sloth-like and it takes FOR-EH-VER to develop. I found myself putting the book down over and over to keep from throwing it across the room from the frustration of reading a stagnant plot. If Tom Clancy is your favorite writer and you have an urge to support him regardless send him 15 bucks and spare yourself the agony of reading this thing. It's really, really bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to his standards","review":"Wow, I was looking forward to this book, and it was quite a disappointment. Poor editing results in deja vu - you'll swear you have already read sections of the book, and you will be right, just turn back a few chapters. I don't know what the ditty about mad dogs and englishmen is, but I certainly don't need the reference at the beginning _and_ end of the book. The technical details that drive ( or bog down depending on your point of view) his other books are not present in this one. He needs to stop writing for the sake of movie plots (ie young Jack ala Affleck) and return to President Jack."},{"rating":"1","title":"TURGID, VAPID AND STUPID","review":"Don't waste your money. This reads as if Clancy was writing under the influence. Lots of jingoism and heavy handed opinion, not much in the way of accurate research, and a pace that brings a new meaning to the word \\"slow\\".If you've already read this, read Martin Cruz Smith's \\"Gorky Park\\" or Polar Star for a well researched book on Russian life under the Soviets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom... focus buddy, focus !","review":"I've been a huge fan since that great start with Hunt for the Red October, what a book ! Read them all. As soon as they hit the stores (or Amazon[.com]) I buy 'em and read 'em in about 5 days, sometimes in the same day. I have over looked some flaws (wordy, wordy, wordy) in the series because of the multiple underlying stories, fascinating technical details vand abrupt plot turns. However, in Red Rabbitt, there was no there there. Just the endless set ups and meaningless dialogue.Don't worry though Tom, I will not give up after just one mistake.

If it wasn't for Tom Clancy's past novels and the Jack Ryan character I would have applied my 100 page theory that if a book has not captured you by the first 100 pages give it up. After 600 pages I was not captured and very disappointed with the ending.It seems that Tom Clancy was looking for a pay day and if it was his first novel it surely would have been rejected. Wake up Tom and start writing again. Or did you employ a ghost to put me to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please let this be a case of Ghost Writing!!!! (ZERO STARS)","review":"I typically enjoy Clancy's work - I've avoided the Op Center stuff from the beginning because they were only using his name. A Ghost Writer either wrote this book or else Clancy phoned it in. While it starts well enough - many interesting story lines are left unfinished and then it devolves into Jack Ryan sniveling about being \\"an instrument of God\\". The Clancy of old would have spun a satisfying tale focused on the Rabbit and how his information was used. This looks like a cheap knock off written by a Ghost for the purpose of a screenplay to showcase Ben Affleck's lack of talent.Editors typically fight to keep Clancy under 1,200 pages. At a little over 600 pages I could have edited this down to about 325. But in good conscience I would have sent Tom back to the drawing board (or rehab). The typical Clancy work ethic is not in evidence.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!!!..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy out of ideas???","review":"...Red Rabbit had taken a sharp downfall after the decent The Bear and The Dragon.

Several of the observations made in the book are repeated over and over again (Note to editor: Were you asleep at the wheel or what?) and some of the little side comments can be very annoying (Hmmm... maybe I'll invest in this little company, they make good coffee.

They just forgot to do the removing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed Clancy Fan","review":"I have read and enjoyed almost every TC novel that he has created, and can honestly say that this is the most disappointed I have ever been.

I only finished it to be sure that I would be fair to Clancy when I ripped this book to everyone I know.As another Amazon.com reviewer pointed out (and quite well, by the way), there is very little in the way of plot, intrigue, drama, or excitement. Other than perhaps providing some background material to the Ryan history, it was singularly useless. This events in this book take place after Patriot Games, but much of Ryan's thoughts and language are reminiscent of an older Ryan, and that was jarring.In preparation for seeing the movie Sum of All Fears (a big disappointment, by the way) I recently re-read that book and, because I enjoyed it so much, most of the other Ryan books. The worst of those books would get 3 stars from me -- this book gets 1.

He hasn't really written a decent book since and this is a pathetic attempt to regain some of the past glory of his brilliant stories before the collapse of the Soviet Union.This book contains no suspense at all. The characters do not encounter any difficulties with anything they attempt, which would remain a problem even if this book was a third the length.And you could easily chop two thirds of this novel by freeing us from having to endure endless and repetitive information regarding the saintly qualities of all of the lead characters.

The plan is for them to take a train from Moscow to Budapest and then to be smuggled to Yugoslavia.

Why bother then to go from Yugoslavia to Hungary to be smuggled back. They could just have disembark in Beograd and avoid all that smuggling across the border.Secondly, no train takes that route, not even a communist one.Beograd is much to the south from Budapest, about a day trip.Seems somebody did not look up the map when writing this poorly constructed plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Rabbit - audio version","review":"I love to listen to audio recordings of thrillers while I exercise - but this production was a terrible disappointment.

This edition of Jack Ryan left me cold in a number of ways. I'd like to know who the whingy, whiny jerk is who professes to be Jack Ryan. It seems all he can do is bellyache about everyone's terrible (Except Cathy's) coffee and bland food. I almost put the book down for good near the end after reading the repetitive complaints about Taster's Choice coffee. Also, we know he doesn't like to fly, but for God's sake, do we have to hear about it endlessly? The Brits offered him a copter ride from Heathrow to Mildenhall and he had the audacity to refuse. He doesn't do choppers after his accident. What a sissy!I have a copy I'll donate to someone with the patience to read this one and the cost of the hardbound is a gift, Mr. Clancy.

The plot was dull, the characters were insipid, the suspense wasn't. Everyone has a bad day now and then, and I hope that Clancy gets back into form with the next one.

I have a complete collection of his works in hardbound. When Amazon.com says he is coming out with a new book I always pre-order, howver this time I made a mistake. To say this book is slow moving doesn't even begin to describe the pace this story unfolds. In addition when you finish the book you will feel as if some one told you a joke but left off the punchline. Normally I expect a Clancy novel to take the first 1/3 of the book just introducing the characters and plot, in Red Rabbit I felt he was still introducing those factors on the last chapter. Very disappointing. It won't keep me from buying another novel by him, but unlike his other stories I will never give this a second read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anxiously awaited reading---mildly disappointed","review":"I have always given Mr.Clancy 4 stars minimum...except now.After reading most of the other reviews, a common theme emerges....a lot of words written with little effect....this was probably the only book he has written where I could put it down without continually thinking about the \\"what comes next\\". Granted, the Bear and the Dragon was a little long on text, but at least it moved. I hope that Mr.Clancy was just a little \\"tired\\"--I would hate for him to drift towards this standard. Look forward to the next one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Rabbit","review":"Clancy is quickly slipping off my list of must read authors. Most of his books start out slowly and eventually pick up the pace. This book never picked up the pace. Character dialouge was painfully stilted. Finally, both Clancy and his editor need to do better research. The assassination attempt of John Paul occurred in 1981. On at least two occasions in the book the intelligence sharing between the US and Great Britian that occurred during the Falklands War was mentioned: small problem, that conflict occured in 1982!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"I have been a fan of Tom Clancy and Jack Ryan since I first read Red October. I am not convinced that Clancy really wrote this book by himself. There is no real suspense, the vulgarity is surprising (and disappointing the way it is used), and the book just plods along.IF this is really Clancy's work, he should be ashamed.

Language is more vulgar and not even necessary for the dialog between characters.And the references to \\"Starbucks\\" feels out of place chronologically. During the setting of the story, Starbucks would have existed of just a few stores in the Northwest. Hard to swallow that Jack Ryan would've have been that addicted to their coffee for so many mentions.I'll just stick to re-reading Clancy's past greats.

I literally have planned camping trips around the release day so I could relax in Yosemite and read the newest thriller in the Jack Ryan series.Never again. This book was never finished by Clancy who evidently finally realized that he could write a blank book with his name on it and it would be a best-seller. After reading red rabbit I wish he would have.The same conversations repeated by the same characters over and over again.Anachronisms that were never edited out.Scenes set up for something exciting to happen but the action was never inserted.Adds absolutly nothing to what we know about Jack Ryan.Adds absolutly nothing about what we know of the attempted assissination of the Pope.Adds absolutly nothing but frustration to the lives of those who struggle through this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing at best","review":"Unfortunately, this is quite boring and disappointing to me.

He's lost his touch.Save your money - don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rabbit Falls Down Its Hole","review":"I struggled to stay with this book, knowing it followed Clancy's same old formula. Ryan comes across as half golden boy and half wimp. Clancy should retire with his millions and leave this alone! And Starbucks in 1980? Please tell me where in Maryland Ryan had Starbucks. Clancy mentions it too often. Several points are repeated ad nauseum in fact, making this a flat, predictable, skim read at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unfortunate failure.","review":"This book could have been great: a young Jack Ryan, a historical basis, and a previously strong cast of characters. Alas, this book falls flat.Clancy repeats himself over and over, ad nauseum: Russians like children, but don't smile; Brits and Americans have honor, the Russians have stupid patriotism; Little girls give the best hugs; Russians like children, but don't smile. Blah, blah, blah.For a former Marine, Jack Ryan is shown to be a surprising wimp, completely out of the character we've seen elsewhere.The book is completely lacking in suspense and shouldn't be classified as a thriller.Copyediting is decent, with only a dozen typos and a handful of incomprehensible sentences.My recommendation: Buy and re-read another of the Ryan stories instead. This one only rehashes the existing characters and adds nothing but an embarrasing misstep for Clancy.After Shadow Warriors, this book is Clancy's worst book to date. Let's hope it doesn't portend his future efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best effort","review":"Tom Clancy must have either tried to take us back to the cold war and resurrect Jack Ryan's character to his pre-executive position days, or he dusted off a book he began a long time ago and sent it in without completing his effort. I was very disappointed, and felt as though I had a bad copy that was missing the final chapter. While some portions of this book was entertaining, I could not figure out if I was reading a romance or spy novel.Clancy tries to make a story around the 1981 Pope assassination attempt. Clancy normally researches his efforts and while I realize this is fiction, there are some huge mistakes. The biggest being the timing of the attempt. Ryan tries to get tid bits of information and scores on the Orioles-Phillies World Series. This series took place in October of 1983, the assassination attempt was May of 1981. While this may seem petty, it is indicative of the poor effort throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Clancy's best effort","review":"The book was not the worst I've read, but as a fan of Tom Clancy, I was vastly disappointed. What dissapointed me the most was the way he ended the book. It seems as if Clancy was 3/4 of the way into the story when his publisher suddenly called and told him he had 24 hours to finish and submit. I've never read such a hurried up, disappointing ending in any book, let alone a Tom Clancy book.I wouldn't recommend this book unless you are a die-hard Tom Clancy fan, as I *was*, and just have to read every one of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I've read all of Clancys books except the co-authoured ones (ops centre)Up to now i've automatically bought them in hard back when they came out.

It's as well written (style-wise) as anything else he's done, it's just that nothing really happens. No suspense, no huge dramatic moments (compare this to anything else he's written). I'm a little surprised he'd write a dud like this, even more surprised the publisher would allow it. If you're not familiar with Tom Clancy, this is not a good book to start with, if you are, this will dissapoint you. If you need a Clancy fix, re-read Executive Orders, or The Bear and the Dragon. Red Rabbit is roadkill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ops Center class writing/plot","review":"Will the real Tom Clancy please stand up!

Usually I end up taking a whole day to finish a book because I become engrossed. This book was laborious and at times I was tempted not to finish it at all. The pseudo-revisionist history should be left to authors like WEB Griffin as Clancy has proven that he can not take a historical precedent and weave them into his tail.

Red Rabbit does not live up to any of the reasons I began reading Clancy novels. The story is long and takes forever to get going and when you finally think something interesting is going to happen it doesn't. His dates are incorrect. (He has the Falklands War happening before the Pope being shot, just one of the many) He reviews old Soviet & Russian history over and over again. Enough! No one cares anymore about the Soviet Union. It's DEAD! Move on, the Russians have Thank God!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"As an avid Tom Clancy fan I found Red Rabbit quite boring. If you're aware of, or know all the characters in the Jack Ryan series, you will enjoy some of the new information about the Foley's, Greer, Ritter, Judge Moore, Jack and Cathy Ryan and even Yuri Andropov.Besides these new insights I found the book plodding. If you enjoy the action of Clancy's books you'll be let down with Red Rabbit. Conversation after conversation that might cause your eyes to glaze over a bit.Clancy is the master of the political/spy/action genre.

They were full of action, and his scene changes were very effective in setting a tense atmosphere for his thrillers. Now, those same scene changes just take you to another character who has a paragraph of limited action and 4-6 pages of inner thoughts. If I didn't understand Communism or the Cold War, part of the book may have been interesting, but I do understand both. He spends too many pages on inner thoughts and very little effort on the story.His last book, I just gave up on, and put down after 200 pages. This one, I finally just skimmed the 4-6 pages of inner thoughts and moved to the next section. In that way, I found the book better. I don't know, however, if I will ever buy another Clancey book."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I expected more from Clancy.

Although not terribly suspenseful, it might have been alright if it had been presented as a short story. Instead it is filled with so much fluff that I found it difficult not to skip through it. At times you feel like Clancy took a European vacation while writing the book and chose to share it with us in fictional form. You're sure to grow tired of Jack's failed attempts to discourage people from calling him 'Sir Jack' or the pretentious pondering that fills these pages. Give this one a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"His old books were better","review":"I loved Tom Clancy's earlier books but he's either tired of writing or has too much going on to focus on it(or he has someone else doing it like some of his paperback series).

True fans of Clancy will be disappointed and should save their time. A book on the Foley's adventure's in Iran might pique some interest...or another John Clark adventure. However, it has become apparent that Jack Ryan has run his course and trying to insert him into a real-life event has turned into a massive dud.And what year is this supposed to be any way?

It takes hundreds of pages to lead up to an outcome that is obvious from page 50. Because everything has to play out a certain way to match historical fact, there's no suspense whatsoever. And Clancy has turned Jack Ryan and his wife into flawless superpeople who are already the best in the world at what they do (spy/analyst and surgeon, respectively) in their early 30s.I'd thought \\"The Bear and The Dragon\\" was bad, but it's a masterpiece compared to \\"Red Rabbit\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you sure this isn't Clancy's first book??","review":"I think Clancy has ran out of books to write and he's just fulfilling his contract with his publisher for another book and so many words each year.

Not !!!","review":"The person who wrote \\"Red Storm Rising\\" and \\"Hunt for Red October\\" could not have written this book. The dialog is stilted and endless, the story is utterly boring, the characters (except maybe the rabbit himself) are shallow and just go through the motions, and NOTHING goes awry. Everything just happens, from the first contact with the rabbit to his arrival in the U.S. I'm thankful I got my copy at a used book store for ten bucks (and I get five back when I turn it in).

When compared to an earlier book such as The Hunt For Red October, its flaws really stand out. It meandered endlessly, had a great deal of redundancy, was condescending, and just plain boring. It's an extremely disappointing book. The Red October in comparison was a tightly-written book. My impression of Red Rabbit is that it was just a way to rake in a few dollars by its placement in the series.

Apparently, endless prattle and relentless character self-examination has replaced the research and plot development Clancy is (was?) noted for. Repetative, boring, and far too long.

Perhaps the Reader's Digest version will be palatable.If you like LeCarre, you will notice some similarities; right down to some historical references oft used in many of his works.

There is more suspense in what the Orioles will do during a game that what was in the entire text of Red Rabbit. I kept waiting for something suspenseful to happen but I should have know that as long as \\"Superman\\" Jack Ryan was on the scene, there would be no suspense. Jack would solve all.

I've read all of his fiction stuff and have loved all of them. That's why Red Rabbit was such a disappointment. I didn't think it possible for Clancy to write a spy thriller with ABSOLUTELY NO ACTION. It was a little bit interesting to read his research/speculation about how things worked in the KGB and CIA but the story went nowhere. Compounding that was the fact that we all know how the Pope assassination went. I hope he can write a more exciting story next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Rabbit","review":"I guess Tom has finally run out of ideas. \\"Red Rabbit\\" should have been named \\"Dead Rabbit\\" as it is the most boring book I've read in the last 10 years.

I was surprised and couldn't believe that Tom was doing this to me and the great Jack Ryan. I dozed off several times and finally speed read the rest of the book.

Adventure, suspense, thrills? If you were disappointed by Dragon's and Bear's you ain't seen nothing yet. This Rabbit's no 'pot boiler' just Rabbit stew. A 'hash' of the usual cast. OK, enough of the cooking cliches. Most of what Tom writes has nothing to do with the story. Tom rightly points out, the British do make the best beer in the world! - but a British pint is 20 fluid ounces not the 16 ounces the wayward eye surgeons are apparently served.

Granted the book is a work of fiction; but it is a work of fiction centered around actual events and several actual people. So if the book is centered around the assasination attempt on the pope that occured in May of 1981, why is it that:1. Early in the book, 'Red Rabbit' describes being at his job for 9 1/2 years; right out of college in 1973 (which would make the book fall of 1982)2. At one point, Greer refers to \\"that rookie shortstop for the Orioles...Ripken?\\"; who made his major league debut in August of 813. Ryan also refers to transferring his sporting enthusiasm to baseball after he 'lost the Colts'; which happened in early 1984.The story isn't terrible thus far; I don't need gobs and gobs of action; but if you are going to tie into real-life events, at least be consistant."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEYOND AWFUL!","review":"I have just driven from Chicago to Atlanta, listening to Red Rabbit on CD.

I think I will give them to him as a gag gift this Christmas! The thought of having read an UNabridged version makes me tremble.

You know the good guys will win, so the fun lies in seeing how all the new military hardware (plus true American grit) would make it all possible.Clancy's new book, Red Rabbit, tries to break with Clancy's successful formula -- and it's a real stinker.The book is set in the early '80s, so we don't get to see any cool new toys. And anyone born before 1975 can tell you the Pope is going to survive the assassination attempt.So what does that leave us? It leaves us with Clancy attempting to re-create The Day of the Jackal.Well, I read that book already, and it's much better than Red Rabbit.If you're a big Jack Ryan fan, this might be a cute book for you. But 600 pages is still an awful lot to slog through, just to find out more what Jack was like back when he only had two kids.Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never buy Clancy again","review":"Worse than his last book. He is either using a computer to write the dialogue or he has lost it. Does not even sound like english as we speak it. Embarassing. No plot, no action. No comparison to his earlier books. If the name was not Clancy, no publisher would have touched this. Maybe the worst novel I have ever read.Clancy and/or the publisher should give all buyers a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Rabbit is a red herring","review":"Clancy has apparently followed the path of past successful writers: rest on your laurels by writing mediocre books and count on past readers to keep buying them. After reading 380 pages of Red Rabbit I am still waiting for a fully developed plot to appear, and even just a hint of action. So far, no success. What I have found is minute detail, most of which is useless and repeated ad naseum. For those of you hoping to gain insight on Ryan's beginnings with the CIA, you won't find it here. There's as much on his wife's \\"adventures\\" as an eye surgeon as there is on her husband, and there is more interesting detail on the early career of the Foley's than on Ryan. The book, in summary, is a ..., and hopefully Clancy won't try to dump on his faithful readers again as he has done with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"embarassing","review":"i hope this is the effort that finally catches up with clancy and exposes his limitations -- i hope it comes out that his last wife turns out to be the real author (ex. fick francis) this effort was an insult---there is no other way to describe it i give credit to his storytelling talents but there were maybe 200 pagesof quality in this effort this is just another example of the rich getting richer and an author not even willing to take a gamble -------lets put jack ryan as head of merrill lynch in this market and see what a hero is"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jack Ryan getting tired","review":"The Ryan saga goes back in time. Clancy as usual gets long winded and seems to gt tired of the story by delivering a sub par ending.

Frankly, I was hoping and praying that some of the idiotic plot twists would SOMEHOW get resolved or explained but that was not to be. too bad, I hope I am able to stomach another run at his latest work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mental Intrigue Replaces Physical Action","review":"It seems many of the reviewers who wanted more action failed to see that this tended to be more of a phsycological thriller with classic Clancy sprinkled throughout.What goes on in the mind of a defector? What goes on in the mind of the agent? My favorite part of this book is the contact between Rabbit and Foley. The mental anguish, intrigue and excitement replaces the gun-toting chase scenes.I also liked Clancy's use of real events from the past to interwine with his story. It doesn't replace \\"Without Remorse\\" as my favorite Clancy novel but it did keep me involved to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"As this book was very long and very boring, I was waiting for a surprise at the end. But no, nothing... All what we know is that Ryan just hate to sleep far from his wife (it is explained at least five times in the book). People are waiting for other people and nothing happens. Many real stories are by far much more interesting than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"tom's review","review":"Of the thousands of books I have read, this is perhaps the most lame. There is no story, there is no character development, \\"hero\\" Jack Ryan does nothing except be the recipient of adulation from various factions of the U.S.Government while doing absolutely nothing except resuming smoking and whining about being away from his wife. The setting is the 80's but the dialog and thinking processes are 50's. How in the world did this ever get published. I read it from cover to cover, (if there is a story its a 50 page one in a 600 page book), because i couldn't believe it would stay so inane, second grade writing at best. I threw my hard-back book in the trash, wouldn't consider selling it to anyone to have to suffer through the same ridiculousness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"Tom Clancy is good at two things-- action, and the description of military equipment. He has always been terrible at everything else.This book is everything else--an utterly tedious work where the reader is forced to wade through some 600 odd-pages of Mr. Clancy's vulgarity and mindless conservatism without any action or the description of any military equipment at all.Clancy has apparently forgotten why people buy his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a re-read","review":"Very much a let down. I have never found my self hoping for the end of a Clancy book, but at about the 450 page mark, I was bored and waiting for the end, which came rather abruptly. Why have his last three books ended so quickly? I so not see the reason to put the Jack Ryan character into a real life situation that everyone knows about in one way or another. Any Clancy fan knows the Pope is not killed in the assassination attempt, and there was no drama, or signifigance to this novel. Come on Tom, get back to the basics. Fictional situations presented in a believable way, with a good, solid story. We already know the older characters, and do not need to re-visit them. How about Ben Goodley as a new main protaganist, because as much as I love the series and Jack Ryan as a character, he is getting a little long in the tooth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make it stop...","review":"Did Clancy actually write this book? I know that nowadays some writers lend their names to books that they conceptualized, but didn't write, and this seems like one of them. Nothing like the Clancy of old.

Red Rabbit takes over 600 pages of aimless conversations to follow a simple and obvious course. What small suspense there is comes as a result of Tommy taking 50-100 pages to tell us the most simple information, while we plod through side narratives which are meaningless to the reader and the plot.Reads like a high school novel written by someone being paid by the word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Rabbit","review":"The first thing I did when I saw the book was turn to the end to see how many pages there were. After suffering through \\"The Bear and the Dragon\\", I did not to read a lot of nonsense fluff. 600 odd pages seemed to be in order for a decent read but was that ever disappointing. 5 pages into the story, I placed the book aside for several hours before resuming. I could barely manage to read for 2 to 3 hours at a time because of boring mundane trite. I bought the book on the 8th and did not finish until the 14th. Normally a good book is an all night read and is an only put down to feed the animals.If you want to read a good Clancy book, read \\"Without Remorse\\"! If you want to read a really bad Clancy book, then read \\"Red Storm Rising\\" or \\"The Bear and the Dragon\\". \\"Red Rabbit\\" comes some where in the line with these last two.

But this book is a misfire and a mess. It's even badly (or barely) edited -- typos, historical mistakes, repeated sentences in different chapters, on the whole about 200 pages too long. I'm sure it was hard to take Ryan back to an earlier point in his career, but if this is the result, then either take him forward or drop him. Just re-read The Hunt for Red October; at least it had suspense and plot complications."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it.","review":"Others have said it already. There's no drama.

Nothing wrong with that, but it doesn't make exciting reading.I greatly prefer any of his other novels. They have action and excitement to keep me up late reading. In contrast, Red Rabbit is slow moving and has a predictable conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rewriting history is not a good idea for fiction.","review":"I was rather disappointed with Red Rabbit, precisely because there is a lot of that history that I lived, and seeing it reorganized as Clancy did bothers me. A reader ought to ask the following things. 1. When was President Reagan shot? 2. When and where was the Pope shot? 3. When was the Falklands campaign? 4. When did the great bull market of the 1980s begin? 5. That fall, what teams played a seven-game World Series? 6. When did Leonid Brezhnev die? 7.

I wish I had waited and read the other reviews on this site.This book is a disgrace. Slow and without any sub-plots, it drags on and on and provides none of the enjoyment Clancy's earlier works have.I'm not a particularly good writer so I'll refer you to the other \\"one star\\" reviews which I think are very accurate.If you have not bought this book yet, don't bother. It adds nothing to the characters that are featured in the other novels and, because it is a prequel, you will not have a gap in the timeline should Clancy be able to resurrect his writing and carry on the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A novel from the cutting room floor?","review":"I concur with other reader's disappointment at this very ho-hum Clancy novel. My suspicion is that it was duct-taped together from unused earlier work to meet a contractual obligation, but that may just be my cynical mind at work. Like another reviewer, I'm also a Brit, and I was irritated by several minor inaccuracies in descriptions of things British. (examples: 'station wagon' = 'estate car' not 'estate wagon', the derided Taster's Choice coffee is a US brand, not a UK one) not very important, but if things you know about are wrong, what else is? Clancy/Ryan also comes over as insufferably condescending and anti-Brit, anti-Russian. This is quite a skill, given the cardboard characterizations other reviewers have noted. At best, an airplane book, if rather heavy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great dissapointment from a former die-hard TC fan","review":"Tom,You owe your readers more than this.

A little therapy might clear up that fear of flying."},{"rating":"2","title":"MAybe as good as any of Clancy's efforts","review":"I've read all of Tom Clancy's novels and a few of his non fiction books, this one is pretty good. The setting is a few months after Patriot Games and I guess a few months before The Hunt for Red October and I think is one of two (Patriot Games is the other)to have any significant blending of real historical characters with fictional characters.You do have some swearing but not really any more or any worse than previous efforts, Catholicism does have a big place (but no more than other Clancy books),and some will be offended by Clancy's obvious great admiration for Ronald Reagan and his policies. Ignore just those not really intrusive parts and enjoy the book, it's shorter than The Bear and The Dragon and doesn't have the unlikely future history or possibly too good to be true weapons."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bear & The Dragon Was Better....","review":"I may be the only person who thinks so.... But ... I thought that The Bear & The Dragon was a much better book. I found my attention wandering quite a bit, althought I did finish it in a couple of days. The telling thing? I haven't re-read it, yet, and I've had it since the day it was released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book by Committee","review":"This is about as far as Clancy can take us from his early works filled with well-researched technicalities of military hardware and action filled pages. This is a major disappointment. It seems pretty clear that he has used a staff of writers and simply lent his name to the collective product. Way too much sophomoric philosophy and far too little of the old Clancy. Next time I'll wait for the paperback. Hardcover prices are too high for this effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleeping won't be a problem","review":"Dull and uneventful have never described Clancy's books until now. If not for his writing style and my love for Jack Ryan's world, I would have tossed this book after the first 100 pages. In fact, the book could have been about 300 pages shorter and would have the same impact for the reader.Not intriguing. Not interesting. Not thrilling. A few fun tidbits. But way too much Ryan talking about his financial savvy, kids glued to VCRs, and topics discussed repeatedily when once would have had a better effect.Of course, Clancy sets up his next book when it appears Jack Ryan will be an instrumental part in Reagan's plan to out spend Russia and crush their economy. So unless you're an econ major, that will be a snoozer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining for Clancy fans, others should skip it","review":"Red Rabbit was a pretty good read, but disappointing to a long-time Clancy fan. Clancy always makes me want to continue reading, but there are some major flaws in Red Rabbit.1. Way too much profanity, nearly all of it unnecessary. He needs an editor.2. Clancy continues to use the same clichés to excess. Everybody is a \\"pro\\". Espionage is a \\"game\\" and everybody abides by the \\"rules\\". The repetitious language gets boring.3. For a character who supposedly understands the need for secrecy, Jack Ryan spills a lot of details to people who don't need to know what he tells them.4. The plot was much simpler than I expect from Clancy. Not really any twists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrogance Showing","review":"Clancy is really starting to believe his own press. I saw him give a TV interview, and he was aloof, obnoxious, and downright arrogant. Red Rabbit is a complete failure of a book, filled with self-indulgent meandering and pontificating. What a waste of time, money, and paper. Go read LeCarre if you want to experience a sound demonstration of the use of language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trust this Clancy fan, do NOT buy/read this book","review":"I echo what many others have said: I'm a huge Tom Clancy (and Larry Bond) fan, and read mosts books of this genre. I loved Red Storm Rising, Rainbow 6, etc. I own all Clancy's books -- in hardcover.But, Oh My God is this book bad. Nothing happens for 500 pages. Ryan woolgathers in his head regarding married life, weather in England, coffee, Russia, the role of the CIA, it is just painful to read so many pages about so little.Clancy's previous book (Bear and Dragon) was also sorely in need of an editor, but I was looking forward to that next Clancy book so much I didn't realize how bad it was as well, and that it foreshadowed a general downward slide.Again, please trust a (formerly) huge Clancy fan when I say this book isn't worth your time for free. Get a copy of Without Remorse, Debt of Honor/Executive Orders, or any of the other Clancy books I've mentioned.

Read Daniel Silva instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I couldn't wait until the release date - I read TC almost non-stop- the Bear and the Dragon was brilliant- I bought Red Rabbit on opening day - 3 weeks later I am on page 80- Need I say more-Has TC gotten too fat and sassy to use the creativity that made him famous ? - What a drag !"},{"rating":"1","title":"A lack of suspence, pacing","review":"In previous works Clancy's ability to build suspense and create believable characters is what sustained the reader through the flat spots, but this book lacks both these characteristics. Further, as noted by others, the dialog is exceptionally wooden which accentuates the poor pacing. (Parenthetically I note that if Ryan calls his wife \\"babe\\" one more time, I'll scream; I habitually refer to my wife as \\"sweetheart\\" but not every single time! I also note that, contrary to what another reviewer stated, Starbucks was started in 1971 but given it's extremely small size at the time and the fact that it seems to have had no retail stores, Ryan would have had to be clairvoyant to buy stock in it.) Save your money unless you need a soporific."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor","review":"If any writer on the planet submited this book to every publisher on the planet, they would have gotten a thousand reject slips. This is not only Clancy's worst, it is the worst novel I've read in several years, and I read fifty to sixty per year. I think Clancy needed the money, maybe had some bad investments, and banged out this nonsense to get it. This book could have been cut to fifty pages, and could have been an opening chapter to some other book. NOW, watch- the paper back will have great reviews: \\"action packed page turner, kept me up all night...\\" They all lie, big time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look what Tom Clancy found in his attic","review":"While looking aroung the attic one day, Tom Clancy found an old manuscript he wrote many years ago. The writing was boring, the plot dull and the characters unbelievable. \\"What the heck\\" he said to himself, \\"I'm famous\\". So the book was published, and millions of us bought and read (as much of it as we could) this drivel. Tom laughed all the way to the bank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Poor Tom","review":"Just finished reading this poor novel.Come on Tom you can do better than this.I guess when you make your first million or more you can pump out the books the way McDonald's pumps out hamburgers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Re-read an old Clancy instead","review":"Perhaps deadened by the numerous Clancy-sponsored, 'insert author's name here' Op-center paperbacks (or his non-fiction backgrounders on military topics), Clancy forgot the critical element of excitement in this one. Set back in the early '80s, we observe a very linear, very boring story play out over 600 pages--600+ pages you'll never get back. There were hundreds of opportunities for the plot to take an unexpected, interesting turn, yet in every case, everything went according to a dull plan. I finally realized that no twists were ever coming about 75 pages from the end and agonizingly paged through to the ending very disappointed.Here's a plot as exciting as the one in Red Rabbit: Cops learn of a bank robbery plot. They set up bugs in the hideout and overhear the plan. Police hide inside the bank to catch robbers. Robbers enter the bank. Police catch robbers. The End.Re-read an old one of Clancy's novels instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Novel Authored Solely By Clancy","review":"Remember the Sesame Street game: \\"One of These Things Is Not Like The Others\\"? If you played that game with Tom Clancy's books, this book would be the answer. He usually writes entertaining techno-thrillers, but not this time. He's certainly entitled to an occasional screw-up. However, this one was a major boner!This has to be one of the most boring books I've ever read in my life, though I did actually slog through it. Too little plot, and too much dragging on and on. It might have been a good short story or novella, or a chapter in some other book. It almost seems like he had to fill a page quota.Do not buy this book, even from the bargain bin. It is not worth paying for. If you feel you must read this cure for insommnia, check it out of the library. Be sure to return it on time. I didn't, and ended up resenting the overdue fines I had to pay for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy has completely lost it","review":"I thought The Bear and the Dragon was bad--but given how much I loved his earlier works, decided to give him one more try.He has completely lost his ability to write a thriller. Very boring and drawn out. It does not matter how much you liked his earlier books--you will hate this one.The same observations are repeated over and over again every chapter. His editor needs to be fired. Very predictable also.It was a good idea to go back in time with Jack Ryan and look at well known historical event, but he completely blows it. I do not think he even cares what he is writing.I will never read another Clancy book and suggest nobody read this long piece of garbage--total waste of time and money. I wish you could give negative stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insult to Marines","review":"A good story idea, but a mediocre execution.Worst, however, Clancy lost the bubble on Jack Ryan.There are inconsistencies in the character in his relationship to his previous and subsequent \\"history,\\" but most notably in his personal character.Clancy seems to have decided that vulgarity sells books. Using that vulgarity in the character of Jack Ryan,, a Marine officer, has definitely cheapened Clancy as a novelist, and is a real insult to all Marines - officer or enlisted.Shame on you, Tom Clancy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh -- why did I finish it?","review":"This book reminds me of some particularly gruesome c-rations I remember choking down. When I complained about how vile they were, the Gunny asked me why I ate them if they were so bad. \\"Well, they're chow\\" I replied.Well, this was a Clancy book and it wasn't supposed to be this bad. I believe that Tom had a lot of spare text -- philosophizing about the roots of the USSR's dowbfall -- that his editors had begged him to take out of other novels; and he likely cobbled it all together for this offering. Needing a plot to tie it all together, I think he borrowed heavily on Claire Sterling's _The Pope Must Die_ as the skeleton to hang this offal on. And it is offal -- or something that sounds like it.Will I read another Clancy novel? Probably. I have long flights coming up and -- well -- its chow."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm still waiting for something to happen!","review":"The first 50 pages and the last 50 pages were pretty good Tom Clancy writing. The stuff in between was just that -- stuff. This was just a one-dimensional book - it had one plot - none of the subplots that Clancy's books always have. If you're a Clancy fan read it b/c it's still Clancy, if you're not, pick another one to read first!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Rabbit Needs to Die a Timely Death","review":"I am a fan of Tom Clancy, but this seems to be his worst effort so far, except for the the collaborative work he has done. While it is interesting about the Foleys, the whole idea is small and drawn out interminably. I also found this novel to be his most jingoistic so far. Now, that is really going some. Clancy is an ultranationalist and has no time for the cultures of other countries whatsoever. The comments about the UK and Italy were especially loathsome. I am a Canadian and yes,we have to wait to for medical procedures occasionally just like the British. But, we do not have 40 million people (more than the population of my country) without medical insurance because they cannot afford it like the USA. I finished the book because it that is just the way I am, but it was not worth my time and I really am tired of Americans thinking that there country is the best place on the earth to live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save a bullet for me","review":"At least that's what I told my wife if she ever saw me pick up a Tom Clancy book again. What a painful experience. There have been a lot of comments about the profanity in the dialogue but stupidity would be a larger concern. I have heard more intelligent conversations late at night at local beer joints than in these hallowed halls of government. It took Clancy (and us) 600 plus pages to get through a story that LeCarre would have made brilliant in half that space. Tom is like an aging ball player who has hung around too long. Hang it up partner and thanks for the memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shouldn't have started","review":"Despite the numerous poor ratings, I gave this a shot. Like so many others, I was very disappointed. It's not an action story - there's three shots fired around page 625. It's not a spy story - every \\"spy-like\\" effort goes perfectly and there is little ... actually no ... intrigue. Everyone has a bad day, and I'll give Tom Clancy another chance on his next book. But once I started I felt compelled to finish in the hope that it would get better. It didn't. If you are looking for classic Clancy fiction, take my advice - skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've ever struggled through.","review":"I like Tom Clancy. With the exception of the new hardcover now out, I've read all of the books he alone has written. One of my favorite books by any author is his \\"Red Storm Rising.\\" However, this one, by far, is his worst. It is also one of the worst books I've ever completed reading. I wonder if Clancy was really the author. He (or his characters) drone on and on endlessly discussing the same internal questions over and over. Was this book ever reviewed by an editor? I suspect it wasn't. If the fluff could have been removed from this junk it would have been at least 25% shorter. Even if you're a Clancy fan, skip this one. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"This book is quite interesting and has its moments, though very few and far between, but it is quite possibly his worst novel.I actually enjoyed this one over The Bear and the Dragon but its about 300 pages too long. Its repetitive, long winded, and lacks suspense as everything is easy to figure out.When the defection finally happens, after about 500 pages of talking about it, it lacks that special something. The escape and Pope scene, which are the two main points of the book, both turn out bland and not that exciting when they happen.I hope Teeth of the Tiger, Clancy's last Ryanverse novel, turns out well because The Bear and now the Rabbit have been real stinkers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why oh why do I buy?","review":"Yet more regret in buying hardcover when I should have waited for a used paperback copy. ARGH! No suspense, no involvement for Jack Ryan, too much political blabber... I'm just simply disgusted.Where the hell is the Clancy that wrote Cardinal and Patriot Games??? Where is the author that once excelled at plot? What drives a man into excessive exposition? ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Rabbit","review":"A BIG disappointment! Sure there is Clancy's trademark attention to detail and manly repartee, BUT... This failure of the imagination offers none of the panoramic excitement and suspense to be found in RED STORM RISING, et al.One would think that a big event like the attempted murder of the Pontifex Maximus would provide the framework for a robust tale, not the anemic one found in RED RABBIT."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great 250-page novel - too bad this one is 600 pages!","review":"Tom Clancy had it all. His first four novels were terrific, and I literally stood in line to buy each new volume. Then, Mr. Clancy somehow made the grave mistake of believing he was above editing. His last four or five books are readable, but barely. Red Rabbit is unquestionably the most overwritten book I've ever read--which is to say Clancy could have used ten words when he used 40. Red Rabbit is WAY too long, and the plot drags along in places in a way I've never seen in a book from a major publishing company. The backstory on Jack Ryan should have been interesting, but this boring manuscript makes me seriously wonder why I would ever buy another Tom Clancy book again. If you love this author's early work, avoid this book--it will singlehandedly destroy the Jack Ryan franchise for you forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Jack Ryan Book So Far","review":"I have to say I was pretty disappointed with this book. I think the same story could have been told in a book about a third of the size. Clancy repeats himself continuously and parts of the book even seem out of order, confirming my believe that Clancy writes his books in parts and sews them together at the end. I plodded my way through this book, reading an endless amount of rhetorical questions, waiting for some sort of Clancy pay off and was bitterly disappointed. A long time ago, Jack Ryan history left real world history. They shouldn't be merged back together, should they?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to reread the earlier books","review":"What was he thinking when he wrote this? I need another few million bucks? As his novels have evolved, you tend to wait longer for the action to occur. But it finally occurs in the other novels. Not in this one. Absolutely nothing exciting happens. If you want an inside look at the spy business, this will be of some interest. If you want entertainment, start with Red October and read forward."},{"rating":"1","title":"A 100-page story squeezed into 618 pages......","review":"Very disappointing.Writing a book about a popular character in a setting 20-years ago, a writer can make them look omniscient. Examples in this book: Having invested in Starbucks, the Japanese ecomonmy is riding for a fall, the Soviet economy is very shaky (and even the internal reports gloss over the problems) - all these in the very early part of the book. In this book, even Jack's inward thoughts are almost completely error free. This happened in other Jack Ryan books, but not in this concentration.And then, as it becomes clear how little is actually going to happen in this entire 618-page tome, the shock sets in: That's all there is?Few plot threads, mostly uninteresting characters. I hope the next one is better....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take A Pass On This One","review":"This is not Tom Clancy's best day. I was disappointed in \\"Red Rabbit\\". It's too late for me, I already bought the book. But my advice to everyone else is --- take pass on this one. Read Bowden's riveting \\"Blackhawk Down\\" and Remick's outstanding allegory for what it is to be an American, \\"West Point\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Rabbit","review":"This book is booring! You can predict from the first 30 pages what is going to happen in this book. There are no surprises at all. The plot is extremely simple.I am a big Tom Clancy fan, so I bought the book before it was published. Boy, was I disappointed. What I have always admired about Clancy is his stories paint scenarios that eerily seem like they can come true. So, when Ryan predicts the downfall of the Japanese economy, which already happened 20 years ago, I was not impressed.This is not up to Clancy's standards. He has checked out on this one. Or did he really write it?Basically the previous reviewer, Henriqe N Teixeira nailed it on the head.Don't waste your time or money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"By far, Clancy's worst","review":"A very large disappointment. The extent to which this novel ispadded out to it's 600+ pages by meaningless repetition ofmundane facts, observations, and personal preferences; issurely a signal that Clancy has far too many irons in thefire. None of the tension of his other Jack Ryan books existshere. Even the hope that by setting this 20+ years in thepast, he could have some fun with the 20/20 hindsight, isalmost entirely wasted. Main prophesy? That Ripken kid surelooks like he's going places. Yes, the baseball Ripken.That's how exciting this book is. For me, this is 2 in a row,I finished Bear & Dragon wondering what had happened to theusually very entertaining imagination of Mr. Clancy. I finishedthis one thinking it must either be all used up, or the fallof the \\"Evil Empire\\" has just left him without a proper foil."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slow book","review":"I am usually a fan of Tom Clancy's fictional works, but not this one. I struggled to finish this book because of the slow pace. The book is filled with useless dialog which adds to the feeling of it just dragging on and on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Rabbit... unpublished if not written by Clancey","review":"KGB insider plans to defect and tell his secrets. The CIA brings him out according to plan. End of story.No suspense. No suprises. No action.Let me look again, maybe this was written by Tim Clancey, not the Tom Clancey that wrote Hunt for Red October and Red Storm Rising.I guess he had a contract to write another, and ran out of time. He also ran out of ideas, so he just rehashed all the cliches he invented for his previous books, redeveloped (not as well) all the characters he already invented, and left out the suspense that he couldn't figure out how to work in.I felt cheated. Of my money, but moreso of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on Tom Get Back To The Good Stuff","review":"This has to be, of the Jack Ryan series, the worst of the lot. I am highly disapointed. It is very dry, slow in action and plot. I love the series, or would have given it only one star. Yes it fills in some blanks, but after \\"The Bear and The Dragon\\" this book seems like someone else wrote it trying to copy his style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy needs to find new charcters and revive his writing","review":"You will be extremely disappointed- long and rambling without much techno or thriller. Not worth buying, even in paperback.Borrow the copy from the library and save the $$."},{"rating":"1","title":"Becoming complacent","review":"Tom Clancy must feel that his status is secured in the literary world. Why? Well, simply put, this book is nowhere near the level with with Tom Clancy is capable of. It seems as though he (or quite possibly his publisher) felt that just putting a book out there with his name on it would sell thousands. Alas, that may well be the case.For me, the book seemed to drag on and on with no direction or purpose. While the story is centered around the assassination plot, there was no depth. It made me feel as though I were reading an amateur author's first attempt at writing. The characters were two-dimensional, the plot was weak for most of the book, and it simply was NOT a Tom Clancy novel.All things considered, I would recommend passing on this book. Tom, if you're out there, come on now. I am surprised you put your name on sometihng like this. You of all people are capable of so much better work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Clancy Disappointment","review":"I'm a Clancy fan, having read all his other novels, and I must admit that this was a disappointment. What makes Clancy great is the treatment of so many story lines at once, keeping you interested in various story threads. In this book, though, the number of threads is greatly reduced and the reader is left wanting more.Reading this book is worth it only if you are a Clancy fan in need of a fix. Since I'm in that category, I can overlook many of the flaws but still ask Mr. Clancy to please take more time with his next novel and truly deliver like he knows how."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's coming... it's coming... it's coming... Nope, never did","review":"Clancy must have written this one from left-over notes and in a few spare moments here and there. Lot's of opportunities for the suspensful plot twists and turns of his early novels, but it never happens here. We do get a lot of detail about what the characters have for breakfast and how difficult the transition is for Ryan's \\"eye-cutter\\" wife to operate in Britain vs. the USA. A big disappointment for Clancy fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedantic at best","review":"Clancy always has a political point(s) to make, but he really over does here. His criticism of the British socialized medical system may be on point, but seemed exaggerated and supercilious to the book's plot. The defector may have had a bout of conscience, but Clancy spends far too many words agonizing over the moral dilemma. Jack Ryan is one of Clancy central characters, but he is unnecessary to the main plot. He was however, the vehicle for Clancy to moralize. The novel could have been a page turner, if it were 200 pages instead of 600 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I've read all of Tom Clancy's novels, and have loved all of them . . . until this one. Where all of Clancy's previous novels have been full of intertwining plot threads which weave and wind until they all come together and culminate in an explosive, breathtaking climax, this book just plods along and leaves the reader waiting for something interesting to happen, which unfortunately never develops. The usual complexity of his plot twists just aren't there, and what looked to be a promising and interesting story never really goes anywhere.If you're a casual Tom Clancy reader, or are new to Clancy's works, stay away from this dud because it's really not typical of his usual high-quality of writing and suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Dog","review":"This book should have been titled \\"Red Dog\\", because it was a real barker. In his last two books, Clancy has become a boring, plodding writer who often strays into lengthy discussions by his characters that have nothing to do with the plot he is trying to develop. I have read all of his books, but \\"Red Rabbit\\" took me longer to read than all the others combined. I will not read another Clancy book unless he somehow returns to his old form."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Effort for a Great Author","review":"This book took almost half of it's length getting started. It was good when it finally got started but way too much of the book was quite dry. Unusual for Clancy. It's like Clancy was just trying to fill most of the pages.Glad I read it but it was not the book you'd expect from Clancy and I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been called \\"Hunt for a Red Editor\\"","review":"One third the story, three times the words of Clancy's best. The plot: It's 1982. Russia is the Evil Empire. A KGB defector reveals a Soviet plot to kill the Pope. The Pope is shot but lives and Jack Ryan is somewhat involved. That's the story. Period. The other 620 pages delve into the fascinating details of Jack's preference for coffee over tea, the quality of Russian fur hats, the incompetence of British eye surgeons and why English faucets have both hot and cold handles, plus a million other pointless musings. After every journey down a new stream of consciousness, Clancy throws in a flashback to Patriot Games, Jack's helicopter crash, his career on Wall Street or his Jesuit education. Then it's time to repeat some other opinions of English beer, Russian architecture or what's for dinner. This could have been a fairly entertaining 200-pager but instead Clancy's bloated prose is as boring a 20-year old history lesson."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN!!!","review":"Let me begin by stating that Tom Clancy was one of my favorite novelists, however he remains a casulty of the breakup of the Soviet Union. He hasn't really written a decent book since and this is a [bad] attempt to regain some of the past glory of his brilliant stories before the collapse of the Soviet Union.This book contains no suspense at all. The characters do not encounter any difficulties with anything they attempt, which would remain a problem even if this book was a third the length.And you could easily chop two thirds of this novel by freeing us from having to endure endless and repetitive information regarding the saintly qualities of all of the lead characters. Did I mention the repetitive nature of this information? Did I mention the repetitive nature of this information? Did I mention the repetitive nature of this information?By far the worst Tom Clancy novel ever and right up there as one of the worst novels ever written.Signed,A very disappointed fan"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"Clancy must have had a book due under contract and this was the best he could throw together. I'm a huge fan of the Jack Ryan series and was eagerly looking forward to the \\"next installment\\". Well, instead Clancy hands us a historical look at Ryan that is far from thrilling and never captivating. If you really must read this novel, check it out from the library - then you'll be getting your moneys worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Clancy yet","review":"There are not many positive sides to this piece of literature. The story is somewhat interesting if you are interested in cold-war politics and especially the intelligence service. However, personally I found the book too much biased to my liking even in this aspect. The characters are not very interesting and the way Clancy portraits Jack Ryan as a totally flawless jack-of-all-trades made me sick. Add a simply awful dialogue and a plot thinner than George W Bushs intellect and you have a book not worth reading in an isolation cell at Guantanamo.Considering that I really enjoyed Mr Clancys early cold-war fiction this makes it even more disappointing.How unbelievable as it may seem, this book is really as silly as its title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars for the rabbit","review":"Someone saw I was reading this and asked me how it was. I replied, \\"America GOOD! Russia BAD! Capitalism GOOD! Communism BAD!\\" I am a member of the 'read 'em all since Red October' club and I, too, am wishing I had read some reviews first. Stunningly bad dialogue. Heavy-handed jingoism. Blustering machismo, we've got it all. The Starbucks reference was when I almost stopped but I hung in there. Why I don't know. Really feels like Clancy phoned this one in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Rabbit","review":"Redundant, no imagination, the hook ending was not worth the painful read.

Too slow and full of minutiae that was OK 10/15 years ago but is now well documented and passe. Does not seem to be written by Clancy. Maybe if I have the patience I will get to the ending!!A slow read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need more Jack Ryan","review":"Clancy hasn't written a good book since Executive Order. Bear and the Dragon is awful, as it this. No suspense, totaly predictable, my fifth grader could have figured it out. Clancy should be embarrassed. Sum of All Fears was one of his best. Executive Order was fantasitic. Red Rabbit was a waste of my time. I put down Patterson's \\"The Beach House\\" in favor of this. After struggling with Rabbit for 4 weeks, I finished it, then finished Beach House in 2 days. A fantastic book! I would highly recommend it, even though Alex Cross is not a character.Which brings up a good point. Ryan is only as good as Domingo Chevez, who wasn't in Red Rabbit. Maybe we have something here...I hope and pray Clancy comes up with his next book a winner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom Clancy Contracts SWS","review":"It appears that Tom Clancy has been struck with SWS (Successful Writers Syndrome). Typical of so many successful writers, Tom doesn't appear to have to respond to an editor. He can write as much as he wants, whether or not it advances the plot or develops characterisation. You can know how the book will end by page 17 and yet still get paid lots of big bucks. Sorry, Tom. It's harder to write a short book than a long one and I don't think you broke a sweat on this one... and I'm a FAN! There may be a modestly interesting 125 page book in here but I doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"the book where nothing happens","review":"Tom Clancy seems to have lost the plot so to speak, and fails to find it in Red Rabbit. Essentially *nothing* happens in this book until about page 600 or so and then it's all over in 3 pages, so save yourself a lot of time and money by reading these pages in the bookshop as you browse and then replace the book on the shelf and walk out.If you are looking for an action packed thriller this is not the book to read, instead go and get Patriot Games or Hunt for Red October."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as bad as all that","review":"Yes, it seemed like capitalist propaganda. Yes, we all know how it's going to come out if we're middle aged and if we've read the newspapers since we've been adults. Yes, Clancy has done way better in all the books he actually wrote except for \\"Rainbow Six\\". Yes, he's pretty heavy handed about advertising his previous book, \\"Patriot Games\\". But some Clancy fans will want to read \\"Red Rabbit\\" anyway. Most of life is not an extreme thriller, and so, I suppose, is Jack Ryan's life. \\"Red Rabbit\\" is not as bad as the \\"Net Force\\" books that he phones in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insipid warmed-up soup","review":"..... The only improvements from \\"The Bear and the Dragon\\" (THAT one really was THE PITS!!!) are the lack of the lurid details and about 500 less pages. \\"One-star\\" is already too much, the contents of this book are not even worth the cost of the paper it's printed on. This is the end of my buying books by this writer: sorry, Mr Clancy, it was nice while it lasted (I guess from \\"Red October\\", original version, to \\"Cardinal of the Kremlin\\"), before those fat payments on account/commission made you forget how to write and how to deal with the characters of your books. Never a good writer, but at least you could provide the reader with some interest with curious technological stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and tedious","review":"Perhaps it's time for Clancy to hang up his boots. Red Rabbit is uninspired and frankly boring. Fans (like me) who have always found the Ryan tales an excellent airplane/beach read must be wondering why a good, potentially exciting, plot was wasted with endless repetition (count the number of \\"get out of Dodges\\"), bad research (Clancy's England is unlike the one I grew up in) and unlikely opinion. The few occasions things looked to be getting interesting fizzled away to nothing. Ryan's younger character was not really believable and unlikely to develop into the Ryan of later books.

This book was definitely inferior, and a waste of both time and money.

Dawn the next day found me literally holding my eyes open with my fingers to get to the end. That will not happen to anyone with this book. It is simply too formulaic. While Frederick Forsythe could turn an even less successful attempted assassination of Charles de Gaulle into the very suspenseful Day of the Jackal, Clancy has much less luck with the attempt on the life of the Pope. The idea actually has the potential for Clancy to have made a much better story, but he wastes it on showing how much he knows about the arcane world of spies and counter spies and on how much he thinks America is better than Soviet Russia was and how many hot stocks Ryan can identify before they take off. Sort of John O'Hara of the Big Board.There was never a willing suspension of disbelief and this book badly needed at least one, or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wimpy","review":"I am a longtime Clancy fan and have read all his books. The thing I found most objectionable about this book was that Jack Ryan, who just previously saved the Prince from assasination and fought off various attempts to kill him spends most of the book agonizing over whether he is doing the right thing by taking a relatively non-hazardous field assignment.

This is Clancy's worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"terribly boring.","review":"that says it all. make no mistake, i'm a clancy fan but in this novel, it seems to me that the author is experimenting in a different style of writing which has a shallow plot not typical of clancy. what's worst is when i listened to the audio book, the narrator's voice was so monotonous as if i was in a seance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloooooooowwwww","review":"An easy book to put down. After his last novel I thought that was it. Then I thought that maybe someone else wrote it and I would give him one more try. Lord, what happened to the Clancy that wrote \\"Red October\\"? I made it half way through \\"Red Rabbit\\" hoping for something exciting to happen and finally gave up. Didn't finish.There was too much political analysis here for me. I don't really care about the character of Lenin or Stalin. I know they were bad guys. I don't need Clancy laying it out for me in excruciating detail.It may be time for the author to see a \\"pshrink\\". (What's up with that anyway?)Try some Bill Buckley's Blackford Oakes or Ken Follett's WWII spy thrillers. This was the last Clancy I will try."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"After waiting that long for something better than \\"Net-Force\\" Clancy fell down. Clancy's usual strength, the underlying plot, was dated, rehashed, and weak; and the meaningless rambling jingoistic \\"good-guy-American\\" character thoughts/editorials became incredibly annoying. For the first time ever with Clancy, I scanned many pages just to be able to get through it. Glad I waited for it to come into the library..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort it takes to read","review":"I'm beginning to fear that Tom Clancy has lost his touch. Unfortunately, not unlike Stpehen King, he will continue to put out book after book and continue to rake in the cash.This book is one you must force yourself to finish. I kept reading, determined to find where the excitement was. It never shows up.This book is full of long, rambling monologues spewing forth the right-wing, conservative slant that Clancy so firmly believes in. He could have shortened the book considerably by simply writing 'right=good, left=bad'.I will wait and read the reviews before buying another of Tom Clancy's books. Maybe he needs to take another look at what he is doing and reevaluate his style. But then why do that when every book you write, no matter how bad, is a guaranteed best-seller?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've got all of Clancy's adventure books, and I've enjoyed them all up to now.This book was, utterly predictable, slow, and boring. At no point was there any suspense.Now that I think about it, this may be the closest any of his spy vs. spy novels has ever approached reality. I prefer his escapism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Rabbit by Tom Clancy","review":"I have read all of Mr. Clancy's previous books, and this is hands-down my least favorite. As other reviewers have mentioned, there is absolutely no suspense in the book. Everything goes off without a hitch; the Soviets are completely clueless. I also think that it is time to retire Jack Ryan and develop a new protagonist, or concentrate on Clark or the Foleys. To expect the reader to buy into the same man as the continuing savior of the free world is asking a lot. I also have a few nit-picky issues with this book. Way too many words are spent describing cups of coffee. The kids watch way too much TV - uninvolved parents. The same phrases are used constantly: 'the little guy', 'pshrink', etc. If you really want to read this book, check it out from the library. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"About as exciting as Tolstoy (and as wordy). Clancy can't seem to let the cold war go (if he actually wrote this book). The only interesting parts are about Mary Pat and Ed Foley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably bad","review":"I must admit that I have never before felt compelled to write an online review of a book that I had read, but this work by Clancy was so dull and boring that I could not hold myself back. This book may be the worst that I have ever read - no excitement, no suspense, hackneyed phrases used over and over again - truly a disaster. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy's getting worse and worse . . . .","review":"I've been a big Clancy fan ever since I was a submariner and Hunt for Red October came out. But his plots have become too predictable and his characters are too perfect. (Name a Jack Ryan flaw other than he sneaks cigarettes when his wife's not around.)Red Rabbit is the worst. The book contains some interesting insight into spy operations behind the iron curtain, but do I want to read a page and a half of the Ryan's morning routine or a several pages about how much Jack Ryan loves his wife? (No!)Tom Clancy is a father of this genre, but he needs to take some lessons from his proteges -- Neal Stephenson, for example."},{"rating":"1","title":"repetitive blah","review":"here's a synopsis:a foreign government wants to do something to the pope; jack ryan doesn't like planes; america is the best; jack ryan doesn't like his father in law; the russians are pretty good, but the americans are better; the british are pretty good, but the americans are better; ryan doesn't like planes; cathy ryan doesn't like not sleeping beside jack; jack doesn't like not sleeping beside cathy; ryan doesn't like planes; america is the best place to live.... blah blah blah,THe first 3/4's of the book is boring and highly repetitive. The last 1/4 is OK.I'm a big fan of Tom Clancy's books containing more technical and suspensful content (i.e. most of the books before this one).

I hope that Tom Clancy rediscovers hisold self."},{"rating":"1","title":"I won't blindly buy a Clancy book again!","review":"Normally, if I see a book written by Tom Clancy, I buy it. That won't happen again! I was very disappointed with this book. It plodded along for the first 300 pages before it got mildly interesting and once the Pope was shot, it ended with many questions unanswered.One was left to wonder what happened to the Rabbit family in America, who are the Minister, Neptune, and Cassius. What is the \\"Masque of the Red Death\\"? Sounds like a cliffhanger sequel to me!Other things I did not care for were some of the slang that wasn't right for what might have been used in 1981. I.e.: sh..burger, wimp out. Also, I wish I'd counted how many times \\"Getting the Rabbit out of Dodge City\\" was used!All in all, not the \\"Tom Clancy\\" of old. I was extremely underwhelmed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this?","review":"After reading the first 50 pages, I couldn't help but post the question here that had been nagging me since I started Red Rabbit. Who wrote this? Is this the real Tom Clancy? Did someone else write the earlier and decently written books? Or did he write those and this is yet another ghost written book, only unattributed?Has Tom Clancy grown so sellable that editing is unecessary? Is he arrogant and uneditable? I search for an explanation because this book is miserable. It is poor writing, plain and simple. I can't finish it and wish that I hadn't spent the five bucks in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty disappointing, coming from the King","review":"I have been a long time Clancy fan. This book is a sleeper. In fact, I am at page 301 right now, and I cant even read any more. I skipped half the pages actually, and didnt regret it... I dont want page after page of ... dialogue that signifies nothing. I want some action. I want suspense. Heck, I would even settle for some drama,... or even humor ...My advice is to go back and read Clancy's earlier books, and just skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear.","review":"Well I don't really know where to begin. I hadn't read a Clancy book in a while because he was feeling a bit stale. But I came back to him for this one and found it to be hit and miss. Some great bits. Some flashes of old form. But largely this just feels thrown together. One for a completist I think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just putting ink on paper","review":"After reading his last three books, I am convinced that Clancy and his publishers are all about just getting ink on paper and money from the masses. Clancy doesn't even proof read his work. He descibes the hills of Pest and the plains of Buda. The last time I was in Hungary Buda had the hill and Pest was farm land. Come on Tom at least visit the city you write about!As for the story, its too historical and predictable.For a major publisher and a centerpiece release there were way too many typos in the copy I received. I felt taken after reading it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many pages, too little story","review":"I have been a big fan of Tom Clancy, having read hisnovels, the week after they came out.Red Rabbit is a total disappointment.

All of the reviews that cite the lack of excitement, constant repetition and endless rhetoric are dead on target. And for those who attribute this failure to the difficulties of writing a prequel, I refer you to Without Remorse, which was an excellent piece. Bottom line: I have always finished each of Clancy's prior works within 48 hours; this one took me a week, and I had to force myself to complete it. I hope this is a fluke and not the end of the Jack Ryan books, but I would prefer that Clancy never write another Jack Ryan novel rather than publish another work of this caliber."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Clancy Book, Bad for Any Book","review":"How can a great writer do 600 pages of pure snooze material? The Bear and the Dragon dragged on for a long time but was vintage Clancy for the last two hundred pages. This book could have been written in 200 pages and it still would have bored me to death. Maybe he is just to busy to research and write the quality novel that we had come to expect. A true disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed - 2 year wait for this?!?","review":"Before I discuss this book, I want to say that I have read every novel Tom Clancy has written and loved them all. I look forward (for years sometimes) for his next book.This book was a real disappointment. The plot was shallow, the ending was too easy, and everything was just too simple. Going from earlier novels of multiple plots that weave together to a grand combination... this book falls flat.I recently read an interview with Tom Clancy where he discusses this book. He mentions that this is the first book he wrote without smoking a cigarette. Perhaps, like the character Jack Ryan himself, he should sneak a few to help him with his thought process.The next novel Tom Clancy writes I will also purchase as soon as Amazon.com can ship it BUT, if its like this one, it will be the last time I buy a Clancy novel until I see everyone is raving about it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy's worst ever","review":"I couldn't have been more disappointed with this disaster. Clancy is my favorite fiction writer, and I loved his books up through Executive Orders. But this one was a total loser.Jamming a story in between Patriot Games and Red October was a lousy idea to start with. We already knew Ryan's history, and by definition there couldn't be anything substantive in the book.Besides that, we all knew the Pope had been shot. There were virtually no interesting subplots, just lots of sleepy dialogue that didn't go anywhere. There were more false starts in this book than in any previous novel. Not a single interesting plot twist or thing-gone-wrong.Jack Ryan is such a terrific character - can't we find out what happens to him NEXT? Did we have to go back in time with a poorly conceived, disappointly executed, flat-out BORING story?If you're a real Clancy fan, be prepared for disappointment. No questions this is his worst book ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating read for history buffs","review":"The reviews for this book are all over the board. I think it is all due to what you want in a novel like this. Clancy's reputation for action and technical information is absorbing. But his research and clear knowledge of what seems like every little detail is incredible. In reading the book, I felt as if I, for the first time, really knew what the old KGB was like. The conversations between players such as Judge Moore, Greer, Ritter, Mary Pat and Ed taught me so much. Yes, this book is quite different from some of Clancy's books. Yet it seems thoughtful and well laid-out. I am a big Clancy fan and was extremely disappointed with \\"The Bear and the Dragon.\\" It seems to me that Clancy has found his voice again. My only question is \\"what's next?\\" This has to be the last Jack Ryan book. There is nothing left for him to do. But if Clancy surprises me on that matter, he will truly prove to be a brilliant author. History buffs--get this book and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOM IS BACK","review":"Yeah, after going off into never land with Jack Ryan as president, Tom is finially back to writting about our favorite characters doing what they do best.Definately a book that will keep you up late at night...:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books that I have ever read","review":"I used to be a fan of Tom Clancy's books before he started turning them into ultra right wing military cartoons.This is an appalling book on every conceivable level.Out of the bargain bin and into the recycle bin where it so obviously belongs"},{"rating":"1","title":"same old tom clancy, idea: get new stuff it's getting old.","review":"Same old story there is a bomb it's going to explode.

When I read the adaptation for that book I was not pleased the character based on the film is nothing like the book. They should of kept with the premise and character of the movie and not changed it. Well thats the least of the problems. I started to read this book and have found that it was a prequel to all of Jacks adventures. What I can't figure out is how he could have done any of this. His character in Sum is thirty, back track through the other stories and he would have to be 12, my age, it makes no sense. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Giant Yawn","review":"Just echoing the reviews before me, but this was a giant yawn and a waste of time. Clancy is the master of the techno-thriller. However, Red Rabbit is a spy \\"procedural\\" in the genre of John LeCarre, but Clancy ain't no LeCarre.All the previous war, military, combat, technology, special forces emphasis covered up the fact that Clancy is a bore. Take away all that, as he's done in Red Rabbit, and you have nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest disappointment of the year","review":"And I was so looking forward to this.Bear and the Dragon was slower then previous books but I did not realise it was the start of the Clancy sleepwalking years. Clancy has chosen a scenario where the tension is lost because we already know the outcome. Where pace and tension might have been added to the plot, Clancy slows things down into turgid detail and needless repetition. On a purely intellectual basis, insights into the Russion mind set and international espionage might be interesting, but not there does not seem much else. I'm British and his views on Merry Olde England in the early 80's were quite accurate, but who cares unless they are put into context of the overall story!Astonishingly this is a thriller by perhaps the biggest name in the business and he fails to deliver one single thrill in the entire book. A terrible effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleeaaase get an editor with a full red pen!","review":"I have not read a Tom Clancy book since \\"Patriot Games\\". I thought this would be a good one to pick up since the chronology comes after that book. Wrong! What a waste of time. Is Clancy so big that he doesn't have an editor to redline his redundancies? There are so many references to Jack Ryan being a marine that I felt like I went to Paris Island. Reading Red Rabbit is like having dinner with a man who had once been somebody and now had to bore you to tears with the same stories you heard from him just 5 minutes before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbingly inaccurate","review":"I like Tom Clancy and despite its many shortcomings noted by others I could have liked Red Rabbit too. But the incredible factual inaccuracies made me vince.His geography at times mixes East and West. He makes his Rabbit travel from Moscow to Budapest via Sophia and Belgrade and changes railroad tracks as they cross into Hungary.His geography and details of Budapest is a mixture of small irrelevant - but correct - details and sheer misinformation. A simple look at any tourist map would have shown him how wrong he is.How a writer of Clancy's reputation can efford not to have qualified reviewers - for a pittance - is beyond me.A disappointment that will leave me questioning all details in his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"New editor needed...","review":"This book was disappointing, at best.Clancy needs new editors or he needs to listen to them better. How many times do we need to be subjected to the same lawyer joke, or Stalin's thoughts about the Pope's divisions, or that spycraft is easier than cutting eyeballs, etc.? The repetition became a distraction as I was reading the book - I kept saying to myself \\"why did he mention this again?\\".Either the editors don't have the guts to trim Clancy's books, or he feels he too great of an author to need an editor, or listen to one.A weak effort, with little suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surely Overblown","review":"The man who wrote the gripping 'The Search for Red October' has fallen a long way in producing this 900 pages of pure boredom. This book could be improved by taking out about 600 of those pages. His insights are nil - what he says about the English is almost entirely cliche. The repetitiveness is unbelievable. How many times do we need to be told that Ryan doesn't like flying - or tea? And do we really believe that CIA and MI6 could be so clever and KGB so stupid as to allow the defection in the terms described. The whole stratagem is unconvincing and it is noticeable that when detail is required in order to convince the reader Clancy can never provide it. Incidentally, does Ryan, even though having been a marine, have to be so foul-mouthed? I dislike buying books and not finishing them but to finish this one was a real effort. No more Clancy for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst Clancy = almost worst book","review":"This book is an embarassment. It shows what happens when an author decides to just capitalize on past reputation. This book is so bad it actually makes you mad to be reading it. You almost wish for a government agency to protect the public from this kind of exploitation. Shame on the author, the publisher,and the booksellers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Clancy cop-out","review":"Why does an author that gave us the incredible \\"Hunt for Red October\\" never write another novel that can hold a candle to his first one?With each successive book, Clancy seems to be \\"in the churn out\\" mode without any real interest in character/plot development. Reading Red Rabbit reminds me of a book I read when I was 12 years of age. It's simplistic, repetitive (how many times do we need to be reminded that Ryan was knighted, that Sally gives sloppy kisses, etc.), unimaginative, and took way too long to tell the story (could have been done in half the amount of pages with more impact).What a shame. Clancy is no longer on my must read list. Come on Tom....you can do hell of a lot better and have. Give us the 21st century equivalent of your first novel and we'll be very happy. Did you even write the Red Rabbit?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'M sorry I \\"red\\" RABBIT","review":"Oh No! A Tom \\"Clunker\\". This filler of a book between Patriot Games and Cardinal of the Kremlin is as exciting as STAR WARS Episode II. I understand a prequel or a sequel but these \\"midquels\\" have no surprises and are redundent. Len Deighton did it with great success but there was alot of mysteries to solve. In the first 100 pages, he repeats himself in this book dozen's of times(chess analogies,lawyer joke(not jokes),origin of KGB building,etc) Great title,read title and then throw away unopened book.I Loved his other books,so sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far From Clancy's Best","review":"As someone who has read all of Clancy's novels to date, this was the poorest by far. It was carelessly edited so there are many typos and some scenes where military personnel are called by several different ranks with a few paragraphs. The plot is listless and unsurprising.Most distressing by far are the bizarre antics of Jack Ryan in this book. This is not the Jack Ryan of old - this one uses harsh and vulgar language freely - even with his daughter! He comes across as a very unlikable character.I was really looking forward to this book so I'm very disappointed. Mr. Clancy has shown he can do much, much better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clancy is back to his old writing and its a welcome change","review":"This one recalls the days of \\"Cardinal\\" in that it leanstowards the tradecraft of the latter days of the Cold War ratherthan the military texts that he has been producing as of late.A good read...a welcome read."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could leave a negative star I would","review":"This book is his worst. I am glad that I bought it used as to pay full retail for it would have been an even worse insult.I have read all of his books that he has written and he has not written one in years that was good. It is like he and another writer who has rode the gravy train of a one character series have lost sight of what a good book entails. Read Jack DuBrul for something new and refreshing, or waste [the money] and buy this doorstop."},{"rating":"1","title":"REALLY WORTH A ZERO","review":"Without question, this is the worst novel I have ever read.At over 600 pages in length, it more appropriately should be condensed into a terrible short story. There was no suspense, no nothing! The amount of meaningless dialogue and worthless descriptive and informative matter was clearly inserted by Clancy to make a bigger book. Or maybe he really wanted to write a stinker to get out of his contractual obligations?DO NOT TAKE YOUR VALUABLE TIME TO READ THIS BOOK!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Not Good Enough","review":"I found the book to be pedestrian, dull, ordinary, colorless, mundane, banal and just plain uninspired.

It's a pale reflection of the man's work. Cardinal of The Kremlin was 5 stars. Patriot Games was 5 stars. But this? Is dredging up the Cold War with a boring scenario the best he can do when the world of spying and intrigue has so much fodder to offer today?To think they might make a movie of this. Groan. This one even Clancy's rabid fans have to shudder with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Typically, Clancy spends a good deal of time and effort developing characters and the story, building up to a wonderful, fast paced ending. In this LACKLUSTER effort, I kept waiting for the Clancy of old but it is more than apparent that even Clancy has TIRED of Jack Ryan. A very DISSAPPOINTING effort and it has left me skeptical on any further Clancy books without thouroughly investigating reviewer comments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor indeed","review":"Not convincing, either in it's reason for the attempt on the Pope, the portrayal of the UK, or the characters.Regarding the assassination attempt he is at odds with the Pope's own memories and actions. ...On the UK, he is way out of line on the NHS. It is supported by all major parties, including conservatives, and the slur on surgeons is, frankly unforgiveable and narrow minded. Clancy does this a lot. In previous novels he has poked contempt at the UK for our gun laws, without mentiuoning the event that triggered it - a conservative member of a gun club slaughtering 16 seven year olds and their teacher.On the characters, Ryan comes across as a bit of an airhead.As a major fan of his work for years this is dreadfully disappointing.Will (Liverpool, UK)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, formulaic, preachy.","review":"This Tom Clancy book takes his formula to a ludicrious degree - it's just not exciting or good. He spends 90% of his time in a fawning devotion to Reagan, Thatcher, and capitalism, while slamming the British healthcare system. One would think the book should be about Jack Ryan, normally a good character, but it's not. This book is Republican Kool-Aid and nothing else. Look elsewhere for entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Clancy ever?","review":"This was absolutely horrible. I read it all the way through, hoping it would get better but it never did.

Skip this one, there are many better ones out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps written by a ghost writer for Clancy?","review":"Is Tom Clancy trying to milk Jack Ryan fans for a few more dollars? This was an extremely poor addition to the series, and nowhere near the usual standards expected of Clancy. Neither the plot nor the writing provides any suspense. The book lacks the thorough research Clancy usually delivers. The novel is long on dialogue but short on analysis or action. Much of Ryan's (fairly minor) role in the plot is highly implausible. There is no attention to detail or consistency (the Rabbit goes from Captain to Major to Colonel and back to Captain during the course of the novel). The sloppiness just served to annoy this reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Others Already Said It","review":"Not a good intro to Clancy. I did finish it, but for those used to Clancy, it's a slow-paced read. I didn't hate it and I did finish it, but my advice is wait for the next \\"real\\" Clancy. Probably the least interesting of Clancy's works (I've read them all, but won't touch Clancy and whomever)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of the bunch","review":"I can't believe I read the whole thing!. What a bore, when we got to what I thought would be exciting (the border crossing, or the kill attempt), each was about one page long. The pontification about the Catholic religion was misplaced. And to hear the hero Ryan whining endlessly about being away from home for a few nights, please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did he get paid by the word?","review":"Unfortunately, this wordy,ponderous,repetitious tree waster is no where near the quality I have come to know and love from Clancy. Clearly, he has done some terrific work , such as Red Storm Rising, Executive Orders, Bear & Dragon,etc. While a game attempt at some real history, Red Rabbit has none of the usual suspense and complexity I expect from this writer. Hey Tom, next time, when you are 1/2 way through it, and it doesn't look good, just trash it, and come up with something we can all be proud of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Tom Clancy missed the target on this one. It was slow, dull, predictable and too religeous. This book is one that, once you put it down, you don't want to pick it up again.Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Rabbit","review":"Tom Clancy is past his prime. The character of Jack Ryan has only one place to go, and that is godhood. In the future, I'll wait a very long time before I jump into another Clancy novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful","review":"This one reads like a Rush Limbaugh tribute to Ronald Reagan. Clancy seems to have adopted the \\"Great Communicator\\" as some sort of real politician and stops at nothing to hand out accolades to Ronnie and the Right. We don't pay the big bucks to hear your strange personal political agenda Mr. Clancy. Stick to what you do best and skip the pandering to the right wing. In the future I will study several pages before purchasing this kind of drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you suffer from insomnia...","review":"I have to say, when I saw the book, my hand went to my wallet. Now I wish I had read some reviews first. Very tedious, Mr. Clancy as usual, spends way to much time on detail after detail,instead of getting to the action. Of course in this book there is no action. Each time I picked it up, I was drifting off to sleep by the fifth page. Hey Tom, stop pontificating on your politics in your character's thoughts. Better yet, get new characters, instead of Mr. Clean Marine, who says \\"love ya babe\\" every third page! Gentle reader, do yourself a favor, and skip this one, or if you must, borrow it from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great change of pace for Ryan","review":"Absolutely magnificent. I found the throwback to the early days of Ryan's career much more fun than the current Presidential run with ryan. As with many of Clancy's novels the beginning might seem slow to some but I was enthralled by the characteristic Tom Clancy well researched and well written storytelling. The addition of actual historical events that I can relate to was a nice addition. And as usual the book finished with a true page-turning sequence of events. I highly recommend this book to all readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy gets worse as he gets older","review":"Don't even bother with this attempt. The plot had no imagination and was completely predictable. The so-called \\"good guy\\" Jack Ryan was pathetic. Someone with his education and professional experience wouldn't drop the \\"F-bomb\\" every other sentence or whine like a baby.In the last half of the book Clancy reminds us, at least every other page, that Ryan hates flying and that he is \\"no field spook\\". This was repetitious and very boring.Over the last few of his books I've become use to his characters staring out of a window and thinking inconsequential thought for pages on end with no plot advancement but this book brought it to a new low. How sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save some time and just read this","review":"Save some time and just read this:While sleeping the sleep of the just he looked at his wife, the eye cutter, and asked himself, \\"How many divisions does the Pope have?\\" which made him realize that little girls give the best hugs.

Then the Pope didn't get killed.Now read it again and again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"RED RABBIT DOESN'T HOP","review":"I quite enjoyed Clancy's previous books and I will no doubt purchase the next one, but I would not recommend Red Rabbit to anyone. First off, Clancy has Jack Ryan talking like a foul mouthed hippie and it is very much out of character for Ryan. Most disappointing, though, is that there is NO suspense. Everything the Americans and Brits plan comes through without a hitch and the Russians are depicted as, if not stupid, then certainly quite naive. Rabbit's wife hardly questions his defection! A very poor effort from Clancy. Seems almost as though this book was written to meet a publisher's deadline rather than to entertain readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameless laughing stock","review":"This is the most disappointing work of any author I've read in years. Red Rabbit is an almost complete dedication to the shameless jingoistic bashing of everything Soviet, right down to the physical makeup of the Slavic man and woman. Not only is this work poorly researched (assassination attempt is incorrectly set in plot timing, assuming there's allusion to real-life incidents), it's thoroughly shallow in its depiction of character. Even Ryan, perhaps the least caustic character in the novel has uncharacteristically ugly words. The sign-language Idiots, Inc. spy team of Ed/Mary is completely ridiculous, but that's not wholly surprising as I've never been impressed with the covert worlds in Clancy's literature. There's really only one fiction spymaster - John le Carre.What happened, Mr. Clancy? Where's the wit, the drama and the maturity we saw in your other works, such as the Red October and Rainbow Six? I'm disappointed. And disgusted. What a waste of time, pen and paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy mailed it in","review":"If this was the first jack Ryan book it would have been the last.

When I picked up the book, I expected the usual attention to detail, but this is simply excruciating. People talk. They decide to send a message. Somebody encrypts the message. The message is sent. The message is received. Somebody else decrypts the message. The message is delivered. Other people talk. Repeat every 40 pages. Arrgh!This book would be very difficult to enjoy, even for the most enthusiastic Clancy fan. Casual readers of Clancy have no chance.Skip it and read \\"Red October\\" again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey, Tom! Stop Writing Now!","review":"This book is crap. Other reviewers have noted the stupid pitfalls that Clancy cannot seem to avoid. My least favorite must be the \\"Mr. so-and so? He's a GOOD MAN.\\" In the nine hundred plus pages that the softcover consumed, this was used at least twenty times to introduce new characters. Come on! Second on my list of rants is how Clancy can't stop mentioning the fact that Ryan is a former Marine, and uses this as justification for his ability. You know what? I got it the first time. The book is a waste of readers' time as well as ink and paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"I will wait for more reviews next time!","review":"This should have been a sub-one star book. With all of the advances Tom Clancy gets for his books, It is obvious he is counting on sales history to get a dud through. With only three shots fired in the whole book, (and none at or by Ryan) I was dissapointed with the action level. This was a sub-parr effort for Mr Clancy. I'm not ready to give up on him, but I won't be so anxious next time. This one was a total waste of time and money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needed to Fulfill Contract","review":"Tom must have owed the publisher another book by a certain time.

There is sooo much repetition. I got tired of rehashing the previous novel with the attack on his house...Sum of All Fears, I believe.

This one is a BIG disappointment!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was a Clancy fan until this came along.","review":"I have read all of the Clancy novels until now. I waited eagerly for each of them. Then this one came along. I will wait for reviews before picking up another.Maybe he has forgotten how to write. Or this could just be ghosted ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will the Real Tom Clancy Please Stand Up","review":"Will the real Tom Clancy please stand up? I couldn't find him in this book. No high-tech weaponry, no complex plot (was there a plot at all?), no suspense, and no surprises. In this book Jack Ryan goes on European holiday, or may as well have. The story is so predictable that it is not predictable. You never expect a Clancy story to go so smoothly for the characters. There are always snags and plot-twists. I kept waiting for something to go wrong in Operation BEATRIX but the \\"other shoe\\" never falls. It's a text-book spy operation, almost boring. They all live happily ever after. The End."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Going Through the Paces","review":"Tom Clancy has apparently spent too much time reading his prior reviews and not enough time developing any new novel over the past several years. This book is anytghing but a page turner. Slow, plodding with minimal excitment.Very little in the way of plot development. No excitment, no surprises. After first hundred pages entire oucome predictable.I actually blame his editors and publishers for allowing such a piece of junk to be published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Slow Reading","review":"Tom Clancy is following in the steps of Stephen King. Just because one writes more verse, it does not mean there is quality there. This book rambles on about one of Clancys favorite subjects \\"the Catholic Church\\" But there is little bite to the plot, especially since you know how things will turn out. Entirely droll and predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much of a rant","review":"Red Rabbit differs considerably from Tom Clancy's other books in that it is moreso a political rant on how wonderful the blessed-by-god USA is and how crap and godless every other nation is.Key negatives are:- continuous ranting on how bad the UK health system is when Cathy Ryan starts working- commentary that evil is a direct result of not believing in god- everything the USSR manufactured was well below US standards (let's ignore Sputnik shall we!)I've been a big fan of Tom's previous books, so to see him lose the plot on what was a nice little underlying story was disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Done with Clancy","review":"Shame on me. I bought another one of his ponderous novels. Another snooze fest from the godfather of same. This guy is obviously a stream of consciousness writer with no editing. Jack Ryan is brilliant, Jack Ryan is a great investor, Jack Ryan can make his own coffee and on and on and on... This book is just awful. Clancy should be arrested for stealing the reading public's money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have you filled your contract quota yet, Clancy?","review":"The title says it all, Clancy is definitely writing books to fullfill a contract quota because he has definitely lost all passion for writing evident by the garbage he has been churning out for about the last three novels; Red Rabbit is the absolute worst yet!!I have read all of his novels and 'was' a passionate fan. I almost cried when I finished Clear and Present Danger because I didn't want it to end. Now I cry every time I open a Clancy novel because each page is worse than the last and the end never comes soon enough.I'll read the next Clancy novel because, like a good addict, I'll keep looking for that rush I found in novels like The Cardinal but I fear I will never again find it (and like most others here, I'll only buy it from the bargain bin)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feel Free to Skip this Ryanverse Novel, You Won't Miss Anything","review":"This is an average thrown together Clancy novel. Does not focus on Jack Ryan, he is more of a bumbling ancillary character. If you skip this you will miss almost nothing in the Ryanverse. I read the book 4 years ago, so I do not remember the particulars , just that I was unimpressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decline and Fall","review":"Although a Clancy from his first book, \\"Hunt For Red October,\\" I've found the quality of his writing has begun to decline in the last two or three novels. And this is especially true of \\"Red Rabbit.\\" I almost feel that rather than write a novel for the entertainment of his readers, he's now writing to primarily express his own personal ideologies. This is, at best, a mediocre 250 page story that Clancy has managed to drag out through more than 500 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Off the mark","review":"I don't have a lot to say about this book except that it is boring and confusing. Clancy gets so caught up in his minute details that he forgets to actually write a story. Early Clancy is far superior to this read. The only reason I'm finishing it, is because I started it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Roost","review":"Wow, the intensity, the techo thriller and the interesting plot are gone. I found this a bit to boring and predictable. Although interesting, it could have been told in 50 pages or less. I do not think I can handle another Clancy book, and I used to be a big fan. The creative juices from Clancy are gone like a burnt out rock star. Time for him to retire and read other's great novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the 97 cents","review":"At the time I write this review Red Rabbit is being offered for 97 cents for a used copy.Please believe me - it isn't worth it"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Clancy Book","review":"I think I have now read all Mr C's Ryan/Clark series......and this is the worst, very dissapointing. I read somewhere that T.C. does his own editing, if this is correct it shows in Red Rabbit, way too long for the story.Mr Clancy has gone overboard with the detail in this story and seems to be using the book as a vehicle to impress his readers with his intimate detailed knowledge of his subject matter. The detail supplied in works such as Red October, Executive Orders and Debt of Honour was relevant and added to the experience making those books very good indeed, and EO & DOH were HUGE stories. The Red Rabbit story could have been told in 2/3 of the size, I only just managed to make it to the end. Also his knowledge of England could use a little work, It may pass muster to an Americam audience but is exposed to a british one.2 stars - must try harder"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"This book, like one reviewer has already stated, MUST have been written to fill a contract. It was a waste of my time & $$.I have all of Tom Clancy's other books, but this one I sold after reading...."},{"rating":"2","title":"His best effort in a while.......","review":"It is far from his best (HFR October), and even further from his worst (SOA Fears). Clancy seems better when he keeps to a story that stays far away from outlandish. This qualifies. It doesn't grab you like many of his efforts, but still has some qualities that make you very interested in how it plays out. It is always enjoyable to read TC doing what he does best, describe something very complicated so even I can understand.I love the idea of following our favorite group of regulars, but have them set back in the cold war days. This should serve as some kind of model for new novels. I would have given it 3 1/2 stars, but that isn't an option, so 4 stars it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy Creates New Levels of Boredom","review":"I've read college textbooks that were more entertaining than this book. It's amazing to me that the author of Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games, Rainbow Six, and other excellent novels also wrote this book. Most of the book seemed to be setup of Jack Ryan's life and the history of other characters that appeared in the other novels. Reading over six hundred pages to get twenty pages of actual excitement and adventure made this book a huge disappointment. Based on this novel, he is no longer a 'Master of Suspense' and should stick to writing his histories of the military services. For those of you that must read all Clancy novels, I suggest you wait till your local library has it or to buy it off the paperback table at your local used bookstore. I'd have given it zero stars if that were an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointment from Clancy","review":"Tom Clancy seems to be one of several popular novelists whose recent books have disappointed readers due to the absence of a good story. (Robert Jordan, Diana Gabaldon, and Jean Auel come to mind). Why is this happening? Are publishers pushing authors to publish a big book every year? Is it greed on the part of the writers?Although we know the outcome of the assassination attempt on Pope John Paul, this could have been an exciting story, filling in some of the gaps in the life of Clancy's popular hero, Jack Ryan, and other recurring characters.But, as many reviewers have pointed out, there is no story, no action, no suspense, and far too much repetition. This is not the sort of writing that made Clancy famous.If you must read \\"Red Rabbit,\\" borrow it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Ending","review":"After trying hard to get the many characters names straight, Clancy mixes last names with first names and you don't know who is who. Halfway through the book you begin to understand a little better. The last paragraph of the book....where did that come from...The last page...no words to describe. Very disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Invest Your Time Elsewhere","review":"Clancy, like Ludlum and Grisham has seemingly run out of stories to tell. In 600 pages Clancy, in Red Rabbit, provides details about the spy business and more characters than is comprehensible without providing any reason for the reader to continue turning the pages except that many of his previous books have been page turners. The story is trite and the ending is disappointing. When the reader finally gets to the final page he is left with the question, why did I read all of this? For me, it is time to find a new author with fresh ideas. Tom Clancy's formula does not work anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom: Please Save the Trees; Retire Jack Ryan","review":"I cannot believe I read every one of the 618 pages of this novel.Like most Clancy novels, nothing happens for the first 550 pages; then there is a rush to bring the story to a close. More than half of the 550 page introduction should have found its way to the editing room floor, as it only serves to regurgitate background information from Clancy's previous novels.The one redeeming feature of my experience with this book is I borrowed it from the library, rather than purchased it.Jack Ryan has been President, perhaps it is time to let him collect his pension."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Slow Read","review":"Tom Clancy's books usually are written so well that you hate to set down his books. Not only did I set \\"Red Rabbit\\" down several times, but I left it sitting on my desk for a month without ever feeling that I was missing something.The majority of the book is used to set the plot and introduce you to all of the characters. The final few chapters are used to bring the storyline to a conclusion. There is little action and, when there is something happening, it concludes too quickly and too easily.The story reads like something that would happen in real life with few surprises. This is definitely NOT a book to escape from reallity into a world of intrigue and fun. For that you will have to check out Tom's other books...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plodding and Predictable","review":"It's difficult to create tension when you backdate your story and focus on an assassination everyone already knows failed. But it is possible. Clancy did not do so here. Everything surrounding the plot is predictable, and there is virtually no tension in the storyline. This could have been made a much better book. Clancy focussed on the efforts to get a defector and his family out, which leaves ample room for tension, but then he made the operation utterly without danger, and we were told this frequently while the operation was going on. There was no suspicious KGB type hot on their heels, so to speak, no shootouts at midnight, no running through darekened streets, no action, in fact, of any kind. And then, at the end, what is our reward? The Pope gets shot anyway, of course, so where is the victory? If you were disappointed, as I was, with Rainbow Six, well, this one is much worse than that, and would probably never have been published if Clancy's name hadn't been attached."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tech-Non-Thriller","review":"Tom Clancy's decline has found a new bottom in this book. Hopefully his craft turns around.The essence of a thriller is uncertainty and surprise. Alas, there is none in Red Rabbit. Nothing goes wrong; nothing comes as a surprise. Hence, there is no drama. There is just 618 pages of description - and we all know how wooden Tom Clancy's description can be.Here's hoping Clancy finds something more interesting to write about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but not up to the Clancy bar","review":"I am also a big fan of Clancy's work. Particularly his later books (Executive Order, Debt of Honor, Without Remorse). The only similarity of this novel with those is the names of a few characters.This book is not what any Clancy fan would expect. If the names were changed and the book was 200 pages shorter and written under another pen name or something, it might be a good read. But for Clancy fans that enjoy the normal time investment that his technical and long novels take, this one doesn't have the \\"Return on Investment\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, Who REALLY wrote this book?","review":"Slow is an understatement for this novel.If it didn't have Clancy's name on the cover I would never have believed it was his work.Because I already knew the outcome of the book from history, I expected the story to have more intrigue.Well, the intrigue was there, but it was spread thin through a lot of filler. Normally, I have difficulty putting a Clancy novel down. Not with this book. Don't try to read this one when you're tired or you will be asleep in short order. It does not require a lot analysis to follow the story.This Clancy novel has far more profanity than his previous works. Many will not find it objectionable, but it was more than I prefer and detracted from the story.This is the second Clancy book that I wish I had waited for the paperbook to purchase. I think I won't buy his next in hardback until I have reviewed a library copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Rabbit Hops.....Slowly","review":"Tame plot, not much action.

No real intrigue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strike 2","review":"It is a shame no stars is not an option for rating. It would appear Clancy was attempting to write the screenplay of another Jack Ryan movie with this work.With the high tension that was rampant between NATO and the Warsaw Pact during this time period, there was plenty of background to place many of the characters from his other books. And I had to laugh at Clancy's buildup of Ed Foley and the New York Times reporter, yet there was no further mention of this later in Foley's career. The NYT would have never lived down a sleeper CIA agent on their reporter staff.Instead, we get a plodding story that is lacking virtually everything Clancy had become well known for....and it only gets worse with the TEETH OF THE TIGER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"Tom Clancy really missed this one. The story within the 900 pages (Penguin pocket book edition) could be easily told in at least half of that. The large paragraphs with descriptions and characters thought add nothing to the plot and are passed through.Jack Ryan is a merely spectator. The guy in the right place at the right time.Where is the suspense? And all the hard decision making in the intelligence business? Who cares about the differences between american and british ophtamologists?I'll tell a small detail of the story now...the \\"hard part\\" of the defection, make the soviets believe that the Rabbits are dead, is easily solved with \\"convenient\\" fires in the US and Britain. That's awful writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of \\"Red Rabbit\\" by Tom Clancy","review":"This is probably the worst Tom Clancy book I have read. It is heavily padded and is probably three times as long as the simplistic plot deserves. I'm sorry I spent the money on buying it. A great disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"[Tired] Rabbit","review":"I have long been a Clancy fan and my personal library has ALL of his books. But Clancy has grown tired and this book is positively [poor]! There were no surprises and little action. His earlier books were hard to put down; this one took me days to get through. I'm afraid this is the final chapter in my Clancy library. Remember his better days - skip this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"tom clancy should be ashamed","review":"This book was a mess. Mr. Clancy creates bad characters in a lackluster plot. There's no action, and the dialogue seems like its written by some fourth-tier college drunk frat boy. Do yourself a favor and read Demille or the late and great Mr. Ludlum. Harrison Ford or Ben Affleck--both deserve a whole lot better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A contrary opinion","review":"Okay, it's not a technothriller, a lot of the dialogue is a bit corny, but it's still a Clancy page turner based on a real life event. Jack Ryan is a bit of a wimp but it's a fun look at the days of the Cold War CIA and KGB cloak and dagger stuff. Not all of the characters are developed as well as others but it is a good yarn and I devoured the more than 600 pages in record time.Was it worth the time and money? I give it a yes."},{"rating":"1","title":"When is something going to happen","review":"I love Clancy but this book is a bore. Almost nothing happens. Skip this in favor of one of his older books you'll be happier"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Clancy ?","review":"A disappointing book. One wonders whether Mr. Clancy used a substitute writer for this mediocre thriller. Compared with his earlier books which were terrific, Red Rabbit seems to have been written as an afterthought."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's with the all the venom this book has been getting?","review":"Although this is not as good as the Hunt for Red October or the Cardinal of the Kremlin, and is a bit slow, it is far from Tom Clancy's worst. Sure the Cold War may be history, but this doesn't make the book any less enjoyable. Actually, it reminded me of The Day of the Jackal (though The Day of the Jackal is a better book)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good new series","review":"This is the second book in the \\"Beacon Hill Series.\\" The first book is \\"The Death of Colonel Mann.\\" The next book, which I will definitely read, is \\"The White Crow.\\"Boston was always the most \\"upright\\" of the American cities, and the Victorian period exacerbated this tendency. This is the background for this series. The author catches the tone of the times and provides a great plot with the slightest hint of a romance in the offing. I figured out who the murderer was, but that in no way spoiled the story. I liked this book slightly better than the first which I also liked. This means this is not one of those series that starts with a great book and goes downhill from there."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Girl Power\\": - '20's Style","review":"I purchased a paperback copy of this book when I was in elementary school and have cherished it ever since. Even though I have read the book many times, I still laugh at the girls' many adventures. It's a joy to read a well-written book, and these two ladies know how to turn a phrase. Even the most incidental characters come to life - from Miss Mary in Canada to the French madam who is befuddled by the fact that her establishment has been recommended by a publication listing safe accomodations for well-bred young ladies. Cornelia and Emily, lifelong friends, will seem like your longtime friends after you read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book","review":"At least once a decade since I was fifteen, I have re-read OUR HEARTS WERE YOUNG AND GAY, and the pleasure which I find in it never has diminished. Of course, by now, it's more like visiting with old friends than it is starting out on a brand-new adventure. Yet with the passage of years, the simpler delights--and values--which OUR HEARTS WERE YOUNG AND GAY displays so matter-of-factly appear even more touching than they once had. There are many scenes which are hilarious, and I can state definitively that these scenes have withstood the test of time. While OUR HEARTS WERE YOUNG AND GAY undeniably is a sweet story, it remains the best read ever. And it is a book that anyone can share with a teenaged daughter or an 80-year old grandmother without a second's concern about exposing them to ideas that may be unseemly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely wonderful book!","review":"This book is my favorite, and I read alot. I start to chuckle before I turn the page, knowing what I will read there.

This is a funny little treasure of a book.Note: a 3 star ranking from me is actually pretty good; I reserve 4 stars for tremendously good works, and 5 only for the rare few that are or ought to be classic; unfortunately most books published are 2 or less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Hearts were Young and Gay","review":"The stories I read were excellently written about events little known today but show that people are people through the ages.

Bought it for my mother who had me read it in the 50's because it reminded her of growing up in Chicago. Enjoyed it then and again now but was disapointed in the clumsy editing of my copy. For $40. I did not expect that pages would be missing and others run out of place. Example page 196 runs after page 191 and again in proper place after 195, there is no page 192. Then page 244 runs after page 215. There is no page 216. Would expect this with a cheap copy but not from Amazon.

Since its inception decades ago, Orq. Broadway has remained a potent force, and this new album is a flawless set of hypnotic dance tunes, led by the darting flute of Eddy Zervigon, along with rhythmic violins and pulsing piano work. This group hasn't been diminished or watered down with the passage of time: fans of the old band or folks entirely unfamiliar with their work can rest assured that this is a top-flight record, fun from start to finish. I was pleasantly surprised, and I definitely recommend this disc if you're looking for some sweet, fine salsa to swing and sway to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Good Book From Seung Sahn","review":"Very good book for a glimpse into intimate zen.

Thompson","review":"The author of this book has obviously seen combat in the trenches. The fact that he would discuss deployment requirements like auto-update and secure network communication is proof enough.I particularly enjoyed the bits of storytelling that Blunden hides in between technical discussions. In one part, he talks about working at a company in the throes of Y2K conniptions: \\"Like a 15-year-old kid studying for an algebra test, the company that hired me had waited until the last minute to do its homework.

I am glad I own both albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Music CD","review":"The music CD was reasonably priced for a older recording and the music of the 1984 cast featuring Glenn Close was very enjoyable.

Close is a fair performer, but is not Tony quality. Campbell does a horrible version of Joe. Then there is the music. Once you you hear a melody, you are going to hear it again, and again, and again. ALW could have at least made original music for the car chase scene! Then the lyrics. In \\"The lady's paying\\" you hear joe say \\"Golly Gee\\" out of nowhere. That is totally out of character, and out of the blue. The two decent songs, \\"As if we never said goodbye\\", and \\"With One Look\\", are best heard on the Striesand album, \\"Barbra, back to Broadway\\".

I have of a proposed musical starring the original \\"Norma\\", Gloria Swanson, was better.In fact,I was so disappointed with this, I couldn't wait to give it away.And who told Glenn Close she could sing ?.After listening to this,I had to make sure it wasn't just me,so I listened to \\"Les Mis\\",Sondheims' \\"Passion\\", and even Andersson & Ulvaeus' \\"Kristina fran Duvemala\\" in Swedish,and found them all eminently more involving emotionally.Even a second listening did nothing to improve my original opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply flawed","review":"Everyone in New York seems to hate Mr. Webber, and this show is always on their list of excuses. I will admit that a lot of the music is exeptionally average, but he main problem is the lyrics. I could give you a lundry list of problems with the lyrics, but that would be tedious to say the least. Just trust me when I say they're bad. They are so bad that they ruin the CD, which has so much talent in it it should be hailed as a modern classic. Webber is definatly at fault for a the cheesey music, but I have a feeling the music would seem less cheesey with lyrics that don't absolutly reek of limburger.

Thank you again for a good sale, a quick sale and an even quicker mail delivery; much better than the anticipated date."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECTION!","review":"After listening to movie samples on Amazon comparing both the London and the LA cast. I had decided to buy this edition. It turned out to be the right choice. There were 3 factors which convinced me to buy this edition rather than the London cast.1) the actors were more well known (Glenn Close) and some were portrayed in other musicals I enjoyed such as Judy Kuhn from les miserables broadway edition.2) The cast portrayed more emotion and made (and still makes) me feel more for the characters then the London Cast. Although many people may think that Glenn Close's voice isn't as powerful as LuPone's, her voice providees realism to the character and makes listeners feel emotion for her situation as well as Joe's.3) it's the more complete version out there,so in conclusion I RECOMEND that you get this version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sunset BLVD is amazing","review":"I love Andrew Loyd Webber musicals, and in all honesty I must say that my favorite one yet is SUNSET BLVD. The story is so captivating, and beautifully told that every time I listen to the songs it grips me again. Allen Cambell is INCREDIBLE, his proformance is very moving. All the proformers are great. ALW out did himself with this one. My favorite song is SUNSET BLVD. I think Cambell delivers it so dramatically that you can't help but to feel for his charactor. Glenn Close is perfect for the part she plays also. Every one should hear this music, it is soooooooo worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this deluxe edition -- buy the US release","review":"I recently bought this deluxe edition thinking that the audio quality would be better than the regular US release since it has been 'remastered'. When I listened to it, I could hear some noise specially in silent moments (such as in conversations). When I listened to my highlights CD (US release), the audio quality was much, much better. So, I suggest that this 'deluxe edition' not be considered if you're thinking of buying the original American cast recording of Sunset Boulevard. Better stick with the regular US release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the London Cast Instead","review":"Glenn Close is indeed a brilliant actress, and she can sing well enough to have pulled off the vocals for the Lion King, but a Broadway musical? Her voice is too weak and lacks the range for these songs. While her performance on stage might have made up for the weakness of her vocal performance, a soundtrack is an entirely different matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Sunset\\" Overdone","review":"So, the producers felt the Broadway audience would much rather see Glenn Close as Norma Desmond than Patti LuPone. Though I disagree, they were probably right - the advance box office sales alone were amazing. Alas, big box office from a big star does not necessarily translate into a great soundtrack. Close is simply not a singer. As she over-does her Norma Desmond - losing any sense of vulnerability and fragility associated with the character- she turns Norma into a frightening stage clown. As she sings(?)/acts on the soundtrack, one can not help but notice her eyes focused on the Tony Award, and not the character itself. Certainly not to be out-done we have Allan Campbell out-diva-ing the diva herself, turning the character of Joe into a bloodless monster. For those who saw the play with Close in the lead (either LA or NY) this is probably an unforgettable souvenir from the show. For everyone else: it's a huge mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glenn Close shines in Andrew Llyod Webber's hit musical","review":"This great Hollywood fairy tale is brought to life by the extrordinary Glenn Close. One of Andrew Lloyd Webber's best musicals because of its jazzy score and heart filled songs such as \\"If We Had Never Said Goodbye,\\" we may rank \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" 's storyline among Webber's top shows compared to \\"Starlight Express\\" and \\"Cats\\" (Webber's desperate need for a lame storyline). But in the end, Andrew Llyod Webber's musical score is triumphant. This recording is the best compared to the world and British premiers because of (as stated earlier) Glenn Close, the star of this recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back on their game!","review":"Madness is back on the top of their game!

The layered multimedia works in this book reflect the increasing depth of this author's life experiences and are among the best pieces in the work.

I found it to be a little on the week side and it took a bit of futzing with and positioning to get it to be clear and fit in the mix. Probably because it was in a drawer made for a center channel speaker, but I had to actually put some supports in to make it fire correctly forward. Taking the cover off helped too. Another problem that most people won't have is that I was moving into a place with hardwood floors, no rug, little furniture and 16 foot ceilings.

What is strange is the mixing of 18th century history with modern day images.For example, after explaining about Dorchester Heights and its role in the seige of Boston, they show a kid throwing a tennis ball against the monument on D. Heights. WHAT? Everything is presented from the British point of view, which is OK, but I have a few issues with that. They insist on calling it a \\"Civil War\\" which I'm not completely convinced the term is appropriate. Also, there are many innane references to the Vietnam War. The interviewing of people on the bus about the history is funny and seems SO out of place for the seriousness of the film.After watching 3 of the 4 episodes, I won't be finishing it.

The entire revolution is redifined as a civil war, one instigated by greedy merchantmen with a lust for bloodshed. Particulary entertaining for me was the statement that the rebels where equivalents of the Viet Cong and the Mujahadeen in Afghanistan. I should like to think that any responsible documentartian would be able to understand the difference between George Washington and Osama bin Laden. Unfortunately, the documentary (using the Michael Moore definition of the word) labels the Americans as, and I quote, \\"militants\\". The same word the media uses to describe those individuals in the Middle East prone to destroying coffee houses full of Jewish children.Avoid this at all costs.Unless you're in the mood to laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget that guy!","review":"This is a well done historical documentary. The other reviewer obviously didn't see the whole documentary and was perhaps not listening. Yes he describes the Rebels in terms of the Viet Cong and Mujuhadeen... but only in terms of explaining how a small band of rebels could defeat such a large emperical army such as the Brits. Yes, he calls the rebels militants... um... they were. They were a militia, there was no government to be an army of.I learned a good deal of the Revolutionary War that I did not know before. The recreations are well done, and the host is engaging and well spoken. Well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tweaky, noisey","review":"This is an OK first amp for your blossoming metalhead, but it wasn't what I wanted. The problem is that none of the amp models are really clean, and don't sound true. Running other effects into this amp results in disaster. It does have a nice noise reduction circuit, and it's needed.A design flaw is that they placed the power cord jack (back) exactly where the unit would rest on most stands available on the market for this size amp. So, you end up chopping the stand or forgoeing it altogether.

Think of early Popol Vuh or Agitation Free (German bands midway between New Age and rock) and you'll have some idea ... Raksha Mancham uses samples of Arab speech and song over which they play North African instruments together with synthesizer and electric bass. The mood is haunting and quite dark throughout. A few tracks have a political message re struggles for freedom of ethnic minorities. This CD may not be completely representative of Raksha Mancham (it seems thay have earlier recordings influenced by Tibetan music) but it is well worth a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's OK, but wasn't worth the price","review":"I bought this for my son's 4th birthday; he had asked specifically for Packer & it was hard to find anywhere else.

When we're not using it in the car it is in my kitchen. Now I can cook and clean and not miss any of my shows. But it really got put to the test over this past Thanksgiving weekend. We drove eight hours with a two year old and an eight year old, and barely knew they were in the car.

However, it does have one major fault: the display is simply not bright enough. It's OK in the house (provided you dim the lights). However, in the car the display is almost unusable. Even in the back seat of a minivan with dark-tinted windows I had to block off the sides with cardboard to make the display watchable.So the bottom line is that the unit doesn't quite fulfill it's promise.

That includes both side-to-side and vertical off-center displacement. My wife was very unhappy with the results, because she moves around lots when in the kitchen.

I tried to guide Roomba to its charger but the \\"forward\\" command buttom stops working after I push it more than three times. (3) I have not tried the Roomba long enough at one cleaning to see if it returns itself to the charger. We have a three-bedroom house. Perhaps we have to try cleaning only one bedroom to see if it will returns to the charger. (4) My son came to our house one time and showed me how to clean the surface of the sensors. He found out that my Roomba has only one sensor while his Roomba has two. I am not sure it it has anything to do with the problems I mentioned above."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roomba's Short Life","review":"We purchased one of the first Roombas--a \\"ProElite\\"--in 2003. While it was working, it was great, but it has now quit working and all that the service techs at iRobot would offer in the way of a fix is for us to send it in and for another $99, they will send a different model. In short, we had a working vacuum for three years--at a operating cost of $100 per year. A colossal overexpenditure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what a piece of garbage","review":"This is one of the most horrible things my husband brought home. It is a filthy machine to clean... stupid plastic comb for the brush... give me a break... broke the first time i used it. The lines in the carpet are deplorable. I have to go over it with my REAL VACUUM to make the rooms look respectable. I would not recommend this to anyone. I guess if you are too lazy to use a REAL VAC, then this might work, but, not in this household!!! Really ticked when I saw what hubby paid for this piece of trash. I only wish we had not opened the box & tested it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work, what an expensive piece of garbage I got stuck with!","review":"For the first 4-5 times I tried this machine, it worked for maybe 30 whole seconds and stopped. It never ever returned to the base as promised, it never worked for up to 60 minutes as promised...what a piece of garbage. It did seem to suck up some dirt when it was working. I emptied the compartment of any dust, checked and dusted the sensors and now it's just not working at all. I have been robbed!I bought it used through one of Amazon's marketplace sellers, another big mistake. But it looked brand new in the packaging. Now I am stuck with it. Seller won't reply. I put a claim in but so far, I feel like I wasted nearly $200, if you include shipping and all that! I will never ever use a marketplace seller again. Amazon is great but they obviously don't always work with above board people."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work after a few months","review":"The wheel sensors get dirty and send the device dancing in circles.

It does a poor job of cleaning, but when, not if and soon after you start using it the battery will quit working. Don't be fooled thinking that you can get another one. I have been through three different replacement batteries and done all of the \\"reset\\" instructions. None of them work. iRobot will of course tell you you are doing something wrong. It is the robot and the battery design that are crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Third Roomba not the charm","review":"This was our third roomba. The first lasted two years before it had a stroke. The second one lasted 4 years, until it ran into a heavy high box that feel on it causing a concussion(our fault). This one worked fantastic and unlike the first that went through a battery every year, the batery on this lasted 4 years. So we obviously wanted something close to the second and did not need a lot of bells and whistles. This looked the closest to that model even though we did not need the scheduling.It was no where near as good as the second roomba. It is kind of chinzy compared to its sturdy predicessor. It can't even climb over the jam going into bathrooms like the earlier model, it stalls on vents and struggles on slightly thick carpeting. In addition we went through 2 bateries in a year. Now after 8 years of roombas we are back to the old vacuum cleaner. Wish I could get the old model back."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a great help around the house","review":"The Roomba is great to have in this busy world of ours. It helps keep the dust off our floors plus it is fun to watch it move around the house. It looks for dirt and picks it up. The bad part is the docking station, it has a hard time getting seated on the station, so it does not received a full charge. We just plug it in to the charging unit. As for all the other accessories we have not use them yet, so I have no opion on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Racket","review":"This thing is a toy, nothing more. Will pick pick dirt from the floor but, even when new, had a relatively short battery life (returned to battery charger before finishing even a small room). Now, not quite two years old, the battery lasts approximately 10 minutes. The company is apparently aware of some problem because the website gives instructions for improving battery life. However, the procedure does not work. I have gone through the process four times with no improvement to battery life. Save your money, unless you want an expensive way to entertain your pets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but not perfect","review":"Mine lasted one year with heavy pet hair use.

Since my floor is completely flat, I put masking tape over the sensors for floor dropoffs, and WOW, it now works like majic. I remember how in the 1950's Popular Mechanics Magazine promised alll of these labor saving devices, along with an arplane that could take off from your driveway and everyone could afford, well, the IRobot Roomba is everything a labor saving device could ever be...every promis ever made in the 50's for same. I love it. I leave it and when I come home the livingroom is completely clean ( the floor anyway) and it is safely parked in its recharger with little effort of mine being expended. Buy one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my Roomba!","review":"We purchased the Roomba Scheduler a month and a half ago. It can be loud, but I was aware of that thanks to other user reviews, and since I can schedule it to run when I'm gone, or just start it as I'm leaving the house, that was not a big issue. The benefit of Roomba keeping my hardwood floors clean without getting my \\"big\\" vacuum out several times a week definitely overcomes any negatives.Note: I did not realize that there are some \\"consumable\\" parts that will need to be replaced periodically (filter, roller brush and such). It came with a spare of each consumable, but you may want to research the cost and frequency of replacing these if that is an issue for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"iRobot Roomba 4230 Scheduler Robotic Vacuum","review":"Bought as a gift for Family Member.

It's been 2 months since I ordered the battery and Irobot can't tell me when I can get this replacement part, but they can offer a good deal on a new unit. THIS IS CLEARLY A BAIT AND SWITCH AS WELL AS A DECEPTIVE BUSINESS PRACTICE. THIS UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR MEANS I WILL NEVER DO BUSISNESS WITH THIS COMPANY AND I ADVISE EVERYONE TO AVOID I-ROBOT.DO NOT BUT THIS PRODUCT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Vacuum Cleaner","review":"The vacuum does an adequate job vacuuming carpets. The real advantage is not having to push a heavy vacuum. We only have to use our big vacuum every few months. The robot reaches all areas of the carpet, no more dust bunnies under the bed. It also terrifies the cats.Downside: We have new carpets that quickly fill the vacuum with fluff, requiring emptying the compartment after every use. It is difficult to remove the fluff from all areas of the vacuum. With the passage of time there is less fluff and the vacuum only requires emptying every so often."},{"rating":"1","title":"it sucks that it does not suck","review":"The IRobot is really fun to watch zoom around the room, but it does not really clean any type of floor.

We track in leaves and dog hair off our patio, so I let Rosie go at nite while we're in another room and she picks up grass, leaves, dog hair, crumbs, dust... I walk around barefoot a lot, and i never get little pieces of grit stuck to my foot after Rosie has been at work!My house is small (about 1230 sq. ft) and I don't use her in the living room where there is deep plush carpet, even though I tried her in there and she worked, it takes much, much longer so I run the upright in there.But she goes under furniture, under the bed and dresser, and those places are cleaner than they have ever been!This is a great product and a time saver for me. It's one less chore I need to worry about and I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it until it broke!","review":"I loved this little guy when I got it, but just after 5 months of normal use it broke!

I tried several sources to purchase a new battery and none of them have one in stock, not even IRobot. I think that is absolutely pathetic.The fact that they are willing to take your old Roomba in on trade in, makes me think they are not very honest in how they do business. Too bad, I liked the machine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised","review":"I have 5 dogs and cats and thought the Roomba probably wouldn't perform very well under the circumstances. I got a great deal from the Woot site on the scheduler and thought I'd give it a shot. I love how it gets all the dust bunnies out from under the beds, sofas, etc., that you just can't get with a normal vacuum cleaner unless you move all the furniture. I also think it does a pretty good job with the pet hair. Now, all my floors are tile so it's great in my home. Now, you do have to empty the bin a little more often than you'd want to, but I see that as only a tiny problem. I would definitely buy it again. I already have the scooba and think that it is wonderful too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roomba Scheduler","review":"Used both QQ2 and Roomba.

So all's I can say is that it is GREAT and am glad that I purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy","review":"I own the discovery and love it, so I ordered the scheduler. Big mistake. It will not work properly. Sits and spins in one spot.Tried all the troubleshooting tips, nothing works. Called the customer service number which is a joke.

Called more than twenty times, different days and times just to hear my call is important please hold.....Still holding, feel very ripped off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scheduler not as good as roomba red","review":"Let me start by saying that I am an avid roomba fan.. I owned the roomba red first and then decided to upgrade to the scheduler. the sceduler only found it's base about half of the time and the biggest problem I had was that the scheduler fell down my stairs multiple times.. The roomba red never fell down my stairs.. so for the money I would go with the roomba red.. you do have to start it yourself but it is worth the money difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty cool so far","review":"I just got the scheduler out of the box and so far I'm amazed. I was skeptical but it has initially at least passed my expectations. First try, it cleaned my entire carpet well without getting stuck or having any problems. Even managed to weave through a narrow opening onto my sunroom, vaccum that and then find its way back out. Only problem so far is it didn't go back automatically to the charger as promised even though it was on clean mode. It went back close to it many times but just kept vaccuming until it ran out of power (maybe 1 hour, which is less than the 120 est minutes but I do have a large room and carpet so it seems reasonable). Overall, I like it...now I just hope it holds up well over time and continues to operate at this level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable and always breaking down","review":"Of the two I own, I had problems with both malfunctioning in less than a year. One malfunctioned within a couple of weeks and I ended up exchanging it for another. Both these have malfunctioned, and right now I have one that hasn't worked for over a month. IRobot has made suggestions on what is wrong, but the bottom line is that my roomba is STILL malfunctioning. $329 (plus tax) sitting idle. That's a lot of money to waste. While it was working, it was nice - kept white fuzzballs off my dark carpet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roomba solved my vacuuming problem","review":"I have a 96 year old mother who still wants to help - but gets sick when vacuuming.

My rugs are much cleaner than I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thing since sliced bread!!!","review":"I was not sure if this thing would work, but I have to wonder how I lived without it! I have 3 kids and 3 inside dogs, and this is a life saver. It cleans 100% better than my central vaccuum. My husband accidentally dropped it and broke off the front wheel. One call later they said send it in and they will replace and clean it. I was back like new within 2 weeks- faster than I ever expected. I love it, was thinking about getting another one, putting eyes on it and name it spot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"Poor customer service at Roomba, No instruction book came with it, when I called I was on hold for 20 mins, I finally gave up & emailed them they said they would respond within 24 ohurs, they never did. About a year ago I was thinking of buying one & emailed Roomba a question, they never answered me then either. I have to give this item 1*, because while it works ok, it seems delicate & could easily break & I think the chances of Roomba actually honoring your warranty is very slim since you can't get in touch with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"I bought this vacuum to save me some time but it is actually taking more time out of my day because I have to go over the areas again with our upright vacuum. The Roomba does not pick up what it should for the price, however my biggest complaint is that its \\"random\\" movement is not so random. It basically picks an area and goes around in circles until it runs out of batteries. I have a pretty small apartment and it can't even manage a whole room. In addition, it is not very quiet, especially for an apartment. My recommendation is that you same money and time and buy a regular vacuum!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great product, clean thoroughly, charge automatically","review":"I schedule it when I am not home.

I purchased this book along with another but this is currently the book I am working out of. Excellent information on the Autoharp as well as music theory. Many old favorite songs that are easy to follow. I really appreciate the finger positioning explanations for both 12-15 bar and the 21 button Autoharps. The text provides various strumming techniques followed by an appropriate song on which to practice.

I'm not sure what they were going for, but my family and I find it strange and annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the Way","review":"This is kind of a transitional album. Shania's first album, the one before this, was in the country vein. She begins the transition to country/pop and country/rock that came to real fruition in Come on Over, the album after this one. This album isn't quite the blockbuster that its successor is, but still very good. Very good tunes:Any Man of MineI'm Outta HereWhose Bed Have Your Boots Been UnderNo One Needs to Know"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is Shania","review":"Come On Over was a good album, but its pale in comparison to this fantastic album, The Woman In Me. This created a tidal wave of change in country. Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under and Any Man Of Mine changed country, because it was a female who was dressing a little more skimpier and was a little more sassy that what country was used to. Those were the two first hits, but then came another gem, my personal favorite, The Woman In Me (Needs the Man In You). Beautiful song. If Youre Not In It For Love is fun. You Win My Love is the best upbeat in my opinion. I could go on and on. Another good one is Home Aint Where His Heart Is Anymore. Other memorable songs are God Bless The Child (video is much better), Leavin is The Only Way Out, If It Dont Take Two and more. You need this album if you like country, it was revolutionary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Country!","review":"\\"The Woman In Me\\" was a great second effort for Shania! This cd is 100% country. So if you love country, this cd is a must buy. This cd has fun lyrics and the tunes are catchy. The best cuts are \\"Any Man Of Mine\\", \\"I'm Outta Here\\", \\"Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under?\\", \\"Home Ain't Where His Heart Is Anymore\\", and \\"You Win My Love\\". I can go on, but hey, you need to find out for yourself. Get the cd! You won' be dissapointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent album!","review":"Every single song on this album shows her rich, deep voice and stellar song writing. It covers everything from boot stomping songs to slow ballads. The only dissapointment was God Bless the Child. The back ground music was excellent and the back up vocals by her ex husband were impeccable. With eight singles released from the album show it's versatility and appeal to traditional country fans. Six of the songs made it onto her Greatest Hits album. This is a goodalbum with longer songs than you will find on Come On Over, but there are less of them. No On Needs to Know was featured on the soundtrack for Twister and Any Man of Mine was her first number one single. You will find many fun songs and some slow touching songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before she became a household item...","review":"\\"The Woman in Me\\" is what I call the \\"Cinderella\\" story of a release. Virtually ignored by the POP market, this CD features TRUE country that somehow managed to generate sales over 11 million (last I checked). With the follow-up selling around the same amount, you can only wonder how GOOD this CD REALLY is! Well, it's flawless! You won't find sugar-coated sellout tunes like \\"You're Still The One\\" but instead some great roots music which makes you wonder how this Canadian and her (ex?) rock-producer Mutt Lange could have come up with this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"100+ New & Used for Sale - That should speak for itself","review":"The CD is monotonous and annoying after a few listens. After hearing the entire CD 5 or more times I realized that Shania has very little range. Hearing her live in concert further proved to me that she has very little talent, is the product of great marketing, sex appeal, and genius editing by her husband, Mutt. It's no wonder he is the best in the buisness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent album, an ear opener!!","review":"I have every tape of Shania's. I love them all!!

My faves are Any Man Of Mine and You win My Love."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it,she great!!","review":"This has always been my favorite CD mainly because it has the first song I heard by her on it. Which is also my favorite song by her \\"Any Man Of Mine\\". I used to listen to that song all day long until it was time for me to go to bed. Even then I played it on my CD player. I was told one time that I sung the song in my sleep. One time I was sleeping in the car when her song \\"Nobody Needs To Know\\" came on and I woke right up and started singing to it. After that I went back to sleep. I see alot more country artist following her. You're seeing a lot more mid-drif and hearing a little more upbeat sound to the songs. I guess they're finally realizing that country music doesn't have to be like it was in the 50's. It doen't have to be to the extreme to where it isn't country any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shania used to be the only country I liked","review":"Shania used to be the coolest singer in my books and thats before i even saw what she looked like she is a great singer and she is very hot her other cds are better but this one was very good"},{"rating":"2","title":"HAVE YOU HEARD...","review":"This album went something like 11 or 12 times platinum, so you know it's probably a keeper right from the start. The Woman In Me has a bit more of a traditional country music feel to it than Come On Over does, but it's still very accessible to anyone who's not a real country fan. The CD is full of songs that make you feel good, and might get you thinking \\"country music ain't too bad\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new version of country","review":"I am not much of a country fan. I would rather put a Destiny's Child CD in my CD player before a country CD. However, I feel Shania Twain has come up with a version of country that can make even a R&B/pop listener like myself a fan. I like to listen to her songs over and over again. There is a song on her album that I can listen to if I want to dance. If I want to relax she has it covered also."},{"rating":"2","title":"A super album. If you don't already have it, get it!","review":"I love all the songs on it. I don't usually like female country singers, except for Patsy Cline, Wynonna Judd, and Faith HIll, but Shania is the tops.

I also just can't stand these songs.Shania is a mega talent and all of her other work is great. This collection is vastly inferior for someone of her talent. I hate \\"Any Man of Mine\\" so much that I think that song is torture and punishment for the hearing. Those discordant violins have got to go! They don't work on this piece.\\"Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under\\" is just as bad. These songs should be kindly retired. They stink."},{"rating":"1","title":"It gets old quickly","review":"Her lyrics are preachy and condescending. Her voice is saved by great production and busy background tracks. But she's been hyped, hyped, hyped by the media. Her songs are catchy but you eventually get sick to death of hearing them. I have this CD and \\"Come on Over\\" and have retired both of them. I actually feel her debut album was her best because only one song was written by her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harsh, Screechy Blue Collar Noise","review":"I don't like Shania Twain. I hate this CD. I hate another one she whines, \\"Honey, I'm Home\\" on a different CD. It's just too lowbrow. \\"Pour me a cold one\\" is blue collar, low brow sounding. This CD is painful to listen to.

Too loud and whiney."},{"rating":"2","title":"The woman in me......","review":"Well, to start of with, i'm not a fan of country music. I fell in love with her Come On Over CD, and thought to buy some of her older stuff. On the first listen, I was a bit put off with the country sound to it, and it took me a while to listen to it again. But listen to it I did, and the more I listened to it, the more I fell in love with it. The lyrics are gorgeous, the beaty songs are cool, and, after a while, you don't even really notice the countryness of it. It's a cool album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Country music with an attitude!!!","review":"Shania Twain has done something with country music that very few have managed to accomplish. She has turned non and some-timey country listeners into full fledged country die hards. Her music has a sound that won't give up and keeps you listening for more. The beat gets you moving and the lyrics get you singing no matter what wood you're in, this music will get you jumpin and begging for more!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as \\"Come on Over\\" but worth the purchase","review":"I base my review on how many of the songs I enjoy from a Cd and while Come on Over had more songs that I absoloutly enjoyed, this album has at least five quality songs. This album has the upbeat songs that I prefer (just as Come On Over does) as well as a few lower tempo recordings.I think for anyone who likes anything they have heard from Shania must own this album as well as my favorite, Come On Over."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing and dull","review":"I was looking forward to reading this author for the first time but this book couldn't catch my interest at all.

Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"Awful book! I like some of Alexandra Raife's books, but this one is awful. First there is the tease that is hinted at but not revealed. Just tell us, for pity's sake, so we can understand what is going on! Then the main male character is so unlikable that you keep hoping someone will show up who is really worth caring about. When I think of some of this author's other books, it's difficult to believe that this was even penned by her. The bad language and emotional shifts are excessive, and I don't care for the \\"sex for fun with no commitment\\" attitude. \\"We'll just have sex and nobody will get hurt!\\" What is that??? \\"I want to see your naked body and make love to IT???????????????????\\" A huge disappointment and I can't believe an author like Mary Stewart who has recommended this author has read this particular book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's my enhanced portion?","review":"Let me start by saying that I love the Nekromantix. Since the first note I heard, I was hooked. When I bought this re-issue I was led to believe from Amazon's listing, Hellcat Records website & other various sources that it was an enhanced disc with concert footage circa 1994. So why doesn't my copy have any enhanced content? I love the album (though I'm disappointed that I can't find an original copy) but what happened and why does every online source still list it as an enhanced disc?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soul Renching and Personal","review":"HOME is a fantastic set of songs which reaches your heart. The lyrics are pure, direct and personal. \\"Going Down\\", a song of a brother imprisoned, an unwed mother, a father's coping, strikes straight to the soul of America. This is, simply, a very good CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hope not the last","review":"This is the third of a series called \\"Beacon Hill Mysteries.\\" They have all been good, but this is the best of the lot. The late Victorian age was a time when science was stretching into the technology of daily life, and the very air was alive with possibility. Boston, on the other hand, had a stultifying rigid caste system. Despite a great admiration for science, those who experimented too much stood the chance of becoming \\"ruined\\" and no longer being accepted into polite society.Our characters in this mix are Addington Ames, the middle aged and stuffy older brother of Caroline Ames, thirty six year old spinster, and their boarder, Dr. MacKenzie, invalided from the Army by a Sioux bullet. The characters are beautifully drawn and set solidly in their period with no anachronistic issues.The first book in the series is \\"The Death of Colonel Mann.\\" The second is \\"Murder at Bertram's Bower.\\" Each book is better than the last. I am looking for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"sad to see this series lapse","review":"I enjoyed this book, and immediately sought out Peale's other titles. Rich in historical detail, and color. The mystery plot, however, seems a little bit of an afterthought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great album, but Caveat Emptor on this version","review":"This version of Clockwork Orange Sndtrk is the same material on the original lp version, but the packaging seems a little lacking and might be a pirated copy.First of there's no covers in the shrinkwrapped jewel case, there was a UPC sticker on the shrinkwrap.The CD is a printed silver, not a burned blue CD, with a picture that looks like the original CD with the track listing and \\"made in USA\\", but the printing quality on the CD is a little off and looks like it came from a scan, not from WB or Rhino. It also lacks any publishing info and even most bootlegs have that info on them.If I bought this used for about $10 I'd be happy, but at the current, over $20 price, I would have passed and kept listening to the lp until it come back into print."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST SOUNDTRACK EVER MADE. EVER.","review":"I love this soundtrack so much.The music works extremely well for the film, but if you don't want to watch the film to hear the beautiful music, you could always perhaps this CD. It contains classical well known compositions that seem to entertain. A must have for the classical music fan/film buff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easier to experience than the movie!","review":"Having purchased this soundtrack along with its respective CD score (by Wendy Carlos), it is a wonderful installment to any soundtrack fan/buff. The awesome sound of classical music, contained in the CDs, in which director Stanley Kubrick chose for the picture, is so juxtaposing it is brilliant. Even if one does not know a lick of classical music, one can easily suggest this soundtrack as a useful introduction into the genre. Though the film may not be as easy to experience as the music contained inside, the soundtrack stands as a milestone for music in film perhaps only beaten by the director's previous work in '2001 A Space Odyssey'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pirated Music","review":"The product I received was not a legitimate product from all appearances. I purchased this item as a replacement for my lost copy of the Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange OST on compact disc. The product I received didn't even resemble my original nor was it packaged in a manner consistent with published music. I immediately destroyed the disc and all accompanying materials."},{"rating":"2","title":"dumb and dumber, fun and funner","review":"Fans of Yes and King Crimson probably need not apply. A mensa level IQ will probably preclude your understanding the deepest implications inherent in Reg Presley and his fellow intellectual's existential pavane \\"I Can't Control Myself\\". I myself am constantly amazed at the many parralels to be drawn between Dostoevsky\\"s 'The Idiot' and \\"Wild Thing\\". It quickly becomes apparent that The Troggs had tapped into the same rich vein of ethical malaise as that of the philosopher Spinoza in their quest for the philological answers found on \\"Love Is All Around\\". Cartesians and Nihilists alike will agree however that if you want to jump start a baby boomer party this sucker is a sure bet."},{"rating":"2","title":"innovative","review":"I love how each chapter is a \\"first\\" chapter, but still tells another piece of Sarah's story.

In this book you get just a hand full of images which look like a zeroxs of a copy. You'd be better off going to your local library and wasting less money using their copier and getting better quality from it or getting something else for that price which is why I'd give it a zero in stars (but I guess this review doesn't give you that option hence the 1 star)... it's not even worth a quarter of what you pay for it or the time you'd take to click and order it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great guide for people with SUVs.","review":"This is a really good guidebook for anyone who drives a stock sport-utility vehicle, and who wants to explore the backways of places like Death Valley, Joshua Tree, Anza-Borrego, Mojave Preserve and lots of lesser-known places in the California desert.

Nancy, Bess, and George go to Belgium to help a friend of Bess's mother. A lot of creepy, awful things happen. Nancy enters a mystery contest, but her manuscript gets stolen, someone tries to break in their house, and in Belgium lots of things happen, too. There are many suspicious people there, Ms. Marvin's friend's diamond pendant is stolen, there are lots of creepy trapdoors and passageways, even a ghost! I guarantee that you'll love this book if you read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Priceless music","review":"In this stunning 4 cd set you'll find the very best of Abba, a group now seemingly overlooked in the cannon of today's music. This is a shame, since the tracks here show how innovative the Sweedish quartet truly was, combining a pleasent mix of pop-based music with classical elements and the stunning vocals of the band members. The only reason I gave this set only 4 stars is the treatment of one of my favorite Abba tracks - the great lost song \\"Just Like That\\", which is presented here in the \\"Abba Undeleted\\" track mixed in with snippits of other unreleased songs. Here \\"Just Like That\\" is reduced to two repeats of the chorus only - hardly fair treatment for such a great track. I was sure this would be included in its full form, but sadly it wasn't. Oh well...maybe it'll slip out of the vaults someday..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should I laugh or cry?","review":"How many songs in the last 30 years are as powerful as the ones here? ABBA will take you through the entire range of emotions on their Box Set \\"Thank You For The Music.\\"All your favorites are here. Granted, you are going to have to shell out some bucks for this delightful collection, but hey, it's ABBA! They're worth it! You're worth it!Especially fun is Disk 4, with all sorts of hard-to-find ABBA songs. If you are an ABBA fan, you'll recognize some of their popular melodies imbedded in a few of these more obscure songs (\\"Does Your Mother Know\\" in \\"Dream World\\" for example).A 60-plus page booklet attached to the box contains MANY great ABBA pictures along with some great ABBA history to read.Should I laugh from the joy ABBA brings? Should I cry that I will never have the chance to hear ABBA live? I'll just put these CDs in my stereo and scream: \\"ABBA, Thank You for the Music! \\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef?","review":"When someone buys a box set they are usually already fans so they don't need another copy of Dancing queen or Chiquita. Why not include some rarities like their final concert on the rooftop of the Swedish Embassy or a dvd of their Folsom Prison Show only available as a bootleg?I also think it would have been better to have the songs in random order as while their songs from the later years are catchy they pale in comparison to their groundbreaking earlier work and by the time I get to disc three I am sleepy tired. I mean how can you compare \\"Put on Your White Sombrero\\" to 'Happy Hawaii\\"?It's a shame all the infighting and Frieda's anorexia caused this great band to dissolve into a heap of doggy poo. Clam chowder is one thing but silly string can stick to the wall, I guess clam chowder can to now I think back to Bjorns drinking problem and his solo unplugged album."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL!","review":"This box set is awesome- 66 songs! ABBA Undeleted is one of my favorite tracks because it's the only way to hear ABBA's unfinished/unreleased songs. So they are songs you've never heard. How fun! In all, (including ABBA Undeleted songs) there are 80 songs. Also, there is a 66-page booklet!Best songs: Dream World, Elaine, Burning My Bridges (Burning My Bridges is a country song), and You Owe Me One.I would also reccommend listening to the previews of the songs to be sure you like the box set. ENJOY PLEASE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Buying for Just a Few Rare Tracks...","review":"The best part of this collection is the rare, previously unavailable tracks. Never mind that buying this item means acquiring songs one already has; it is the the above mentioned rare stuff that is worth the price of admission. Disc 4, Track 8, Medley, Pick a Bale of Cotton, On Top of Old Smokey, and Midnight Special are interesting. Whoever heard of ABBA singing a CCR song? And Track 11 on the same disc, ABBA Undeleted, in which they're \\"jamming\\" is a lot of fun, because it is so informal and spontaneous.Now, if only Agnetha Faltskog's early career German language recordings would once again be available..."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABBA rules!","review":"The definitive, the most ultimate collection of this groovy Swedish pop band. This set truly has it all. No,Thank you for the music! Depressed? Need a boost? Have a Sunday afternoon sing-a-long. Practice your dance moves. No one knows what just a little ABBA can do....If you don't remember crying when they broke up (okay so maybe I was eight, but it was a big deal!) perhaps they're not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hours of listening pleasure...","review":"This set of music is hours of listening pleasure...there is no group like ABBA. Their music is so nice, so pleasurable.I just love them and could listen to them all the time...and you should too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent box set","review":"What a fantastic set for Abba fans. Not only do we get all their hits and a lot of album tracks, but also a whole disc of previously unreleased tracks and B-sides. And not just that, but every song in the set has a paragraph written about it, where and when it was recorded and any other information or little story about it. The 67 page book is very informative, with a forward written by Abba, 3 in-depth essays, a section of their memorabilia and their extraordinary stage outfits. Tons of photos throughout make it a must for any true fan. And with the resurgence of Abba popularity, a new generation is experiencing the Abba phenomena. Benny and Bjorn's intricate music and clever lyrics, Agnetha and Frida's beautiful vocals and harmonies. The best pop band ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sing It, Sing It, Sing it!","review":"Little known in 1972, ABBA released five singles before reaching International stardom. It all culminated in 1982 with more records sales then the Beatles. This 4-CD, 66 song Box Set is only for the true ABBA collector. Benny and Bjorn seem superhuman with their innate ability to write songs and perform a variety of instruments beautifully. Agnetha and Frida pull their own with vocal mixes and solos that defy most singers abilities. Al the songs are here and then some. Only the last disc seems a tad frivilous with a variety of mixes and little know versions of previously released songs. But who can blame them? It all seems like yesterday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally cool with the ABBA boxed set.","review":"The package arrived on time and as advertised. Have played 3 of the 4 cds and I am totally satisfied so far. The history with the box set has been informative, learned facts about ABBA didn't know before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You for the Music","review":"Thank You for the Music is a 4 cd compilation that captures the entire career of this Swedish super popgroup. From their first single \\"People Need Love\\" to the disco tracks like \\"Dancing Tracks\\" and their last single \\"Thank you for the music\\". Here is a little bit of everything for the ABBA fan and not a release to be ignored. My favorite track is \\"The Day Before You Came\\" as I like their more somber and serious lyrics and songs. Highly recommended. 5/5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this for its current price($40)","review":"I bought is product when it was a GOLD BOX DEAL, for $13. I was buying this kit mainly for the HDMI cable, so it thought it was a good deal. The HDMI cable produces a good picture, the fan worked but it was very weak, and the control charger is basically junk. The control charger charges through the USB, and only works while the PS3 is on. You can just as well use the charging cable that comes with your controller. Only one out of the three items in the kit worked well, so I would recommend you pass on this kit."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap","review":"I would not purchase again. the product is flimsy plastic an I was not happy in its quality and the way it preformed. it does not take 20 words for me to give a low review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"I was at the cd release party/show for this album @ the Blind Pig in Ann Arbor. It was a great show and the bass was so loud that it made you feel like you were going to have a heart attack and the swinging lights were very cool. What a great show! The studio release does not carry the same energy as Wig's live shows but it is still a darn good record and worth adding to your collection.

One hears people talk about an infinite capacity to bear pain -- it is not so different as the capacity to bear infinite beauty. If you want the example of such a man, read Genet.The sheer intensity of this book, its fearlessness, its devotion to what is human, is astonishing. This was the first Genet novel I read, & I was converted.

In this beautiful coffee table book, one of the favorite pics is of Whoopi Goldberg. The contrast of her dark caramel skin peeking through the surface of a bright white milk bath is astounding. The curved artistic forms of Yoko Ono & John Lennon show them as they were--as one. You just want to slowly trace your finger over their shapes.There are over 200 photos to delight the senses. Most are of famous people which Ms. L has had contacts with from her work at Rolling Stone and other venues. These performers seem to open up to this photographer and are willing to show something more than their \\"star\\" profile. Even people who are not into art or photography, like this book.A grand illusionary celebration.Thanks for your interest & comment vote--CDS"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love her work!","review":"A must have book for all photography fans and amateur photographers. Annie has her own unique style - she knows exactly how to seize the moment. Her early photographs describe her family, Rock stars and their fans and even simple people - in that special moment that will never return, that moment that Annie so creatively captured. Annie's Photographs, are semi-journalistic, and describe a given situation - no excess face powder and bright lights. Besides these, the book contains her most famous \\"staged\\" photographs, in which Annie took pictures of famous people from her own perspective. I must say, that the scenarios and poses chosen for most celebrities fit them like a glove. My favorite photographs are the one in which Woopie Goldberg is soaking in a bath full of milk, and the beautiful photo of Sting, standing covered in mud, in the middle of the desert (of course, there is also the famous photograph of John and Yoko)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captures the true essence of everyone she photographs....","review":"This is one of the most expressive photo books of famous human beings I have ever seen. Leibovitz has a way of capturing the subject at THAT moment that lets you know them and see the humility behind them. Her photos remind us that these \\"famous\\" people are human just like you and I. Leibovits has the talent to do the things that she wants to do and has combined them with all of the elements that are present. The quality of Leibovitz's photos are crisp, clear and sharp.

If possible, even worse as a work of fictionalized who-knows-what. The \\"stories\\" that go along with the recipes are the worst kind of hack chick-fic: tedious and with an artificial flavour, much like the recipes.If anything is worth a star about this book, it's the huge laugh I got from the review by the woman who said she put it on her women's lit reading list.

The main character has no insights as to how she became like she became and she doesn't say anything concerning F. Scott Fitzgerald that has any interest whatsoever. Pretty much it's a tragedy of a southern belle used to being the center of attention who must play the role of The Writer's Wife.

I suspect there are more inspirational books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great history book.","review":"I was looking for a book about the effects of refined sugar on the body. Sugar Blues was a book about the history of refined sugar. Duffy repeatedly says how bad sugar is for you but doesn't back it up with any explanations."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just didn't get this book","review":"I found this a hard read and didn't understand really what was being discussed. Perhaps it's just the beginning of the book that is this way because I didn't make it past the first few chapters that deal with the history of sugar and generalizations made about the effects it had on history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watching my sugar habit, but with a grain of salt","review":"This is an important book on a vital subject. Very worth reading, as long as you remember not to believe every word. Parts of it seem to be well researched, but the untrue parts make it hard to know how to view the rest. The author speculates at length on the medical discovery of diabetes, implying it was unknown before refined sugar entered the diet in the last millenium, but in fact diabetes was described more than 2000 years ago. It would be nice if there were a revised edition or another book on the subject that was more based in fact. But after reading this it's hard to say exactly what differentiates sugar from opium or cocaine: they all have clear physiological effects, all are found naturally in plants, and all can create a dependency. Of course sugar is a lot cheaper and government sanctioned, and those who really can't tolerate it (diabetics) get insurance-covered treatment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This book should be a must read for everyone. It is very insightful and if you want to be healthy you need to know what an awful drug refined sugar actually is and how it is destroying your body. The truth is most people are sugar addicts and do not realize it, we are trained from an early age that sugar is a reward for finishing our meals, we are rewarded with candy for doing a good job, the media portrays soda and sweetened drinks as hip and cool \\"it's the real thing\\" and\\"Obey your thirst\\" many processed foods are loaded with sugar and we consume them in mass without bothering to read the label of the ingredients, Why? because most of us are sugar junkies! we are addicted to the stuff! and the sad thing is that it's no different than cigarettes, alcohol, crack or meth! Do yourself a BIG favor buy this book, read it and take charge of your health, make no mistake refined sugar is POISON!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, Very informative","review":"This book has made me want to change my life, and share this book with others.I am in the process of buying more and handing them out to family and friends.Everyone needs to be better informed about sugar and its harmful effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth is in book","review":"Educated on sugar for SURE. Sometimes, truth hurts but at least its the truth. Sugar is bad esp. in quanities we americans are taking in. I will cut back, but can't go without it completely."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down!","review":"I am not usually a big fan of non-fiction, self help type books, but I could not put this one down. What I liked most was the unique approach of this book. Rather than alot of abstract opinions, this is more of a history of the evolution of refined sugar and the effect it has had on humanity. The author sited case after case of illness and disease due to the intake of sugar, but in an easy to read and very interesting format. Even if you are not ready to make major changes in your life or diet, I would recommend reading this book. It's an eye opening experience!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book!","review":"An excellent book exposing the arrogance and folly of modern medicine. Although primarily dealing with the consumption of refined sugar, this book goes into many relevant tangents weaving in effect an enlightening discussion which forces one to rethink the way he or she has taken for granted to live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue no more","review":"It is amazing the damage sugar does to the body. this is a must have book for every household in America."},{"rating":"2","title":"good old fashioned sense","review":"This book has been around for a while, but it very simply explains the damage that processed sugar is causing to us NOW. No gimmicks, nothing to sell, pure good intentions on the part of the writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel Blessed to Find This Book Again","review":"This is another book I read about 20 years ago and found it to be insightful and mind-boggling!

The author gives a lot of historicaly information about sugar, including the health, economic and political issues that were (and continue to be )tied to it. He describes his own experiences as a sugar addict and how he overcame that, with wonderful healthly results. My husband and I keep reading each other passages from the book...and I can no longer eat sugar without feeling very bad about it. I am considering serious diet changes due to reading this book. Please read this, because Dufty is not telling us anything new, he is just revealing what has been known for a very long time: sugar is dangerous for human health!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Published years ago, but as good as new books on the subject","review":"I read this book years ago and have not been able to locate it locally. Written by Gloria Swanson's good friend or paramour, I'm not sure which, it is as good as new titles on the subject of sugar, the enemy. The first part of the book, where Duffy questions Swanson about what she had to eat at a cocktail party, is worth the read. His description of what was in her stomach could turn anyone off of food. Catch this one to understand that diet theories, fads, and programs are usually not new ideas, just a rehash of common sense information."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will never allow you to view sugar the same","review":"\\"Sugar Blues\\" will change you outlook on sugar forever. It opened my eyes to pay attention to what I put in my body. This book is hard to read at times and does appear to be very opinionated, but it had a great impact on my life. I have been eliminating sugar from my diet and I have never felt better. I had gained a lot of weight during the last year and had little energy. I have made a concious effort to put to use the tips in this book and I have a new lease on life. My energy seems to go up every day. If you like this book another that I have read is:\\"Get the Sugar Out\\". It includes a few sugarless recipes as well. Please read this book if you are having ANY health problems or a low energy level. This will change your life forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"If it isn't so, why don't you try dropping sugar cold turkey","review":"It has a tremendous impact on the way you eat. When you began checking labels and see the amount of sugar in your diet, it is amazing! It gave me the push to turn away extra sugar items. I personally want to leave this world with my pancreas when I go and one that hasn't been totally worked to death! =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kick your sugar habit and start feeling great!","review":"I came upon this book in the Library and I just thought I would take it home and read it for fun. I had no idea this would change my life. This is a thoroughly researched and detailed book but only for those people with open minds. After reading the book I tried to locate a copy to keep but I could not even find this book at a national chain. Good old Amazon had it. I am now on an anti sugar crusade and when anyone asks me I tell them about Dufty's book. I have also begun purchasing several at a time and giving them to people I feel are open to learning and changing themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best reviews of the sugar industry","review":"This is one of the best and revealing books on the sugar industry and the government connections I have read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jeeez Louise! Get to the point already!","review":"I don't usually skim through books, but by chapter two I'd had it with all the extraenous historical information that Dufty seems to think is needed. All I wanted to know was: why sugar is bad for you, what it does to your body physically and mentally, and what you can do to eliminate this drug from your diet, i.e. food substitutions. There is a little info on all the above, but you have to search through all the other verbage to find it. If you are the kind of person that likes to go to flea markets and sort through piles of junk in hopes of finding some little treasure, then you'll probably like this book. Me personally, I don't want to spend the time. Lets get right to the point. I came away wondering whether the publisher paid this guy by the word to write this book. Too verbose!!!I've since ordered another book by Gittleman? called 501 ways to eliminate sugar from your diet, which from the reviews I've read, sounds like its more to the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sugar is like cocaine.","review":"This book came highly recommended byy father in law. We eat a very Paleo diet, and I just wanted to educate myself even further about sugar. As soon as I read it, I will write a thorough review of the book. Fast shipping. Can't wait to read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Excellent","review":"Although this book was originally written over 25+ years ago, it is still valid reading for those looking to kick sugar.An interesting note is that author Dufty was inspired to delve into the subject after meeting aging yet ageless movie star Gloria Swanson (70s???). He ended up marrying her and was her last husband!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Book super, but sugar is not so sweet","review":"I bought the book on a recommendation from Greensmoothie girl. com It really gave my eyes a new wide open realization about how truly toxic sugar can be. I am trying my best to get off it by using other sweeteners when the need presents itself. Used Dr. Barnards, Breaking the Food Seduction. Great History lesson, but I wish he had more science from recent decades."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author bias makes it hard to read","review":"While the message has much validity, the author's presentation is so biased that it is very hard to finish reading the very short book"},{"rating":"2","title":"The unfortunate truth.","review":"This book was highly recommended by a friend but I was reluctant to purchase it book becuase it was realeased more than 35 years ago. However, it would have been my loss had I not gotten it. It is a very fascinating and illuminating little book, written in a way that is a very easy read. I recommend it to anyone who wants to improve their health and learn how such a dangerous substance has become such an integral part of daily lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended for anyone who wants better health!","review":"First read this 30 years ago and it's had a profound, positive effect on our (my husband and myself) health and lives. It is the answer, in a big way, to the bulk of American's health problems today with diabetes and obesity, to mention only a few problems that are deeply aggravated by sugar addiction.It is based on personal experience, not theory, and the self portraits on the back page (William Dufty, sugar addict compared with William Dufty, recovered sugar addict, tell it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Francie has a problem - she needs a husband and kids asap!","review":"Any woman will tell you it's hard to find a good man, but Francie manages it with Ryan MacNair.

It's widescreen (*not* pan & scan), plus it comes with a Director's Commentary which offers good insights from Joseph Sargent (who also directed the original \\"The Taking of Pelham One Two Three\\").Admittedly, it won't be cheap. Current exchange rate amounts to eighteen bucks plus shipping. But you'll then be able to enjoy one of the classics of science fiction. It predates WarGames by more than ten years, and offers a more realistic--if darker--vision of the future of computer intelligence.*********************UPDATE November 2009Looks like this has been discontinued by the manufacturer. Wonder if that means a proper Region 1 release (widescreen) might be in the works? Maybe a 40th Anniversary Edition next year??"},{"rating":"1","title":"4:3!!!!","review":"I knew going in that this was a 4:3 NOT 16:9 movie but I remember this movie from years ago and enjoyed it. Only 1 star because of the aspect ratio, 4 stars for the movie.Note to studios: The dual sides DVDs with 4:3 on one side and 16:9 on the other side are bad enough but this is the 21st century.

With the dawning of nano technology it presents a frightning prospect for the future.

I'm an interesting movie trapped in FullScreen format!","review":"A friend invited a group to watch this fun little movie. While the content itself was an interesting story whose themes are cited in modern science fiction movies, the presentation spoils the effect.One of those who watched it with us has worked in the TV industry for some time and had an explanation. He suggested that Universal just used the copy of the film normally sent to TV stations, making a quick-and-dirty version for DVD -- an easy and inexpensive way to produce a copy for home. Taking the actual film out of the vault, correcting color, and re-mastering would be more costly.My friend is returning his copy to Amazon, unhappy with the quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie ... avoid this disk","review":"Colossus is one the best '60s SF films, intelligently written, well directed, with a fine cast. But if you're a fan (as I am) you should avoid this DVD. For some inexplicable reason, Universal has chosen to dump a pan-and-scan version on the market, totally destroying Joseph Sargent's widescreen compositions. Why these companies continue to ruin good movies in this way is impossible to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star for pan and scan. 5 for the movie.","review":"Like many others here, I am a big fan of this movie. An almost boyish looking Eric Braedon (his real name is Hans Gudegast) plays Dr. Charles Forbin, who has invented a super computer to control America's defenses. However, things go awry, as mentioned in the other reviews here.This underappreciated little gem is based on the novels by D.F. Jones (a gardener who hit paydirt with \\"Colossus\\", but really showed his hack side in the followups \\"Fall of Colossus\\" and \\"Colossus and the Crab\\"). This movie deserves widescreen. I was all ready to get the DVD when it came out, but thankfully I saw these reviews.This story is first rate. It is character driven. The \\"antiquated technology\\" gives it a bit of style in my view. It has a message that is still relevent. And it should FINALLY be given it's proper treatment- widescreen at least, and with some extras."},{"rating":"2","title":"Topical even after all these years","review":"I watched this years ago and really enjoyed it. My only critism is of the end, it felt unfinished. I half expect that it was written to be followed up with a second movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome flick!","review":"I can't tell you how many times I have seen this movie. All I know is that it gives me the creeps every time I do. I also begin to look at the computers I work with on a daily basis in a whole new light. When will they begin talking to me? When will they begin telling me what to do? Who will control who?Anyway, if you love sci fi this is a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice movie","review":"Having just recently seen Collusus the Forbin Project on the Sci Fi Channel it has reignited my interest in the film especially if you have an interest in computers. Although not in the same league with Andromeda Strain or Planet of the Apes it is a nice sci fi gem from 1970. The ending begged for a sequel. Too bad they never did one!! Anyway check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The First in a non-Series","review":"In this 60's trend-setter, the two world super-powers, U.S.A. and Russia (Boy, this WAS made a long time ago) have each created a super-computer to run things.

Quite happy when able to get a DVD version. This is one I want forever. I purchased the book; as I recall the movie is close. I also purchased the sequel book, but I didn't consider it worth the bother. This movie is a classic, and actually I do not favor a remake. I don't think it can be improved, particularly if brought forth to present day. I love the work done in the old Sci-Fi movies. I also prefer most of the older Sci-Fi books as well. For me this one is on the top. I reread this review and find it lacking in the enthusiasm I hold toward this movie. But for now it will have to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cold Logic: Obey And Survive...","review":"This cold war masterpiece is right up there w/ DR. STRANGELOVE, FAILSAFE, and the 80s WAR GAMES. Actually, it may be better than any of these! COLOSSUS: THE FORBIN PROJECT is a cautionary tale about technology, war, freedom, paranoia, and security. I can imagine someone today coming up w/ the \\"brilliant\\" idea of centralizing all defensive / offensive capabilities into one massive underground complex. It would solve the world's problems immediately! No more worries! No fears! Society would hum along like a mechanized hive! We would no longer need to think. The central computer would make any / all decisions! Utopia at last! Unfortunately, as in COLOSSUS, we'd probably wind up as a slave race, but isn't that the price of total safety?

Good enough to own."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could you Universal Studio","review":"As others have mentioned, this isn't full widescreen, but instead pan and scan. But on top of that, the transfer looks incredibly grainy. Having seen the laser disc version, I just don't understand where they got this horrid version from.One of the most under rated and oft forgotten dystopian classics of the old style SciFi classics, ruined by a studio that feels fobbing the public off with such a shoddy transfer is acceptable. I'd return this lousy copy but I don't see how this is Amazon's fault. Universal Studio are 100% to blame for this horrible mistake.Please don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pan & Scan has got to go","review":"Why anyone would release a film in \\"Full Screen\\" escapes me. It cheats the viewer by showing only part of the actual image, and call me crazy, but I would think the public would want to see a motion picture the way it was filmed. If the filmmakers wanted Pan & Scan, they would have filmed it that way! Leave Full Screen to the realm of TV shows -- it has no place in the world of theatrical motion pictures!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not widescreen","review":"I got a chance to see an advance copy of this today, and to my disappointment, this DVD is a so-called \\"Full Frame\\" transfer (in other terms, Pan & Scan).Colossus: The Forbin Project was shot in 2.35:1 (I have it on laser disc in widescreen) so you will be losing more than half of the image on this version.What a shame! This is a classic SF movie, and it deserves to be seen as it was photographed. Sure, the price is low, but when you don't get the real film, so what? In any case, it may be reissued some day with in the special edition form it deserves, and then you'll have to buy it again. Purchase not recommended.\\"No widescreen, no sale!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Full-screen??? What's up with that?","review":"Colossus is one of my all time favorite science fiction movies. The movie inspired me to become a software developer, oh so many years ago. I missed it when it came out on laser disc and have been waiting patiently for the DVD release. My question to Universal is what were you thinking releaseing the movie in Pan 'n Scan? The movie was filmed in widescreen! Fans want it in widescreen. As another reviewer mentioned, if you must release it in Pan 'n Scan for those who feel they're losing something if the movie doesn't fill the screen, then at least release it with both formats. Other companies do it. Get with the program!!! I am giving this movie a low rating solely on the lack of a widescreen format.

DVD gets a 1.I own over 100 DVDs. This is far and away the worst DVD I own. It is worse than the original \\"A Christmas Story\\" DVD.Universal has released the worst DVD of the year for, sadly, one of the best 70s/cold-war flicks. The best thing I can say about this DVD is that the film is not on VHS.For starters, they didn't get the title right- Colossus: \\"The Forbin\\" project. OK, whatever. This attention to detail is representative of the entire DVD.Menu? Nope. You get chapters- amazingly enough- but I'd bet they were just generated by the mastering software. I can't say for certain though because there are no scene selections- because there's no menu. Load it in, and the DVD plays.The DVD has a screen that reads \\"formatted to fit your TV\\" which means they don't know about widescreen TVs yet. Thankfully, the opening credits are widescreen so you can read them. The rest of the film is pan and scan. The video transfer is lousy too- moire patterns abound."},{"rating":"1","title":"colossaly TINY!!!!","review":"By QUANMECH; I totally agree with all those who are really ticked-off that this DVD (and,for that matter, VHS) is presented in so-called full-frame (I say \\"so-called\\" because there's nothing FULL about it). WHAT A WASTE! Maybe if enough of us vote with our feet, i.e., NO SALE, maybe someone in charge will WISE-UP and get this COLOSSAL movie re-issued in the format it not only deserves but DEMANDS! Wide-Screen or nothing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Aspect Ratio for a great film","review":"I have to agree with other comments about this release. This is a very good sci-fi movie from the late 60's, but the impact is diminished because Universal decided to release it in a pan and scan version, which frankly sucks. I bought it without checking the aspect ratio which sucks even more. I hate it when a widescreen movie is redirected by a technician to fit a square format that very soon will be obsolete. Please Universal release a widescreen version of this sci-fi classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 Stars for a great film, -3 for Not Widescreen in 2012","review":"I can't believe I didn't read the reviews which make it plain 8 years ago this is a \\"Full Screen\\" (4:3) edition of a widescreen movie, since the ad made no mention whatsoever regarding screen format.I'll eat the cheap price, and I'll enjoy seeing the movie again after 30 years, but the Amazon ad should have at least mentioned the Full Screen layout. Who sells 4:3 edition movies (that weren't full screen originally) these days? Jokers who want to make a fast buck, that's who. Amazon should be ashamed of itself.Sure, I'll keep buying from Amazon.

I read the SciFi reviews and thought this was really a movie for me, and it really was good right up to the end. Just one problem, they forgot to write the end. What happened? Did they run out of money? Did the writer write himself into a corner? There was no climax, conclusion, or resolution. You can argue till you are blue in the face about \\"pan & scan.\\" I prefer movies with an ending. If you are looking for a great unfinished story, this one is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is just like the rest lately...Disappointing","review":"I swore to myself I would not read another DS book again but there I went the lure of a DS book in the shelves was to much for me so I went ahead and bought it. (Can I get a refund?) Ms. Steel your books lately don't come close to what your first books were. The Ring, Zoya, those were, are classics. You didn't spend chapters talking about closets or how much money they had or what the wine tasted like. You truly made us care about the characters. I suggest you take a real break and go back to the reason you became a #1 bestselling author. I know authors don't like to read bad reviews but this is a cry for the good stuff. We miss the Daniel Steel that brought us Message from Nam, No Greater Love. What have you done with her?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I've read this year","review":"I have read a lot of DS books and this is the worst one yet. It was repetitive; the story was totally mundane, not even a little bit intriguing and the ending predictable. I read it to the end hoping it was going to get better but it never did. For a writer of her caliber and reputation she ought to know better. The only good point - it didn't take long to read. This is the last DS book I'll ever buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't she have an editor?!?","review":"Like several other reviewers, I found this repetitive and rambling. It is also very poorly edited, full of comma splices and run-on sentences - overall, extremely annoying. She can be a good story teller, but over the last few years they are more and more poorly written.The books read as if she just tells a story into a tape recorder, and no one cleans them up at all. Second Chances was one of the worst, and this story wasn't good enough to distract from the poor sentence construction, etc. The book seemed like just another she churned out to meet a publishing quota.One more pet peeve: I despise such long chapters with no breaks within them. Although I read a great deal - at least a dozen books a month - I seldom have time to read one of her whole chapters at one sitting, and I prefer having a real \\"stopping place\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical DS!!","review":"I am a big fan of Danielle Steel. If you are a fan you know that the ending is predictable. It follows the usual format of romance as is her custom.It is a look into the world of women whose entire lives are wrapped around their jobs. Fiona lived, ate and enjoyed her job, her single life and all of the trappings. Meeting John was fun but love had a stronger tug despite Fiona's resistance to say no. Fiona had a very difficult road ahead as she wanted to know John's daughters but their resistance to her was even stronger.It is a great summer read and a quick one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic","review":"Danielle spins the usual McRomance. Fairly decent for her, but sometimes there are situations in her books that are simply 50 years out of date. Example is the lady in a former book whose husband REFUSED to let her attend law school. Hello? 2004 calling? I remember a story about a character giving birth who was forced to give birth with her legs strapped down. This written in like 1985 and they stopped doing that in like 1965. Well, the throwback in this book is the two selfish girls who were \\"cruel\\" to the stepmother. Hello? 2004 calling? Like 60% of their contemporaries don't have mixed families? Like mom DIED two years ago? Like y'all are adults? The twist that irritates so much that it throws you out of the web of belief needed to enjoy a romance novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak characters, no \\"magic\\"","review":"Danielle Steel just doesn't have the magic touch that she used to have. I remember reading her earlier books - Malice, Wings (my all time favorite DS book), The Accident, and really feeling captivated by the story line and the characters. The last few DS books I have read have fallen short, and this one takes the cake.Both her main characters, Fiona & John, are both annoying. Fiona is so selfish that she can't even make room in one closet for John's clothes, and John lets his children walk all over him.

Nope - this is the second one I've read that left me wondering what age group she was targeting. She repeats herself like crazy, and the book is filled with short, choppy sentences. In addition, the characters made me bristle! Fiona seems the opposite of the fashion magnate in The Devil Wears Prada - she is kind, generous, and seems to have a heart. She swears off marriage, then lo and behold - after 40+ years of loving singlehood she meets and marries a man in an 8 month time span. This guy swears to never leave her, and knows who he is marrying, yet two months later he throws in the towel - after letting his adult kids and the housekeeper walk all over him.

While most of the endings are fairly predictable, the stories themselves set you up to really be engrossed in the world of the characters and really be sad when you finish the book.This book was short, so I finished it in about a day. It is the first book that I can honestly say I didn't really enjoy of hers. I felt the storyline moved pretty unrealistically, and while the ending was predictable, I didn't feel the quick and easy ending did the story or the characters justice.I will continue to read her books, but this definitely will not have a place in my library and will soon be going to a used bookstore."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites of her later novels","review":"No, not at all like her books from 10-20 years ago. But now and again a newer DS novel can still surprise and be enjoyable!I found this book a little fresher than other books of hers, as of late. I enjoyed the background and the characters, and of course the love story. The main reason I read DS!! I also find the lessons she tries to incorporate are usually worthy, as was this one.If you're looking to give DS a try, as usual, I'd recommend an older novel of hers, like Once in a Lifetime, Thurston House and Wanderlust.

As a long-time fan of Parker's - I've read 'em all and enjoyed most of them - I found Shrink Rap to be silly, contrived, sexist, and banal - and that's the good parts. This book shows the sign of too much success and not enough effort on the part of the author. After a good start - a successful woman is being stalked by a dangerous ex-husband and hires Sunny Randall to provide security - the novel simply whirls down the drain through some really messy plotting into a totally unsatisfying ending. This thing smacks of the typess of sicko fantasy a demented pre-adolescent might dream up. Go back to what you know, Bob! If Spenser had a problem like this, it would be a subplot in a better novel, because he or Hawk would dispense some street-corner justice and the ex-husband would be on the first bus out of town - as soon as he got out of the hospital.

The constant use of \\"she said\\" or \\"he said\\" for every single line of dialogue almost made me roll down my car windows and scream like a banshee. Not only that, but the story was sexist and contrived and, well, rather stupid. This was the first book I ever picked up by this author, and I can't see buying anymore if this is any indication. Give me James Patterson or Patricia Cornwell for murder mysteries any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of All","review":"I've read many of Parker's books and used to be an avid fan. This book seems to be one where Parker lost interest after writing the first page. Many details are utterly superfluous and seem to be fillers to enlarge the book. The plot is silly, and the characters are inane. I know Parker can write well. I wish he would do so all the time and forget about putting out books en masse without serious editing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sunny's fun to be with","review":"So far, I can't say that any of the Sunny Randall books have hit the high point that some Spenser novels have. But I find the three of them consistently good.SHRINK RAP does differ somewhat from your basic Parker story. It's one of the few that doesn't bring in organized crime figures. The principle bad guy is believingly creepy enough that he doesn't need gangster help. He does have a couple of confederates, and again, they are sleazy enough, and somehow more menacing than any of Joe Broz' or Tony Morris' hoods.As others point out, the disguise element doesn't convince. This evil character sure isn't going to be convinced by Sunny's disguise, and I'm afraid I'm not either.However, this book delivers what one expects from Parker...a quick entertaining straight-line read which while mainly diversion still has enough thought provoking elements to satisfy the intelligent reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parker at his most lame","review":"I agree whole heartedly with the recent reviewer who advises us not to put Parker's works in the same league as the classics. However, just as there is good, enjoyable, challenging popular entertainment (be it in books, TV, pop music, theater or film) there is also subpar popular entertainment that wastes the consumer's time. I also agree whole heartedly with the other reviewers who thought that the plot in this book strains credibility and that the dialog and behavior of Sunny, Spike, Julie, the villainous doctor, etc., are just as difficult to accept. Just as Neil Simon isn't Shakespeare, audiences still have a right to quality entertainment from him. Fans of Parker's Jesse Stone and Spenser expect a certain level of craftsmanship from him, and this time he doesn't deliver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great characters, tired template","review":"I sat across the table from my alter ego, pen in hand ready to write a review of \\"Shrink Rap\\".\\"I'm afraid Parker's losing it,\\" I said.\\"Don't you like Sunny Randall?\\" he said.\\"Sunny's great,\\" I said.\\"Then what?\\" he said.\\"His books are all the same,\\" I said.

Told in the first person by Sunny Randall, a private investigator whom everyone she encounters feels called upon to describe as \\"slim and cute,\\" the plot is minimal and the extraneous detail maximal. Parker dwells indulgently on minutiae of clothing, food, Boston area geography and the minute-by-minute actions of Sunny's surrogate child, a miniature bull terrier. We also hear a great deal about Sunny's unsatisfactory love life. After 3 1/2 cassettes (out of 5, total) of ladies' magazine trivia, action heats up a bit, but even after the bad guy is caught in the despicable act we never do learn why those two poor, benighted women had to end up dead.If you know and like Robert Parker, you'll probably enjoy this recording (except for the mind-numbing repetition of \\"he said,\\" \\"she said\\" and \\"I said\\" in every conversational interchange). If you're not a Robert Parker fan, this won't turn you into one."},{"rating":"2","title":"fresh, witty","review":"Sharp dialogue, fresh witty characters, fast-paced mystery. As some of the hateful reviews here note, yes, there is a stong woman as the protagonist. If you don't like that, get another book and crawl back under your rock--But it is not a valid criticism of the book in and of itself.Those of us in the 21st Century who think both men and women should be allowed self-determination, find Parker's Sunny Randall to be interesting (if not always perfect--like most of us), strong, intelligent, witty, realistic and curious. The degree of hate in these reviews against independant women is frightening. They obviously have some problems with equality and are using this venue to make a point at the cost of sincere book reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parker is coasting","review":"If this was the first book I had read by Robert B.Parker, it would be the last.

It is a very short book. Maybe Parker is tired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly amusing","review":"Sunny Randall must spend her time reading Stephanie Plum mysteries. There is no whacky grandmother in this story, but other than that it is pretty much a Janet Evanovich [clone]. Parker's novel read like a movie script in that they are almost all diologue. They also have more white space than a serious writer should be willing to foist on the public. There is really no mystery in this novel just a story of bringing a known stalker to a form of justice by your basically neurotic woman private detective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I love Robert B Parker and this is a great book of his.

Our heroine Gillian Ellicott is made a ward (is that even possible at 20 yrs old?) of Calum Marquess of Iolar, when her father unexpectedly dies.I found this romance novel difficult to get into. Gillian was an immature woman, whose 'hijinks' became annoying after a while. Calum Marquess of Iolar speaks like an extra from Braveheart... \\"Och, weel, we know what that means doona we lassie?\\"I found myself skimming the second half of the book.

A pretentious, over-bearing mother guides Kitty's career from childhood. Although Kitty herself claims that she was never very pretty, couldn't act very well and was at best, a mediocre singer, she still managed to have a movie career (not successful), several Broadway hits and finally a performance at the Metropolitan Opera. She became a staple of the Goodson-Todman game show, \\"To Tell the Truth\\" and these appearances are what she is best remembered for. Her marriage to Moss Hart allowed her access to some of the wittiest and cleverest writers, actors and performers of the day.

Dr. Geller has a very laid back style of writing, which is very comfortable to read and easy to understand. He outlines many psychological theories in a very comprehensible manner, and reinforces ideas with models and anecdotes from his own experiences.My interest in Total Safety Culture was its application towards unleasing latent resources in the union environment, essentially making safety a common ground for labor relations. This book is well worth the money, and a cover to cover read will likely make you want more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confusing in it's brilliance","review":"This movie was a beautiful yet dark glipmse into the lives of poetic greats. Though confusing at times, the cinematography was completely amazing-sometimes eerie. This film has the ability to engulf you, and the acting is excellent. This was an engaging, thought provoking film. The only negative aspect is that at times it gets a little confusing, however overall, an excellent, unique film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Flick!","review":"Although I am biased, I enjoy anything Linus Roache plays in. This is great BBC Film Noir.This historical appetite in this movie is lacking. The film is great for thinking, and expanding your horizons on the film character. I find the acting to be quiet good, believable, and quirky. The British have a way of making a film that our, \\"Hollywood,\\" cannot. If you purchase this film be prepared to be amazed at the characters, and their development. I do not give away total plots or more than my feelings in my reviews beacaue I'll not ruin it for future viewers. Interpretation is always as individual as ones tastes! Enjoy this fine BBC offering. The time travel scenes are to make their point well known, and in a timely manner. The flight, and destruction of man is present here. I never knew opium could be such a creative juice for poetry, or anything else. I do like that justice for the betrayer is done in the flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's get high and write some poems","review":"I watched this movie in one of my classes and I loved it. I did not know that John Hannah was in it, and when I saw him in it I knew I would like it. It is a crazy drug adventure that is beautifully done. If you liked Fear & Loathing you will enjoy this movie, if not...don't bother. No, the movie is not historically accurate. I don't think they wanted it to be, but what they did do is make a great movie. The dialogue is great, and the acting superb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pandaemonium--Dumb and Dumber","review":"This movie is stunning in its stupidity. The writers are obviously incapable of even the dimmest understanding of the work of either Wordsworth or Coleridge. In their ignorance they must fall back upon a stereotypical pastiche bearing virtually no resemblance to the history or character of either poet. The legacy of these two literary giants offers a rich tapestry to exploit.

What made me notice it was the young man reading it would often smile and kind of nod to himself, but, also, at least three times during the flight, I noticed him wiping what appeared to be tears from his eyes. As the flight ended, I asked him about the book, and he simply handed the book to me and said \\"read it for yourself, Its a great story.\\" I went on to read Patent Piracy in two night at my hotel room and was brought into a powerful tale of a man who simply would not give up. If you've ever been knocked down in life, Patent Piracy will encourage you to get back up.

I asked my pastor, but never got satisfactory answers. I recently joined a Lutheran (LCMS) church and read this book and the Book of Concord. I found both to be very helpful, but in particular, I enjoyed how the Small Catechism answered so many of the questions I had previously been unable to answer.

I have to continually reach behind me (while sitting in the driver's seat) to center the pillow. If it were longer, like 16 inches, I wouldn't have to keep reaching behind me (while driving) to adjust it. Also, the zipper handle occasionally comes up and that too digs into my back. Again, when that happens, I have to awkwardly reach behind me to adjust it. I guess they make it short to scrimp on costs. BTW, I'm not a big person (5' 11, 170 lbs), so I'm surprised more people haven't mentioned this. Aside from its length issue, the pillow is well constructed. No complaints in that regard.

Perhaps I should have ordered the firmer version that some of its reviews claim was too firm. It's too late and not worth the time and money to return the two I received.

It cleans everything from plush carpeting to stone floors. The trick Ive found is you have to clean the brush head off especially if you are vacuuming pet hair. (I find that most people dont do that and then the vacuum ceases to be effective).I have had no problems with the attachments--still have all the original attachments as well as the bare floor attachment (which I bought separately). Nothing has broken.I was on Amazon looking for an upgraded machine, but am thinking that I will probably just stick with the Magic blue since its seemed to have outperformed many of the other cleaners here."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL!","review":"it was amazing to me that i see some poor reviews here on this little vacuum! - i bought one quite a few years ago when they first came out - use it on both carpet/tile/hardwood almost daily. after two years we had a lightning storm which \\"fried\\" almost everything plugged in (yes, i'd left it plugged in), including large appliances.anyway, had to replace it then. that was about 3 yr.s ago - purchased another and love it just as much! i honestly would not trade this little jewel for another rainbow vac.someone on a review mentioned it having little suction? this vacuum's suction is so powerful that i often need to turn it down!i drag this little guy back and forth from my gift shop to the house....love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vacuum, but waaaaay over priced.....","review":"I own this vacuum and it is really great on hard-wood and tiled floors, but DO NOT buy if you have a lot of carpet in your home because, like others have said, it will not work well on carpet. On other floors you shouldn't find any trouble at all. JUST DON'T GO OVER SCREWS, or really big objects, AND THINGS THAT MIGHT ROLL AROUND THE ATTACHMENTS OR THEY WILL SURELY NOT WORK WELL AND MAYBE EVEN BREAK (as with all other vacuums)!Another thing: this vacuum is way overpriced at amazon.com!!!!! I bought this vacuum for $76 at SEARS about a year ago and it is still in great condition and I use it a lot considering that I have to constantly clean up after my kids. Check out the prices at other stores before considering to buy it here. This vacuum may run for probably about $100 now at SEARS..."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this little thing.","review":"I have had this vacuum fore over 2 years, i have mostly wood floors in my home, so i dont use the carpet attachment much at all. its still working strong, the only thing is that my wood floor attachments wheels came off and wont stay back on, i may just super glue them on, lol, because i cant find the attachment anywhere. also on the same wood floor attachment the little hook that is there to clip the wand onto the vacuum broke off as well, but once i find a new attachment to replace it with, it will be good as new. its great for the price i paid,and still works really well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vacuum for low carpet and bare floors","review":"I have own one of this for a couple of months now and I am very happy with its overall performance.It is perfect for bare floors and low carpeted areas. The tool airflow and suction power is the strongest I have ever seen with an empty bag in for this size and model of vacuum cleaner. The noise is not an issue at all. Handling is quite comfortable and the 360-degree swivel base allows you to move more freely. The fingertip power control and the on/off switch works smoothly and precisely. I would definitely recommend this item to anyone interested into buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problematic","review":"I've owned this vacuum cleaner for a few years now.

She did give some guidelines which are nice, but I found it very hard to drum up much sympathy for the author, who seemed very full of herself and self-focussed.

She had a few bumps and now she's back on track and that's why she wrote the book.

Since Dummies books are for beginners, a logical order running from easy to difficult should be used. This author is all over the place.The above is bad enough, then add to this the obvious fact that the book was merely spell-checked but never looked at by an editor (or at least by one who knows grammar and syntax).The code isn't consistent, and the index has errors.Don't buy this book. It was obviously pushed out the publisher's door without any attempt to make sure customers get their money's worth. Don't you get ripped off too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"I find that as a book for people new to the topic, this is very confusing.

After finding another introductory & intermediate CSS book, & then comparing the two, I can honestly say CSS For Dummies is not organized well, has examples which do not contain vital information or a variety of applications. Based on other books I've owned & read, this book is a poor choice when learning CSS.Worst of all, there was at least one sample file on the included CD where illegal [chemical] use was cited in the text (see Ch8_fixed.html on the CD - the author writes about \\"being pissed\\", and taking [a chemical]). Examples as this clearly make the book an undesirable selection - especially for youth trying to learn CSS. There are simply no reasons for either using offensive language or blatant references to illegal [chemical] use in a book like this.I'll never buy another \\"Dummies\\" book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crooked doors!","review":"While the color of the cabinet is right for ur decor, that is the only good thing we can say.

I understand that there have been different versions of THE GUIDE, but come on...Just from the trailer I was extremely unhappy with the following changes from the best book I've ever read1.

Bring a towel"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This has to be one of the worst movies I've seen in awhile. I have watched really crappy movies before, like Frakenhooker, but this one left every other bad movie in the dust and tops them all for being the most atrocious. Nothing in the movie was funny, the only people in a filled theatre who laughed at anything were 4 stoned teenagers (it's possible to tell because they laughed at many acts that were not even meant to be funny also...and the smell) on opening day. The acting is just terrible; none of the actors/actresses made anything seem even remotely convincing. I was interested in reading the book before the movie, but after seeing it, I decided to throw away the book. My friend like the book and hated the movie as well. If you don't want to ruin your taste in movies, don't buy or rent this movie unless you are stoned out of your mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marvin says it best...","review":"\\"I have seen it.

IT WILL BE DOUBTFUL IF IT MAKES THE BARGIN BIN."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hitchhikers guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is a disappointing, boring, incoherent mess. About five minutes into the movie, it is impossible to keep track of what is going on or why. In the last 10 minutes of the movie, it becomes understandable again but by that time who cares? The characters are uninvolving and the special effects pointless. With a plot that starts out with the destruction of the earth, and the sole two survivors traveling the galaxy with peculier aliens, this movie should be riveting. Unfortunately, there is no attempt to make the characters more than one dimentional, and the dialogue could have been written on a cocktail napkin. There's not much of it, and what there is contributes nothing to either plot or characters. Don't waste your time unless you want background noise while you're cleaning the house or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm still in shock","review":"i was once scammed out of 30$ on eBay, Francly i think those $$ where better spent than the $$ i spent on this Movie.they took a good story and took moost of the good dialog out of it . a Kid might find some of it funny but to some1 that has read the book and listened to the original BBC radio show ,it was a nighmare.i had to stop watching half way trough it , if i hadn't i would have started to cry"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Little Film that Couldn't....","review":"As a loyal fan of Douglas Adams, I am sorry to say that this movie just doesn't cut it. Sadly!. Its the type of movie that just didn't come together; editing, timing and a couple of key cast members seriously hamper the pithy, clever and bantering style of the books and even the early 80's television series.Its a shame, because the costumes, special effects and script are all good. But something went seriously wrong. It was just plain boring, and timed wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very funny","review":"This movie has its moments, but they are few, short and far apart. It's mostly just not funny. It suffers from bad, unconvincing acting (or bad casting) - the actors somehow seem incapable of delivering lines. It's amazing how they got Marvin to *not* be entertaining. Slartibartfast's attempts at threatening Arthur don't feel like he's really trying, just going through the motions. When the plot does stumble upon some funny innovation (like the POV gun), it's overused and becomes annoying. The Trillian-Arthur relationship is irritating, particularly because it leads to cheesy moments involving cheap moralizing and quasi-deep thoughts about insecurity and love being important.The good parts are the dolphin song in the intro, the general look of the film (I particularly liked Marvin's design and the not very spectacular demolition of the earth) and the guide entries. That's nowhere near enough to make a movie though, hence the two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Disney-fied It","review":"The film version of \\"Hitchhiker's Guide\\" really doesn't work.The actor who plays Arthur Dent did not seem to have any comic timing, which is odd because I've been told the same actor is hilarious in the original version of \\"The Office.\\" Maybe the director asked him not to be funny in this film.The inserted a Carpe Diem (sieze the day) message into the film - whereas the book had more of a Crappy Diem message (another crappy day).The add a new storyline on the Vogon home planet which is supposed to make fun of bureaucracy - but if the filmmakers think having to fill out TWO different forms is a hardship, then I question their sanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snore...","review":"I didn't think a movie about outerspace and aliens could be this boring. I haven't read the book, but I sure hope it's more entertaining and lively. Thefilm was excruciating to sit through, and so disappointing.

I recommend skipping - you're not missing out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic!!","review":"This is a movie that I loved the first time I saw it on Tv.

A few days ago, I was talking to my wife about this movie, so we decided to watch it.I could not believe I didn't remember how slow it was, and how mediocre the story was. This is not me being a snob critic, this is my wife and me, deciding wether to just stop watching it. And Zooey Deschanel is in it?! How did I forget that! Had I remembered she was in there, I would have never had the face to even suggest my wife we should watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'VE SEEN IT... ITS RUBBISH...","review":"Mostly awful...sorry guys.But I've been following the guide for over 20 years now.Having read the series and have the BBC version...and this is the worst incarnaton yet.The BBC version,though it looks like it was done in a garage,blows this little bit of Vogon poetry away.Sci-fi and humor require more than special effects and hype to work.I know that watching this sputum is easier than having to read...but come on!The magic of the guide is that all the bizarre loose ends come together, in the end...sort of.The bizarre loose ends here, go off and are never seen...or referred to, again.Only a dyed in the wool Golgafrinchamian would find this load of dingos kidneys amusing.Could have been so much better...sad really.But still...rent it anyway,just to see how much something can suck."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absolute Pleasure to Watch","review":"I have not read the book, probably to my discredit, but I know I am not the only person who has seen the movie without reading the book first. I found this film thoroughly enjoyable from beginning to end. For one, you never know what is going to happen next, one minute the people turn into couches and the next they turn into yarn. The Zophad guy was hilarious! as was Mos Def. This is definitely the weirdest, strangest, most original movie I have ever seen. It is rated PG so it is fun for the entire family. My only real complaint is the earth guy, Arthur Dent, who complains and whines most of the time he is zooming around the galaxy. Alot of people complain about the movie not being as good as the book and so on. When was a movie based on a best-selling book ever as good as the book? Maybe sometimes. My advice: just sit back and enjoy the ride!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than Volgon Poetry","review":"I just bought this movie and only a few minutes ago finished watching it. I'm a fan of the novels but by far this is the worst movie I have ever seen. As a matter of fact it so eclipses the last bad movie I have seen that I can't even remember what that other movie was.It was tedious boring and unfunny. Most movies start a little slow and build to the climax, at the rate this movie was traveling it would take another 10 million years for it to reach it's climax.I did laugh once when everybody got hit in the face, but alas that moment passed and I wished I was being hit in the face, being bludgeoned unconscious.The mice were cute, now I'm so depressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not specifically the book","review":"Many fans of Douglas Adams' writing have been waiting a long time for a good feature-length film from the increasingly misnamed trilogy. The script is not someone's interpretation of the stories, but is part Adams' work and someone else. This bears noting since Adams understood that what works on radio would not necessarily work in a book, and likewise, not in a movie. In the end, the movie keeps the general storyline and keeps to the spirit of the work.Although the character of Ford Prefect is fine, the movie did not have as much screen time for him as one would think. Zaphod's, Trillian's, and Arthur's characters did get plenty of time as did Marvin the robot.The ending left the audience with the feeling that there will be a sequel, but without Adams, I would have to wonder if it will stray from the spirit of the books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"As I liked the book(s) for their wit, often hitting the ground laughing, I found the film quite boring. It laks the interesting dialogue the book supplies and tries to work only with the imagery. For me, that was not enough. The film is nice to see on a rainy day and perhaps for a fan of the books a wannahave. But in the end you'll feel disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and Refreshing","review":"Ive been a fan of the series since I was 13, Ive listened, read and watched the versions of the series and approuched the movie with trepedation. I was completly blown away, I thought it was a marvelous tribute to Adam's work and was glad to see that he was behind most of the writing before his death.The use of Jim Hensons company for the Vogons was an especially marvelous treat after being hammered with so many CG aliens these days. Ive missed the days of Muppets and actors in masks.It is definitly not a movie for the general public but then Hitchhikers never really was. I think there has to be an appreciation for the series and British humor for it to be really appreciated.Im so glad that they took their time and did such a spectacular job and after seeing it in the theatre 4 times I cant wait to get it on DVD"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'D RATHER BE EATEN BY THE RAVENOUS BUGBLATTER BEAST OF TRAAL.","review":"I had high hopes for this film, but it turned out to be the perfect film to not watch. If the novel is too long to put into one film, then why did they waste valuable screen time by adding a sappy love story instead of using that time to leave in more of the flawless original work? And Zaphod Beeblebrox is not supposed to be a mean-spirited hillbilly. I could go on pointing out the flaws in this adaptation, but why bother? If you're a fan of the Douglas Adams trilogy, buy the BBC TV series (try to ignore the outdated special effects) and you'll get the story as written by the author. And he's a guy who really knows where his towel is."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disgrace","review":"considering the sheer brilliance of the Hitchhiker's Guide books (most especially the first one) this film is worse than a disgrace. Mos Def as Ford? it may have worked but, oh my what a failure! what a disaster!! and Trillian is an American?!? what? that is criminal. They reduced Trillian to an American love inerest. And this movie is the exact opposite of funny.One of the two worst films i have ever had the misfortune to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Widescreen Edition)","review":"Don't waste you money.

The film is a bit long but as a newcomer to this story it's very hard for you to get bored of it because it has so much imagination. It's a movie that will definitely make you use your brain but it's something that isn't for everybody. I like that it was not the same old movie you always see and can't stand. Though it is good the first time I think a third or fourth time would be a little heavy on your brain. I thought it was pretty good and the visuals are very nice. It can get stupid at times but it's stays in a good blend of inteligence and comedy. I can't compare it to it's original novel so for the people that are just hearing about it it's worth at least one watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for sci fi","review":"i am absolutely not a sci fi fan and when this originally came out and had such great reviews i kept wondering to myself what everyone around me was smoking because how could a sci fi movie possibly be any good. then i accidently watched it one day and fell in love. yea, it really is a great sci fi movie. its goofy so if you're not into that sort of thing, avoid it but coming from a non sci fi lover, if all sci fi movies were like this i would definitely own more movies of the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Improbability Generator For Sale","review":"I was first exposed to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy through the famous computer text adventure game, so I had high expectactions for the movie.The Hitchhiker's Guide was written so far ahead of it's time, that technology just now exists to bring the characters in the book to life. I think the movie was so clever that it will be enjoyable even if you have never read the book or played the game.If you are a hardcore fan, then you will spend many hours singing the theme song with all of your friends! The DVD has an extra Sing Along feature that has all of the words, along with the beautiful opening scenes of the movie.So Long! (And thanks for all the fish!!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"This is one of the funniest movies ever. Yes, it is stupid. Yes, it is very silly, but it is hilarious.For all you people who don't like it (mostly religious types), I have one thing to say to you: Get a sense of humor. You can't live life without enjoying some stupid, yet undeniably funny comedy.Douglas Adams was a genius. He created this whole universe that is real, but yet completely unreal. There is not one line in the book where I did nolt laugh out loud and barely a minute in the film in which I did not laugh out loud.The visual effects aren't great, but they are passable. The performances are great especially by Warwick Davis and Alan Rickman (who both played the part of Marvin).It is a great film which will keep you laughing even after you have finished watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Random, Dumb Movie","review":"This movie was a total waste of time and money. The plot is scattered as the main characters jump from planet to planet after earth is destroyed. There's very little that holds this movie together other than weirdness as the characters encounter new places and odd but uninteresting circumstances."},{"rating":"1","title":"About the worst movie I ever saw","review":"The only reason I stayed with this movie thru most of it was because I was watching it with my granddaughter. Had never heard of the book it was based on, or the authors. But this may well be the worst movie I ever saw. Imbecilic characters, an impossible plot, and I cannot tell how it ended because, when the granddaughter fell asleep, I turned it off and went to bed. Had to give it one star because Amazon won't let you leave it blank."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sort of Disappointing","review":"The books were just brilliant. The film was, well... average. It just didn't do the books the justice they deserved. But, for what it was, it was an enjoyable enough film."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Loved This!","review":"This is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen. There were Doctor Who elements, The Fifth Element elements and Monty Python elements all wrapped up into one quirky but thoughtful and entertaining film. Despite the many random events that take place there is a peculiar order to things... it all makes sense... eventually! Great characters and dialog. And I loved the song So Long and Thanks for all the Fish (lol)! Definitely Brit-humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Randomness","review":"When I was a young teen, till my now current 28 year old teen, I have always enjoyed the humor that came from the random. Monty Python, Animaniacs, and this movie all have this often misunderstood and hard to perfect trait of randomness. Random for the sake of entertainment and humor really isn't all that random, but follows a somewhat deranged and curiously built train of thought. For those that either think that way or simply can see the humor in it, this movie is a pleaser. I'm sorry to say I haven't ready the books that this movie is trying to encapsulate, but I can say that my far and away response and review to the film is 42."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply horrible","review":"Grade D, I'm refraining from giving it an F because I laughed once or twice... The movie is utter rubbish, they took everything that was great, funny, and British and violated it. The whole middle of the movie is an absolute waste of time, did nothing for the story and made me rather bored. I was very upset with it, and very sorry we bought it. Since they didn't have it available to rent we bought it assuming we'd like it, yes that was our mistake.There are extras on the dvd, but it's not enough to save the movie. The dvd offers stuff like a marvin Hangman. I wanted to like it but I just couldn't be won over. Don't waste your time on it, instead watch the TV series from the 80's, now that version is hilarious."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have listened...","review":"I should have listened to the reviews that advised to run away from this movie. I really enjoyed the TV version of HHG and I was hoping the SFX in the movie would really bring the story to life. It was horrible. There are some SFX which are interesting but the storyline is completely missing. How could the writers have left out so many key elements of the tale? I didn't even finish viewing the DVD... yes, I thought it was that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, Absolutely Gastly","review":"This movie is awful, absolutely gastly. Oh, I guess the Vogon poetry was OK, but it went down hill from there. And don't talk to me about acting because there wasn't any. And I found the lack of directing disturbing. Arthur and Ford were the worse, and then it went into a decline. Trillian reminded me of Liza Lupner. Eddy was the best actor and then Slarty.

Suffers from what David Lynch's \\"Dune\\" suffered from. How could you just make one movie on these books? Take the cue from \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and do it as a trilogy. Do it right. The fans deserve it, not a run through of the story at warp speed. Take your time, develop the characters, and for goodness sake, get a good cast. This was just plain awful.

The bizarre, incoherrent non-hits that were used to fill a dead time slot? This is what this movie reminds me of! It is nonsensical and only loosely held together with an insubstantial plot, and yet, I watched it, and nearly liked it. I say nearly because I can't really tell you any one part that really grabbed my attention, nor remember any characters names. The movie, as a whole, sparked my interest to read the book with hopes that it is a little better. As far as the movie goes, I rented it free from the library so I don't feel juped for wasting money on this. I wouldn't recomend buying this, I can hardly see watching this over and over again.

I remember that there were 10 or so other people in the theater when it started and when I left I think there were only 2 or 3 other people left.This movie isnt even so bad that its good...actually it might have been so bad that it could have been good but ended up back at bad again.Don't buy it, don't rent it, dont even get a dozen people together and rent it on pay per view (even splitting the cost)....maybe, just maybe watch it when it comes on regular tv in....2 to 3 months(Huge Adams fan though)"},{"rating":"1","title":"God awful, NOT for fans of Douglas Adams!","review":"This movie died at every possible opportunity. It starts off with dropping the biggest joke in Adams' career with Ford Prefect tricking the demolition crew into not tearing down Arthur's house. The original demonstrates political bureaucracy and irony, as well as human gullibility, whereas this movie, Ford just bribes the crew with a few beers then leaves with Arthur. The movie is NOTHING like the book, the TV series (Made into a movie, rather cheaply made but WELL done). Everything in this movie past the first three minutes is NOTHING like the original. I can see why they waited for Adams to die before releasing it in the theaters.This movie will make any more-than-casual fan of Adams vomit in disgust. Not even worth a free rental!

It was all I could do to sit through it. The 1980's BBC TV series was WAAY better even though it did not have the special effects the movie did.

The casting was pretty bad; I always imagined Ford Prefect to be a more confident and cool type of character, which was not at all portrayed. The cast had very little to no chemistry, and none of the moments meant to be funny were funny at all. I did like Alan Rickman as the voice of Marvin, and John Malkovich did a wonderful job as well. It was interesting to see the novels come to life, and some parts did reflect the imagery very well, but to someone who did not read the series, this film would be very confusing and just plain unfunny.

It just goes to show that we all have our own taste.Why did the movie fail where the book succeeded? Why did I enjoy the humor in the book while finding it tiresome in the movie?Also, I don't remember having a negative reaction to Zaphod while reading the book, but in the movie he was an absolute load, a bad joke, an annoyance.The most enjoyable characters in the movie were the villains, the Vogons. They remind me of the races of muppets in Dark Crystal and of one of the races in The Fifth Element.Zaphod's \\"I'm an absolute moron, and annoying besides\\" character wears very thin very fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just had too!","review":"Bought this one and the DVD version.

Perhaps you all should watch the previous 1982 tv series or atleast listen to the radio adaptation or better yet, read the books.The whole Hollywood assimilated production's just another feeble attempt at adapting another great book title into motion picture. Rather sad they butchered it. If not for Alan Rickman and Stephen Fry's voices(the greatest thing in the show), I would have given it a 1 star.Well just expressing my displeasure at how a good title ended up being vulgerly slapped. But if u all really wanted to experience a better Douglas Adams works in visual and/or audio form, I do recommend you all get the past productions. I especially like the British Radio adaptations.

But after watching this, my thought is it was like redoing several classic Monty Python TV skits with different, unfunny actors and a higher budget. In other words - not good. Basically, I think it should just have been left alone - you can't really improve on the TV series. Special effects don't matter - in fact - they make it worse, because special effects aren't funny. Low production values actually add to the humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been better","review":"I fell in love with the Hitchhiker's Guide through the radio series, and maybe that's part of my problem with this movie. The voices weren't quite right. I love Alan Rickman and thought he'd be perfect for Marvin, but somehow, it just didn't work. Whiny rather than depressed. And the voice of the Guide didn't quite capture the deadpan goofiness required. The acting is fine, especially Martin Freeman as Arthur Dent, though Sam Rockwell's over-the-top performance did get a bit annoying after a while. But the thing that bothered me the most was that the movie just isn't funny. I'm sorry to say that despite Douglas Adams' involvement in the original script, it just falls flat at almost every turn. I didn't expect the movie to match the radio series - there's really no way a movie could - but even so I was greatly disappointed.

Despite all the excellent CGI material the movie can never capture completely the asides that you read in the book... not in two hours, anyway.The writers took considerable liberties with the original plot and the characters in a way that is undoubtably disappointing to many who are die-hard fans of Adams' books. Myself, I read all four books of the Trilogy but have never gotten around to other books.

One thing I strongly objected to: the movie makers decided to make a sappy love story with Arthur and Trillian.

Overall, this was a waste of two hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"frantic and univolving","review":"Granted, this movie had some funny moments and some decent effects, but, who cares? There's some moron who looks like the lead-singer of Nickleback in charge of the galaxy (yet he seems to have no power and is running away with his earthling girlfriend for reasons that aren't clear) who unknowingly authorizes the destruction of earth. One social throw-back who saved an unwitting alien from being hit by a car is saved and together they mostly wonder aimlessly from one set-up gag to the next with an ending so obvious, so fruitless, so poorly executed you're left with nothing but one hilarious song that plays over the credits.Yes the one bright point in this movie is the doulphin song!

You just won't believe how mind-bogglingly bad it is.Take the original book. Put it through the blender. Take a few flakes and add in some unnecessary Disney-esque characters and a love triangle. Tie together things into a neat, stupid, cliche plot that doesn't relate to the original.How did this movie get made? Argggggh! All of the gravitas, the drama, the humour, the fun was drained out. The timing is horrible. The dialogue is butchered. This \\"production\\" doesn't live up to the word \\"movie\\": a movie needs characters, plot, setting, DRAMA, ENTERTAINMENT!

However, if you do not like the type of humor found in the books, you most likely will not enjoy the movie.I saw this movie with someone who likes Sci-Fi movies, but doesn't care for this particular genre of books. The only thing he liked about the movie was the opening theme-song \\"So Long and Thanks for All the Fish.\\"I am a HUGE HHG fan--played game, read ALL the books--however, I will not watch this movie again.This is one of those movies you have to see ONCE if you are already a fan, but probably will not want to see ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed.","review":"I hate to agree with the reviewer \\"John Q. Public\\", but I am forced to here. I wanted very much to like this movie. I remember the books fondly from my teen years, and I have always been a fan of British humor such as Python and Blackadder. That being said, this movie just did not work. I was left feeling flat about the acting, the plot decisions, the special effects, and it just wasn't that funny.The character of Ford seemed incredibly wasted here, and Zaphod was over-the-top in a way that distracted from the story. Trillian was pushed to the foreground in a way that felt forced. Arthur was the character I tried hardest to connect with, and yet just couldn't. He seemed to take all of this a little too in stride, and that pulled me out of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A travesty","review":"It saddens me that this will be Douglas Adams final legacy.He deserved so much more.

There's not a chuckle in the wholemovie.Everything they could do wrong, they did. Casting was a disaster,especially Mos Def as Ford Prefect. He turned one of the funniestcharacters in the book into a boring straightman. The story wasmuddled with a totally new plot that resembled the book verylittle.I spent $4.25 to rent this movie from the video store, and I feltlike demanding my money back. Complete, utter garbage.

I could have really loved this movie if it was any good at all, but really, it just wasn't. It really felt like either the writer, the director, or the producers had carefully studied the original material in order to find everything that was good and funny about it, so they could remove it from the script in order to make more room for special effects.If you are considering going to see this movie, the best advice I feel I can give you is, don't. Take the money you were planning to spend on tickets and buy a DVD of the 1982 television version instead.

He DID actually work on this film in preproduction, even if his involvement was tragically cut short.In the end, this movie does not tell the stories of Arthur, Ford, Trillian, The Heart of Gold, Marvin, 42, or even the whale.

The rest, is just details."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie ever","review":"The shipment was on time and was as suggested. The movie on the other hand was the worst in history.

Other than that, this movie was terrible. I don't like science fiction, but I've enjoyed every single movie that Mos has been in, so I tried to be open-minded with this film. However, this wasn't even thought-provoking. Aliens destroyed Planet Earth taking two people with it to deal with some repulsive aliens who liked to recite bad poetry. Then they ended up hitchhiking to another planet, and when that planet escaped being destroyed by enemies, the alternate planet turned into a bowl of petunias. A whale fell from the air, speculated on what to call its tail and what to call the whooshing sound around him (air), and one alien walked around in a fur coat. Have I said enough? This was painful. I'm going to erase this movie from Mos' resume and hope that he now regrets being a part of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"zero stars, much like vogon poetry","review":"Having read the books and watched the BBC television series, I was unable to sit there, mouth agape, for more than ten minutes. The wooden delivery of previously witty lines was killing me.

Save your time and burn the disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy - 2005 version","review":"The 1981 version is great, this later release is dreadful. Many subtle funny things are left out of the later script, as if the writer thought he could do better, or maybe he never even got them. I see that the earlier DVD is more costly, not a surprise. On the new one's package, you have to have a microscope to find anything distinguishing it from the old version, as if they meant to suck in the unwary. I had to apologize to my friends for sitting them down to share the newer movie. I'll have to dig up my VHS copy of the old one and show them the good stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Movie","review":"I don't give movies a bad review. If I don't like a movie, I don't write a review on it. But, this one was different. I loved the books and could not stop wanting to see this movie, but it was a big letdown. I've come to expect movies to not be as good as its book counterpart, but this one was just horrible. From the acting to the destroyed story line, almost everything was bad. A veiwer would be very confused if he or she had not first read the books. If you want to hear this story read the books, or if you don't have time to read, get the CD version. That said, there were a few parts that were funny both in the movie and the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 words, Not Funny","review":"Its not a funny movie, painful to watch.

Sorry I wasted my money but you never know until you try."},{"rating":"2","title":"neither here nor there...","review":"The issue is how to 'adapt' Hitchhiker - a book that sprung from a multi hour TV series into a movie length version. Hard to do. The movie in the end tries to have it both ways - you really need to have read the book to understand the movie fully or in some cases at all but if you've read the book you realize just how much (and there was a lot) was cut.But I'm not sure that the producers could have done much different. So the '4' rating? The book was great - the movie was just good. I had to explain certain things to others who hadn't read the book but they did laugh at somethings almost reflectively.The best comparison I can come up with is reading the Readers Digest condensed version of a good novel - you get the main points but you miss the odd little things that make the story great."},{"rating":"1","title":"What???","review":"Went to see this movie in the theater, left early. Unless you are really into this type of humor (What type this is, I don't know. I don't want to know!) you are probably better off skipping this one. If you must see it, rent it before buying it.

Actors have zero chemistry. Screenplay fails to capitalize even marginally on Adam's work, making the existentialism even more sophomoric that it is. The costumes are horribly ridiculous. It rips off Star Wars every 10 minutes. The story has zero life or bounce or clarity. It can only be marginally interpreted by hard-core fans, everyone else is left in the dark.

Not the tepid American remake, but the original British series with its slapstick situations and witty dialogue. The plot is a comedy of errors, with the reader aware of all the entanglements, while the main character continues to have obstacles put in the way of her happiness. There are lots of humorous situations and the read is made more enjoyable with the wonderful anticipation of what's going to happen next and who will she end up with?."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful summer read - a 4 1/2 star book","review":"The catchy title and cover of this book is what caught my attention. Since I was looking for a Bridget Jones type book, I found this to be just right. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that the basic pretext of the story, which was that Cara's picture posted on the internet caused so many problems, was a little improbable in this day and age of Paris Hilton videos.

This book was a HUGE disappointment to me. Although the initial concept intrigued me, that's all this book had going for it - a clever initial idea. After that, it all fell apart for me. This book could have benefitted by some major editing by cutting out at least 100 pages, if not more. It dragged on and on endlessly, as the reader waits for the main character and her dream man to finally meet but they frustratingly keep missing each other over and over again. I skimmed to the end and felt cheated by the ending. I know the other reviewers seemed to love it but I definitely feel I wasted my money on this one and I would not recommend it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring. Boring.

The pages are semitransparent so that the ink from one side of the paper is visible from the obverse side. It looks like a palimpsest or a book soaked in the rain; reading it gives me a headache.Second, the book is too political. Its selections from modern literary analysis are subsumed by polemic focused on various flavors of identity politics and Marxism. A typical sentence: \\"In this attempt at an epistemological and political position, I would like to sketch a picture of possible unity, a picture indebted to socialist and feminist principles of design.\\" (p. 2,281). Even if it seems unobjectionable for one sentence, and even if one agrees with the politics, the long, political analyses, over hundreds of pages, are out-of-place in a book on literary theory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cranky Swishteeka","review":"This book, was remindful of the various ways, to speak of the subparts is to speak of the hole that you fall into, for this is the best manner in which to explicate texts that at once become larger than flung outward, becoming at once too difficult to obtain and too simple to master.

And \\"Lush Life\\" is one of her finest ballads ever recorded. \\"The Woman In Me\\" is a bit plodding and Summer plays her sex goddess role with reluctance. (But the song enjoyed a happy life on the soul charts) \\"Protection\\" is a great rock number with the boss Bruce Springsteen. It's only flaw is it sounds too rushed.

Well, I tried going without one for awhile and then dirt started to build up on the front element of my very expense lens. And although you can clean the front element of a lens, I feel much, much safer wiping my comparatively cheap UV filter time and time again rather than chancing any actual lens damage.

Claus Ogermann's compositions and arranging are top notch, and the music touches on some of Evans' past piano work with George Russell and Miles Davis. The 2nd movement's track 4 is truly one of my favorite Bill Evans performances. The space he creates while playing with such stark emotion is simply breathtaking.The cd as a whole sounds great, and all of the pieces are excellent. The 2nd movement is more what Evans was exploring at the time, very introspective, while the 1st movement reminds me of the George Russell albums that Evans played a prominent role on. Also, this trio of his is really shortchanged by a lot of people. Eddie Gomez and Marty Morrell are simply fantastic on this cd.

If there is not always much bobbed hair as promised, it is made up for by great heaping quantites of bathtub gin, among many other libations.

'Chantier d'Et' could make good a soundtrack to Jean Cocteau 'Beauty and the Beast.' That's the best way I can describe it. It's folky and dreamlike with a slight circus-like mood to it.

There r no big guitar riffs and it sounds like a acid trip. I am a fan but the No Respect and the Love is for Strangers albums R much more superior. Davey needs ta go back to his roots not to be like the cure. He also should stick to singing than playing the guitar.he needs also more input from the other bandmembers also.I think the lyrics need much more improvement also.I hope he starts to play something more like rock.This album is very mello for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solidly built bins, easy stacking, could be a bit harder plastic","review":"I have a small computer store and needed some sort of stacking bin system in order to tame the mess of parts and cords I had laying around. These bins are big enough to put most of the parts in and they stack nicely. They also have a nice flat front spot for attaching labels.

It's 15 years later and still great. I can't think of any band since who have released such gorgeous tunes with such compelling lyrics. I loved watching them live. Anyone who has will know why I say that. ;) Babies is the song of a lifetime. And so many of these tunes are just plain sexy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seminal Pop/rock. A Pulp masterpiece","review":"One brilliant album from the blokes that brought you Different Class. Like their 1995 masterpiece, His 'n Hers draws its influence from culture clashes/social awareness and packed with those gorgeous J.Cocker melodies. The His 'n Hers theme and sound eventually evolved to the not so different 'Different Class'. I've listened to this album front to back and everything is MUSIC. Every song, I've found that there is something clever about it, some lyrical theme or crazy guitar work that catches my ear. My personal favorites areJoyriders,Acrylic Afternoons,She's A Lady,andPink Glove. And the keyboard melody near the end of track #11 is a bona vide lullaby. Regarding this LP - I think of Pulp as a very sophisticated and cultured music group, and J.Cocker as an enlightening lyrical figure. One of MY favorite albums; worth those petty bill$."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sassy, sexy and sarcastic lost classic!","review":"His n Hers is one of the albums of the 90's. I think it overshawdows the likes of other Pulp recordings such as: This is Hardcore and Different Class. His n Hers is basically a whole album epic and it ranges though many feelings and topics. Pulp frontman 'Jarvis Cocker' uses the most beatiful yet freaky style of vocal i have herd. Songs like \\"Do you remember the first\\" and \\"pink Glove\\" are songs we all can relate to and feel the emotions that Jarvis and the band are trying to portray though these poppy and sweet tunes. There are a few mood swings in the album from a nice eroticly charged \\"Babies\\" to the freaky and disjointed \\"She's a Lady\\". His n Hers only lacks in the song \\"Someone like the Moon\\" other than that a wonder."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CLASSIC IS BACK!","review":"This is a must-have album for any true hip-hop fan. Mantronik's production was truly ahead of its time. As with the sound of hip-hop in the mid to late eighties, the songs contain plently of 808 and 909 drum kicks and snares. This was probably one of the most underappreciated albums in the culture. I'm glad to see it's back.

This book, and her book, \\"Successful Lyric Writing,\\" are easily the premier books in the field. She's the first one to offer a textbook approach to lyric writing, to really put into words what goes on, subconsciously, when one writes a lyric, the how to's, the do's, and the don'ts.

Also the references made to other authors, books and songwriters has turned me on to a whole new world of literature.

The recipes are simple and written in a manner that is so easy to understand with just the right amount of important tips that ensure you are preparing the food correctly. I so appreciate these little details! One of my favorite things about this book is that the ingredient lists are manageable and simple. I have yet had to shop around to find an ingredient. There are so many recipes that contain ingredients that are all staples in my pantry so making a meal in a pinch is easy to do. This book is also the source of my signature dish that impresses everyone I serve it to, Madame Cartet's Potato Gratin made with just a few ingredients. Just today I made an impressive but simple chocolate cake that was a breeze from this book. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great introduction to French cooking!","review":"My husband purchased this cookbook for me as a gift after returning from France.

Nona Ponferrada conveys powerfully how similar the experiences can be in as far flung places as Romania, India, Israel and China!The writing style of the author is most appealing. Each of the short essays conveys a real sense of people and the way they relate. The kindness that the author experiences in strange places awakens one's urge to wander and explore.The book has a very easy and friendly style.

Once you buy a book on writing it is reasonable to assume that you are determined to write and that the mental obstacles are not your major concern. Further, a lot of the advice given on overcoming obstacles boils down to; at best common sense - at worst being downright ridiculous.In the second part of the book the author tries to cover everything from short stories over poetry to script writing and offers very little advice that readers with an average IQ wouldn't already have figured out themselves.Last part of the book deals with how to sell your work, finding an editor etc. and a substantial part of this is devoted to address lists that are most likely already outdated at the time of printing..Unless you regard yourself as a complete idiot - which I assume that very few aspiring writers do - don't waste your money or time on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ceremony and Ceremony","review":"If you are interested in basic visual information about one of many Santeria practices, then \\"Vamos al Tambor\\" is a good purchase.

Jorge's soulful tone and elegant improvizations are at the heart of this album's sound. Pieces like Blues Latino, Morning in Marin, and Aranjuez, all have his stamp. Interesting that they are not written by the performers. The utterly forgettable rest of the album are more Carlos' style. Two of his pieces stick out like a sore, pulsating thumb - the opener and the bizzarre The Trip (to musical la-la land?). As for the little Carlitos... well, his dental-drill guitar is terribly restricted stylistically and inept musically, and his only composition is not going anyplace in particular (except maybe the rubbish basket). So we are left with Jorge to save the day. Is it not ironic that he is virtually unknown?

It certainly deserves to be up there with Santana's best. Track #2 is written by Carlos Hernandez and he plays on it without the elder Santana's, and it is very impressive and shows him to be an emerging major talent in his own right.

The characters are inconsistent with the other books (Lew Alton and Regis Hastur, for example, seem to have undergone a mutual personality transplant) and the usual Darkovan politicking is garbled. Plus the unspeakably naff way Margarita and Mikhail get sent back in time to be married by Varzil and Evanda.... Please, bring back the Marion Zimmer Bradley who wrote \\"Heritage of Hastur\\" and \\"Thendara House\\", and pray that the sequel isn't this bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpeice","review":"Even though this book starts out slow, the rest of the read is well worth it. This cunning story is a hard to put down book that has adventure as well as true love. This is one of Marion Zimmer Bradly's best works."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is one of the best books that I've read recently.","review":"I love this book. It was a real joy to read. This book really devopled some of the minor charcters in Exile's Song. I loved all of it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MZB Darkover series has been renovated.","review":"At last! The Darkover series has beem brought back to life by MZB with this and her last book. It was getting a little bit tiring to read antholigies and revisited history in her books. New characters with new plots being aimed at. She points toward new books in this story. I found it refreshing to have some new characters being active in the series. The characters are not completlely fleshed out yet, but that is why you have a series. You learn about the people in the story as they grow in the series. I look forward to the next book in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing entry in Darkover series","review":"Having been a Bradley and Darkover fan for years, I was greatly disappointed in this latest offering. It lacked the character depth and richness of all of the others; very superficial."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album. Bueno, bueno bueno; grande la Andrea Echeverri","review":"It's a really great album. I love her style and most of the album's songs are really great. Can you say that about many albums? I can hardly wait for her up-coming album!Es un gran disco. La Andrea Echeverri demuestra su gran calidad como interprete. Espero con ansias su siguiente album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Andrea Eceverri","review":"The CD is okay, not fantastic. I missed the punk/folk music that Andrea did with Aterciopelados. She writes/sings a lot about experience with motherhood, which got a little boring. I am a mom myself and did not get that thrilled about pregnancy/nursing, etc. which is what she sings about throughout the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"I, Sell Out\\"","review":"Do you what the three biggest mistakes in the history of rock & roll were?1) John Lennon leaving the Beatles to make albums with the inferior Yoko Ono.2) Paul McCartney leaving the Beatles to make albums with the inferior Wings.3) Alan Parsons leaving behind his fans to make an inferior album of lifeless dance tracks, barking dogs, and baby noises.This almost matches John & Yoko's Two Virgins as the most horrible and unlistenable album I have heard in 30 plus years as a rock fan. Major jeers to Alan Parsons for selling out after such a long string of excellent melodic music. Will he ever make good music again? This is so bad that I doubt it. Let's hope that the Moody Blues & Jethro Tull aren't next. After this disasterous letdown anything seems possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's cool.","review":"It's certainly different than most his other stuff, but you can hear his influence. Mark of a great music man, e-yep. Electronica fans will probably enjoy it more than nostalgic Alan Parsons Project buffs, simply because it is very different.It's cool, check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed the mark....","review":"I have been a fan of Alan Parson since day one. I have every album and have never been dissapointed with any of them. I have always thought that you could buy a Parson's CD site unseen and enjoy it. Until now I was right.... this CD offers no Parson fan anything to sink their teeth into. Add to that a couple of retreads and you have a poor excuse for a Parson album. Best try before you buy this CD. Someone said if you like Stereotomy, Gaudi, Try Anything Once Time Machine then you might not like this. I add if you liked anything since I Robot you might not like this. Sorry Alan...you missed the target...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parson's Exemplified","review":"You can certainly hear and feel, Alan Parson's omnipresence on all of these tracks. Also, love the significance of the first track \\"Return to Tunguska,\\" which has David Gilmour's signature guitar solo enclosed. As most already know, Alan Parson produced Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of The Moon (1973)\\" album, which had launched them into mainstream rock. Tunguska was the spot in Siberia where something struck in 1908, devestating over 2,200 square kilometers of land, which was the equivilant to the force of 1,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs! The inferences to such a cataclysmic event is nothing short of the genius of Parson and Gilmour included. The entire CD is outstanding on multiple levels, giving all listeners something to appreciate and too certainly remember!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Alan Parsons I used to enjoy","review":"I bought the very first Alan Parsons Project albums in the 1970's and enjoyed them immediately. After that, the quality kind of went up & down but they were still pretty good...up until now.This CD sounds like those cheap techno dance remixes that were the big thing in the 80's. If this is a progressive step, it's backwards to something that has already been done ad nauseum. If this is Alan Parsons attempt to capitalize on the Britney Spears generation of computerized pablum, then he's succeeded.As for us older fans who have been with him since day one, this is barely recognizable of what we would expect from Alan Parsons. Try to listen to it before buying to avoid disappointment. It appears to be one of those CD's where you'll either love it or hate it depending on your tastes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Visionary!","review":"I've been a Alan Parsons fan since stationed in England in the late Seventies. As always, Alan Parsons shows he's a true visionary when it comes to pushing the envelope with his differences in the music he puts out. \\"A Valid Path\\" shows he's still got it. It's an album unlike any other he's produced and it's a joy to listen to. Lot's of electronica that keeps you busy thinking where he's going next. I recommend this to any true hard core Alan Parsons fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Release!","review":"There is really not much to write about this. I cannot believe that AP project could get into these waters and sink so low. A horrible CD, better forgotten as soon as possible. I still don't understand the rational behind this release. Why do people like AP need to reinvent themselves...A totally catastrophic release that will leave a dark shadow on an impecable career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the trip.","review":"\\"Return to Tunguska\\" is worth the price of admission all by itself if you're a fan of AP instrumentals. While the overall compilation admittedly isn't quite as good as the cohesive \\"Time Machine\\", it's quite a bit better than the tedious \\"On Air\\" or the scattered \\"Try Anything Once.\\" I personally like having a couple of redone classics, although I'd have preferred to have them as \\"bonus\\" tracks rather than taking 2 of a precious 9."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing introduction","review":"This was my first introduction to the work of Alan Parsons. I am not really a prog enthusiast, but rather someone who quite likes classic Yes and who has been into electronic music for about 10-12 years. I founf this album fairly disappointing. Most of the album is derivative and lacklustre. I'm sure for APP fans who haven't listened to much electronic music this probably seems fresh and vibrant, but from someone approaching it from the other side, it is anything but. For someone who is interested in seeing how another progressive musician made the crossover to doing electronic music, I'd encourage you all to check out what Robert Fripp (formerly of King Crimson and others) has been doing with some of his side projects with Brian Eno and also the FFWD project with Alex Paterson of The Orb. Also recommended: System 7, with Steve Hillage's wonderful guitar work."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"Absolute techno crap. This is just electronic dribble with no emotion or feeling; obviously released ONLY for commercial purposes. There is no concept here, the bass is overblown. This is a great album for a noise war with your neighbors or if you want to get thrown out of your apartment. Otherwise, it's a worthless piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I expected better from Parsons after 5 years. A few are pretty good, but overall, not as good as any of his others. The best one is his own remake of \\"The Raven\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh dear oh dear","review":"just as genesis should have quit while ahead and avoided the very average calling all stations, alan parsons should have stuck to what he's good at, instead of producing this batch of mind numbing repetetive dirge.Yes there is a market for this kind of stuff but he should leave it to those who are better at it.His albums over the years have been classics but if you were expecting the same you will be very dissapointed.There is nothing more embarrasing when someone who patently isnt, trys to be hip.What a sad episode in an otherwise brilliant career"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget The Project","review":"I have always been a big fan of Alan Parsons' music and when it was brought to my attention that a new record was coming out I was thrilled! Well, I purchased \\"A Vaild Path\\" and needless to say I am quite dissappointed. Alans' previous effort \\"THe Time Machine\\" is such an enjoyable record that the release of his new project would lead fans to believe that \\"A Valid Path\\" would pickup where \\"The Time Macine\\" left off. WRONG. Gone are mainstays Ian Bairnson and Stuart Elloitt. They are sorely missed throughout the record. All I would like to include is if you've been a fan of the work of Alan Parsons' throughout the \\"Project\\" days and his solo work, this CD is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"The instrumentals are terrible. The remake of Mammagamma sounds like the macarena gone very wrong (listen to it closely! You'll agree!)Chomolungma is just repetitive crap.The songs with lyrics are awful too.I can truly say that Alan Parsons is nothing without good musicians and good musicianship around him. This complete piece of trash is all drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Being a long time AAP fan this was a very welcome release. From the get go this CD grabbed me with \\"Return to Tunguska\\". The tie ins back to previous CD's with \\"Mammagamma\\" and the \\"Return to a Dream Within A Dream\\" are good for nostalgia's sake. \\"Chomolungma\\" is a great way to end the CD.To AAP - Thanks for this release. I hope to see more from you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impeccably composed,executed & engineered. 10 stars!","review":"Alan is truly a progressive artist. Many who claim to be progressive are really just stuck in the past somewhere, trying to find new ways to play nostalgic music. Alan on the other hand, redefined himself in 1993 and now, a decade later, has proven again that *he* is most faithful to the true meaning of the word 'progressive'. Call it techno if you want, but \\"A Valid Path\\" is best described as the greatest Alan Parson's album of all time. Check out David Gilmour's guitar on 'Return' and the Nuendo computer programming by Alan's son Jeremy. Flawless."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought....I played.....","review":"...it sucked....and I returned it!That's about all I can say about the album. There is nothing redeemable about this album. What an inferior album from an artist of superior talent!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the wait","review":"Best description of my reaction, WOW! After the departure of Eric Woolfson from The Project, and the long wait for a new release, and word that Alan was going in a new direction with his new release, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. Well, Alan never disappoints! While his new CD is nothing like the Project albums I've loved in the past, it still has the Parsons signature on it, and is very addictive. I've not been able to take it out of my CD player since the first playing, and have listened to it perhaps 20 times since. Every listening is just as enjoyable as the first. Fans will rank this as one of his best.UPDATE: THREE MONTHS after purchasing this CD, I STILL listen to it. I've ripped it to my PC hard drive so I can easily listen while I'm working at home, it's on my zip drive so I can take it to work, it's on my iPod so I can listen to it while I workout at the gym, and I made an extra copy for the car... Obssessed? Yeah, maybe... But I can't get it out of my head!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Valid New Direction","review":"Its Parsons, the King of Electronics. An album like this was inevitable. From The Avenue, it seemed obvious that this album would be unlike any of his others and it is. Don't expect anything that you've heard before by him. The vocals are near non-existent and the sound is alot more in your face. After only a few listens, the album sounds very well produced, as usual. The bass is absolutely incredible.This album would be interesting to hear on 5.1 when it comes out. Make no mistake, this is more electronica than classic Parsons. It certainly is worth listening to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alan's new path - it is the right path","review":"I'm an APP Fan since exactly 20 years. After the project was over i missed eric woolfson on the solo-albums of AP. They were ok, but not as good as the project's cd's. Now, Alan changed his music into electronic, but you hear it out it is still Alan's music! I love the whole CD, it's A MASTERPIECE! The quality of the sound is a clearly \\"10\\". The songs are perfect! I really like the new \\"Mammagamma 04\\", it is even better then the original, and that's rare! I love the voice of Alan Parsons on \\"We play the game\\". He is a fantastic singer, why he didn't sing before?!??!? I can't understand when a longtime APP-Fan don't like this album, it is still Parsons-music, but more trendy. i don't know if he reach younger people, that will be difficult, because they don't know his music. But for me: it is one of my favourite album since 10 years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it - you will like this one up loud...for a change.","review":"Alan Parsons has had a reputation for a certain sound that has pervaded Alan Parsons Project albums/CDs from the 70s-80s and even after breaking away from Eric Woolfson after their final \\"Gaudi\\" CD. This CD is different and I like it immensely. It seem to have spirit and excitement that has been waning of late, and it causes me to look forward to the next CD from Mr. Parsons and his new collaborators.Does this CD change the formula? Well, yes. Does it lose its identity. Well, no I don't believe so. I like to hear the music updated to reflect more current styles and this CD certainly does that. If you don't like The Crystal Method and related styles, then you probably won't like this one. But if you like electronic dance music with \\"something extra\\" that's a bit orchestral or literately themed in flavor, then I'd recommend this one strongly."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST PROJECT","review":"I'm a APP fan, I love The Turn of.., Eye in the Sky, On Air, Vulture, Gaudi, etc, but this work is horrendous. After the departure of Woolfson and Bairnson, Alan stayed alone and produced the worst project of all times. There's none that catched me. It seems a techno project, with two old songs.Sorry, but it must be the end of the project. Go to Porcupine Tree and Marillion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not believe my ears","review":"I simply could not believe my ears that this was an Alan Parson recording. After all the years of producing albums with wonderful melodies, I was left stuned by my disapointment at this effort. The new instumentals are almost devoid of melody or buried under techo noise. The reworked old stuff vastly inferior to the original. The vocals..well to tell the truth, I don't remember much about them as nothing could save this \\"work\\". If you're as big a fan as I am, you will ignore this and buy it anyway, but this is not anything like he has done before and I pray like anything he will do again."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happens when you take X-tascy and go to a Euro disco...","review":"Ugh! I have been an AP fan since 1976's \\"I Robot\\" and I have suffered through highs (\\"Eye in the Sky\\") and lows (\\"Ammonia Avenue\\"), but nothing can prepare you for this shock... and I was so looking forward to a new Alan Parsons CD...What a mess. If AP was trying to make Dance club music, he's failed. Others do it better.Painful to listen to... arrangements are all over the place. Nothing memorable or melodic here. After listening to \\"Vital Path\\", just to remember how good things used to be, I had to listen to \\"There Must Be More\\" from \\"Try Anything Once\\" to re-affirm my faith in Alan Parsons abilities. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's see...85% Invalid Path...","review":"I'm not sure of the percentage, but a good deal of this is just plain crap. You who buy it, even you Parsons fans, get your can openers out to open the can because that is what you are going to get--Canned Music. I give it two stars because there is one pretty decent song, but one pretty decent song does not make an album. If you are into electronica and not musicians playing real instruments, you will really enjoy this probably. If you respect a little electronica, like me, but prefer to hear a lot of real instruments that Bairnson and the others used to provide, go to the back catalog of Parsons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Onward with progress........","review":"In 1979, I first heard I Robot. That album (at its time was way ahead of itself). I guess you could say it was new electronic. All of APP and AP albums have helped me through hard times in my life. It seemed as though when I was growing Alan Parsons was growing. I have read all of the above rates and I have to say that I am disapointed. I guess I am too old now. If I was young and going to Rave's, then this music might come close to something I was looking for. I get the feeling that Alan's son had a lot to do with this CD. I will buy the next AP CD. However, I am 43 now and my party days are over. I guess Alan needs to key into the new younger crowd. I am saddened by this CD. Too electronic/techno for me...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for traditional Parsons fans","review":"I was surprised to see so much positive feedback for this. And, while I wish Alan the best and appreciate all of the past magic, this was definately a non-valid path for me.I should have listened to clips before buying. But, the cover was cool and cryptic as ever; and, heck it was Alan Parsons.I've loved every Alan Parsons piece. My favorites being \\"Tales of Imagination,\\" \\"Gaudi,\\" \\"Eve,\\" and the next most recent ones \\"On Air\\" and \\"Time Machine.\\" If you are expecting music on \\"Valid Path\\" to be in the vein of those....don't.It has great fidelity (as always), but the music/songs are lost at sea to me.With humble apologies to Alan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"As a long time APP fan, I was pleasantly surprised by this new offering. Like many others who left negative reviews, I was underwhelmed when I first listened to the album, but, as is usually the case with Parsons' music, the more you listen to it, the more it grows on you. The instrumentals are outstanding, as they always are, and the vocal tracks seem weak at first, but reveal their complexity with repeated listens. For those of you who dissed this CD, give it a few more tries...I promise you that it will pay off in the long run!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Alan Parsons CD is worth it.","review":"I have been a Alan Parsons fan since day one. I have never been disapointed with any of his albums. Obviously I like some better than others, but they are all great albums and A Valid Path is no exception. I was a little anxious about this album since I knew he didn't have his long time band mates and was venturing more into electronica music, but I am very happy with it. Is it his best album? No, but it is very good nonetheless. Especially the song You Can Run. We just got back last night from seeing him on his current tour. He had about a 30 piece orchestra with him and was well worth it. Just thought I would get my two cents worth in."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different Alan Parsons","review":"Being a big fan of prog, learning about a new Alan Parsons release caught my attention. While not a bad album (some artists simply cannot release a bad production), this album sounds more like Robert Miles than your classic Alan Parsons. It's got more ambient beats and a EuroPop feel than anything else, which is not wrong: it just makes comparisons to Pink Floyd, ELO or Jethro Tull more inappropriate than, say, comparing his current work to today's Tears for Fears."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Not-So-Valid Path","review":"As an Alan Parsons devotee all the way back to Tales of Mystery and Imagination, I had never had to apologize for buying one of his CDs. Finding a new Parsons CD in the store was an unexpected gift and an automatic buy until now. I know that some albums have been weaker than others, but there have always been at least 1 or 2 strong tracks that make the whole album worth listening to. Not so with this effort. The usual and expected skilled use of synthesizers and vocals to create textures within the songs has been obscured by so much techno-clutter that it is difficult to recognize the themes. This is especially true in the two tracks that were updated or recycled for this album (3, 7). The fact that this is the first time I've ever felt the need to write a review demonstrates the level of my disappointment. I hope your experience will be better than mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub \\"Par\\"sons","review":"First, let me say that this is NOT a \\"Project\\" album. Gone are Woolfson, Powell and all who made it a Project. Alan is on his own here. Very well engineered and produced but falls somewhat short in the delivery of the final product. I must say that this CD is disappointing. Not quite what I expected from AP. Only 9 tracks and two are redo's so actually only 7 tracks of new music. Not much for 3 years worth of waiting. The lyrical aspect is overly simplistic and not very catchy. Too many experiments on this to be able to follow what Parsons is trying to say. Instrumentals are hip and more in tune with what we have come to enjoy from Alan. Overall, he doesn't quite seem to know which path is valid but still wants us to follow him. I will follow him and hope that his next album find him on a clear path and off this rocky road that he seems to have found himself on."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISGRACEFUL SELL OUT!!! Why, Alan, Why?","review":"I love art rock. I love Alan Parsons. I Robot, Pyramid, Try Anything Once, Time Machine, they were all brilliant albums. But now PARSONS HAS SOLD OUT TO THE \\"CLUB MTV\\" GENERATION! Here you will find not one scrap of the depth and tunefullness of the previous albums, just simple-minded kiddie schlock played with the subtlety of a jack hammer! Every song (if these can be called songs) sounds like a clone of all the worst MTV-approved groups. Babies goo goo-ing? Computer gurgles? Distorted voices? Plastic sounding drum machines? IS THIS A JOKE, MR. PARSONS? This is an obvious SELL OUT and a kick in the teeth to all of the fans who have stayed faithful over the years. I'm afraid that I will never again but an Alan Parsons album without sampling it first. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great album, minus 1 point for recording spoof in Tijuaniac","review":"I love this album, I have always been an Alan Parsons fan, even the new versions of older songs are great.I regret however to hear a loud noise, and the sound engineer telling someone to \\"Be careful, I'm recording!... RECORDING!!!\\" (heard in spanish, minute 1:37).The album deserves 5 stars, minus 1 for the engineer's lack of professionalism."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Valid Path - hey, Try Anything Once!","review":"It's very hard for me to write a review about this album without resorting to comparisons, so here they are. \\"A Valid Path\\" is to Alan Parsons what \\"The Division Bell\\" was to Pink Floyd.You'll begin to wonder whether this is, in fact, Alan Parsons. Or, were Stuart Elliot, Ian Bairnson, Eric Woolfson and the whole gang what made Alan Parsons tick? Hey, why did Polly Samson write a Pink Floyd song (oh, I got my metaphors mixed, sorry). And that will be the easy part about listening to this album.If you want not to be so shocked about what you'll listen to, I'd strongly recommend to listen to L'Arc En Ciel first, then to Return to Tunguska, and finish it off with Tijuaniac, then listen to the rest of the album. Why? Because I feel that, if you are happily surpried at first, you'll be willing to accept whatever comes next.And believe me, it's nothing short of... well.You'll have to listen to it and make up your mind yourself.Me?

Just as APP was selling out and sounding like phil collins they have finally come out with an album like I robot and pyramid. These were not, in my opinion, not meant to be chart topper but neat concepts. That seem to be what Valid Path is. A neat concept. All those who are trying to relive their 80's proms. . . get over it! Move on.. . take the valid path and chill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wire collated, not plastic","review":"My second order for this item. Quantity is just right for home use. Other sellers have huge quantities that apply mostly to contractors. First order of this item listed as wire collated, now listed as plastic collated. Second order arrived and they are in fact wire collated, NOT plastic. Will fit Porter Cable 350 coil nailer, which I use. The nails do their intended job with no jamming. The only drawback is the coils tend to be flattened during shipping. With a little re-shaping, they work well.Gary Faries"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Surprise","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by this cd. I picked it up on a whim and to my delight it is fresh and vital. I've never heard of any of these groups but that doesn't hurt the music. Most of the songs were recorded using either traditional instruments or with the addition of electric guitars. This cd, despite the cheesey cover is not overproduced tourist music. Instead it is delivers a nice selection of East and Southern African sounds. The singing and guitar work is great. The rhythms are awesome. Track four is killer. There is no info on the liner notes, but you can't beat this for it's price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly better than Marvel's Captain America movie","review":"Well, after Ultimate Avengers 2 I kinda figured Iron Man would be pretty bad.

Every where you compare to the live action, live action is far better. Ending wasn't as good it didn't focus the main villain. Anyway is only rental for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bait and Switch... clearly an issue with marketing by MARVEL","review":"I too sat down with my family to watch Iron Man. It was only once opened and the movie started that we realized that this IRON MAN was an animated version.Unfortunately as with most there is a regulation regarding exchanges once the packaging is opened.At least now the price of this annimated cartoon nightmare is $10 dollars less so you might be warned you arent getting what you expect.Good luck with trying to get a credit...

Extremely unhappy with what I feel was a bait and switch. No where did it say this was not the movie but and animation. My family opened to watch and then found out it was not what any of us thought even after receiving dvd. Too late to return since it was opened but I won't order dvds again from them. 1 of 3 dvds I bought on Christmas sale. It was the only present I bought my husband this year and it felt like my christmas gift was taken away from both of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie SUCKS","review":"I finally saw this movie-The Invincible Iron Man.It was absolutely HORRIBLE.The story and plot are WEAK and SLOW.Iron man doesn't even come in for most of the movie.The CG and voice casting SUCKED.I wouldn't pay $[...] for this garbage!!!It's a good thing I watched it for free on YOUTUBE!The only cool thing about this movie was the dvd cover-which lies.In the movie his armor isn't red/gold or looks cool.Do your yourself a favor and forget this Piece OF CRAP even existed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring storyline, hardly few things to keep back for re-watch.","review":"Having liked the previous animations done by Lionsgate (Avengers 1 & 2), I was expecting something better from this Iron Man production. Unfortunately, the story takes like forever to come to one of its highly anticipated moments (Tony donning the Iron Man suit). Afterwards, there are few moments in the storyline that could really leave you in awe.For my taste, the only parts where I liked what I saw, was some (not all) of the CGI-induced animation, where some of the movements were very life-like.I saw this downer just yesterday, and to tell you the truth, I already forgot pretty much of everything that happened in the story!! Pitiful!I'll take this space to HIGHLY recommend JUstice League Unlimited, Season 1. A GREAT surprise, indeed!Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining but....","review":"Most of my knowlege of Iron Man comes from the '90s cartoon, but the plot seemed to divert a bit from what should have been. It didn't even really seem consistant with the first movies, as there was no mention of the suit sustining Stark's heart.There were definately some very amusing scenes. The mix of 3D and 2D was pretty smooth for the most part. My disk seemed to have interlacing problems, but I haven't taken the time to figure out if it was the disk, the player of the combination of both. There's one more story in this series of direct to dvd movies, Doctor Strange, which I'm greatly looking forward to. But that aside, I'd love to visit this Iron Man again to see what happens after the movie ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite entertaining.","review":"Overall I have to say that this movie was very well done. It is certainly better than the two Ultimate Avengers cartoon movies. The animation was great, I do like how they used 3-D graphics for the armors. The redesign of the grey armor made it look threatening, definitely much cooler than the original grey armor.I have a few critiques. I'm not sure I liked all the changes to Mandarin's storyline, and the very final battle with Mandarin was a little bit disappointing. All the fights leading up to it were great though. The movie had a good mix between action and plot, which I always appreciate. It's annoying to watch super hero movies that don't have enough action. Definitely a worthy buy for any Iron Man fan, and even people who aren't fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"After watching the two Avengers animated movies this one fell flat. The Tony Stark in this movie did not have much personality, and the story was slow. I wish I could give it a better rating, because I love the fact that Marvel and Lions Gate are putting out these animated films, but I recommend saving your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORENDOUS!!!!!!","review":"This was appalling.

It's as bad as the Avenger movies. Terrible animation. The animation reminds me of Gi-Joe cartoons from the 80's.The only good animated scenes are the scenes the elementals, but that's not enough to make it worthwhile.Plus we don't even get to see IronMan in his suit at all the first hour.The movie is just terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"IRONSCAM!","review":"I GREW UP READING MARVEL COMICS AND ALWAYS LOOKED FORWARD TO THE NEXT ISSUE.

Several animation styles were used to provide the atomosphere and avery ideal voice actor cast. For what was seen and heard in the movie... there was a sense of something left unsaid (or done).It actually works best that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked it!","review":"I liked this one. Got it for a birthday present and just got around to watching it. I liked the animation and the story. It was a little long for me, but I thought it was a cool story and it was fun to watch just because it looked pretty. Iron man critics may take issue with the fact that the suit development part of the story will differ from the current major motion picture release and probably from the acutal comic books, as i have not gotten around to reading those yet. solid moive though, younger kids might not get it, i am not 100% sure though."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Invincible Ironman","review":"I was really excited about this DVD, to my knowledge no one had ever done anything like this before, an animated movie about Ironman (COOL!!!). I wish my expectations met what I received. The story is weak, the animation is thin and the voice acting is poor. How could so much time have gone into something so cold, this left me feeling nothing for the characters or the storyline. I really hope more time goes into the live action version because this animated movie does not work on any level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watched once, threw it in the trash.","review":"I've never done a review on Amazon before but after seeing this movie I felt compelled to. I bought this DVD for my son, as he is into Iron Man in a crazy way. First of all, this movie is deadly dull. Incredibly boring. It is also full of \\"funny\\" racist jokes, such as a Chinese man working with Rhody being unable to say his name correctly. Tony is portrayed as a pathetic, petulant whiner. There is literally nothing in this movie that you would want to expose to a kid- or yourself. I am both a cheapskate and a nerd but I still threw this thing in the garbage bin. If you need some Iron Man in your life, skip this junk and buy the live action movies or Armored Adventures instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken Promise","review":"Long on story short on action.

Why does every film about a superhero have to recap the origin of the superhero?

With the plethora of high quality animation coming out of Warner Brothers for their DC line, I decided to give some of Marvel's stock a crack. I found this movie on Ebay for 99 cents (seriously, thats all I paid.) and I still feel as though I was ripped off. The earlier reviews give a good overall gist of this terrible plot so there is no point in me rehashing. All I can say is Marvel is extremely lucky the Motion Pictures turned out so well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey, I liked it...","review":"I read many really bad reviews about this one, so I was prepared for the worst.

Iron Man's origins were no where close to his Marvel comic origin. The dialogue was downright cheesy as well as annoying...and not to mention the stereotypical characters!

Do yourself a favor and save $15 to get yourself something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Romance of Iron Man","review":"Once again, the folks at Marvel Comics have unleashed a big screen drama in the form of a cartoon. Don't let the cover fool you. This is not kid's stuff. This movie was made for the hard-line, mature audiance, Tony Stark/Iron Man lover. Not some saturday morning, hoaky, watered down version to amuse the kids. Iron Man has always been a comic about romance, power, science, and the resolve of one man to live in-spite of himself. With this brings meaning to one's life. This version of the beginnings of the Iron Man charictor was great. A must see. Looking forward to more movies of this nature from my friends at Marvel Comics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good one","review":"So yeah, this is a good animated marvel movie.

Not every origin story needs to be exactly like the comics; otherwise it would be stale, repetitive and boring. Props to the creators for trying to update Iron Man and having the courage to tell their own story instead of regurgitating what has already been told numbers times in the comic book.The movie is excellent quality and Blu-ray really makes it shine. Overall it is a good movie; do not be put off by the dummies who thought this was the live action that came out in 2008, when this movie came out in 2007."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great for kids","review":"I bought this movie with the anticiaption of getting my kid into Iron Man with the new movie out on the big screen. I was disappointed with the cartoon due to 90% of the movie is build up and only the last 10% is Iron Man fighting and action that a young kid could follow. This movie appears to appeal to an older generation or maybe even some older kids into comic books, not good for little kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"As much as I like Iron Man, I was...","review":"disappointed. The animation is good, but the story and dialogue were weak.The ending was what REALLY ruined it for me. The entire Mandarin sub-plot was confusing, LONG and boring. I actually couldn't wait for the movie to be over (so I could pop in my Pink Panter cartoon DVD)...but since I'm a 35 year fan of Iron Man, I rode out the storm. The writers were trying to make some kind of french cuisine with the story, when all i really wanted was meat and potatoes (if you get my drift). There was a shortage of dialogue in the last battle sequence.What a shame for fans of the franchise."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointed iron fan....","review":"I was really excited about this movie with the new fangled( who says new fangled anymore) cgi animation mixed with trditional, andf it was decent, not the best I'd ever seen. Kinda reminded me of the old G.I.Joe's where they all walked stiff and talked with little expression. I applaud them using tony stark as the playboy he was, but the story was horrible and the mandarin could have been used so much better. That was really weak. Anyway, I think this will disapoint any die hard iron man fan. I hope doctor strange redeems this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different read on Gettysburg","review":"Do not buy this book if you wanted a detailed blow by blow description of the battle, see Coddington's work for a great study of the battle. While sections of the book do have detailed analysis and descriptions it's the look at the command structure that sets this book apart.Stackpole goes to great lengths to show the differences between Meade and Lee and how these differences affected the ebb and flow over the course of the 3 days in question.

The sparse, bare sets, the spiritual torment of the characters as Kozintsev explores Lear's fall from power endorses the NEW YORKER's declaration that the film would \\"stand as one of the unshakeable edifices of Shakespearean imagination.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Bare Bones","review":"Any afficionado of King Lear will appreciate the nuances developed in any performance of the play. While this version is the bare bones of the play's plot, with much left out, this production comes closest to what Shakespeare could have done writing for the screen rather than the stage. The feeling of place, the condition of the kingdom's impacted peasantry unrepresented in the Dramatis Personae, is the finest of all filmed performances of this play, and I've seen them all. The cinematography is a work of art in its own right, sometimes as stunning and disturbing as the play's most compelling dialogue. For one unfamiliar with the play, this film would be an adequate introduction, but for a student with a deepening and abiding interest, it is a Must Have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent adaptation","review":"Kosintzev's King Lear is as good as Kosintzev's Hamlet.

His suggestions range from violations of employees' privacy (listening in on their private conversations, searching their personal possessions) to major safety issues (keeping the back door deadbolted so no one can get out). As someone who has been both an employer and an employee, I'm shocked and appalled at his complete lack of consideration for other people.I don't see how any person with a shred of intelligence or self esteem could stand working for an employer like this. I wonder how he finds time to work on implementing a strategic plan for the business when he spends all day snooping on his employees and micromanaging the cash register.And in case the author ever has a chance to read this review, here are a couple more clues to the mysteries of life:1. Your female employees are women, not girls.2.

It's a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Science made fun!","review":"I was assigned to read this book for a physical anthropology class and I enjoyed it a lot. Sapolsky writes in the style of Stephan Jay Gould, connecting scientific abstracts to everyday life.

So overall an interesting read, but not the best \\"popular\\" science I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately disappointing","review":"While I bought this book expecting an \\"engaging and erudite\\" insight into the biological causes behind human behavior, I ended up getting one scientist's narrow perspective. Although the concept of the book is promising, its goals would perhaps be better served in a multi-author collection of essays. This book, written by a researcher of primate stress and its effects on their behavior, might be better titled \\"What Baboons do in their Spare Time and Some Obscure Connections to Humans\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff, only a little dated","review":"Great science writing designed to reach out to the general public - in particular, students in college who aren't science majors. I use it in my own biology classes as extra credit work for advanced students. The author finds a way to relate biology, and science in general, to the average (highly educated) person's life.The only fault is a bit too much political correctness in some of the essays - this makes them feel oh so 1990s. I like Sapolsky's newer books, which seem to have less of this too-careful presentation of biological reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detailed information concerning orchid biology, ecology, history, and conservation for nature lovers and gardeners alike","review":"Now in paperback for the first time, Wild Orchids Across North America: A Botanical Travelogue is offers detailed information concerning orchid biology, ecology, history, and conservation for nature lovers and gardeners alike.

Anybody who has ever dealt with a critical parent or a disappointing place in their life should read this, it's sure to make you feel better.

Sadly this book is just not that funny and as this was my primary reason for purchase I was disappointed.I read it to the end but it just didnt go anywhere and was a largely pointless excercise. The mysterious flower delivery was obvious from the beginning and the relationship with the parents barely comprehensible.

Yes, it is about a single woman, but this book does not have the zippy, Brit hipness about it found in Helen Fielding's book. What it does have is one of the most hysterical descriptions of bad sex I have ever read. \\"It's My F---king Birthday\\" explores exasperating relationships with parents, getting older and staying single, and finding self-contentment.Some reviewers criticize Markoe's writing as lazy, and while I get the distinct impression that this short novel wasn't something she toiled over, that doesn't mean you should enjoy it any less. It is not a deep read, and if that's what you're looking for, look elsewhere. But if you're looking for something funny and poignant, check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitter Birthdays","review":"I got this book not so surprizingly on my birthday. At first I thought the title was funny and the back excerpt seemed hilarious. But the actual book was not so funny. Typical of may thirtysomething single woman books, it focus on the narrator's lack of a positive love interest. True there were some really funny moments, but mostly I sensed a depressing undercurrent. The totally horrible relationship with her parents and obsessing over a past breakup became tiring. I was also a bit bothered with the narrator's \\"detective\\" work, it bordered on weird.There were some lessons to be learned. Don't take the bait with people that want to pick a fight with you and try to learn something new each year.However, this thiry something single lady is glad...no overjoyed that I find much more happiness in my life that the narrator managed to squeeze out of hers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mind of the Unmarried Woman","review":"Hard to believe such a \\"chick\\" book could have such guy appeal.

Unfotunately it didn't live up to all the hype.The premise of this book, as you probably know by now is a high school art teacher who writes to herself on her Birthday (beginning with #36) reflecting on the past year, what she learned and what she hoped to accomplish the following year.The premise of this book is both unique and original. Unfortunately the content was so dark and depressing that it just wasn't fun to read. I kept hoping that the something/anything good would happen to the character, just one year, but noooo...each year was just more and more depressing then the next.Don't get me wrong, I realize that life's \\"downs\\" were what made the book funny (in parts) but couldn't she have had something/anything GOOD happen one year???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it seems","review":"I definately bought this book because of the title. Expecting this to be a funny/touching novel was my mistake. The funny moments are few and Markoe's relationship with her parents just becomes uncomfortable.

But the breaking point had to be when I figured out the mystery of the flowers in the FIRST CHAPTER. This woman is clueless! I could NOT relate!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a rip off!","review":"With such a great title, I expected this to be an excellent read--it was quite the opposite. Dull and repetitive.

If they are so awful why doesn't this grown woman grow up and spend less time with mom and dad? The flowers from the former flame that she receives each year for her birthday is so lame and contrived that it has to be true. Some laughs, but mostly sad stuff because the character and the author both seem stuck in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start...then, eh","review":"I anticipated a sly, witty look at the world of a single woman over 35, which this started out to be. But I became really disturbed by the dysfunction surrounding the character's relationship with her parents, and the way she embraced being the victim, or fall-guy. There is nothing sly or witty about a 30-something woman who can't walk away when mean, hurtful words are the inevitable outcome of a family gathering, or can't ask a straight forward question to get to the bottom of a nagging question.

The premise is funny. The book itself is not funny. I only laughed at her comment about Hillary Clinton at the end of the book.

But it boils down to only two things - the gifts of idiotic clothing to the main character on her birthday every year, and the bouquet of flowers from an ex-boyfriend, also every year on her birthday. This got to be tedious after the first birthday. The main character, who apparently has no name, was so weak and spineless I felt like kicking her in the you-know-where. I would have told the parents and the ex to go to you-know-where. Why the author thought the same old-same old for 7 years would be interesting to read about is beyond me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to believe that this was a novel -","review":"I have a hard time believing that this was a novel and not a personal memoir. (Or a biography of a close friend) Some of the events were so off the wall that while I can imagine them happening in real life, I have a hard time believing that someone could make this stuff up.I liked it a great deal. The idea of noting the goings-on from year to year on one's birthday with your dysfunctional family are just precious.Since I have it in my mind that this book is really non-fiction - I would have given it 5 stars save for the year when her Father comes around.

I don't think I've ever read a book where someone complained through the entire thing. The book is about a woman who decides to journal her birthdays to see if she has made improvements in her life. If you don't like something in your life, change it.. stop complaining. For someone who is 36 years old she acts like a whiny teenager. I just wanted to grab her by the shoulders, shake her and say \\"stand up for yourself.. for once!\\". She's pushed around by everyone in her life. She doesn't stand up to anyone. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last!","review":"At last there is a book that addresses real compatability issues.

Johanna introduced me to romance, being the first author I read as a teenager and continue to read to this day. She has a way of writing that is smart, sassy, engaging, erotic, humorous and intelligent ... all at the same time. If you've never read a Johanna Lindsey book, shame on you and start NOW."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"I could not wait to read Selig's story but what a disappointment it was. The book was more of a family reunion than a story about Selig and Erika. Although I enjoyed hearing about the rest of the family his story did not stand alone. I thought a couple of chapters could have been eliminated. The first two books in the Viking series I highly recommend they are excellent reads. Find this one at your local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and Plodding","review":"I was given this book at the beach by my friend and had not read the previous two. In fact didn't know there even were other stories until a few chapters into this one. Maybe if I'd read the previous two I would've cared more about Selig and Erika.However, if you are a big J.L. fan make sure you read the previous two before this one. If you don't you may find it as I did. Sloooooooowwwww and a bit dull. I didn't care for either of the characters and although all romance fans are guarunteed a happy ending Selig and Erika's personalities made their actions and motivations in the book so foregone that it was a trial to finish it out.Seems like Selig was a bit of a fan fav. for this trilogy and it's a shame that more wasn't made of his story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!!","review":"Selig and Erika were absolutley hot!!! I loved them together and I really enjoyed getting caught up with the rest of Selig's family. Favorite part....the little rendevous on the stairs!!!! Another keeper from JL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"I am sorry, but I was truly disappointed by this book. I found the book to be choppy and uneven. I did not find myself feeling sorry for the heroine Erika, nor could I gather compassion for the wronged Selig. I read the first two novels in this series, Hearts Aflame and Fires of Winter and they are definately worth reading. I love most all of Ms. Lindsey's books, but I think she was under pressure to finish the Trilogy and she did not put much effort into this novel. The plot and characters were very weak, even the characters from the earlier novels were very unlikable. I do not recommend this book. (sorry to the previous reviewers)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't get off the ground","review":"I love the viking trilogy, but this one(3rd)never seemed to get off the ground. Selig wasn't convincing as being sooo upset with Erika. Erika was in turn too weak for my taste. And I loved Hearts Aflame, but Kirsten from that book took up way too much space in this one and was nasty. i was wondering if it was the same Kirsten or a new one. I didn't understand how Selig's mother could even tolerate her son doing the things he did to Erika, being how strong she was in Fires of Winter. She of all people should understand how Erika felt, but she didn't. Even Garrick, you'd think he would've said something. this was a boring Lindsey read. If you're not an avid Lindsey reader, pass this one up. She seemed rushed to make a 3rd book for this trilogy, and it shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"3rd of the Viking Trilogy","review":"Selig is now living near his sister Kristen and offers to help the Saxon King by offering to be a translator to the Danes, but their expedition is attacked and he his left for dead. Erika of Gronwood has made a mistake. In her brother's absence a spy is captured, but this man claims not to be a spy. He claims to be a Norwegian Viking helping the Saxons, and he insults Erika even though his life is in her hands. Furious, she orders him whipped only to recant the order later. What she doesn't know is that Selig is suffering from a head wound and fever. That is why he is not making sense. When Selig's kin come to claim him, he takes Erika with him to exact revenge on her. (In his fevered state he imagined her laughing at his torment and pain.) Never did he realize that he would be taken with her and she with him. Could they find actually find love? This story is not as good or steamy as Hearts Aflame, but it is still a good tale with suspense and surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"Wonderful continuation of the Viking Haardrad family. Would recommend to any one who loves a good series. I like the books that are done in past centuries vs now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"The second book was definitely the best one in the trilogy. I think that Lindsey should have taken her time w/this--Selig deserved better. The heroine was so weak and passive--not to mention totally unlikable. Ulg, don't read this book; better to reread a favorite or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrow it from a friend or the library","review":"I would definitely recommend borrowing this book over buying it. The plot never got fully developed. After reading Hearts Aflame, I was looking forward to reading about Selig. In this novel, he appears as a mere shadow of himself. He and Erika are very shallow characters the likes of which are usually in the background of a novel. Even his nickname is corny and not fully thought out. This is another of those novels when the hero and heroine fall in love and you have to ask yourself why. They know nothing about one another. For that matter, we as the reader don't know enough about them to care either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well informed and witty","review":"This is a serious and well-researched book on a little known chapter of history.Many authors could have taken the same material and produced a ponderously dull tome of purely academic interest, or a polemic for the disaffected.

The art direction is superb, the Henry Mancini score is wonderful, and Matthau is fine as always, but the film promises more than it delivers. The original Runyon story tells of a hard-hearted bookie who reluctantly accepts a little girl as security for a wager, and gradually thaws out as he cares for the child as his own. The story (faithfully told in the 1934 Adolphe Menjou-Shirley Temple film version) strikes all the right notes as the plot progresses, but the 1980 script rambles aimlessly and often overlooks key plot points, with many missed opportunities for the Runyon warmth and humor. Still watchable thanks to Matthau and villain Tony Curtis, but what should have been a sure winner finishes out of the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Miss Marker","review":"This is by far the best version of this story ever filmed.

Sandy Owen's style and technique are phenomenal. Some of the rhythm changes are breath taking and seemingly impossible. While in the traditional vain, all of the cuts on this album are new and sparkling. It is also evident that Mr. Owen listened to the old masters and several of the cuts pay tribute to the earlier players like Yancey and Lewis with hints of their patterns and melodies.

Now here I am searching in vain at Amazon.com. Every time I went to a record store they looked at me with this glazed expression (a lot of people that work in record stores look like that) when I asked for Sandy Owen.

I guess I should say you shouldn't see this movie unless you are a big fan of one of the cast members.

But still, it's a good movie to see if you like dark comedy, and I mean really, really dark. I myself liked it a lot; however, it is pretty strange and the ending could have been much, much better.

The sound is absolutely amazing. In fact, I'm having a difficult time finding replacements for them because when I actually do side-by-side comparisons between these headphones and other sets, these come out on top.For all of their amazing performance, I have to say that I do wish these headphones were more durable. The connection at the switch is weak, and takes a little wiggling to get working properly. I was concerned about the fragility of the swivel connections - they don't look very strong - so I have taken extra care to make sure that I put them away properly. They haven't broken.For the most part, the minor connection issue hasn't been enough of an annoyance to inspire me to get another set of headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"These Headphones are GREAT!

Beside the fact that it requires batteries to work, they seem like a great deal. The problem: The set that I have are picking-up radio interference. As soon as I turn it on and plug into a device I can hear the same radio station clear as a bell. The strange thing is I don't even have to plug it into a device; I can just touch the metal contact of the cord to most large metal objects in the house and listen to this one radio station! I think its some manufacturing defect causing these headphones to behave as a simple bandpass filter and since it has its own power source it just amplifies the interference. Regardless of the cause, it is an extremely annoying problem since no mater what I'm listening to there is always faint gospel music playing in the background! Folks I kid you not.

Its AM reception was consistently somewhere between feeble and non-existent ... do not buy a Teac R2 radio if you want to listen to a station that has a broadcast tower more than two miles from where you live. It will not pick up any AM signal any further away than that. Moreover, what others have said about the \\"flashlight\\" like qualities of it's display module are also true.

I agree that the brightness of the dial is annoying and I had to put some black tape over the LED so that it wouldn't bother me. The big disappointment is that the battery pack has now died and even though I never planned on using it without power, it will now not work at all. I presume that since the battery pack is now dead that it won't pass the power on through to the radio even though it is plugged into AC power. I haven't yet spoken to TEAC to find out how much a replacement battery pack is.

The radio was bought by an elderly woman who can't manage \\"newfangled\\" radios with multiple functions, etc. This satisfies that requirement but it fails in other ways. For instance, the tuning dial does not display what station is being played. It is purely hit and miss. Once you find a station you like, you'd better just leave it there - little hope of ever finding it again. Also, we had trouble finding stations that would come in properly without a lot of static. Once the radio is tuned in, it does not stay that way. Occasional tweaking of the dial is necessary. Also, this was advertised as a clock/radio. There is no clock, unless you can call the timer function (totally useless!) a \\"clock.\\" This radio is a big disappointment and if the original box had not been thrown away, this radio would have been returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"The battery system needs rethinking.","review":"My battery pack would not charge, strait out of the new box.

None of the other songs, much to my disappointment, were much like \\"Down By The Water,\\" but most (I don't care for the strident \\"Send His Love To Me\\" or the prosaic \\"C'Mon Billy\\") were charming in different ways. \\"To Bring You My Love\\" is a bluesy track that sounds like what Fiona Apple was going for on her second album, \\"Meet Ze Monsta\\" sounds at once tough and bouncy, \\"Teclo\\" is haunting and lovely, and \\"The Dancer\\" is just plain fascination with its flamenco touches.

Stephens profiles a variety of careers such as Chief of Police, State Attorney, small town and city police officers, FBI, forensics, and more. Each profile centers on one officer, who explains how he or she became interested in their chosen field, the kinds of education they had to acquire both in school and on the job, and what traits an officer needs to possess in order to succeed. The most prevalent tip throughout the book was to gain a wide variety of education due to the growing cultural and technological trends in today's society.This book is a short 91 pages, and it doesn't list websites or professional organizations like several other books about law enforcement. But it is written in a conversational style, giving the reader a first-hand idea of what it is like to work out in the field or in a lab.

In this follow-up, Trouble in Paradise, Parker blatantly steals from the Spenser series. The characters in this one are either actual Spenser characters, or the personas of characters with different names. C'mon - a gruff, Native American character of few words named Crow? Talk about a discount version of Hawk! I was so distracted by looking at all of the Spenser similatities that following the thin plot was almost secondary. It's as if Parker is daring his faithful fans to stop reading his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Page Chapters Don't Cut It!","review":"This little Parker novel was very thin, both on plot and number of pages.

In the first of these I read, the character mentions in passing his acquaintance with Spenser, up in Boston; and my bored-to-tears heart actually started racing with hope, as though a rock star might appear.

Jesse's persona is deceiving. He's a guiet man who watches other people's behavior. Jesse's very quick as a trained post LA cop turned sheriff in a sleepy town. His instincts are very good at picking out people who are going to do bad. Jesse does have his internal demons and his emotional intensity for his ex-wife, neither one will let the other move-on. It's Jesse's emotional drama with his ex-wife and drinking that are his vices. That part gets a little boring; but when you love someone, you just can't let go.

I thought that Jesse Stone was a very appealing leading man--and I particularly liked his supporting characters...Suitcase and Molly. I thought that Parker's simple language was intentional, given the no-nonsense personality of his hero. He could have left a little more for the reader to surmise--the characters overexplained each other to me a little too often where their actions and reactions would have been sufficient for most readers to figure them out. Other than that, I thought it was well done. I'm going to back up and read the first book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great characters, bad plot...","review":"I loved the characters in this book. They way he lets us see through their actions and dialog what kind of people they are is very refreshing (most authors today tend to tell us what the characters are like).However, the plot was a silly as they come and seemed to be there only to bring the characters together for a climax (or anticlimax in this case) and bears no resemblence to reality.That aside, it was an enjoyable read and introduces you to a different character for him other than Spenser."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trouble in Paradise - Robert B Parker - a well thought out action/mystery","review":"I liked this adventure because it had practically all the good characters from the town and from his past in it.

What's more, the songs transition perfectly (without mentioning the gong) so he should have gotten award for the sequencing alone. Other reviews refer to filler... I don't hear filler songs.

This particular album I saw them perform at Maxwell's in Hoboken when it first came out. If you like this one, you'll love their earlier albums. Especially Ripping Spin, Frequency and Urgency, and the 1st one. They have a good greatest hits album too: Your Soul is Mine. I first heard them on WFMU in 1985: song: The Vessel. The dreamlike post-psychedelic vision they have is a tap into the collective unconscious of visionaries everywhere. They were on the great indy Homestead label along with other greats of the 80s Phantom Tollbooth and Antietam. Best song on this album: Isabella.

Surely the book was truly worth to read.I do not want to go through the details and the analysis to the book, but I must say, reading Woman At Point Zero was heart-throbbing and was exciting at once. I sure recommend anyone to read this book, to also feel the excitement and, as for informational, to see the lives of Egyptian muslims.The book is written in a well-structured manner and is very easy to understand.

The subjects affect all Americans in economics, environment, civil liberty, healthcare and education. Despite his grades, he managed to have White House lease extended for four more years. That must be democracy and politics.This book showed George came from the right wing with a prayer to serve the trinity of religious right, corporate business and neocons. George is a tough cowboy not to mess with. He shows America is no paper tiger to the Axis of evil. His top gun Mission Accomplished show was impressive after the shock and awe.As Commander in Chief, George's policy affects rich & poor, faithful & secular, war & peace.

This is straight-ahead jazz--with none of the more pop, commercial arrangements that characterized most of the MF Horn series.

Maynard sounds like an operatic tenor and the power and musical-ness is just amazing. This CD is absolute and will pin your ears back every time you listen to it. The only recording that comes close to this level is...... well there isn't any! Also remember, this is a live set. No hocus pocus or fancy editing to hide behind.

Rather than keep to the original \\"VINTAGE\\" pattern, the original is thrown out altogether and the author merely makes a \\"similar\\" sock with totally different weights and materials for yarn and needles far to large to be in a \\"VINTAGE\\" pattern. For all the reader knows, she merely made up the patterns, stuck a piece of clipart in and called them vintage.What was needed (and expected by the title) was the original pattern, equivalent yarns and needles and THEN, a modern twist on same.

There are several wonderful patterns, including a great pair of ladies' thigh-high stockings that would suit anyone interested in authentic historical costume reproduction.I find most patterns easily adaptable to the Magic Loop method that I prefer, even though all of the patterns are written for double-pointed needles. They are also all top-down, which I also prefer, but toe-up aficionados would have to adapt the patterns to their preferred method.

The historical sections are enlightening, the discussions of technique are clear and helpful, and the patterns themselves are interesting and attractive. The simple, elegant lace and color stich motifs featured will hold a knitter's attention without being needlessly complex. I can see myself turning to Knitting Vintage Socks again and again, as will beginning and experienced socknitters alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mary Hunt is the best!","review":"Mary Hunt is the Real Deal.

It addresses the current topic dealing with kids, or anyone who end up with AIDS through a blood transfusion (a rare event nowadays). This movie is not for young children because of language and other inferences made in some of the scenes. Some of the situations were a little out there, but still it got the main theme of the movie across."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great friendship movie","review":"A touching story about 2 boys---one with no friends (Brad Renfro), and the other (Joseph Mazzello) is HIV positive.

You'll learn a lot about their \\"true colors.\\" I am a teacher that has shown this movie to all of my students for the past six years. I teach kids (with this movie) that even though they might have it bad because they live in rough and poor neighborhoods, they might actually have it better than others. Most of my female students cry because it is such a sad story. I've also had many of my male students cry as well. None of my students have ever made fun of each other about crying. This story brings up several topics that many people would dare not talk about. It is a great movie and if you are a teacher, this is a \\"must see\\" for all your kids!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must see movie","review":"I cried during this movie...luckily I was alone.

The two kids are excellent in their emotionally-laden roles, which was a pleasant surprise. All the actors put in A+ performances.However, I found the movie fairly predictable, including the evolving relationship between the two boys. Ho hum. It's definitely not \\"one of the greatest movies ever made\\" as some of the other reviews would have it, nor is it even close.In spite of elements of plot mediocrity, though, the movie does somehow manage to illuminate the undefinable beauty of a child's life, and the undiluted tragedy of a child's death, in a very authentic and moving manner.I will confess that I never tire of \\"happily-ever-after\\" endings, and I was rather expecting one for this movie. But I don't think anyone will walk away smiling. The conclusion is a stark dose of reality, and quite sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cure","review":"This is not a movie I would like my child to see. Three reasons;1.

Dexter later cut his own hand, threatening to give them HIV to keep the stolen money.This movie could have been so much better, kids deserve better role models than that. It is however a great story about friendship no doubt."},{"rating":"2","title":"An 80's Treasure","review":"The main characters in this film are disillusioned with goodness in this world and they find it in one another. It makes a statement against social prejudice, that it is excactly that, prejudice, and that they (the main characters) would have sacrificed a meaningful friendship and personal development had they give in. Another theme in this movie is about not being resigned to life and living even in the face of death. The downside to this release is that the disc is in 4:3 aspect ratio and some of the breathtaking scenery that the film was captured in does not shine through, especially in the world of HD today. The story does shine through however and it captures some of the fears of its day about AIDS. I like the hope this movie holds to, of people in each other. I give it 5 Stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cure","review":"Wow! What a wonderful movie and a great friendship!!! I loved this movie! I would recommend people to see this movies!

The ballads on Winterheart's Guild are boring, unlike the incredibly powerful tracks on Silence like Tallulah and Sing in Silence. The fast power metal tracks don't have the energy or virtuosity of Ecliptica and there is very little 'progressive' musicianship on this album. 'The cage', 'Victoria's Secret' and 'Silver Tongue' are all good but don't even come close to older tracks like 'Black Sheep' or 'Kingdom for a Heart'. And, I didn't think it was possible but Tony Kakko's lyrics have actually gotten worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"mmm not their best effort","review":"GETS REALLY BORING AFTER JUST A FEW LISTENS TO MANY REPETITIVE TRACKS AND THE SLOW MELODYS ARE JUST PLAIN BORING ZZZZZZZZZZZ I WOULD ONLY RECOMEND THIS FOR TRUE POWER METAL FANS IF YOUR TASTES ARE NOT TO THIS KIND OF MUSIC OR JUST THAT YOUR NOT ALL THAT CRAZY FOR IT YOU'LL MOST LIKELY JUST GET BORED REAL FAST OF THIS CD LIKE I DID."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a bit of the best...","review":"...but you can have too much of the good things, too.If the music was just a BIT more variating, it would be perfect! Great singer and instruments, very very symphonic metal at its best. That's how I would rate it. Sounds a bit like the symphonic synth-solo's from Nightwish or Symphony X-tracks, only the solos take over all of the song. It's a bit tiering, but lovely if you don't repeat the tracks over and over again.More modern than Symphony X and Lacuna Coil, still extremely well-played symphonic music. It rock's, and as said, so does the singer.If you like Blind Guardian, Nightwish, Symphony X and Lacuna Coil you'll certainly like this, as it's symphonic at its maximum! =D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Silence but almost close to being perfect!","review":"I updated my review after a month, and here goes my new review:After listening to this album for a few weeks my opinion has changed about for the better. I still think Silence is a better album, this one deserves a 4 star, or somewhere between 4 and 5 -since I gave Silence 5 stars-. I absolutely think these guys are brilliant and therefore had me spoiled with their music, now I have so high expectations from them. so perhaps I am unjustly punishing them !!The main thing that kept me from giving 5 stars to this one was because I couldn't shake off the feeling that some songs sounded as if they were rushed for the recording. For example,the ending Silver Tongue is horrible. I can not understand how a fantastic song like Silver Tongue can have such an end. The devil is in the details!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Great Sonata Arctica","review":"This band brings depth, quality, and skill to the table for our enjoyment. They can go fast, like Dragonforce, but they also know how to make a ballad. I prefer their harder stuff though, but don't have to skip tracks because it is all very good. Sometimes you can hear Tony Kakko's Finnish accent, but it does not detract from the music in my opinion. I have Reckoning Night and Ecliptica (in addition to Winterheart's Guild) and they are also worth getting. If you like Sonata Arctica's style, make sure you pick up all 3 titles that I mentioned. They are very satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid effort","review":"This album from Sonata Arctica truly shows what this band is capable of. This time they came up with something different, yet quite interesting set of tunes that take a liitle time to get into and fully appreciate. First, there are songs like 'Gravenimage' and 'Ruins of my Life' that grow on you each time you listen, then there are your guaranteed 'Victora's Secret and 'The Cage' that you'd expect to hear on any SA album. Contribution of J. Johansson of Stratovarius on some songs is evident, though the band would't suffer much recording without him, as keyboards on the rest had been handled with surprising freshness. The production is top notch as always. A couple of songs here I do not care much about, that's why 4 stars they get from me without thinking twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy tips and easy visual format","review":"A handy manual of how-tos, on a wide range of topics,and in a useful visual format that makes the steps easy to follow without too much verbage. While it's unlikely you'll use every suggestion in the book, there's bound to be a couple of tips that will make life with Word a little less frustrating, and that is worth the purchase price, in my opinion. The format is friendly enough that you'll probably end up browsing beyond the section you were looking for, even after you've found the one trick you were seeking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!!!!","review":"I really did not enjoy most of the songs in this album. Only two songs I enjoyed is \\"ode to my family\\" and \\"zombie.\\" But the rest of the album just drags. There are no memorable songs that will keep you wanting to listen to the CD over and over again. I bought it and have not listen to it in over a year.

For me, this album has met my expectations for the follow-up to Everybody Else..., however I know one person in particular who is slightly disappointed with the fact that they strayed from styles like that of Linger and so on from their first album. So, as with all music, it's an individual taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still their best to date...","review":"Many Cranfans were born with this sophmore album. It is truly amazing to listen to an album start to finish and enjoy almost every minute of it. The major singles \\"Ode To My Family\\", \\"Zombie\\", and \\"Ridiculous Thoughts\\" make it a must own all by themselves, and the rest are definitely worth hearing too. Loud to soft, innocent to political, this is the Cranberries most eclectic and best sounding album so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Need To Argue","review":"The second Cranberries album is a very,very good. There are several classics on this album. I could listen to songs like I Can't Be With You, Zombie and Ridiculous Thoughts again and again.When I go into my father's car I insist on listening to the songs I've mentioned. The single reason I slightly disagree a few other Cranberries fans who rate this the band's best album is that there are a couple of songs that do not live up to the usual high standard. Their first album is more consistent so that I've rated 5 star and this album 4 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many Great Songs!","review":"There are many great songs on this album. I want to focus on a song that didn't get much press, but carried with it to the album name, \\"No Need to Argue\\". What I get from this song is the let down when you find out that someone comes clear on their sexual orientation. A understandable letdown happens when you finally realize that someone is gay. Zombie is a unique song that is hard and soft at the same time. I enjoy all the songs on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my fave cd's even after so many years.","review":"I have a very large and diverse collection of music.

The lyrics are amazing. Dolores' voice is amazing. Each song capture a different emotion, each pure and explosive.

Yes, 5 star video, but unfortunately, they lose 4 stars for forcing us to watch a commercial for the Childrens Television Workshop at the start of the video. There's no way to skip it, fast-foward or go to Menus... All commands are blocked until the commercial runs its course. OK, I'm sure it's a worthy cause, but I purchased the rights to this video, so I should not be forced to watch their ad. I've had to sit through it countless times! I get it!

The whole album was done in one take !! Talk about a master. There are great ballads here especially \\"I am glad there is you\\" and \\"Love me tender\\". But the first two cuts on the album reminds us that Carmen can swing with the best of them and her scatting is just as remarkable. This album is the beginning of the last great phase for Carmen from '86 to '91.

Since reading it I have also learned, from a interview with LeAnn herself, that not only was she not consulted in the writing of this book, the author did not even bother to interview her! It was based primarily on past interviews conducted by other writers. I you have absolutely no knowlege of LeAnn you might enjoy this book, otherwise I recommend passing it over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get it While You Can","review":"A modern masterpiece.

The \\"flexi\\" part is made of rubber - similar to one of those black rubber tie-downs with the hoods on each end. When you flex it, it bends completely shutting off air-flow. Since it pinches off, I don't consider this flexible. I expect flexible attachments to bend without interferring with the performance of the product.

I'm sitting here staring at the keyboard trying to explain what it sounds like and I'm unsuccessful. Some call it \\"trip-hop\\" but I say this sounds NOTHING like \\"Dummy\\" or \\"Mezzanine\\"! Ever heard the song \\"Downs\\" from Big Star's \\"Third Sister Lovers\\"? That's what a lot of this album sounds like. Unique percussion and static melodies. And lyrics along the lines of \\"I drink till I'm drunk and I smoke till I'm senseless\\" and \\"I f--- you in the a--.\\" with song titles like \\"Ponderosa\\" and \\"Suffocated Love\\".

Martina, his main singer here who he found on the street, has an incredible voice, very sexy.\\"Ponderosa\\" is a quirky track with strange percussion. \\"Black Steel\\" takes an NWA rap, gives it to Martina (to unusual effect) and transforms it into a full-blown rocker. \\"Strugglin'\\" is a disturbing vision of insanity with bizarre sounds like dripping water, clicking cameras and sirens that get sped up and cut off.Pretty much everything else (if you wanted to) could be programmed together to make the perfect atmospheric soundtrack for an evening of romance - very sexy. Not everyone will see it that way, but it works for me. What is undenyable is that each of these songs stand out on their own.

I bought all except JUXTAPOSE,AND PRE MILLENIUM TENSION.This is some of the best songs ive heard because they are so different, and they are not as easy to understand. This makes the listener sit there and brainstorm. And buy a couple of listenings you start to enjoy this.

My main complaint, though, is that in the earlier stages of the show it seems to be just one battle after another, and they all seem begin and end the same way with a buch of beasts surrounding he heros, and the heros beating them again and again and again.Overall, the show is enjoyable and funny anime that all ages will find amusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hackin and Slashin Their Way to the Top","review":"The Slayers is an excellent example of what I would call D&D style anime. It is vaguely similar to Lodoss Wars in that respect but only in that way. This series is significantly more of a comedy. There is also a touch of Tenchi syndrome as well.

I bought this book expecting that there'd be at least a chapter on Cottage Cheese, Flaxseed Oil, and Cancer including discussions on why it's believed to help. I also expected similar chapters on other simple, everyday things that might help.But it's less than 50 pages and reads more like one man's journal at a very high level.

The story of this complex and still controversial war is probably intended for those who are new to the subject, but the objects/photos may be interesting for those who already have a good understanding of the subject matter.Add this book to your library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite","review":"While the poems in this book are wonderful, the commentary by Housden is just too syrupy.

The commentary provides too much personal (and disconcertingly jejune) information that cannot be of interest to anyone other than the author and his apparently odd wife. His discussion of the poems sounds like a stoned and mawkish college freshman at three o'clock in the morning discussing how each grain of sand could be its own universe.One also has to ask whether there was an editor. On page 41, it is clear that the author has no idea what the word \\"kelson\\" means; he apparently believes it to mean a subatomic particle, when in fact it is a part of a ship. On page 93, he misuses the word \\"enormity\\" to mean vast, rather than its correct meaning of extreme wickedness or evil. For a book about poetry, it is remarkably insensitive to the meaning of words, or the aesthetic pleasure of using them economically."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ten Poems","review":"I loved this little book.I introduction is fabulous.The reviews of each poem are wonderful too.All different.I loved the 1st one the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Expect Life Changes","review":"See Jason Murphy's November 11 below for guidance ( not spiritual, but very worthwhile ).

A \\"zombie\\" movie were the dead could integrate into society. Lots of possibilities in the relationship area. This movie was unbelivably boring and long. The \\"Zombies\\" just act like they are really stoned. Character development is extremely thin and not at all compelling. The resolution / climax was confusing and non existant.

They put a thing on so that your computer won't play it, in the hopes that you won't be able to copy it. Sadly, that means you can't play it on your computer and that really limits my options.They also put lots of errors in the tracks, which are supposed to be compensated for by the correction codes, but that unfortunately does not work on the CD changer in my car. So it doesn't play there either.The only place it does play (out of 5 places I tried) is on the crappy boom box in the bathroom.There are many fish in the ocean, and there are many CDs on the market.

This is the perfect cd to have around when you've got friends over. I looked at bordersj2's other reviews and it looks like he/she is a brazilian dj of some sort and obviously bitter about not being able to do the cd themselves. What the review doesn't talk about is that a good song is a good song. Just becasue a song is a couple of years old doesn't make it a bad song - can you imagine if we held this standard up to The Beatles, Rolling Stones or Led Zepelin ?

I'll admit, I don't know the name of the songs or artists. I just play songs 1-8 because they are cool. I only listen to CD 2 because it's more upbeat. I don't have a problem playing it on my computer or elsewhere. It's a awesome starter CD if you are just getting into this. All I have to say, is listen to the samples provided-and you decide if you want to make the investment. If it sounds good, get it and you'll be happy.

My 7-year old was frustrated with being forced to use the keyboard and no mouse. And we couldn't figure out a way to go back to the main menu without exiting the game. And playing a later level requires you to go through all the earlier levels. And...did they actually test this thing on humans? What a waste of potential. It is a good concept."},{"rating":"1","title":"A HUGE Disappointment !!","review":"My son had an earlier version of Math Blaster, it was wonderful. I saw this new version and expected more of the same. WRONG!! After 10 minutes of loud sounds, and pulsing video, he was complaining. It was impossible to focus on what he should do with all the distracting background stuff. Never could get to a point where learning might take place. Wish I could get my money back.After this disaster, we purchased Mia's Math Adventure. This was more in tune with the first Math Blaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"You won't master the basics","review":"I bought this for my two sons, ages 6 and 8, to help them develop speed with their memory math skills. What a disappointment. Even when they do know the answer quickly it can take them a good minute to find the actual answer in the game. Each playtime you must start from the beginning a work back up to where you left off. Good for review but it takes so long to get to the levels where practice is really needed. I wish I'd purchased a different product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating and Boring","review":"I just got a 2006 version of math blasters, I played it for a while and I thought that it was really frustrating and it didnt help me at math at all!

It was a good review tool and they liked it. But this new Mathblaster is nothing like the old one. It is trying so hard to appeal to modern kids who play video games that there is too much gaming with very little math thrown in. I'm not happy with it at all since it's not really reviewing much math. My 9yo son sort of likes it because it's basically just another video game. But he doesn't really play it that much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Educational software available","review":"I've taught math 40 years. Twenty five years ago my children used Math Blaster to build their basics and speed.

I threw it away.What game these days uses keyboard keys and no mouse? What game makes you use those keyboard keys to hop around 20 times to answer a simply math problem. Stupid. The early game had you flying a spaceship and you had to shoot the right answer as fast as you could. Made much more sense. Hopping around in 6 rows and 5 columns to answer 5 + 18 is just not right.Horrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Math Blaster Startup Help","review":"Once you decrypt the game entry point, Math Blaster is a brilliant method for teaching basic math functions (+,-,*, /). The problem with startup is the lack of guidance on how to start the game. A line or two (in the UI)explaining how to start the game (after the arithmetic tables are displayed) would be a tremendous assistance for beginners. We were disappointed with the list of +,-.*,/ tables displayed until we accidently clicked the entry point with the mouse. The user is presented an endless set of arithmetic expressions which the user must discern as valid/invalid while exploring a labyrinth of shoot-em-up and donkey-kong type choices.

It's jump from ledge to ledge trying to find numbers to add or subtract until you get the answer to an equation (ex: 3x7=?). Then you jump up and down ledges for 2-3 minutes trying to get numbers that add up to what you think the answer is and then jumping back to the bottom to see if the answer you have is correct. Boring and stupid, I want my kid to be able to answer it right away not jump around for minutes and then check if they have the correct answer. I bought six different math games that all turn out to be made by this company and all are just horrible, don't buy any of the Math Blaster series or The Learning Company games, they are a waste of time and money.

My 8 year old children who like almost any computer game did not like this one. I tried it. It is poorly designed from a skill perspective.

While it's true that the series is intended as simple, self-directed reading for 4-8 year olds, the bright photos and easily understood text makes paraphrasing or straight-forward reading doable for younger children who love books (as our kids do- I regularly spend half an hour or more being sat on & reading requests- not exactly painful!)The books always provide comprehensive info so they're perfect for allowing teachers to learn about holidays with their children.

However what I we got was an overly long and drawn out story line. However this isnt what define the movie for me.There is a very troubling scene in this movie where entire families are executed quite brutally. A man is forced to watch as his son is stretched to death between 2 cars. You here the child scream for his father as the cars screech in opposite directions. Although I know that perhaps executions like this may have occurred in the real world mobs, drug cartels and their like, I don't think anyone needs to see this level of violence and brutality. This one scene made me turn away in disgust and has stayed with me.

I was 17 or 18 at the time and apparently hadn't formed any type of taste yet. The songs on this album actually get more and more annoying each time they are played. Bonham doesn't sing, she whines, and screams, and frankly I don't consider that art.

I bought it because I really liked the first song \\"Mother Mother\\" (which is the only reason why Tracy Bonham even gets 2 stars from me)... and I was completely disappointed with the rest of the album. The songs aren't interesting and the whole thing all in all is just simply not worth the money. Unless its used and only costs like, two bucks. Actually, when I went to to trade it in at the record store, they only offered me 25 cents for it because they have so many copies of it and nobody wants them. And I took the quarter!

Both Tracy Bonham's screetchy and frequently flat delivery and her inarticulate message were off-putting. For some great women rockers who manage to preserve musical beauty along with their political and personal messages, check out any of the following: Tracy Chapman, Ani DiFranco (even in her most angry politically-charged work she maintains lyrical beauty and ocassionally musical loveliness), The Indigo Girls, Sarah McLaughlan, Bonnie Raitt (especially her early Blues-revival period), Paula Cole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grows on you","review":"I have to admit that at first I only liked the first song on this CD, but after listening to it a few times I found an appreciation for most of the songs. I find myself getting more and more into chick rock and Tracy Bonham is no exception. There is a wide range on this CD, everything from driving rock to a couple more soothing melodies. Tracy has written some moderately profound lirics, developed melodies that compliment well, and has a raspy voice that is a great alternative to all the overproduced music popular right now. All in all a worthy addition to my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"a keeper","review":"I bought this CD a couple of years ago, listened to it a couple of times and put it away.

She has a song on the new Lilith CD, and I hope a new CD is coming out sometime.... I loved Mother Mother when it came out, and that's what made me get the CD in the first place. Sharks Can't Sleep is most certainly my fave though. There are only a couple of tracks here that seem a little too similar to others on the CD, but the rest is awesome edgy pop/rock. I would call this lady a folky Shirley Manson (of Garbage), without all of the electronica and with some pure vocal skill. Yeah...

I hoped the rest would be similar, but it really was not at all. I found most of the music almost grating, especially the popular \\"Mother Mother\\" and the lyrics quite uninspired. In addition, the CD as a whole lacked flow, rather, it seemed like a bunch of random songs and chants thrown together. I ended up trying to give this CD away, then throwing it away when nobody wanted it. I did keep a tape of \\"Shark's Can't Sleep\\", however, which I listen to frequently enough to warrant a couple stars.

His band on this release-Craig Goldy on lead guitar, Jeff Pilson on bass, Scott Warren on keyboards, and Simon Wright on drums are great. With a band like that, you know this will deliver the goods, but more importantly, Ronnie is still at the top of his game with his vocals, and the songwriting is inspired and fresh...some of Ronnie's best lyrics in over 20 years, and the music is strong with catchy riffs and arrangements that really stick. Just enough contrast between the slower moody numbers with some good upbeat rockers. Favorite tracks are \\"Shivers\\", \\"The Eyes\\", \\"One More For The Road\\", \\"End Of The World\\",\\"Death By Love\\", and closing track \\"In Dreams\\", but every song is really worth listening to.

Admittedly I'm more of a fan of fast-paced and solo-heavy work of the likes of Iron Maiden or Judas Priest, but this album is short on originality. Some songs, including the title track, where painful to listen to, and lead me to believe that Dio was more a corporate creation than an actual musical talent. Some would contend Dio of today doesn't even compare to his masterpieces in the past, but I would suggest that those new to Dio don't start here. I would advise those who claim this is \\"better than most of the crap out there\\" to open your eyes to some of the great metal that's come out in the past decade - to more musically complete bands like Opeth, Dimmu Borgir, and Trivium, or to creative forces like Symphony X, Between the Buried and Me, or Agalloch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, Superb, and Great","review":"The best you can expect from an artist is that they deliver what they do best, and DIO does that in spades here.Whilst I like MAGICA as well, MASTER OF THE MOON covers slightly different ground in a great way.One suspicion I have is that this CD was mastered for volume; the reason I say this is that the sound is absolutely outrageously great on my 5.1 system ... not that a standard stereo does not deliver, just that a cranked up ( I mean MAJOR loud , which for me is loud in my home office ) listen of this CD is Great.DIO is one of the best, the most consistent, and possibly one of the most prolific in this genre. With Alice doing great discs, a new ACDC on the way, and etc., the solid product coming out that is an antidote to the commerical garbage is superb.LONG LIVE DIO!!!!!!!!!!!!If you can find it, check the December 1977 Munich concert, and compare it to anything done in the last 5 years by DIO...

For the first 6-7 months it operated O.K., with good picture and sound through my AVR-645. However, it soon began to show all kinds of (presumably) software-related issues such as skipping, freezing up on brand new disks, etc. Shortly thereafter, the fiber optic input died, so I'm back to copper connections.Now, in order to turn the machine on I have to manually hold down the power button for 3-4 seconds, which turns on the power light but nothing else.

The essential components of a succesful soilfree garden are covered very well, such as the balance between lighting and nutrients and the chemical changes that occur in the growth process. All of this explained in \\"layman's terms\\" that we can all understand. Three well described sets of plans are included in the book which can get the reader on a small budget started.

It's a handsomely produced effort, with fancy production values including a lyric booklet, and nothing bad to say about the back-up musicians and singers, who probably did their best. Embarassing all round in an \\"Emperor's New Clothes\\" sort of way. Maybe someone should do this guy a favor and tell him he has no talent.

In some ways he is a throwback artist- he has his toasting skills down well, and his rough and ready voice reminds me of Peter Tosh, who, in my mind's eye, had the greatest of all reggae voices.When I had to review \\"'Til Shiloh\\" in '95 when it came out, I needed several listens to take it all in, then proceeded to never return the promo copy I received- it was THAT good.Every track here is a gem, full of power and poise. Buju was on all cylinders when this lp was made, to be sure.All of the trcaks can be sampled, so listen to all of them- then get this lp.

To set lyrics and vocals of Marley-esque joy, exuberance and insight against a wide variety of infectious Jamaican styles, all the while with his dancehall roots intact, is the feat of a great artist.

Then there's Motivation, which I really would've liked to have seen released as a single, because it's always been one of my favorites off this album, along with the 9 minute long Prick, which brilliantly shifts from heavy, distorted guitars to the soft, mellow bridge, then right back into the heavy music....back and forth, back and forth, only to be followed by the wonderful song High, whose lyrics came right off the top of Tim's head.

She definately has a more American sound throughout the CD. I feel like she shows depth throughout the album, and she shows a range of voice, but it just does not have the fire of the other ones. None of the songs are very memorable outside of the lyrics themselves.. she sounds very soft and almost bored while she is singing in some songs.

It's so nice to hear from Shakira again after five years, and boy did she deliver on this record. If you haven't gotten a chance to hear it yet, I strongly recommend that you do, as it's quite an excellent CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now THIS is the Shakira I know!","review":"After the HUGE dissapointment(for me) that was Laundry Service, with it's weak English lyrics and pretty generic English songs, I anticipated to hear Shakis in Spanish again.This album really impressed me. Shakira has delicately weaved in many different types of sounds to create a wonderful blend of pop/rock/Latin-American rhythms.People should be forewarned however- this is VERY different from her previous work, and definitely not as commercial sounding as Laundry Service. Most of the songs are slow love songs, something I think lots of people did not expect and hence why they did not like the album.It is however a solid, unique piece of work...totally recommended for people who appreciate unique music that stands out from the repetitive pop crap being produced today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I found out about Shakira when she came out with Laundry Service in 2001. I bought it and though it was pretty good. Then i sort of forgot about her because she was gone for like 2 years or something. Then i saw La Tortura on MTV and started listening to Laundry Service and knew I had to try out the new CD. I didn't know it was all in Spanish but i decided to try it out anyways. I was blown away. Laundry Service was great but I like this one much more and I don't even know what she's singing about hahaha. The song's are different from each other and each one has it's own flavor. There's ballads, reggaeton, dance, rock, folk, and jazz. But it still doesn't sound like it's just a bunch of songs put together. The songs go well together even though they're so different. I seriously can NOT wait for the English CD. For now, I have Fijacion Oral Vol. 1 in my CD player 24/7."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spanish Smanish","review":"I don't really know a word of Spanish, but I've been a fan of Shakira since her MTV Unplugged performance. Keeping this short, this CD is full of hook-driven pop music. There really isn't a dud track, and there are four huge keepers in \\"La Pared,\\" \\"La Tortura,\\" \\"En Tus Pupilas,\\" and \\"No.\\" Her voice is huge and variable. Singing in Spanish is her comfort zone. Trust me, if you even kind of liked her English cross-over album, you will love this CD. Even if you don't understand the words she's saying."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"besides of the first single - which I love - the rest of the songs are too slow and boring!

She is supposed to be an \\"original\\" artist yet she jumps on the bandwagon with La Tortura copying Reggaeton just like Jlo. On encondite Ingles she sounds like Gwen Stefani when she was in No doubt.Im bringing back my copy tomorrow and I advise the rest of you not to bother with the album. Some of the songs are just aweful, it was hard to even get through the album. Its definitally not a rock album and while trying to appeal to everyone the whole album together doesnt really appeal to anybody.

Fijacion Oral shows a more mature Shakira, who has the confidence to incorporate jazz, rock, latin-rap, salsa rhythms and a bit of a classic 80s tone into an upbeat and rhythmical album. Only two of the 12 songs have clear ties to her previous music. Few artists today display the vocal control and playfulness that Shakira has come to master, and shows so greatly in this album. Whether you want to dance, dream, relax, or simply be enchanted this album is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mi fijación con Shakira","review":"I am shocked with this album to the core.Honestly speaking being of latin decent i knew of her, but never thought much of her English speaking music.Then she came along with this album, and has left my fixated with her.The album has got to be one of the best albums that have had release in 2005.The versatility and delicacy with the album, really does reflect on the fact that Shakira undoubtedly has and is the most famous Latin artist to come out of the 21st century. Im sure that many people will dispute it, but this is my opinion.La Tortura and the new No video are both amazing.The only thing i wish is that there were more tracks on the album. But then Oral Fixation Vol 2. Will be out in november, and hopefully there is a little bit of Spanish tracks on there as well. lol.If i could give the album more stars i would.This is def a classic, and one that i will always keep with me on my journeys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fijacion Musical","review":"Shakira delivers a product destined to delight her fans and music critics worldwide.There is a certain vocal spontaneity on this cd that is refreshing and festive.The album track listing is carefully paced to entertain and hook the listeners from the first song.The arrays of musical styles found on this album go from a bouncy festive latin pop mode to a sleek sophisticated lounge.This truly is the perfect summer cd.Ideal for any impromptu outdoor get together with friends on humid summer evenings.On this CD, Shakira's vocal performance is in top form -- worthy of a Grammy nomination.I for one cannot wait until the fall arrival of part two for this project with English vocals. I was pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shakira failed in this one................","review":"I have been one of the biggest fans of shakira, but this CD is not worth it. I pre-ordered 5 copies of the cd to give to other fans, such as my sisters and boyfriend, but I regreted it so bad. Why after a cd like Laundry Service, this is nothing?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than 'Laundry Service'","review":"No offense, but Shakira kind of sucks in English. I was so happy to see that this entire album is in Spanish. This sounds more like the Shakira I loved before she became a sell-out and dyed her hair blond and sang in English. She just sounds better in Spanish and her lyrics don't sound so awkward. I love that there are two versions of 'La Tortura' and 'La Pared.' 'Dia de enero' is the song that is on permanent repeat in my cd player. This cd took a couple times of listening to it to really appreciate it, but in the end, it's really good...still not as good as 'Donde estan los ladrones?' but that's pretty hard to beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great comeback from an excellent artist","review":"After being a little hesistant about buying this cd (a lot of people lot negative reviews about it), I'm glad I did. It doesn't sound like any of her previous works, but it still mesmerizes. I love almost all of the songs. The ones she did with Gustavo Cerrati are great tunes. I especially love \\"Las de la Intuición\\", \\"Lo imprescindible\\", \\"No\\", \\"La Pared\\", \\"Dia Especial\\" and \\"En tus pupilas\\". If I don't give it a five star, is because she could have included more songs (not two remixes, although they're good) and the song \\"Obtener un Si\\" doesn't quite do it for me. If you like Shakira, I recommend to buy this cd. If you're waiting for another \\"Pies Descalzos\\", \\"Donde están los ladrones?\\" or, specially, \\"Laundry Service\\", you will be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome back","review":"por fin Shakira volviò a hacer mùsica de calidad.

Despues que anuncio que planeaba dos discos, uno en espan~ol, y el otro en ingles, yo esperaba que el disco en espan~ol hubiese traido unas gran influencias latinas. Estuve muy equivocado.Con excepcion de \\"La Tortura\\", en ritmo de reggaeton, suena mas como la musica de artistas como Coldplay, pero cantado por Shakira. Y hablando de Coldplay, se copiaron de su tocar de piano. Si el nombre del productor, Rick Rubin, y los musicos que no me acuerdo sus nombre ahora, no suenan latinos, menos latino sono su estilo de tocar la musica.Obviamente le gusto a mucha gente le gusto y estoy en la minoria.

Shakira's music has really changed that. Besides her intriguing voice, her music comes across as always beautiful, even when \\"shaken up,\\" and intelligent. I'm going to have to take language lessons so I can follow along while she sings, but this album, even to a totally foreign ear, transcends pop stereotypes but manages to be completely accessible. If you think the chanteuse is not for you because you don't speak her language, you're missing out; the language of the music speaks for itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment !","review":"I think this album is very weak compared the previous ones.Shakira was special because her songs were unique and edgy.Most of the new songs sound very generic, like soap opera themes.

It's dirty, she must take it to the laundry","review":"Is the worst Shakira's cd ever, even worst than Magia, it's a bad copy of all the music we heard in the 80's... She lost her latin style. I love her music but this one is bad.. The lyrics are full of chiches like in No She shings 'Te juro, no miento' But in the latin music 9 of each 10 songs say that phrase...

Sigan comprando este disco, esta super Americanado y aburrido."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible amalgam of sounds that just do not work together!","review":"This album was a huge disappointment. I loved her earlier (spanish) stuff because it had an exciting sound that mixed popular latino music with some mediterranean flavour. In this album she ditches that sound in favour of the synthesiser and electronic drumset sound that was popular in the late 80's. I knew I made a mistake buying the CD as soon as the first song began. I can't understand how a high energy artist like Shakira can put a song like En Tus Pupilas as the first track. This album shows that a singer with a great voice isn't enough. You need quality sound engineers, mixers, editors, and producers in order to pull off a good album. Hopefully she can find some for her next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many errors","review":"I recently completed 2 Microsoft courses on C# and was hoping to use this book for review and to fill in gaps.

Ironically, all of the errors eroded my faith in the author, which compelled me to research many of the topics independent of the text, which lead to a deeper understanding of .NET.

Many of the code examples don't work or even compile as written. The explanations of the authors are terse, especially for the advanced subjects, betraying their own ignorance. Worst of all, each exam section covers at most half of the actual information you will see on the exams. None of the things listed as exam tips were even mentioned on any exam I took.Finally, the prep software that comes with the book uses questions directly from the back of the chapters, so you don't get any new questions.

I know horrible burnings at the stake took place. Do I have to have them described for me? (Read \\"The Adventurer\\" by Waltari for a wonderful fictional history of that time.) Beatrice changes character much too quickly; and Simon, her knight in shining armor. Please! The ending was too easy, too pat. I actually feel violated in having read this trash. And her sex scenes.

First and foremost, David Livingstone was not the first person to discover Victoria Falls. The native Africans who knew the Falls before him, were the ones that led him to its location.Also, castigating Africans for not trusting and loving him at-the-first-sight was very unfair. It showed how myopic the author, (Sam Wellman), and the reviewer, (Hazel Rochman), are. Both men must be joking if they assumed that readers have forgotten that Dr. Livingstone entered Africa at a period when the aim of 99.9% of Europeans who went there was to abduct and sell Africans into slavery.This book is dying for a revision.

It is a very quick and engaging read.The Christmas Letters recounts all of the bittersweet memories that surround Christmas. It is not necessarily all happy, but it is all very real. Maybe as I get older, the pathos of Christmas becomes more real - both the sadness associated with memories of the past which can no longer be recreated and the realization that we can only celebrate from that place where we currently live in our lives. When we are in good places, then Christmas is magical. When not, Christmas can be very difficult. Smith touches on both of these points.I am a great fan of Lee Smith's books. I gave this one only 4 stars, but that is in relation to her other books.

Some items in the letters seemed to be included to remind the writer of experiences she did not want to forget.My only complaint about this Kindle version is that the cover of the book as it appears in my carousel has NO WORDS at all. It has only an off-white linen appearance. Could I re-order this book at no charge and have it delivered to my Kindle with a cover that looks like the one pictured on this web site?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this collection of letters","review":"This book is wonderful.

If the book had been priced at $4.95, I would have considered it worthwhile but, I paid $9.95 only to have insult added to injury with a price reduction of more than $1.00.

Her advice is practical, to the point, and easy to do. The thing that most excited me was the Rapid Debt Payment Calendar.

From the reviews that I read I thought it would be great but it really isn't what I was looking for. I'm finding Mary's book has mostly common sense and some information that I definately was not looking for. She mentions how giving 10% of your money away will connect you with \\"God\\" and a few other things about how it will enhance your relationship with \\"God\\". This is okay for some people but if it's not what you're looking for you should probably skip this book. I am going to spend some more time looking to see if there are some hidden bits of wisdom in here... I guess my advice overall would be that if you are looking for something intellectual/educating, are familiar with budgeting/banking/savings techniques, and are wise about your money, even if you do have debt, this isn't the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another one???","review":"Okay, I am not a Mary Hunt fan. Every year, (more or less), Mary publishes a new book on how to save money or invest wisely, yada, yada, yada...Basically all her books are a rehashing of the same thing. Of course the irony is, that while Mary is supposedly helping you to save money, she is growing richer for every book she sells to the poor saps who buy them. The lesson is, stop spending your hard earned cash on Mary Hunt books. If she really wanted to help you save money, she would give you the information for free, plain and simple. Truth be told, the information isn't all that useful anyway, or else why would she have to publish a new book every year?Mary has yet another book due out in January 2012 and as usual, this one is going to be the one to solve all of your financial woes. Please???? Do yourself a favor folks, jump off the Mary-Go-Round and borrow some books from the library that will be more helpful than Mary ever has, or ever will write."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much useful information here","review":"Most of the frugal tips in this book are really quite obvious to anyone with any financial sense. There is nothing new or revolutionary about what the author is saying and most of her suggestions fall into the basic financial planning category. She also repeats herself constantly. The book could have been about half as long if she didn't rehash the same points over and over. This is not a good book if you are serious about finding ways to save money. The religious overtones throughout the book are a bit offensive, as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Debt-Proof Living is not Goof-Proof","review":"I found this book to be adequate but it only re-invented the wheel.

I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"God this, God that","review":"Can't people just write self-help books anymore without throwing God into the picture?? This is just another example of Christian authors trying to push their values onto others. The author suggests that we give away 10% of our income, and that connects us to God? I don't think so. And besides, if I'm buried in debt and am having financial problems, am I really in a position to just give away 10% of my hard-earned money? I think not! If I make $2000 per month, I'm supposed to give away $200? Maybe when I'm OUT of debt, I'll be in a better position to donate, help the homeless, or aid some other cause.This book lost credibility from the get-go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really odorless.","review":"Been using for more than 10 years.

I tried it in different soils, some of which were fairly dry, and some that had just been watered, some with fertlizer/some without. The indicator never moved. It stayed in the exact same spot no matter what type or condition of soil I tested. When I pick it back up, the needle wiggles, so I know it's not stuck in place. It just doesn't work.

Along with the Bible and writings of Josephus, they use non-canonical early Christian writings, and Roman documents and inscriptions.Bibliographical Notes in addition to the Bibliography make it easy to refer to more original sources in topics of interest.The book is somehat hard to read, visually.

Both songs weave a tale about life, family and the delicate balance of humanity through the interaction of strangers and family. This CD is filled with the quieter, gentler side of RS's music.

His dad said that it's a bad place to live. Mostly because how they treat blacks. His dad finally let him go back during summer. Things were happening to a certain black. The black was murdered and a trial was started. There is only one question though, guilty or not guilty.There is no way that I could not have say I disliked this book.

After 7 or 10 year his dad gives in and lets him stay at his grand fathers for the summer. At his grand fathers he sees how his grandpa and people around him are treating Africans, and wants to stop it. This book is very interesting to me because it shows the truth of the south, and all of its badness and it shows how it would feel to grow up with racism all around you and having to fight it all back.

In the first part, the Monkey King has been reincarnated as Joker, the leader of a group of bandits...However, I'm confused by the picture that's shown on this listing.

While it must be congratulated for giving the centuries-old classic a novel spin, there's just too much repetition, wackiness and messiness to ensure this a smooth ride; the jokes are mainly slapstick, and could well be removed without hurting the ramshackle plot at all.

Both are much, much better books at helping you find your bearings in the stormy seas of wine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"As mentioned by another reviewer, the organization of this book was not ideal. I was disappointed, because usually Simon is a terrific writer. I do like the visual richness of DK books but found their \\"French Wines\\" by Robert Joseph to be far superior to this one; wonderful to look at AND to learn from."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a U2 Album!","review":"If you're looking for a U2 album this is not it. Passengers is really just a side project in electronic music, and a poor one at that. Some songs like \\"Miss Sarajevo\\" have some appeal, but most are moody, rambling, and not a joy to listen to. If you want classic U2 look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Album Filled With Beautiful Textures","review":"U2 and Brian Eno come together to craft a fantastic album that is absolutely stunning. I really enjoy music that creates a sense of time and place, and with emotional and sureal textures the music on this album bursts forward with vivid images.If you only like U2's straight forward rock albums, you may confront this album coldy. But, after all, there is a reason that Original Sountracks is labeled as Passengers and not as a U2 album.But if you like Brian Eno, this will blow your mind away. And if you love Eno, it may kill you. You have been warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Incomparable Aural Experience","review":"Eno really stretches out on this great collaborative effort! You really won't believe the sounds coming out of your stereo. Tracks 2 - 7 are an organic whole, sweeping the listener up, down, and through emotional and psychedelic peaks and valleys, culminating in an amazing operatic solo from none other than Pavarotti (!). Bono's ego is gratefully subdued and he makes a fine contribution on vocals. Great guitar work - awesome sonic treatments. A wonderful achievement!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not U2, good techno, but not U2.","review":"My favorite band in the world is U2. That said, this album is not a U2 album. It is a Brian Eno album, with help from many other musicians including Luciano Pavoratti (though I do admit most of the assistance comes from Bono, Edge, Larry, and Adam). It's a good, strong techno album,easy to relax to. However, it is not the long lost step between ZOOROPA and POP. It is the opposite of the 3 U2 1990's albums. Instead of Eno assisting U2, they assist his vision. It's all techno here folks, no memorable pop songs that you'll be hummin to yourself on the way back from lunch. However, if you want to see what U2 are capable of when they relinquish control and serve another creative light, go ahead. Anyone looking for the next \\"One\\" \\"Lemon\\" or \\"Gone\\" or \\"Discotheque\\" or should stay far away from Passengers. We can only hope Larry Mullen comes around to this album in a couple years so we can see a Passengers 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"U2 and Brian Eno are a great team - surreal album","review":"By combining one of the greatest bands in the world with one of the greatest producers, U2 and Brian Eno have created a truly magical album. Passengers has some of the most surreal sounds around, as well as some incredibly sexy songs and enough off the wall stuff to keep you listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cannot be used on induction cooktop","review":"This product were listed as one \\"usually bought\\" with the induction cooktop. However, it is made of non-magnetic stainless steel, a type not recommended for induction cooking. You should bring a small magnet with you when shopping for cooking implements to use with your induction cooktop. Only metals sensitive to magnets can be used with these cooktops.So, I give it a 4 star because it was not what I thought I was getting.On the other hand, it is a beautiful hot pot and seems to be well made.

Thus time must now be lost every month double-checking invoices to be sure the totals are right, which is completely unacceptable for any business.Also: the program is remarkably anti-intuitive, and figuring out how to accomplish even simple tasks will challenge the resourcefulness of even the cleverest among us. Often, accomplishing one task means going through two different routines, located under different menu drop-downs. We have found that having a tech-support contract with a local vendor is an absolute necessity even to get the simple stuff done.Why this program is as dominant as it is has me completely mystified."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Goofy\\" wristwatch","review":"This watch with Goofy whose hands tell time in backwards fashion is a great conversation piece and teaching tool.

It is poorly written and edited. It has a chapter on how to use search engines such as PubMed. Surely if you are sitting this subject, you have already had considerable exposure to search engines and databases, so what the author tells you here will be nothing new, not to mention his description of using booleans in searches is very confusing. Consider another text or read what you can on the WWW.

I've been playing bridge for years but always felt a bit shaky on my bidding. 3/4 of this book is what, how, why, and when to bid. The author goes through each part of the game step by step. I found myself comfortably implementing these strategies almost immediately. Easy to read, enjoyable anecdotes. Will teach beginners the basics and give intermediate players a leg up on their game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Narrow and sensational perspective.","review":"Being a scholar of U.S.-Sino relations, I find all perspectives on the subject to be valid and valuable. Despite this, I find Lam's work, \\"China: The Last Superpower - The Dragon's Hunger for World Conquest\\", to be unfortunately sensational. Most importantly, the thesis assumes that the Christian anti-Christ story is not only factual but that its realization is nigh. Essentially, Lam suggests that the PRC government is the anti-Christ and the 'Christian West' must prepare for the end of times. The so called \\"proofs\\" given are a set of ambiguous historical claims and many blatant inaccuracies. Unless this erroneous 'doom's day' thesis is appealing to you, do not buy this book.Contrasting from my warning, I must add that if you are like me and wish to understand the many perspectives available then you might actually enjoy this curious, quick and often humorous read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I bought this book to use in an undergraduate business class (International Finance)Two of my teachers have commented on the fact that it is primarily used for graduate courses, however the concepts are explained clearly enough for a undergraduate to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"First disc is much better","review":"This is going to sound like a mildly negative review, but it would truly be hard to slag the first disc on this set. Some of these tunes are high water marks in reggae. I'm a fan of early 70's reggae and late 60's ska. I don't care for watered-down, drum machine (1980's) reggae music. The problem with this collection is that the first disc makes the second one sound weak. Too many songs on the second disc slide into UB40 territory w/out the hooks. And I can only take so much Marcus Garvey talk... it's harder to take the music seriously when you kind of just want to roll your eyes over the worship of this guy (or ANY man).I would suggest looking into his early albums before purchasing this set for full price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Collection of Spear","review":"Given the short life expentancy of a reggae musician in Jamaica, at age 55, Burning Spear has become the elder statesman of reggae music. The native of St. Ann's parish is a mezmerizing performer whose live performances weave a spell of firey intensity and rastafarian redemption. He is one of the last of the old school rastafarians committed to conscious lyrics and the one drop riddims of classic reggae music. \\"Chant Down Babylon\\", a collection of Spear's early music, should be on any short-list of reggae music fan's CD collection. It contains most of his breakthrough Marcus Gavey album, the crucial cuts all of his watershed albums, plus a generous sampling of dub versions of his music. There are several Burning Spear collections around, but \\"Chant Down Babylon\\" trumps them hands down. I have seen this double CD ...used on Amazon which is a real bargain for the fan or newbie who wants to check this righteous rastafarian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crucial collection","review":"This is one of the greatest reggae albums, and captures all the best of Burning Spear with excellent production value. Every ting i-rey!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will make you smile","review":"My daughter got this book as a gift when she was four, and it is great. The story is so sweet and fun to read, seems to put a smile on everyone's face. We have had this book for about a year now, and though my daughter sometimes forgets about it for a few weeks, she always seems to remember it again. Then we have to find it on the bookshelf and read it regularly for a while. We have family that lives far away, so we've talked about how it would be neat if we could really send them a hug in the mail. All in all, I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page Turner To The End","review":"I thought this book was well written through the end. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I think the publisher should have been a little better at picking up on the spelling errors in some of the chapters, and no, it wasn't jargon. But I digress...The book's opening scene builds up alot of questions about why this was happening, and because you have all these questions needing answers you cannot help but read through this book to find them out.Very good story, very plausible. I highly recommend it to people who enjoy espionage/thriller stories. I started it today, and I finished it as well. It was exciting, and had some funny moments in it as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Octane Excitement","review":"This book ramps up the action right from the start, and the pace never lets up. Lysander Dalton is a Virginia winemaker, a man with a checkered past who has retreated from the world into his vineyard, basically wanting nothing more than to be left alone. It is not to be: the past catches up with him, with extreme violence.He teams up with a long-legged, Porsche-driving, thigh-holster wearing lawyer by the name of the Valentina Mariposa, and together they investigate and unravel the mystery.Sophisticated and ironic as well as a real page-turner, to my sense this is much better than the average thriller. Highly recommneded."},{"rating":"2","title":"book","review":"don't remember ordering this! are you sure I did order? must have been a few years ago. help me here"},{"rating":"1","title":"Implausible and Run of the Mill","review":"This cookie-cutter thriller is, at the same time, both implausible and entirely predictable. Our hero seems to have endless amounts of money, the luck to meet only stunning women, and the ability to get them into bed at all times. Sprinkled with the now-traditional tecnnical descriptions of a variety of firearms, the plot makes little sense and the characters are mere plot devices. For pure escapist reading, this book might be worth bringing on an airplane or to a doctor's waiting room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Devine","review":"This CD is thoroughly devine in the arrangements and orchestration of the hymns I grew up with. I have listened to it over and over again. I'm quite pleased with it and also have Celtic Fantasy by David Davidson and it is the reason I went searching for another by him. Was quite surprised to find this inspirational music and will purchase other productions by him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This is a wonderful collection. The only piece I'm not crazy about his Abide with Me - this version is a bit dark for my taste. The celtic influence is stong which makes this suitable for background music at a gathering. I listen to this at least once a week while I work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very impressed","review":"While I'm not very impressed by the book in general - it's far from what my conception of 'encyclopedia' is, I am impressed by number of misprints/errors I came over shortly after opening the book. For example, I learned that the edge of space is at 1,025 kilmeters (page 331) and the first manned space flight was in April 12, 1959 (page 334). Will probably keep this book as a picture album because illustrations are rather nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular!","review":"This magnificently written and illustrated book is like taking a flight through space without leaving the comfort of your reading chair! Our unique human desire to explore the heavens is herein celebrated and our subsequent civilian/military applications of discoveries to date are explained with clarity and detail in entertaining and comprehensive essays supported by wondrous photos of our cosmos, clearly understandable charts, graphs and illustrations.

A superlative achievement and a grand volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars only","review":"This book is not really up to date as far as I am concerned!Mostly old stuff!

Anyone who has used googleearth will find the pictures pretty boring. The design of the ilustrations is boring, nothing like the good maps natgeo is sending in its recent issues. Actually I wonder if it is just a reprint of old material, refurrnished and actualized with a photo of the hubble space telescope.Dont buy it.

How to understand his/her behavior?Peter Blos gives good directions on how those common questions might be investigated, both for adults and teenagers. The reading of this book can help many people to understand what happens with teenagers observing the changes happening in their particularly mysterious and many times ritualistic world.Ideal for students of Psychology, but it can be read by virtually anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy this book","review":"If ever I have bought a worthless piece of #### this is it.

This double live cd set has fairly poor sound, though the playing is terrific. With better sound, it would have been fantastic. It sounds like an audience recording. Bunny Brunel sounds like Muddy Brunel. You can also clearly hear people talking off and on. One woman deserves credit on the album, as she is constantly jabbering away, except there are no liner notes. No matter which site you buy this set on, it is overpriced given the poor sound quality. Whoever authorized this thing to be released without a warning and at such a high price should be ashamed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of print?

There are not a lot of examples, and when there is an example the authors do not include many portions of the code, instead they direct you to the web site to download it yourself. Personaly I like when the author presents the code and discusses it afterwards, but none of that in this book.If you are looking for a book that is more of a tutorial on the topic look somewhere else. In addition to having very few examples, they are written in \\"tutti-fruti\\" language, some of them in C# and some in VB.NET.I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Technical Reference","review":"As a professional software developer, I have a need to continually develop and enhance my experience base. Reading and working through examples in technical books is one of the fastest methods for getting up to speed on emerging technologies. As a result, I am continually looking for technical books. Unlike many books in my collection, this book was a pleasant surprise. The book does an excellent job of covering the basics and provides plenty of code examples. The book was obviously written by experienced developers with an understanding of the shortcomings of most technical books. I would highly recommend this book to anyone trying to get up to speed on .NET."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad book for beginners","review":"I agree with some of the users about how bad this book is. Good developers does not equate to being a good book writer. The authors may be great at programming but poor at presenting their knowledge to novice and intermediate users. This book was written not solely for web services as the title implies, so it is misleading to buyers of the book. It concentrates more on how .Net architecture should be designed in a theorical way. I didn't get anything helpful on web services, and will look at some other books or the net instead. If you are a hands-on learner, then this book is NOT for you, there is no full code that I can see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good starter guide..! Nothing more","review":"This book intoduces more on XML stuff than to a .NET developer. It starts explaining .NET architecture after XML. I have read a lot of xml stuff before, so that probably helps to new developer. The authors approach on explaining things is just great for a new .NET developer.I used this book like a quick start for .NET Web services. Beside, I found this book lack lot of architectural considerations for real world deployments and so on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"I'm not always able to figure out the \\"bad guy\\" in mysteries, but this one was so obvious as to be laughable.

Otherwise I'm going to be waiting for paperbacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"what the???","review":"I LOVE Stuart Woods. I have read pretty near all of his books. However, this book bombed! WHY? Because it is just so far fetched it's unreal. Holly Barker is the chief of police in Orchid Beach, some small town that no one has ever heard of. She seems to go outside of her jurisdiction more in this book then five local cops do in a life time. She hooks up with an undercover FBI agent in the book, and trusts and relies on him, yet she doesn't even know what his undercover case is. It's just way too long and dragged out. During the first 4-5 chapters, you are able to figure out who the \\"bad guy\\" is, and you are forced to wade through 300 more pages of her not realizing it's him, and befriending him. Stick to Stone Barrington, he is at least more credible then this."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Improvement","review":"This author has had a few good efforts, \\"Chiefs\\" in particular.

It will come as an disppointment for people who expect poetry or prose in their readings. My idea was to learn more about Gandhi and I was very satified as this book nearly accomplished that for me. This book is as simple to read as the man himself. Gandhi tells us most sincerely and honestly that he would not have been what he became, if it was not for certain events that changed his life.

In a number of polls to name the \\"Person of the Century\\" taken by various media, Gandhi's name invariably shows up on the top. After reading this book, most will conclude the same. What impressed me the most about this book (not the person Gandhi)is the breadth of coverage in time, geography, politics, spirituality, economics, human psychology and many other things! After you have read this I suggest you read an outsider's view on Gandhi by Louis Fischer, \\"Gandhi: His life and message for the world.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird","review":"I actually put this book down because it was making me take an extreme dislike to Ghandi - which I didn't think was possible. It is extremely boring and tedious to read. Somehow you get the impression that Ghandi had a certain arrogance/holier than thou attitude about him. His attitude toward his wife is horrible, and even though he admits it was wrong, you feel he believes women are less than men. For all his achievements, he was a very strange person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I had high expectations of this book and I was disappointed. I believe Ghandi was one of the greatest, moral, and just citizens of the ages. But the book itself is fairly dull. I found the majority of it to be Ghandi obsessing on political beaurocracy, name dropping, and discussing his diet ad-infinitum. He comes across as quite a humourless man which makes the autobiography read like a dull textbook. I struggled to finish it. Its also disappointing because it was written before Ghandi achieved arguably his greatest achievements. I advise the reader with only a casual interest in Ghandi to pick up something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"good item, fast shipping, will buy again without thinking again !","review":"good item, fast shipping, will buy again without thinking again !"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!","review":"This book was great!

The book is not about Gandhi. And only covers his thought process till the 1920s (I think). From an Indian perspective, his life from 1920s-1948 is very interesting, because it is at this time that he makes significant and direct contribution to the Indian struggle against the British. It's a pity he did not update the book in the late 40s before he was killed.For a more interesting history check out Discovery of India by Nehru or Freedom at Midnight by Collins, et al.There have been many books on Gandhi but this is the only one he wrote. I would recommend this to anybody trying to understand the concept of non-violence, ahimsa. Was Gandhi a re-incarnation of Buddha ? I don't know, it doesn't matter. All that matters is that he continues to make a difference to a billion FREE Indians almost 50 years afer he died."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gandhi : Change your concepts about him.","review":"When I was young I was told in my school and syllabi books that Gandhi was the ringleader of \\"Hindu toola\\" who were creating Hindu-Muslim hatred before 1947 (I am talking about schools in Pakistan).Eventhough my ideas regarding Gandhi changed by the time I entered Uni,my instinct to explore the true nature of our pre-independence leaders is still there.This book no doubt has been my favourite since the day it was published and anyone who has misconception of any types should read this ."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing man","review":"always wanted to learn more about this amazing manthis is a great biographyshows so much more than any movie ever will"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendous Kindle edition","review":"Want to read this book, but the Kindle edition for sale here is plain awful and clearly was not edited or proofread.

However, I found it incredibly interesting and provocative. I was astonished by the clarity of Gandhi's thought and admired the way he was apparently able to adapt his politics and actions to changing circumstances. The moral weight of his account must be acknowledged. I am less convinced by some of his religious ideas and some of his prescriptions about diet, but clearly they are part of what inspired him and enabled him to achieve what he did.

Like many of the previous comments stated, the book doesn't cover much of the part of Gandhi's later life. It's without a doubt a valuable insight into the mind of the man. It rambles at times and assumes knowledge of some events and people not so famous.

There's the title rocker, an A-one hit in \\"Even it Up\\", the bluesy \\"Down on Me\\", and a trio of softer songs to close out the album: \\"Raised on You\\", \\"Pilot\\", and \\"Sweet Darlin\\" that have great lyrics and are pretty much performed by the Wilson sisters on all instruments. Despite the variety, there isn't one song that sounds out of place. They flow together seamlessly.If you're new to Heart through the Greatest Hits, I think this is the album to start with because it represents Heart at the height of their power as wild rockers and mystical balladeers."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"I recently purchased this album on CD.

I live in an ordinary neighborhood of single family homes. The interference is especially bad if you are moving around - you better sit still even in that one room you are limited to. I find it hard to believe that such a flawed device could even pass the company's testing and design. How is it that our 900Mhz wireless phones work fine in our home, and this does not?

Although it does not compare to Lady of the Reeds, one of her best written books ever, Child of the Morning is excellent. It's written about \\"what could happen in a woman's wildest dreams when she strives to become \\"Pharaoh of Egypt\\". The Hatshepsut character itself is somewhat weak, not portraying to her reader all the intricacies & thoughts of a woman. It does, however, show her undeniable strength as a young girl, woman & warrior pharaoh. The chapter where she actually engages in battle with her generals and army of Egypt against the Nubians is the best chapter of the book. Although some of the novel is likely based on some historical fact relative to her and the priest Senmut, no one will ever know the real truth of the relationship.

I have also read anything and everything that I could get my hands on that was fiction set in ancient Egypt. Everything else pales by comparison. Gedge, far and away has done impeccable research and has painted the most realistic picture of Ancient Egypt in print. No one writing fiction set in this period before or since can match the lush, gilded with gold and intense colour that one finds in her books. \\"Child of the Morning\\", which is about Hatshepsut, is a great read, and a wonderful first novel that established her as a writer.

Recent discoveries in Egypt undercut some of the premises, but the overall story is still compelling. Hatshepsut is one of the more interesting figures in Egyptian history, being both female and pharaoh, and Gedge is masterful in taking the bits that we actually do know about her (for example from what still exists on the walls of her temple) and weaving them into a cohesive fictional biography. She puts in a lot of details about ancient Egypt without making them sound like a lesson or a guidebook.It does look like the the original was scanned and not copy edited.

It was a sad tribute to that extraordinary woman and time period. If you like shallow story-telling and flat and uninteresting characters, this may be a book for you. It was beyond dull. The author portrayed Hatshepsut as a boringly perfect being living a life where nothing bad could possibly happen. Even when tragedy befell her, it was quickly glossed over. It read more to me as a silly romance novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"NICE BOOK","review":"I found this book very intriguing. I found myself interested in Egypt afterward and bought a book on its history. Spoiler alert - The only problem I had was that Hatshepsut was portrayed as this very strong personality all through the beginning, but in the end she gave up on her kingship, her followers and on her life so easily. It was like having two different characters. I can't believe that she went down without a fight.

The author provides the reader with the ability to actually visualize the Nile, the temples, the landscape , clothes, etc. because of the way she writes the story. I didn't want the story to end because of this. Wonderful story telling .

None of the eleven tracks are noteworthy unless you are a superfan of Kerri Chandler. But, the basic problem is that Frankie never arcs the BPMs and so this album monotonously moves from track one to eleven without taking you higher. I guess Frankie Knuckles fans will want this historic memento but house fans should save their money for better albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"The essential work in this field.","review":"Computational Transport Phenomena has been the single best general work I have found in my research into numerical heat and mass transfer problems.

Get REAL!","review":"I love Melissa, don't get me wrong, but this album was sour grapes! I could barely get through the first 3 songs. \\"I Wanna Come Over\\" seems to be the only really good song on this CD. I just happened to like her others better. I'll still listen to this but not as much as her self-titled album or \\"Yes I Am.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"This album was horrible!! I was disappointed in Melissa. All her other albums were wonderful!

My son and I are big fans of Melissa and this alubm was trash! I can;t believe that after Yes I am which was pure gold she had to have trash like this! Skip this album now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Are you kidding?! Melissa Etheridge is a phenomenally talented singer and songwriter. This album, like most between her first two and \\"Awakening\\", is less blues-rock, more soul-rock -- but it's pure emotion and awesome sound!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It grows on you","review":"This is a CD that grows on you after a while. At first I wasn't thrilled but now I love it! My Favorites are Nowhere To Go and I want to Come Over! I would now recommend this CD! I hope she releases a new one soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"seems to have lost her passion","review":"The reason I fell in love with M Ethridge way back in 89 was because of the hooks in her music and, more importantly, because of the passion she sang her songs with. From the first listen I heard no fire from Melissa this time. When compared to \\"Somebody Bring Me Some Water\\" and \\"Brave and Crazy,\\" the songs on this cd doesn't even come close to the feeling. I hope her next cd brings some of the fire back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Etheridge","review":"From the opening drum beats of Your Little Secret, the smash title of this album which alludes to bisexuality, I could not help but listen to Melissa. Although not as awesome as her previous 6 million selling classic Yes I Am, Melissa remained true to her gritty rawk'n'roll roots, churning out some majorly powerful rock hits - note also I Really Like You - but not without lending credence to her more sincere personality. Nowhere To Go is romantic, while I Want To Come Over is angst & yearning personnified. 3 US Top 10 singles & a few multi-platinum signs testify why Etheridge is not rock's foremost lesbian, but one of rock's foremost influences. Don't let the former jade your perception of the latter. You'd be a fool to miss out on this Little Secret which is worth sharing."},{"rating":"2","title":"real crunk stuff","review":"I love this album. This dude is from tennesse.This came out in 2001. He pretty much has a yelling style similar to pastor troy. The first 3 songs are super crunk. If you like that lil jon yelling type stuff this is for you. Get it if you can find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Chocolate Soldier","review":"This is a DVD version of a television classic. The plot is light hearted and romantic, based on George Bernard Shaw's novel Arms and Men. The producers have done a remarkable job at reproducing a television version made in 1955. For those of you who lived through the 1950s you will appreciate this restoration of a classic. According to one critic, Eddie Albert looked \\"tubby.\\" In reproducing black and white television for today's screen everybody looks \\"tubby.\\" The producers did an outstanding job with the sound of Rise Stevens singing \\"My Hero\\" three times in the production. A top mezzo-soprano at the Met for two decades, she is at the height of her career at age 42 in this version of the opera. Who cares that she is not twenty-something. This is about wonderful singing. The bad is that Eddie Albert can't sing. The good is that Stevens drowns him out. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Chocolate Soldier","review":"As a fan of the old musicals I was looking forward to this one, but it was hugely disappointing. A tubby Eddie Albert was an unlikely hero, Rise Stevens looked far too old for the romantic female role and the plot is extremely weak, not uncommon in musicals, but the songs and the singers can usually overcome this. Not this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"When I ordered this I thought I was getting a DVD of The Chocolate Soldier with Nelson Eddy. I had entered Nelson Eddy in the search so I expected to get his movies, so I was disappointed to get a TV version with Eddie Albert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Life","review":"The sun evidently was too much for mine - lasted only a few months and the plastic became so sticky you couldn't even lay on it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful reading!","review":"This rendition of Twelve Dancing Princesses is absolutely gorgeous! The detail and expression in the illustrations really brings the classic tale to life. The rich, luminous illustrations beg for the story to be read again and again, taking time to linger over the images. The story tells a wonderful lesson for children and adults. I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"forget Fr Bown","review":"Dreadful waste of money. Over-acting prevails in every story -- we only made it through three! Kenneth More was a natural in old big-screen war movies but not here. The whole thing seems stilted and contrived. No thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat Emptor","review":"This is simply not up to par. Yes, Kenneth More is a fine actor, but nearly everything else is inferior to awful. Take the second program on disc one, \\"The Oracle of the Dog.\\" The acting is on the high school level, the camera work is painfully awkward, the script is filled with cliches, and the ending is embarrassingly predictable. This is a collection of some of the worst British television programs I've ever seen--and I'm familiar with a great many. Alas, Chesterton had so much to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"like a poor high school performance","review":"The whole poduction felt amateurish and we only watched half of the series before tossing it in the garbage. Don't waste your money. It compared poorly to Agatha Christy's productions or any other of the marvelous mystery series that come from Britain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Production murdered these mysteries","review":"Chesterton and especially the Father Brown stories are a great favorite of mine. However, this production is horrendous and makes the programs virtually unwatchable. I own both sets, which luckily I purchased used at great discount, and I have watched both sets of DVDs.I Claudius and the early Peter Wimsey productions were completed around the same time as these. There is no comparison, these do not work, and those other productions were stellar. It is the production that murdered these mysteries!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply disappointed in this show","review":"It was awful- really hard to watch - I knew the endings before the first ten minutes were up. Father Brown is boring - the stories are told in such a way that the spoon feed you the ending and make sure you get all of the \\"hints\\" right away. Awful - just awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Father Brown Delights","review":"The quality of the stories alone make this set worthwhile. Far from being just another bunch of whodunits, each tale tells of some moral or theological problem. My favorite, \\"The Eye of Apollo,\\" is full of contrasts between idealist cults and orthodox Christianity. As you might expect from the title, G. K. Chesterton explores the Nietzschean substrate of the cult and their search for power.I have found that these stories merit multiple viewings, each time revealing resonances I had previously missed. I hope set 2 will be on the way soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable read for any intelligent reader","review":"I have been on a hunt for science fiction books that work for me. I'm 61 years old, and a person who read a lot of sci-fi in the 70's. I found, though, that titles I expected to re-read with pleasure were disappointing to me. This book, which I had only recently been made aware of, was a lot of fun, and a book I could recommend to friends who like mysteries or even chick books. Written with bright sophistication, this tale of a naughty-boy type of pilot's encounter with an alien world is less a science fiction novel than a generic, humorous adventure. Reminds me a lot of the work of Manning Coles, if that helps any."},{"rating":"1","title":"Child-like, One Character, Too Egocentric","review":"The premise was interesting but unfortunately, the alien characterizations were flat. After reading the entire book, hoping that at some point I would learn something interesting about the main character, I am gravely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too strong!","review":"I am in my late 30's, weigh only 100 lbs. I bought this drink at a local Seven Eleven, and drank quarter a bottle on my way home on foot. I felt somehow lightheaded while I was walking home. Then, about 10 minutes later, after getting home, I had another quarter. My heart started racing, and suddenly I had a bowel movement. When I came out of the bathroom, I felt a little better. Then, I took plenty of water to flush it down. In total, I just had half a bottle, but it still was too strong for me. I was lucky that I read the direction before opening the bottle, but the direction on the bottle was not clear and I am afraid that it is unreadable for some people."},{"rating":"1","title":"this product is not for sensitive people: it made me very very sick","review":"I bought one of these to try after reading something online about how it works great and has no crash. Cautiously, I drank a small sip from a bottle. Probably less than a 16th of the two serving bottle. Very soon I was tweaking quite extremely and my friend noticed how irritable I had become from the drink. However, it did seem to wear off a few hours later without a crash. I gave it a tentative try the next day, only drinking a tiny sip twice during the day. Similar effect, so far so good. The third day I tried a tiny sip in the morning and developed an excruciating headache and nausea that has lasted for two days now. I feel extremely overwired and unable to come down from it. Very very sick. I feel horrible still two days later and I hope I improve soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"I use a lot of energy drinks (Jack3d, redbull, assault..etc). This is the worst energy drink you can have. It is just awful. First the crashing afterwards is maximized. i had to sleep for 2 days straight after this. No other energy drinks do that.

In all honesty, I think the old style Redline (Triple Berry) was better which had a tart taste without the current electrolyte mix. In any case, I'd be careful drinking them on an empty stomach, combining them with other caffeine sources and drinking them if you don't know your tollerance to caffeine. I don't think there is too much to worry about except for the caffeine in each bottle which probably equals 2-3 cups of coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!!!","review":"I love the burst of energy that I get and I only need to drink half a bottle to get me thru the day. The best part is that I dont crash later in the day."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOXIC","review":"Do not read if you are easily grossed out! I started buying these because I was tired all the time and didn't want coffee stains on my teeth or coffee breath. After a while I started noticing blood in my stool (embarrassing, i know but i want to warn everyone that they shouldn't buy this stuff). I had crazy mood swings and i'm normally an easy-going person. The bottle warns bi-polar and depressed people that those tendencies will increase. If you're gonna drink caffein just stick to coffee and tea. This stuff is toxic."},{"rating":"1","title":"messed me up","review":"Maybe if you workout it's ok but be careful because it can make your heart race too much. I took.a whole bottle because im used to taking bigger energy drinks with multiple serving in the can but it was a huge mistake... my heart was beating out of my chest for over 8 hours and I was sweating for about just as long. I'm a big guy and not overweight 6' 3 and weigh 190... DO NOT TAKE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jump start your day","review":"Redline helps me get more from my workout.

The price seemed reasonable in comparison to the \\"real\\" instruments. The product is crude and economically manufactured in China (what isn't these days?). It's functional, but by no means a precision instrument and the instructions and user manual are crudely translated on a flimsy little rice-paper pamphlet.

Wish I could give it NO STARS!!!!!My husband and I each have a old Mickey Mouse watch very similar in style and color to this one. It was made by Lorus, and we purchased them back in the late 1980s. They still work great. The only thing is that the bands have discolored and the crystals are somewhat scratched.Fast forward to 2005. I saw these new ones on Amazon (mens and womens), and I was excited. I purchased two - one for each of us. The women's watch is still working OK, but the men's model quit ticking just a few days after one year (warranty = 1 yr), and then to add insult to injury, the second hand fell off!

You can feel every bit of passion she has for life and for her music when you read this book. By the end you realize she is just like everyone else, seeking out love and success. You'll appreciate her music so much more after reading this book. She explains the reasons behind writing some specific songs and you can tell that everything she writes (lyrics and music)is truly about the emotions and struggles of her life. This book will really push you to just be true to who are and inspire you to seek out your own passion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very touching and emotion","review":"I guess I can now say that I understand why her music is so fantastic. It's raw and you can feel her emotions pouring out in each and every one. This book covers most of the basics of her life and of course details. You find out about all the heart breaking, losses, and happy moments of her life and how she came to be the person she is today.If your a fan of her music, you have to pick up this book to fully understand why her music touches your soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clarity comes with time","review":"Melissa can capture an audience through her music because her songs seem to come directly from the pain or pleasure of her experience. Though that may be personal to her, it can be shared by many because most of us go through it at some time or another. Writing an autobiography is not the same. First, she's only 40. I'm hoping she has much more public career left in her. Besides that, I don't think she had enough distance from her relationship with Julie to have good judgement about what to put on the page. What may have felt like the truth for her when she was writing this a year ago may seem like a backlash attack by now. Her contributor must have been too 'in awe' or just collecting the paycheck to help Melissa really think through what she wants to last through time in print. Privacy is something to be respected for many reasons. Next time, Melissa, write with someone who cares about you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"After reading the other two bio's on melissa, I couldn't wait for her to write her own. I was very disappointed. When mentioning her band she completely leaves out Dave Beyer. Talk about a slap in a the face for him. I thought she would have a least put in more stories of being on the road instead of rehashing old interviews. Bascially I'm sorry I wasted my money. Don't get me wrong I'm a major Melissa fan. I just thought the book [stunk]."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes she is","review":"This touched me and humanized her to me she isn't just a voice any longer she is true and warm and hurts and messes up like all of us a must read if you like her. I just think she is the bomb"},{"rating":"2","title":"Her Truth, Her Story","review":"I enjoyed this book. No, it is not a great work of literature but it is compelling, inspiring, and thoughtful. As she stated in the book it is her truth. I don't feel it was a media ploy, or a boo hoo story. It is her way of showing how she manages to rise above, believe in herself, and remain strong and therefore inspire others to do the same. Melissa is a very talented, caring and courageous gal!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Waiting For The Bio Pic...","review":"Some biographies would make better films than books. I believe this is one of them. I like her story, she told it well. I just think it would be better told on the screen rather than on the page. Overall I highly recommend it. It comes across just like one of her songs--strong, heartfelt, and vulnerable."},{"rating":"2","title":"good read","review":"good read. A little too much on the relationships instead of the music and music biz from her view. Melissa rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small Town In Big Boots","review":"This book will leave you in awe after you read it from the pictures alone. Smalltown with big boots is this biography of Melissa Etheridge. Cold, hard truths tangled through the pages. Laughing and hurting with her ... common grounds spoke about ... she's real, true and strong.There was one picture that captivated me in this book. \\"The safest, most perfect place I know\\" is the caption. Why this intriqued me was that in Melissa Etheridge's live shows you can see that this stands true as a safe place. I must say I do know for fact that her safest place is different today. But that picture with Melissa, her guitar, the crowd and the stars all over her shirt. Goes to show you're what you wear.Reading her story and seeing her live makes me grateful to have ever had the opportunity to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"thank goodness it was on sale!","review":"i am a big melissa fans. but this book is crap. I honestly expect more than this! It makes me feel like Melissa was feeling sorry for herself when she wrote it. Glad it was on sale!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!!!!","review":"Etheridge hits a nerve for modern American military historians. Her account of the US Army's experiments with guided missle research is right on the mark. More time should be spent on research into food production and less on building destruction. She spends almost 200 pages setting up an excellent agenda for future US arms developments in the 21st Century, then uses the present data to state the case that we have RIGHT NOW the technology to carry it out. Using missles to plow ground for increased food production will be the 'new technological' breakthrough we've been needing. Acres of wasteland will be transformed into rich agricultural land. Good job on the book. Buy it, you'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth of the Heart","review":"This is an excellent book for Melissa fans! Etheridge shares very personal information about her life and her experiences from an emotionally charged yet wisely analytical perspective. The gut-wrenching, raw emotion she brings to her music is evident throughout the pages of her memoir. The pages almost turn themselves in this honest and intimate account of her heart, mind and soul. Readers won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring woman, inspiring book","review":"Melissa Etheridge has always been a sort of hero of mine (which is wierd because I'm a gay man, I'm not musically inclined, and the closest I've come to Kansas is watching the Wizard of Oz too much) because she is a truely inspiring lady with a truly inspiring story. And she tells it in this book. If you love her you'll love this book and love her even more! The book relies on her lyrics alot which is interesting and you'll earn a greater appreciation for her music after hearing the personal struggles that go into almost every single one of her songs. I had to think hard whether I wanted to give this 4 or 5 stars because obviously it isn't Shakespeare, its the autobiography of a young rock star! But I had to go with 5 because as far as autobiographies go its one of the best I've read and Melissa's inspiring, powerful, soulfull presence permeates it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"Rarely does anyone successfully cross over from rock 'n' roll to literature. But Melissa Etheridge has bridged the distance like few before her. What's more, she's chosen the most difficult path possible: autobiography. She doesn't pull punches about herself or anyone around her. Everyone gets the same brutally honest treatment she uses to portary her own flaws, weaknesses and insecurities. What emerges is the self-portrait that can't be done in three-minute songs. ME's a big star, perhaps the best-ever female in rock; and her fans deserve to know her inspiration, motives and background. Outstanding job, Melissa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brave and insightful look at Melissa Etheridge","review":"I was on the fence about reading this book. I wasn't sure if it would interest me. I have somewhat enjoyed some of Melissa's music in the past. I was never a die hard fan. I must say that this book was well worth reading. This book gave me a detailed idea of what it was like growing up being Melissa Etheridge. The book also talked about her relationships with others. The book also contains some of her songs and her reasons for writing them. I found this to be very interesting. At times it was slightly painful to read, but definitely well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"kudos to Melissa","review":"I've never been a big fan of hers, but after reading excerpts of this book I had to get it. It's a very interesting read, her childhood, romances, rise to the top, kids, break-up, ect. Melissa has the guts to write about some difficult experiences in her life (being abused by her sister, for example), rather than sweeping things under the rug. She doesn't try to make herself into a rock-star who's had a perfect life, which is refreshing. I like reading autobiographies by people who really tell it like it is. Great job Melissa!"},{"rating":"1","title":"She could have done better","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love ME. But this book is written poorly and is not what I expected from her. She tells her story, she is honest and forward but the book lacks what her songs are able to convey. Her writing efforts are better left to songwriting. It's a shame that the content and presentation didn't go beyond a 5th grade reading level and the tell all side of the book was rather shallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"another behind the music episode","review":"I am not a die hard melissa etheridge fan, but 95% of the material I read in the book -- I already knew from \\"vh1 behind the music\\" or in other melissa etheridge interviews.

I only kept it for a short time (returned it to the music store afterward). I recall eccentric instrumentation/compositions, and sour, mildly offensive lyrics disguised as social critiques (\\"Hi, my name is Joe. I go to church on Sunday, come home and beat my wife.\\") Still, those objections came from an ultra-sensitive 18-year-old with undeveloped musical taste. So I could be wrong. Perhaps I'll give Mr. Cole's album another try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Severe Disappointment","review":"I've been a Jude Cole fan for nearly ten years now. His first album was excellent.

I don't like to work out or move for that matter but I don't want to be huge so I do but I'm not going to be mistaken for an Olympic Althlete either. I'm very flexible but not particularly coordinated. The cardio part got my heart rate up without making me feel like I couldn't keep up with the odd workouts that some videos put you through. I read some of the other reviews and if you are in great shape and very coordinated, you probably need something more advanced but if you are excercising because you have to and need to but dreading the insanity that comes with some videos, give it a try! It worked, I noticed differences and I didn't fall over or knock anything down and was able to keep up with the entire video which is rare for a clutz like me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cardio portion is AWEFUL!","review":"The pilates portion is pretty good - keeps your heart rate up, continuous movement.

I give it 2 stars because I think it could be a good workout for someone who is just beginning an exercise routine. Pilates portion is decent but short and the cardio tests your sanity, not your body, it is so boring.

My abs are flatter than used to be. I love this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE DVD, what a joke!! (ZERO STARS)","review":"Let me start by saying I have NEVER written a reveiw on amazon. I dont usually take the time to do it. HOWEVER, after just completing this so called \\"workout\\" I feel compelled to do so. I dont know how they can call his a cardio work out. My heart rate never got up. The Pilates portion of the DVD is just like any other pilates I have done, nothing special. The cardio is a COMPLETE JOKE!! She has you doing the same 4 moves for the entire 20 minutes of the supposed cardio work out. I have never seen something so ridiculous!! DO NOT BUY this DVD!! I purchased this at target and I am hoping to be able to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"When I first bought the DVD I was so excited, I thought this was going to be a fusion of Pilates and Cardio. I was dissapointed however when I watched it, as there was only a 20 something minute basic pilates rutine, then a 20 something very repetitive cardio section.I have done the Winsor Pilates DVDs and I didn't find this one too challenging, there weren't enough repetitions for me to feel the burn. The cardio section did get me sweating, but it was so repetative.I definitely bought this DVD hoping for a full pilates rutine, so I was a bit dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Pilates, BORING cardio","review":"I was pretty excited about the promised combination, but the cardio portion could not be duller. The movements are repetitive and dead simple (dull) and not even synchronized to the inappropriate music. I wish someone would get this right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably dull","review":"As the previous reviewer said, the Pilates half was ok, although I've done a number of much better workouts. The cardio portion was beyond repetitive.Pilates: she did not offer any modification suggestions for people who might have a disability or physical limitation, and some of those exercises are not good without the modifications unless your lower back is already toned & strongCardio: consisted of a whopping 6 moves that lasted an eternal 25 minutes or so. March, hamstring back kicks, reach side, reach over, repeat. Endlessly. She added in a lunge move eventually, and some side punches, but that was it. Also, this may not bother some people, but she was not moving in rhythm with the background music, which I found highly annoying.Stretching/cooldown at end totally insufficient - very little done for the lower body, which was the focus of most of the workout.If you want Pilates videos, I would recommend anything by Ellen Barrett (love the Pick Your Level: Weight Loss Pilates)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pilates segment okay; cardio segment truly lame!","review":"The basic pilates mat exercises are performed, which are okay; however, the cardio segment of this video is truly lame! The instructor runs the viewer through marching, marching and stretching one's arm at the same time and, finally, marching and kicking back one's leg. That's it. How incredibly dull! What's worse, the instructor has a terribly artificial clenched-tooth smile plastered to her face for the duration. \\"Pilates for Dummies\\" is a far better instructional video for newcomers to the world of pilates (do a series of jumping jacks or go for a run afterwards to get in your cardio). I wouldn't waste your time w/ this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Orb - 'Orbus Terrarum' (Island)","review":"Not sure what to make of this UK ensemble.Imagine,if you can that Pink Floyd,in their early days AS a dance band.Sort of far fetched,huh?I was a bit caught off guard when I heard the tracks \\"Valley\\" and \\"Oxbow Lakes\\".Much of The Orb's material may be to long for some listeners.'Orbus...' would definitely be ideal to play at the next rave party that you might attend.Another top rate electronic release.I saw The Orb out on tour awhile back and BELIEVE me,their live shows are something to experience.Should appeal to fans of Aphex Twin,The KLF,Tuu and Meat Beat Manifesto."},{"rating":"2","title":"well worth the effort","review":"This is not a cd that will grab you immediately. It will not hit you over the head, it has no hit singles, hardly any beats ( at least no \\"dance\\" beats that people might expect ) , no obvious song structures and it is unlike anything the Orb have done. Having said all that, I will say that it is well worth spending some time to get to know this album. It is deeply layered and very atmospheric. Subtle touches of found sounds are scattered throughout. It rather reminds me of some of Brian Eno's more esoteric ambient works."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Orb album","review":"IMHO is this the Orbs best work. There is never a letdown. When I listen to it I never even dream of skipping tracks. It is defentetly an album that grows on you. When I first heard it I didn't think that much of it, but it really rewards repeated listening.There is no standout track, although I've always had a weak spot for Plateau, Occidental and Slug Dub. Unlike earlier Orb releases, this one is not meant to chill but to thrill."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the end of The Orb","review":"The Orb did some great remix work in the early-'90s and had a few very nice ambient house albums. But in my opinion they soon started to fade and had no idea what to do next. This album, along with \\"Pomme Fritz\\", doesn't get the job done. There's not a single decent track on this album! Except for the piano intro to \\"Oxbow lakes\\", there are no hooks or melodies, just a wobbly and dissonant goulash of sound. Obviously this album was made in a very sorry state of mind, because it's unbelievable how chaotically produced and mixed it is. You could call this \\"experimental\\", but I think this is nothing but poor und uninspired noise. I recommend you to check out some of the Orb's earlier ventures, but this album is palatable for hardcore fans and masochists only."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is terrible...","review":"I bought this album based on a recommendation from a friend. It is unlistenable.I dont understand the 5 stars given for the album. What have these people heard? All I heard are monotonous background noises you hear from some TV commercial (i.e. the Dodge truck commercial where each truck is picking up sands from an hourglass - check it out). In some tracks you'll hear voices, not singing but conversing.It seems that there must be some sort of hidden subliminal message. Maybe a few beers might help me hear any. I could have given it ZERO star but Amazon requires a minimum of 1.If you are buying this album looking for a beat go look elsewhere like Juno Reactor or TCM. This one will definitely be traded as a used CD in a local music store nearby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful CD, \\"Acid House\\" Fans Need Not Apply","review":"I love all music which induces dreamstates: Ravi Shankar,Psychic TV, Material/Laswell, etc. This album stands out above allthe rest in its ability to remove me from me seat and plop me down right in the heart of the Garden of Eden.

Oh, and this album may only be 7 tracks long but it runs 79 minutes, the longest CD I own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transcendental","review":"Though not considered by most as their best work, I personally feel this is the strongest release Orb has put out to date. Though no one song stands out (i.e. Little Fluffy CLouds on Adventures Beyond...) the whole album is one long ride through the ambient soundscapes that only the Orb can provide. Whereas Adventures Beyond The Ultraworld has a spacy theme, and UFOrb leans toward the aquatic, Orbus Terrarum has a magnificent earthy-tribal feel to it.

You can't expect too much from a 3\\" woofer, even two of them in each speaker, and the system lacks warmth in the midrange even with the sub crossover set at 120hz or higher.

I know that Wearever has the same sautee pan included in this set that has non stick coating. It is being sold on Amazon here separately. The sautee pan is a nice size, other than food tends to stick when you use this for frying.Other than that, perfect for the price.

Most of the video is wasted with two older women describing exercises that anyone can do by just observing.I assumed the video would have a quick 2-3 minute demo at the beginning, then 30 minutes or so of weight training accompanied by an instructor's verbal commands with appropriate music as I do in my body-sculpting class. Instead these women and their chatter are featured throughout the video. It's as if the purpose of the video is to showcase these women instead of weight training.Do not buy this video if you are looking for a good strength traininng video.

I've learned to not follow their rhythm, but do my own and it has worked out fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"talk too much","review":"I was looking for a good basic strength training video that does not have fit 20-somethings hopping around. This one fits that bill but falls short of what I wanted. It is a very simple routine that is made extra long by too much talking between the instructors. Instruction is fine, but they go overboard.

I found it to be poorly written and some chapters were rather ambiguous and confusing.The first few chapters were good but the book steadily went downhill from there. Theodore Roosevelt was such a lively, exciting character and Blum's book did not bring out any of that excitement. I found the book informative but very boring and dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Quiet Power of Love","review":"I'm glad I didn't read the reviews of this film before I saw it, as I don't appreciate to have the entire plot of a movie revealed (reviewers, please, no more spoilers!). Fortunately, I obtained a copy of this film from Amazon[.com] before it became unavailable. I love Faulkner, and this adaptation of one of his short stories is both profound and simple at the same time. Stellar performances by all, including the director, in creating such a moving testament to love and loss which defines us as living human beings. A true treasure of filmmaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faulkner and Duvall, how can you go wrong?","review":"I saw this movie years ago, and loved it. Sensative and gentle, it draws you in with two wonderful characters. No action, just GREAT acting and a deeply sorrowful tale of simple people. If you like Duvall, you have to see it.

It is a tale of a humble and good man who loses the two greatest loves of his life-his wife and child. The bleakness of the ending likely kept the film from being more popular. However, it should be seen by every serious movie fan just for the performance of Robert Duvall. This great actor has never given a better performance. It left me awestruck in its simplicity and believability."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I spent this much money on this.","review":"I should have paid more attention to K. Williams' review. We disagree on one point, though. Williams thinks the movie is too long. I think that any length would be too long.Yes, the acting is excellent, but in order to create a good movie you absolutely must start with a good script. This one just drags on and on. I stayed with the movie all the way to the end, thinking that, with all the 5-star reviews, there must eventually be something to this boring story. Wrong!I rarely give a bad review (see my others), mostly because I don't usually err when I buy something.

This however was a great disappointment. I don't understand how such good actors could collectively turn in such a poor performance. I saw no passion whatsoever. This is a testament to the idea that just having a great cast does not make for a great movie. There was absolutely no chemistry between any of the actors. I hate to place all the blame on the cast but in my very humble opinion that is exactly where the failure of this movie to entertain rests, square on the shoulders of the actors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Grit","review":"This is the worst remake I have ever seen.

I'm not used to the whole western theme, but this was easier to \\"get used to\\". Acting was good, story was good, and it was an overall good film. I didn't think it was anything jaw dropping, or something that amazing, though. Like many reviewers, Jeff Bridges was hard to understand, he kind of sounded like: \\"well watcha midegy uilik-reaolin-ewkavn geths dem bastards\\", but if you tried, you could understand 99% of what he says. I thought Hailee Steinfeld did a good job playing the revenge minded, book smart Mattie, some people didn't like her acting, but I thought she was great. Matt Damon was good, but I felt he was somewhat out of place; going from Bourne to a Texas Ranger was, in a sense, a big jump in roles.

Could not understand most of his slurred dialog. His performance seemed flat and uninspired.Just not as great a movie as it was advertised to be. Sorry but i gave it one star and would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO STARS","review":"This movie was bad.Really bad. Attack of the Killer Tomatoes bad.

And I am sorry to report this was a huge disappointment the cast seemed as though they were sleeping through the entire film it was boring boring boring. My suggestion is to skip this pitiful remake and stick with the original it had more life! I would have given Zero stars if possible, what a shame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"True Grit - the Remake","review":"I haven't figured out what people see in this remake of the original John Wayne classic movie. Oh, sure, the picture has higher resolution and the colors are better but I found Jeff Bridges was a poor replacement for J.W. The movie also deviated from the original in quite a number of scenes, making this newer version, although overall moderately accurate, much less interesting than the original. If you haven't seen the original J.W. version then the latest release may get you by if you like Westerns but only one or two actors in this version are doing characters in an acceptable manner and most of them are not any of the main characters. Mostly, I found this a waste of a couple of hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT WASN'T THAT......","review":"Well yes it was that BAD. All i have to say is that Jeff Bridges who plays as the marshal, is that i couldn't understand a damn word he was saying. I can not stand a movie where the main actor mumbles soo much it makes the movie unbearble to watch. This movie would make JOHN WAYNE roll over in his grave. Plus the DVD version of this movie has a bad glicth in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"my dear wife hated certain elements . . .","review":"My dear wife asked if we could rate this at the lowest possible level due to certain elements which we both found unacceptably distasteful (religious profanity)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Movie Worth Watching Once... Maybe even Twice.","review":"I am definitely not a fan of Westerns but this movie was done well. Kind of cheesy at the end, but good nonetheless.

Liked John Wayne better than Jeff Bridges, but I did like Matt Damon better than Glenn Campbell and the young girl in the remake better than Kim Darby. Overall, I feel the original was much, much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, TRUE GRIT done as it should have been to begin with","review":"The original 1969 movie was just another John Wayne movie about John Wayne and a complete literal misinterpretation of Rooster Cogburn. It was deliberate to allow John Wayne to play the part that fit his limited ability but ever-popular presence (guaranteed audiences).This interpretation was written to bring to screen as close to the literary source as possible and that it does. The Coen brothers yet again create a fantastic re-imaging of the book.Definitely a worth watch film and the actors a perfectly selected for their roles and each of them bring respect to each character as portrayed in the book.4 stars and well worth it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie All Around","review":"Great performances in this beautifully produced re-do. I'm not a particular fan of westerns but this movie was one I loved. There's humor, suspense and great dialogue. I had fond memories of seeing the John Wayne film as a child, but viewing it with more critical adult eyes, it's schlocky and whitewashed.This film takes a more profound approach to dialogue, period and regional characterizations that resonate feeling with impact."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Should Be A Classic","review":"If you like the good old west genre with plenty of action, you'll love this.The characters are believable, the scenery and horses are gorgeous!I will watch it many times, over the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"a movie should look great","review":"this does.

I was continually disapointed, however, to find small editing cuts which remained in the movie theater version, but for some unexplained reason are cut out of the DVD. Im hoping a future \\"Director's Cut\\" might make more of the original available, but why they screwed up a winning version to make what they did remains a mystery to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!!","review":"A must see if you are any kind of western fan. A great push back to all of the crud output these days that thinks it takes major gore, sex, horrid language, and CGI to sell tickets. I watched this movie in the theater three times and it was enjoyable each time. In a time where I don't buy many movies due to Netflix, OnDemand, and RedBox.... I will buy this movie purely to support the industry for outputting something of this quality.Watch it in any fashion....... and enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bridges' True Grit Truer to the Book","review":"The new release of True Grit obviously has been compared to John Wayne's great movie. While Wayne's movie followed the book and used much of the dialogue from it, the new version does a better job of telling the story as presented in the book and conveying the story's true spirit. Gone is the humor of the original designed to lighten the darkness of the story. Mattie is the storyteller in the book and she is the main character in the new movie instead of Rooster Cogburn. Bridges' portrayal of Cogburn emphasizes the lawman's cynicism and hardness. Mattie is hard as nails and sees the world in black and white, while Cogburn sees shades of grey, often tending toward the darker shades.While Wayne's version will always be a favorite of mine, this version is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of money and film!!!","review":"Why they made this film I'll never know. The original John Wayne film was excellent in all regards excepting perhaps Glen Campbell's acting. The rest of the cast and their delivery in the old film were amazing. This new film is completely lifeless. I like Jeff Bridges in most things but this was likely his worst performance ever. The rest of the film just further demonstrated that it was a combined accomplishment of extremely poor performances from some really fine actors.The script was absolutely horrible and since it was a remake, it drug on as a continued example of what the film wasn't rather than what it was.In my view, even for a remake, which are generally spotty to begin with, this film was a total failure in all regards. Avoid it at all cost, especially the cost you would spend on Amazon buying the disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Western In Years","review":"No stars for this terrible remake of a classic. Jeff Bridges sounds like he has mush in his mouth along with several other characters. Is this the best Hollywood can come up with? Even the music was bad. Don't waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excrutiating","review":"This film did not live up to the hype at all. It doesn't deserve the acclaim it's received, for some of the same reasons that someone else has already laid out.1. Boring as hell. Talk, talk, talk, dragged out scenes, this is just DULL.2. The lead, Hailee Steinfeld, got on my nerves in the first five to ten minutes. Her ridiculously proper speech and bratty demeanor are so grating that anytime she was in a wee spot of danger, I was actually hoping something so un-Hollywood would happen and she would bite the dust. No such luck.3. The Coens just dragged it out too long. I'm a big fan of their work, but not this turkey. Their storytelling on this one is so scattered. I couldn't wait for it to end.An annoying lead, an incomprehensible, overbearing Jeff Bridges, and a long, boring story, what could be worse?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"I wasn't impressed with the actors, acting or script. True Grit / Rooster Cogburn is John Wayne and will always be John Wayne. As to the Coen Brothers ... I have yet to find a movie they made that I liked. They are way overrated. As a film buff with thousands in my collection, this definitely wont' be one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"As bad as it gets!","review":"An absolutely pretentious western; indeed, a terrible movie. Rooster Cogburn's exaggerated \\"harelip\\" speech pattern were appalling and tedious. Couple that with a \\"2011-ish\\" smart alec, know-it-all teen, Ross, and you have the makings of a blunderous film. Surprised that she isn't trying to intimidate Rooster with her supreme texting\\" skills as she plods along on her nag. What anybody sees in this movie is beyond me. A waste of time and money. True Grit is True Sh#* !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Matt Damon Failure","review":"My goodness, I would have thought something better with the story, but Damon is just one horrible actor and ruins everything he's in, there has only been two good shows with him: Bourne and Good Will Hunting, and the stories saved him.When will he be ran out of town? His attempt at an accent it laughable. Any producer should refuse to have him on the bill.The movie itself is very slow, and not very well put together. Better than some of the hold \\"Westerns\\" but still not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"true grit","review":"very disappointed as I was unable to view the product. The DVD is Zone 1 (USA only) while I am in Zone 4 (Australia) There was no information regarding zoning at the time of purchase. All in all, very disappointing and, to me, a complete waste of money.

Having said that, this is the first time I have had any problem with any of my numerous purchases from Amazon.Regards"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland and Lifeless","review":"For those who have read the book and seen the original, this is a large disappointment. The personalities of every character have been washed out to no more than line readers in western clothing. There is no emotion or ownership in the actor's performance which led to having no connection to the film by me. It is a shame that so many parts of the story were removed or glossed over so quickly that there is little or no time to relate to the characters. It is a shame that the director of this film pushed good actors to remove any personality from their acting and deliver each word as if they were monotone computers. Not worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"What a load of nonsensical crap! The film did not flow, the story line was.....well......non-existant, acting was strained.

(The movie itself is great.) This is a very misleading product description: the implication was for me and I'm sure others that the movie was Blu Ray [hi-def]. But really what's supplied is an ordinary DVD of the movie plus a Blu Ray of all the filler junk that we don't care about. The movie itself is NOT blu ray. Shame on you Amazon for such a tricky product description.Added 6-29-11:Feedback from my original review convinced me to open the package. Inside there is in fact a disc labeled \\"Blu Ray Feature Film + Special Features\\".

I thought it was a yawner, very slow moving, boring... I had to turn it off... several times.

Waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"If you like westerns, you will love True Grit. I am not a John Wayne fan, more of a Clint Eastwood kind of guy, but this is a far better movie than the 1969 original. This is up there with the best westerns ever made, such as Unforgiven, Good the Bad and the Ugly, and Once upon a time in the west. The music is amazing, the acting and dialogue are some of the best I have ever seen. Just amazing. The video quality on the bluray is also amazing. Very crisp visuals and details to the fabric in Rooster's overcoat are pristine. The audio is also crisp and bombastic. With great LFE effects, and the gun shots are the most realistic that I have heard. You will not regret watching this movie. If you like westerns, you cannot go wrong.

Besides some good film work, pictures, and a handful of decent sarcastic jokes this move was bad. AND I LIKE BAD MOVIES! But this one stunk. And I am not exaggerating. The reason I said \\"dont do it Men\\" bc my wife came back from work saying her young (20's) female coworker was pulled in by the terrible 14 year old girl who goes on the trail with Jeff Bridges character. She thought it was fun... What would have been fun is if i would have counted the number of times during the movie I was wishing for the power to go out and not feel obliged to finish watching this movie. yes Hollywood publicized the crap out of this movie...But they lied to us again.

We watched the movie the other night and I must say I am pretty disappointed. With all the advertising and buzz around this movie, I figured it had to be good, and since my Dad loves John Wayne, I also figured he'd enjoy this. The movie just never really goes anywhere.

I enjoy the new Hawaii Five-0 every week even though I own the first 10 seasons of the original. But this remake is very disappointing. It moves very slowly and is more dialogue than action. I like Jeff Bridges but all he does in this movie is mumble and he is a disaster as Cogburn. It's very hard to understand what he is saying. Also, he doesn't get the same laughs as John Wayne did saying the same lines. I didn't think the young actress was that great either. She was good, but not as fantastic as critics made it sound like. If this movie is closer to the book, then I never want to read the book. It was boring, slow and very disappointing. Too bad because it was full of good actors. I say rent and don't buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Good Price for a fantastic movie.

If you exercise creative liberty in the remake, the other group is indignant.Well here you have the boring. The original was actually much better and more intense.

What makes this version work well is its acting, as a young Hailee Steinfeld pretty much steals the show with her very talented acting. This up-and-coming actress plays a smart, tough, assertive, persuasive and determined young girl who's out to bring justice to her father's killer. Jeff Bridges is also excellent in this film, and brings a realness to his character. This film is ideal for those who like a western once in a while (as I do), and like to take in the whole atmosphere of galloping horses, gunshots, tough guys, etc. I recommend this movie. 8/10"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a good movie to see","review":"After reading about the differences between this version and the 1969 one I was pleased to see a great film in its own right.

Just the fact that you're reading a review on this movie, shows me that you would probably like it. It's worth getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some remakes do work","review":"Yes there are some remakes that do work and the Coen Brother's True Grit is one of them. John Wayne may always be the definitive Rooster Cogburn to most people, but Jeff Bridges has turned in an Oscar nominated performance that does nothing but compliment and enhance the character. I am so glad that they followed the book more faithfully, rather than just simply remake the original film. The supporting cast is also excellent and in my opinion, with the except of Robert Duvall as Lucky Ned Pepper (in the 1969 film), even better than that of the original movie. Kim Darby was really too old to play the 14 year old Mattie Ross and Glen Campbell was never much of an actor. Matt Damon is a vast improvement as LeBeouf and certainly Josh Brolin proves a much more menacing Tom Chaney than Jeff Corey was. I can't wait for this DVD. I hope it is full of extras."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen.","review":"Without wanting to give away any of the storyline, I must say that this was by far the worst movie I have ever seen.

I wasn't sure what to expect from the movie ,because burn after reading was so terrible( in my opinion). And no country for old men was well written, but the ending left me angry. This film plays like a spaghetti/western/comedy believe it or not. Jeff Bridges doesn't even try to be John Wayne, instead he plays the part like a skilled comedian ,but treads softly enough with the jokes so as not to become cartoonish. All throughout the movie, they play differant versions of leaning on the everlasting arms.Which is a interesting foil to the violent story unfolding on screen. The only complaint I have is Matt Damon, who I usually like is very annoying, and I kept wishing his character would die already.I smell an oscar nomination or two for Bridges or the very BRILLIANT young Ms. Steinfeld,(Mattie Ross) I think is she plays her cards right,she could end up in the ranks of Meryl Streep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Colossally Disappointing","review":"Despite its superb cast, True Grit hangs on the screen for an hour and fifty-one minutes as dry and lifeless as baccala.

It gets one star for Jeff Bridges, try as he may his character lacks development and is chalked full of stereo types which are just silly; not very a sympathetic portrayal either. A second star for the set, they made a concerted effort to recreate the old west; perhaps to distract from the lousy direction, cinematography, and hasty flow of the scenes. So much potential with this cast of actors but I got the sense early on that I was being shuffled forward in order to just get to the end. And the ending, pffft; with little sentiment as though there was no meaning to any of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"In one word: boring.","review":"Confusing and not as great as people make it out to be, but to each their own.

I wasted my money buying this copy Took too many liberties in modifying the script."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even A Second Look Didn't Help","review":"I also really wanted to like this re-make of \\"True Grit,\\" but even a second viewing couldn't help. This version - starring Jeff Bridges - is vastly inferior to the 1969 version even if - as remarked - it is truer to the novel (hey, sometimes a novel is simply not as good as its screenplay). The Bridge's version suffers from actors who are trying too hard not to repeat dialogue in the same manner as in the classic John Wayne version and, as a result, either mumble or fumble the film's most classic lines. The acting is stilted and some of the players are clearly miscast, such as Matt Damen as La Boeuf (amazingly even non-actor Glen Campbell gave a more credible performace in the eariler version).In sum, highly recommend letting this one go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Movie","review":"It is a real great movie.

I only remember \\"Open Range\\" and \\"Last Man Standing\\" being the only two westerns I like. Just got done watching this version of \\"True Grit\\" (never seen the original) and I was surprised how much I like this movie. Throughout, I was totally engaged by Jeff Bridges' role as the character Rooster. Equally engaging were the other two main characters--one played by Matt Damon and the other character of the little girl (don't know the actor's name). The story was riveting and funny. The pacing of the movie was great also. There wasn't a moment during the movie where I felt \\"bored\\". The ending had me very emotional; one of the best endings in a movie I've seen. Music and cinematography was superb.

It didn't make me feel as if I were part of the times which is one of the intent of the writer.With that being said the movie felt forced.

I saw an article recently titled \\"The Greatest Book You've Never Read\\", the fact that the novel was made into a movie so quickly overshadowed it, but it too is a classic. What many reviewers comment on as 'mistakes' by the Coen brothers, are in fact them staying true to the novel. Powerfully in the decision to use narrative the opening scene (as it is in the book). The courtroom scene is lost in the original, it has no real purpose - here it gives us a powerful sense of the time; dark brooding men, dressed in black in a shadowy courtroom.

We don't understand. Jeff Bridge was TERRIBLE! He was a slurring, mumbling, unintelligble grade C actor in this movie and Matt Damon (whom i love) was not much better. Hailee Steinfled was the only shining light in the whole movie but she couldn't save it from crumbling around her. In general I love the Coen brothers' movies so I was truly expecting to add this to my list of favorites. I'm glad I held out til the last 5 minutes because that was the best part. If the rest of the movie could have had that tone I would have not been tempted to turn it off 50 times over. I can appreciate the original for what it was but it's not my favorite genre. I was looking forward to a nice rendition of it with this movie. Instead I am severely disappointed and sorry i spent the money and time to watch it.

The process had already begun with their previous effort (\\"know by heart\\", also an excellent album) and is brought even further on this release, their latest.Even if the sound retains AAS' trademark elements (for example the breathy vocals everyone familiar with the band we'll recognize...) the album is more varied, drawing at times from rock and even funk!.

Then again, to label the band as any of the above would only be jeopardizing, as well as inaccurate. Instead, Fischerspooner recalls a brand of synth-pop not heard in years, reinterpreting some of its finest moments as heard in bands such as Wire, Kraftwerk, Can, etc. Not since Orchestral Manouevres in the Dark's debut album in 1980 has electronic music sounded so sensual and mesmerizing as does with this startling release of Fischerspooner's \\"#1.\\" Sounding a bit like OMD's \\"electricity,\\" \\"the 15th,\\" ironically, was written by Wire's Colin Newman. Though \\"Turn On\\" sounds a bit too much like the latest dance-craze, this album, like the many releases out there, never makes the mistake of repeating itself.

There are really only a few tracks here that you will want to listen to again. I'm guessing that the one catchy track(Emerge) on the entire album was good enough for reviewers to say how great this album is when in reality it's overall quite bland. There are a few other tracks that are ok but the majority are a drag to listen to and once the novelty of Emerge wore off I didn't have any interest whatsoever in listening to this album.I strongly advise anyone who isn't sure about buying this album to resist the hype and look for something else. It really isn't that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eyes on the Future; Feet Stuck in 1984","review":"With their debut CD #1, New York's Fischerspooner keep one eye on the future of electronica while their dancing feet are firmly planted in 1984. Warren Fischer and Casey Spooner have taken care of all of the visuals - their video for the club hit \\"Emerge\\" is a hoot - but the music is often wan and predictable. There are only two actual songs here - the aforementioned \\"Emerge\\", which is the best one-hit wonder to come down the pike since Frankie said \\"Relax\\"!, and \\"The 15th\\", which is a superfluous remake of a superior Wire track. The remixes at the end of the disc are great, because they boil Fischerspooner down to beat and blips and place them firmly in clubland where they may not belong but will most certainly end up. The pretenses to performance art are just that: pretenses. Stick them in a room with Laurie Anderson or Karen Finley and, chances are, they won't have the chops of Anderson or the conceptual courage of Finley."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn","review":"This CD [stinks]! Okay, the Wire cover is good and they're probably cool to see live.

It was a drag show without the great makeup nor the humor. In fact it was overall a disappointment. I feel that maybe they claim great shows to hide the fact that they could never play the music live if it is in fact even them who recorded the music. So not only do they provide an average cd but less than average show! Get with the program FS and get over yourselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Junk","review":"Take Sigue Sigue Sputnik and combine with Visage with a dice of parody and a fashion show and you get the music of FischerSpooner...People cannot be serious claiming this has artistic merit, however, it's so left field that it might just shake the status quo of techno music out there so that the rhytum devine left over from the disco era (house music and the various strains thereof with the same drum beat over and over again) might crack under the pressure over this mega-hyped album and group.Yet, I cannot wait to go to a performance to see the spectacle.

That's why this album deserves two stars thenstead of just one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Say I'm Impressed.","review":"After going to one of their concerts at the House of Blues in Anaheim, CA, I gotta say I'm not impressed with this group. What they lack in talent, they do not make up in novelty. All their songs lack melodies and tunes. I found myself unable to tell the difference between song #1 , song #2 or song # 15. They all sounded remarkably similar and monotonous to me. I fear you must have to have very unique preferences to have an affinity for this group, because I highly doubt the average listener will find themselves dancing or singing along to any of their so-called music. There's a difference between diverging from mainstream music, and just producing noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!","review":"This was a gift for my 13 month old daughter. From the very beginning I was having problems with it recognizing the books and turning of the pages. The on/off button is the only light and that was distracting to my little girl. She kept turning the toy on and off. I'd hear the song begin to start and then Bye! Bye! over and over. Had to press very hard with the little bee to make it respond. If I had a hard time pushing down with the bee then it was impossible for my little one to get it to work. It's a waste of money and space because it's so big.

VTech was responsive when I called and stated the toy wouldn't recognize the ABC book. Since I had just purchased it- they are replaceing it free with free shipping. Would I buy it again- NO!! Return it as VTech offered- No, as the books are educational/durable and we can use them without the carrier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe when my son gets older!","review":"My son received this toy as a birthday gift. It seemed like a great gift but it's not all that great for a child that is facinated with flashing lights. The problem is the on/off button is a flashing light that plays a song. Of course my son is intrigued by this and is constantly shutting the thing on and off so he can see the light and hear the song instead of actually playing with the toy. My husband tried to cover the light with a piece of card board and tape, but by that time my son still knew where to push in order to hear the song. Maybe he'll be able to really get to use it as a learning toy when he gets older. Now its just music machine for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool Concept, Useless Design","review":"Don't waste you money. There is NO WAY a two-year old can get this toy to work.

She always asked to play with it, but I had to tell her it was broken b/c the thing never worked! Who gave this thing 5 Stars?! So many things are wrong: The only time it works is when you ARE NOT using the books! Pressing the numbers w/o the books works fine, but the \\"magic bee\\" doesnt identify anything on the books! You have to put some muscle into it when you are using the bee, if not, the computer will tell you that you picked the wrong answer. The \\"magic bee\\" string is too short. I'm surprised she didnt break it when she got frustrated that it wouldn't reach to the far side of the book!

As it is, it's VERY difficult to inflate the tire because the valve is hard to get to. Then, the tube just split wide open (it seemed pretty dry and crackly) within a couple months of use. Now, am I supposed to go buy a replacement tube for this little tire? What a drag. Even getting the tube out to see how bad the hole in it was: a big pain! - not nearly as easy as changing the tube in a bike tire. I would not recommend this version of this cart to anyone, I would get one that does not have a tube and tire system that needs to be filled with air and replaced. - Oh, and part of the plastic on one side of the assembly that holds the tire broke within days. It still worked, so I was able to use it anyway, but just another drag..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great yard cart!","review":"I like the design of this cart, especially that it takes up very little room when not in use.

But this book gave me several good chuckles as well as a decent brain-teaser.In understanding the detective, it helps to do a little research on the real-life Prince of Wales (Wikipedia will do). The scene between Bertie and his mother (Queen Victoria) was especially enhanced by knowing that in real life, Victoria did consider her eldest son pretty much of a wastrel. And apparently the descriptions of his marriage to Alex (fond, if not faithful) and his extracurricular activities (romantic and otherwise) are fairly close to the truth.The mystery itself was diverting, and I didn't figure it out (although I did anticipate the main twist).One note: The review titled \\"Great Victorian Mystery Novel\\" must actually be a review of some other book, because the plot is nothing like what the reviewer describes."},{"rating":"1","title":"like red on a rose by Alan Jackson","review":"This had to be the most depressing, slow singing cd I've ever heard by Alan Jackson.

His music always seemed overly refined to fit the pop-country charts. Top40 \\"Country\\" ain't my bag.This album surpases typical Nashville dreck and if that's what you need, skip it. Otherwise simply listen to the samples and make up your own mind.For the haters out there who seem to claim \\"ownership\\" of Alan Jackson's sound I quote the classic OC punk outfit \\"Agent Orange\\":\\"The public gets what they deserve not what they demandUnless we all decide to be a business not a band\\"I applaud Alan Jackson for making this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This CD sucks.

But there is another version of that song,that he originally released on his 1998 album,\\"High Mileage\\",that sounds so much better than this version on here. I don't know why he even felt that he had to re-record it. The \\"High Mileage\\" version is so much better and actually sounds like country. As for the rest of this album...it doesn't even deserve a 1,but a HUGE FAT ZERO! Overall,if you're a big Alan Jackson fan like me,then don't be expecting that great country sound from this crappy CD.

The soulful sound of Alan's was a little too soft. Most of the songs sounded almost the same. I am so dissappointed in this one. He is the only true country singer, no bells and whistles, just Alan, which is the greatest. He as a person cannot be compared with anyone in Country Music.

Anything he put out I knew would be good, and I did not ever feel I had to hear the tracks before buying his CDs. But that's all changed with this release. Alan Jackson is an undeniable talent, and this CD is very well crafted. His voice is as strong as ever, but this is not a typical Alan Jackson CD. It is almost like an entirely new genre: a more sophisticated, adult contemporary sound with definite Country overtones--I don't know how to describe it, but the songs are not as fun as the tracks on previous records. In time, I might grow used to this and perhaps even come to like it, but for now, there is not really anything on this CD that I feel compelled to add to my playlist. He does not sound like he is having a good time singing these songs, and I am not having a good time listening. Perhaps he was aiming to create a CD to be appreciated far more than enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, boring, borning, boring","review":"I bought this CD because it was mentioned in passing by Derks Bently on a morning radio show. I was so excited! A new Alan Jackson album produced by Allison Krauss (two of my all time favorite country writers and artists). What more could I ask for? Perhaps one good song. How disappointing. I get the feeling this is an album that the music industry has forced Alan Jackson to make due to some contractural obligation.

I don't know what spirits were conjured up in the studio to create such a great album as \\"Different Class\\", but unfortunately,\\"Pulp\\" out did themselves.

Da movie is basically about a guy named Ashtre who goes back to da hood to live wit his dad who is only about 1 year or 2 years older and from there da crudeness begins.

If you don't like gang movies though I wouldn't suggest watching this, but I could be wrong. A brother named Ashtray learns is learning how to live in the hood from homeboys, he meets a black beauty, Dashikee, I don't know how to spell that but close enough. He wants to move out of the ghetto with her and start a new life, a new child but alot of things get in his way, mostly Toothpicks gang. There are so many funny parts in this film, I'd say the funniest are when Toothpick was at the party and was talking about being in the shower with men, the MC Hammer dream, the convient store incident and in the movies begining when the two guys get shot. I demand that you watch this film, but as I said only if your into this type of thing. Great movie! If you've seen Baby Boy then you might see some similarities."},{"rating":"2","title":"will have you laughing all night","review":"This is pure comedy for your azz! Brilliant and funny, it will have you laughing til you can't laugh anymore. Its a spoof of all the gangsta movies that came out in the early 90s like Boyz in the Hood, South Central, Poetic Justice, Menace II Society, etc. This takes a look at the comedic side of things just to make light of some of the more serious issues in the 'hood'Looking for a good laugh...check it out. The Wayans family always comes with the laughter. They are all talented."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just wasn't good in my opinion.","review":"Overall just wasn't a good film to me. I watched this years ago, but couldn't remember much about it. I didn't find the acting to be very believable at all by either Wayans brother. There was a laugh here and there, but not enough to cover up the bad acting and raunchiness of the film. Double dutch scene was probably the funniest.Lol I though it was almost like making fun or a mockery of the \\"hood\\" life though. Just not a fan of films like this. Depending on your taste in movies you could either find this very hilarious or just a total joke. I won't say that it is the worst, but I definitely won't be adding it to my dvd collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Parody on Hood films","review":"The Wayans have done it again. Keenan screaming \\"message\\" in certain parts of the film was too funny. A lot of what was spoofed will keep you laughing. There is this one scene that Marlon Wayans is in that will have you laughing so hard, you will have to pause the DVD so you can recover. I've seen this movie about 100 times, and STILL laugh at that one scene like I've seen it for the first time.It's a funny film indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absofrickinhilarious!","review":"Typical Marlons fare that will have you laughing yourself silly. This time they send up black cinema and gangsta films. Trey is back in the Hood and endures all the toils it has to offer. The funniest parts of the film belong to the old lady in the window from 227. Grandma was such a funny character. The asian liquor store owners, the drunk party girl and the possessed girl are also a trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"...","review":"this movie is EXREMELY funny. i have had to take people to the hospital after they laughed so hard at this movie. there is a small town in mississippi that has made this movie illegal to possess or sell because it is so funny. as i recall this movie recieved the nobel prize for ghetto-parody...."},{"rating":"2","title":"DON'T BE A MENACE","review":"DON'T BE A MENACE TO SOUTH CENTRAL WHILE DRINKING YOUR JUICE IN THE HOOD is a comic spoof on African-American movies such as \\"Boyz In The Hood,\\" \\"Poetic Justice,\\" \\"Higher Learning,\\" and many others. The movie was written by and stars Shawn Wayans and Marlon Wayans. The film is about a young man named Ashtray who is dropped off in the ghetto to live with his father and from there he gets into many crazy situations with his best friend Loc Dog. I'm tired of people who bash this movie, it's not a movie meant to be taken seriously, it's a movie that was made for pure entertainment. The Wayans Brothers have never really made a bad movie because they always manage to pack enough laughs to hold my attention into there films."},{"rating":"2","title":"this movie is the tighest movie ever","review":"man i dont know what that rachelle o' gorman is talking about, this movie is great, its funny, straight to the point, and a great spoofand im sure she would have enjoyed it too if she would have just relaxed a little bit.

I'll just call it DON'T BE A MENACE. This film is classic. It is a perfect example of the Wayans brothers at work, and is way better than SCARY MOVIE 1 & 2. It is completely slapstick with no lesson whatsoever except for that they have made enough films about the hood. No offense to those which have been made (BOYS 'N THE HOOD, MENACE II SOCIETY) which are good, but this film allows you to laugh at what you wouldn't dare, the harsh reality of living in the hood. This movie soughts out and executes every stereotypical aspect of hood movies. It even gets some of the actors from the films it mocks. I gave it 4 stars, because some it is kind of stupid, but I guess that with every comedy, you have to take the good with the bad. It's okay, because it isn't meant to be taken seriously either way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shawn and Marlon Wayans best of da best","review":"Dis movie is way better than any other movie they've been in.

All possible areas of interest, known and little known, are listed. The many area/city regional maps are very clean and helpful. The only thing to possibly change is the blow by blow listing of what highway to take where, when to turn right/left, etc. That tends to make the book drag. Overall, definitly worth purchasing if you want to get started in Burgundy or need a driving guide of who does what and where they do it. (If you do use this as a driving guide, don't bother getting a Michelin guide unless you are going outside the appelation.) Makes you want to drink a glass for every word printed."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read!","review":"I don't understand why this book is so inexpensive.

A good book, and the price makes it a steal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic read","review":"A Lafontaine classic.

I was disappointed and not all that impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is AWESOME!","review":"I am amazed at the versatility of this artist. She is a songwriter who writes and sings from her heart. Each song on this album is unique, and you are never bored, as with some albums where all the songs sound similar. I love the single,\\"I'm Not the Girl\\". It's what we'd all like to say to at least one person we know! I hope \\"Soak\\" becomes the next single. The beat puts me in a great mood! \\"So Good\\" is amazing and I just want to yell at that guy! \\"The End\\" makes me want to cry and \\"It's All You\\" cheers me on! All the songs are awesome! I can assure you that you will enjoy this album. So go buy it, YOU WILL BE GLAD YOU DID!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"Rachel Farris has one of the most annoying voices i've ever heard. She says in her \\"bio\\" that originally held out on a record deal because she felt producers were making her \\"bubblegum\\" and \\"fake.\\" She wants to be considered in the \\"ROCK\\" category.Rachel Farris should've held out longer because the only thing she accomplished was exactly what she was trying to avoid -\\"bubblegum\\" AND \\"fake.\\"She does not compare to a Michelle Branch because Michelle can actually play guitar and has a better voice (not annoying). I don't think Michelle Branch has a big rock feel to her, but she comes far closer than Rachel Farris. Rachel is just a dark haired Britney Spears who often sounds \\"flat\\" on her demo which was annoyingly placed on my movie theatre cup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"First off, most of her songs are so repetitive that they get really annoying and irritating to listen to. The first 3 songs are somewhat more rock, but after that most of them just sound like mandy moore songs with a guitar. The lyrics aren't that great either, just the typical pop stuff going around now. One song - beautiful - even sounds like a brittany spears song. The only thing I can say about this album is that the songs, just like most songs on the radio now, get stuck in your head quite easily. Don't waste your money; go buy Brand New's album - Deja Entendu, or Michelle Branch's Hotel Paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"damn, not another teenie bopper!","review":"rachel farris's debut album soak is eaisly the worst album of the year. much like hilary duff, rachel uses \\"heavy metal\\" gitars and instramentals in a attempt to be edgy.and again like hilary duff her bublegum pop voice confuses the sound. her lyrics go no where when she is \\"deep\\" and when her innuendos and abscrities rest the songs are pointless.i am not going to further furnish your imaganation with my opinion, i will however save you the troubleDO NOT BY THE ALBUM OR SUPPORT RACHEL FARRIS IN ANYWAYif you as a listener have any integrity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great rock and roll","review":"A brief word just to say I found this record terrific.

The tape starts off with some of my all time favorites like \\"Disorder in the court\\", (1936), \\"Malice in the palace\\", (1949), \\"Sing a song of six pants\\", (1947), and \\"Brideless groom\\", (1947). But after that, it goes into early episodes with Ted Healy like \\"Beer and pretzles\\", (1933), \\"Nertsery rhymes\\" (which in my opinion is the worst of all, 1933), \\"Plane nuts\\", (1933), and later comes \\"The Big idea\\", (1934). These were all so musical. Nothing like the stooges would later be. Then, it gets better again, with some of Shemp's solo shorts. In my opinion, these are very good. They are: \\"Corn on the cop\\", (1933), \\"His first flame\\", (1933), and \\"Saltwater daffy\\", (1933). I didn't much care for \\"Roast beef and movies\\" either. It's so-so.

Anyone could easily see it was a copy for two reasons. First, the original book is thinner, because the quality of the paper is different. Second, the original book has a different cover.

I returned it immediately!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Growing fruit trees","review":"This book exceeded our expectations. We highly recommend it for anyone who wants to grow fruit for their own consumption. Other books we've tried to read were much too technical and always intended for commercial growers.

We loved it and feel confident we will now be able to better tend our 10 fruit trees."},{"rating":"2","title":"Technical","review":"I got this book looking for help with my sickly fruit trees. I wanted pictures of the diseases they could have and of the leaf shapes etc. I got more technical explainations and no pictures to help me figure out what was actually going on with my trees. It is a good book, but not for someone like me. I guess I was needing a book like \\"growning fruit trees for dummies\\". Over all very educational but not easy enough for the lay person to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly NOT a complete guide","review":"I have learned a few things (very few) from this book, but on the whole wish I had found a different book. Like many of these how-to-do it books that purport to be a compendium of everything there are chapters included with little valuable information. It's as though the editor said, \\"You've got to have a chapter on plums.\\", so the author includes one that has some general facts but no specific information that would make the reader either run out and buy plums enthusiastically or avoid them entirely. Obviously the author has no knowledge of figs, which are not included. Nut trees are also absent. So the subtitle misrepresents the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, no citrus tree information though","review":"Lots of good information, but I was disappointed that there is not any information about citrus trees."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good","review":"I got this from the library and was not very impressed.

It is very comprehensive. It is also very dry. I will definitely use as a reference over and over. Saying that I would really have appreciated a book with photos of examples of diseases and pests. Line drawings are pretty useless. There are also a lot of new varieties avavilable that are not listed in this book. I am guessing new ones become available every year. I would wish that some day someone will rewrite this book with photos of a bare root delivered tree, the hole, the planting, the tree after it is pruned back, first year, second year, etc. Now that would be worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Backyard Orchardist","review":"The beginning fruit grower will benefit from this book with some information for even the advanced grower."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read!","review":"I used to be sore and tired after a round of golf, but after reading this book and trying several of the techniques my energy level has increased and my body seems much more energized!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic vocal renditions of great songs","review":"A wonderful CD, well worth buying for the vocal arrangements of Miles' \\"Freddie Freeloader\\" and Monk's \\"Rhythm a ning\\" alone.

These were mainly the bouncy swing tunes like \\"Requestfully Yours.\\" The majority of songs had a sappy quality about them and insipid arrangements.

If your routine includes Pilates, power or Bikram yoga, and perhaps free weight exercises then this book is a complete waste of your money. I was expecting to see the deep stretches that ballet dancers do but this book is a commercial venture target to the general public. The \\"NYC Ballet\\" in the title is just to enhance the marketing appeal of the product. Do not be fooled by it. For example: I was very disappointed in discovering that the stretch pictured in the front cover is _never_ described, it is just an image they use in the cover and also in the introduction.

Instead what i received is a book that has the first 15 or so pages dedicated to the NYC Ballet -INCLUDING individual biographies, and then the exercises shown were basic stretches that anyone would know if they ever attended HS physical education.

In the meantime, I've been committed to regular weighttraining and maintaining my flexibility through yoga and calitsthenics. I evaluated my \\"old\\" cardio workouts and realized that constant, rigorous biking and running weren't great for MY body, so I danced because it came naturally for me. I found this book and was very motivated. The photography is beautiful, and the writing as straightfoward and fluid as the moves and exercises throughout. Now I enjoy a broader and more beneficial fitness schedule. Along with weights and regular lighter cardio exercise, the ballet workout elongates my muscles, so they're not only strong,but they're shapely, not bulky."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of filler, but a good workout nonetheless","review":"The first 66 pages are pictures of dancers and information about the New York City Ballet. The pages that include the actual workout have a lot of empty space and photos that don't pertain to the specific workout. If you are interested in ballet and dance photography, this is a nice bonus to a good workout.The workout itself is simple, but challenging. It is helpful to have had a ballet background, so you now how to do the moves without just flopping your limbs around. If you don't know how to use resistance and move your body in slow, controlled movements, this workout will be too easy and not effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I am enjoying reading this book.

So when I saw this book I ordered it in good faith for my young granddaughter. But the story is so inappropriate I'd be embarrassed to give it to anyone. The jist of the story is that PJ torments his sister, for example dumping smashed carrots on her head and hiding her favorite blanket. But when his parents make him stop, she misses him. Then, when he paints polka dots on her face while she is sleeping, mom affirms it's because he really does love her. Seriously? THAT is the message we want to teach our kids in this age of bullying? It's not even funny enough for cynical adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Funny Bunny","review":"Really sorry I read this book to my 5 year old. Honey Bunny's brother teases her incessantly - she finally gets upset and tells her parents - brother gets in trouble and now won't speak or play with Honey Bunny - Honey Bunny misses him teasing her and thinks that he doesn't love her anymore - brother paints her face again so mom says \\"He DOES love you.\\" What kind of lesson is this for our kids? I checked this book out for my daughter from the library, but felt so strongly about the horrible lesson that I had write a review. If the book had ended with the brother apologizing, I would be okay with it. But, to teach our kids that teasing means someone loves you? Wrong! I wish I could give it -5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This book and the others like it that have the Funnybunny characters in them are awesome! This is a special series shared between my husband and 4-year-old daughter. He even recorded them for her to listen to while he is away on business trips! They are funny, entertaining, educational, and yet so simple to enjoy. I hope more of them come back in print soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute story for kids with siblings","review":"My daughter absolutely loves this story. Contrary to a lot of bad reviews that this book has received- I do not believe that it, in any way, condones male on female violence. Anyone who has more than one child knows that at some point there will be some form of teasing. I think that the message this book is trying to convey is that even though your brother (or sister) teases you, he or she still loves you. I do not feel that PJ \\"shunned\\" his sister for tattling on him- I think he genuinely felt bad about teasing her. I know that my daughter is NOT going to develop low self esteem because she likes this story. If reading this story is going to cause your child to someday think that being abused is okay, then I think they have more serious problems that should be addressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honey Bunny Funnybunny","review":"These books about the Funnybunny family are a bright spot in my work as a Peace Corps volunteer in literacy. I love these stories and pass on my enthusiasm to my students. These books are \\"Loved to Death\\" in our library and are the reason that some of our students read at all. I'd love to tell the author this and to encourage her to write more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Memories","review":"I wish the serious reviewers of this book would get over themselves! My older brother teased me endlessly, but what else do older brothers do to their little sisters? I think this book merely sets the stage for opening dialog between older brothers and younger sisters about the differences between the sexes and about reconciliation. The adults reading the book to their youngsters can seize the opportunity to elaborate and teach! I honestly didn't think that the story ended where the book did and that the relationship between these two would change.Books are tools to learn things from and not everything has to be written in black and white. I loved the book and I'm even buying it for my older brother just for a gag gift on his birthday."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very questionable message for young children","review":"To excuse the bizarre and inappropriate storyline of this book as the product of deranged and PC minds is ridiculous. I actually read the stroy several times to my young son before I actually thought about what it was saying. Basically the young female only feels that her brother loves her if he mistreats her! The amount of abuse he seems to heap on her seems excessive and cruel. Even more so, in fact than painting her face. That she misses this attention seems disturbing to say the least.I have passed this book around to several adult acquaintances and simply asked them to take a look at it and most have had the same reaction.I also thought of writing to the publisher - but am contenting myself with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more Honey Bunny Funnybunny, please","review":"Although I do not often become too excited about the negative aspects of children's book, I feel the negatives in this one outweigh the positive.Little sister learns that the wrong kind of attention is better than no attention at all; that you can EITHER be abused or neglected. That having polka dots painted on your face (or maybe scratches or bruises) is some kinds of a sign of affection or love.Brother learns that withholding love makes you a winner and makes you so you never have to apologize.These \\"lessons\\" are shown everyday in our schoolyards where our kids are teased cruelly. We don't need books, let alone children's books, to show us this, to extol this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I really can't stand this book, would never buy it for any child, and would give it negative stars if I could. It gives an awful message, especially to young girls, that abusive behavior is a sign of love. I can't imagine why anyone would want to read this story to a child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teasing is not OK","review":"I bought this book packaged along with 2 other Dr. Suess books I wanted. When I read Honey Bunny Funnybunny to my 5 yr old daughter, I quickly decided we would not be keeping the book. Honey Bunny is teased unmercifully by her older brother. When she objects her parents intervene. They tell her brother to stop teasing her, but do not explain to her brother that there are better ways to show love, and that teasing is cruel and benefits no one. So brother withdraws his attention from Honey Bunny and she decides teasing is better than no attention at all. I feel this is a very bad message that teasing is OK. Teasing is not OK. Teasing is cruel. Perhaps a different sort of book would model for young boys how to really show love instead of reinforcing that they can just act mean instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give this zero stars, I would","review":"All of the other negative reviews do a good job of describing what is wrong with this book. The vaguely cute illustrations are not sufficient to outweigh its negative messages about teasing and how to respond to it. This does not live up to the Dr. Seuss imprint. It is true that one COULD use this book as a way to broach the subject of teasing, but it seems like there are better ways to do it. I warn any potential buyers to preview the book before giving it as a gift. We are throwing away our copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad hike recommendations","review":"Worst recommendation of a hike in any hiking book I've ever read. The book recommended a hike to Mt. Strachan in the Cypress ski area, on a trail that was terrible. Completely overgrown in places, unsigned in crucial places, blowdown to the point that you might as well have been bushwhacking, etc. We finally gave up and went up the ski area road, a much better option not mentioned in the book.Directions to the Garibaldi Lake trailhead were poor.I'm tossing this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Trail Maps and Directions","review":"Having relied on the Pacific Northwest Hiking Guides published by The Mountaineers, I found this book to be almost laughable. Wanting to explore more of western BC, this guide looked like a good choice. The book did point me in some good directions, and a couple of hikes I did were absolute gems. However, I found many of the hikes to be lacking in basic information such as good directions to the trailhead, some trailheads almost impossible to find, road conditions that should have been clearly marked as 4 wheel drive only yet gave no indication of that requirement, and trail maps that were more sketches than anything else. So use this book to give you good hiking suggestions, but then do your additional research by getting a good topo map and checking all road and trail conditions before you head out"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog Toy","review":"I purchased this Deedle Dude Rabbit for my little dog because she had one before and loved the happy tune, but this one did not sing.

Even so, she is a charming lyric soprano, and her approach to each song is light and flutey, if that's a word. Don't lok for deth or seriousness, however. Lupu is quite a recessive player in his own right, and together with Hendricks their collaboration strikes me as almost aloof. After half a dozen songs everything started to sound alike. But this consistency may not bother other listeners, and there's no doubt that few Schubert recitals have sounded so ravishing on the ear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I have over 100 books on the subject of what happens after Death.

Very recently, a high-pitch sound appeared from the otherwise very quiet desktop unit. Browsing of the large internet Mac community pages revealed that my unit is not the only one with that problem. While the final diagnostic awaits confirmation, the majority of comments points to flaws in the design of the processor control and/or in the powersupply. To my great dismay, Apple customer service showed itself very uncorporative. For such an expensive equipment, low-end service is not acceptable. In conclusion, the computer performance warrants 4 stars, the recent problems led to a very annoying noise problem that lowers it to 2 stars, and the response from Apple is just disappointing (does not qualify for any star). One Apple a day keeps the doctor away. But only one without worms..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and informative","review":"My nine year old son liked this book very much, even though this is geared for a slightly younger set.

This book will help to explain some of the wonderful, fascinating, and intriguing things everyone with a baby in their life will be interested in knowing.Though written for children, this book has wonderful adult appeal as well, with lots of great facts and interesting comments from the author.Included throughout the book are things for children to do to see the world from baby's perspective, including, rather than excluding, sibs and others in the process of learning how babies really work.In addition, colourful photographs of babies and accompanying illustrations add a nice visual appeal. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really more like 2 1/2 stars","review":"I bought this book based on the reviews here, but I was fairly disappointed. The pictures and the layout leave much to be desired, and the text is not bad, but not great either. I could not hold my two-year-old's attention with this one, although he will sit still for most books. Frankly, I had purchased this book partially because of the photographs, but I think I would rather just show my son \\"A Child is Born\\" or \\"Your Amazing Newborn\\" and explain the text to him. There just wasn't as much information here as I had hoped for. This is certainly not a bad book, especially for slightly older children, but it is not a great book either."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great early learning book","review":"Each page of this board book has a different letter with photos of objects, the names of which start with the letter shown.

B has boat, beans, beads, bowl, bread, butterfly, bear, belt, buttons, bananas, books and ball. Z has zero, zebra, and zipper. The objects are easily identified by the child because they are familiar and colorful. This book helps with early learning and language development. This book is appropriate for ages 1-5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ive been reading this book for over 11 years!","review":"I have been reading this book since I received it as a baby shower gift for my now eleven year old son. As he aged out of it, his two sisters (now 9 and 5,) and 16 month old brother (it is in his crib right now) have and do still love to read it. What starts out as a baby picture book turns into a preschool vocabulary, alphabet, kindergarten sight word, beginning reader book.

I ordered pairs for both my daughter and myself, using the size chart. We both had problems with the length, being too short for both of us.

Unfortunately, I only was able to wear them one day to work before noticing that they had pulled all over the back of my legs, both left and right. There must've been hundreds of dark lines that formed over the course of the day, they looked completely ridiculous and I will certainly never be able to wear them again.

The now out of print documentary VHS \\"Vietnam: The Ten Thousand Day War\\" was my first exposure to the war in the form of a documentary (released in 1980). that documentary went into great detail by interviewing CIA agents, generals, and politicians involved in the war.

The prose certainly gives them a run for their money, though...clunky and immature, it rings of inexperience.

When you spend this much on a quality H/K player, you expect WAY more. It's a simple, essential function. But I'd say about 33% of the time, I pause the player at any point in the disc, resume play, and the audio either lags or jumps ahead of the video.

The chapter that stands out is \\"Why Doesn't GM Sell Crack?\\" Republicans have succeeded for far too long in convincing people that deregulation and tort reform are tantamount to personal freedom and liberty, and that laws that protect people from products and services that cause injury and suffering and even death are tyrannical and totalitarian. I can not believe the degree to which they get away with this, and I also can not believe the general lack of response from the political left. In this chapter, Moore takes on these distortions, with his typical gusto, in a way that is compelling and accessible, which I think is one of Moore's talents. Personally, I wish he had expanded \\"Why Doesn't GM Sell Crack?\\" to book length. Hopefully, that will be a project for another day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Moore's Best Book to Date","review":"This is the first Michael Moore book I read.

It is much more playful in nature than his other books and is much funnier. Stupid White Men had humour, but seemed mostly to me to be a book of complaints against right winged people in America. This book, Downsize This, is first and foremost a satyrical comedy. The best chapters are the ones about masturbation and campaign funding.

This book is about the problems facing the nation back in the mid 1990s. Unfortunately those same problems continue to plague us today and not much has been done to make things better.The biggest issue covered is how big companies fire many workers when at the same time the companies are reporting huge profits and getting all kinds of tax breaks, hence the more riches, the more stitches. These companies contribute to the campaigns of politicians and the politicians support big business back with the tax breaks. This scenario is all wrong and destroys people's lives.Other issues covered that are still plaguing us today include racism, immigration, abortion, and the little differences between the two major parties.The book is funny at times, easy to read, and suggests ways for fighting back, such as running for local office and doing some whistle blowing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bold, Insightful, and best of all, funny","review":"While it is true that my own views of politics and economics have been conservative, I must say that Michael Moore has indeed helped me to see just what 'the other side' thinks. I have read some of the negative reviews that have said that Moore knows nothing about politics or economics. I would like to tell these people to get a life! This book is a satire. One does not need to be an expert in politics and economics to believe that some things this country is doing are wrong. In this book, Moore is utilizing something that he [and millions of Americans] has. It's called common sense.PS- They never should have cancelled TV Nation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less is Moore...","review":"The only funny thing about this book is the chapter where Moore explains why he thinks O.J.

The comedy value of this book is lost in the ignorant and irrational view of reality held by Mr. Moore.

This book might be useful for leveling off a piece of furniture with a broken leg"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sparks and Heat, but little Illumination","review":"I don't disagree with a lot of Moore's politics, but I find his smug and sometimes not entirely honest methods of satire to be a bit unpleasant. It's easy to preach to the choir, especially if your sermon is mostly hot air and cheap moralizing. You can read the bumper stickers at any expensive private college and skip reading this silly book.

(See some of the \\"one-star\\" reviews above.) Seems like somebody hit a nerve there!As for my own review: Michael Moore is one of a kind (damn it). Better than anyone writing in America today, he tallies up the kibble that executive fat-cats and their downsizing corporations are gobbling down, at the expense of the average American worker AND taxpayer.In the tradition of Mike Royko or Studs Turkel, Moore afflicts the comfortable and comforts the afflicted.

I read it in less than a day. The book is hilarious, and Michael Moore has his facts right. His thesis throughout the book, and indeed throughout his early production, is that big corporations must stop accept government money and then fire most of their workforceto increase their already immense profits. He connects corporate greed to racism and corrupt politicians. His piece on congressman Robert Dornan is just superb! For me as a European this open corruption and greed in politicians in the USA is strange. Of course our politicians also lie and are corrupt, but they are a bit more discrete about it. And many of them are caught and forced to resign. We do not have this worship of Big Business.At times the book becomes a bit rambling, but I can forgive that.I hope more people will read and understand this book, and then go out and vote."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great left-wing political and social comedy","review":"Most readers, like myself, probably don't share all of Michael Moore's political beliefs. This book is definitely left wing, but still will appeal to almost anyone. It crosses political lines by relying on one thing that will be accepted by all: humor.Moore attacks a wide group of companies, issues, and people, but not maliciously, but more humorously. Don't let that fool you though, his attacks are not light hearted. He goes after GM, Robert Dornan, Germany, and both political parties in a manner that is shocking by its humor and its truthfulness.Moore doesn't claim to be a great writer, but his writing style reflects the way is - common, and easy to understand. This makes this book not only funny, but very readable as well.Though pretty short, it's hilarious, original, and even provides some humorous pictures, mock trading cards, and mock articles. Check this book out and you'll most likely enjoy it, no matter what your political affiliation is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mild","review":"I just finished \\"Downsize This\\" by Micheal Moore and I must say I found it somewhat mild in terms of creativity. There was some interesting material, but most of it was simply his thoughts on political issues (and it was very dated). I guess that is why he called it \\"Random Thoughts\\". I really think that I could have done just as good of a job myself. So why is it that Michal Moore can get a book contract and I cannot? I thought that perhaps the publisher would offer him a contract beacuse of his track record, but after \\"Downsize This\\" I realize that the publisher knows that people like me will think \\"Hey that Micheal Moore guy that made that great movie Roger and Me now has a book out. I think I'll go buy it.\\" They don't much care what Micheal has to say as long as he completes a book they can sell.

This book is not.This books is tirade against corporate america, which is expected. What is not expected is that it is not funny. There are attempts at humor like trading cards of corporate criminals that just don't make anybody laugh.So besides humor a good tirade needs to be hard hitting. There are a few moments where some references to NAFTA really make the world look ugly, or when layoffs really seem unncessary. However, the hard hitting things are few and far between.If you are a really hardcore Michael Moore fan you might like this book, but for the casual Michael Moore fan it is a too poorly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the errata sheet or web address?","review":"I'm a beginner and already have hit errors on page 47:Start>Programs>MS SQL server>Configure SQL XML support in IISMy computer yield the following:Start>Programs>MS SQL server>>Books online>Client network utility>Enterprise manager>Import and export data>Profiler>Query analyzer>Readme.txt>Server netowrk utility>Service manager>Uninstall SQL server 7.0There is no mention of Configure XML support in IIS!I'm tired of buying books with sloppy technical editing.

But, in the end, I didn't care nearly enough about the characters. I believe it's because of what one reviewer already mentioned - one dimensional, idealistic characters. It was mildly entertaining, but I didn't finish with much to keep me thinking about. I like the concept of the book - diary entries that a character is reading, but I found the characters overaly idealized.I've never read any of Patterson's other novels, but I know this one is unique in its genre. I'm guessing since he's such a successful author, it's also unique in its flat characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sappy Love Story with a Predictable Ending","review":"In the opening chapter of Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas, the reader meets Katie.

I was disappointed with how unrealistic the book is. It could be appealing if you wanted to believe that everyone in the world is beautiful, smart and successful. Patterson seems to spend more time telling you how the characters feel instead of SHOWING you how they feel through their actions. The reader is intelligent and can figure things out through hints, and getting to know the characters instead of being given everything. That was my problem with it. I thought it will silly and overly sentimental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Packaged Love Story","review":"For those looking for a light read this book is for you. For ardent fans of stories by Robert James Waller, Nicholas Sparks and Nicholas Evans don't waste your money. This is the first book I have read by James Patterson and I was disappointed. It seemed to me that Mr. Patterson got 30 women in a room and did a focus group. They were asked questions including; 1)what their favorite spot to visit---okay Martha's Vineyard so that will be the setting, 2)What kind of woman should be in it?; let's make them strong but emotional, and 3)What are your favorite reads? let's include these in the storyline to make it contemporary. In a word--Packaged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!!!","review":"I pre-ordered this book with great anticipation. James Patterson is one of my favorite authors and I was expecting a great book. I couldn't have been more disappointed. I was looking forward to Patterson's change of genre having been pleasantly surprised by John Grisham's, A Painted House. But unlike Grisham, Patterson's plot and characters have little substance and the outcome is totally predictable from page one. It is hard to believe Mr. Patterson wrote this book. It is more believable a high school student tried to imitate Nicholas Sparks or Robert James Waller and came up with a cross between A Message In A Bottle and The Bridges OF Madison County but failed miserably. So save your (money) and the 2 hours it takes to get through this book and wait for Mr. Patterson to go back to what he does best.

I agree with many of the other readers that this book was way too sappy. I found the writing to be too simple almost to the point that it was insulting. I gave this book two stars because I think the idea was good and the formatt of it, written in letter form, was different.

I would reach for a Nicholas Spark's book any day of the week!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too predictable","review":"I was hoping this would be more of an interesting story, I was quite disappointed to find out that it was a basic and very sad story.

It was so juvenile in it's writing. The premise of the novel was good but the execution was very bad. It couldn't have taken James Patterson more than an hour to complete this mockery of a novel.

And how a happy couple changes with time in ways they didn't forsee. That's a real story.

This novel is amazing, has a great lesson about life. I couldn't put it down and I finished it in one day. James Patterson is great writer, and I love all his books, and each time I read a book for him I said to myself, this is the best, then when I read the next, I said no, this is the best, and still, more to come.I advise everyone to read this thrilling, touching love, and emotional novel. It's a masterpiece. The five balls lesson is very important. After I finished the story I just keep thinking in the events, in what had happened, it really impressed me a lot.

There was no believability there, I couldn't identify with them. Also it was very distracting the way the author kept name dropping/giving shout outs. It wasn't someone took a picture with their camera, it was they used their Canon camera and how many references to watching Ally McBeal can there be. It got real annoying after awhile and interupted the flow.Another flaw is that just by reading the information on the dust jacket you already get an idea of where the story is going before you even read a word.All in all if you are looking for a harmless quick summer read, go for it. If you want a bit more, skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A romance to enjoy if that is your thing...","review":"I don't generally read romance novels.

It is a bit cheesy, but if you are a romance fan, than I suspect it will be just what you are looking for.The story was sad, and I don't want to give the plot away in this review. Suffice it to say, there was foreshadowing of what would come; so there really were no shocks in this story. It was well written, and I would recommend this story to the die hard romance fan. I will be inclined to read Patterson's other novels, rather than a romance should he chose to write another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"I really, really wanted to like this book. Unfortunately, it just didn't ever click into place. I think the main problem was that I didn't like any of the characters: not pathetic, melodramatic, \\"why me?\\" Katie, not super-great-guy Matt, and definitely not self-absorbed Suzanne. I didn't even like the completely unrealistic baby Nicholas.Aside from that, the book moved along at a good pace. I read it in one sitting and the writing was engaging, smooth, and clear, if a bit over-the-top in places. The ending was utterly predictable and the denouement abrupt, leaving me with a vague feeling that the entire preceding drama had no point.If you're looking for a quick summer read, or a cheap tear-jerker, this is the place to look -- although the two-dimensional characters might not tug your heartstrings hard enough to draw tears."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like melassa...","review":"This book has been my first and only encounter with James Patterson and I must admit that, after having read it, I couldn't believe that this author was granted (even though not for this book) some prestigious writing award.You can like it, perhaps, if you are somehow a melassa addict...Though the central idea might have been a very good one, it has been developed very badly. Neither the plot nor the characters are at all believable, they sound like a caricature of romance writing. I found impossible to feel moved by a story that, if just reported by newspaper or magazine with the plain, factual language of journalists, could have been moving indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than perfect","review":"I found the characters in this book too perfect.

It's apparently supposed to be romance, but the dialogue was so cheesy and the chapters so short that it lost my interest almost immediately.Stick to writing good suspense novels and murder mysteries, and leave the tacky romance novels to Judith Krantz."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Predictable \\"Soap Opera\\"","review":"I was very disappointed in this Patterson novel. I found it predictable, contrived, and poorly written (How many times does Suzanne say she is blushing, protesting her aversion to blushing?) I figured the \\"mystery\\" out as soon as I started reading Suzanne's words. Of course, she had died, probably along with the child. And how convenient that Katie is there to take Suzanne's place and to provide another child. What a happy ending! Sorry. I'll look forward to reading more of Patterson's real writing in his mysteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Piece of Fluff","review":"I found this book to be a piece of fluff.I got sick of the new mother, Suzanne, gushing over her baby and her marriage to the ideal mate.Patterson should have spent more time on the other characters and making the obvious not so obvious.Maybe a reader who is a new mother and not too educated would like the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother -- read the real Patterson in his earlier books","review":"James Patterson should stick to what he knows best. The glaring problems with timelines and logic in this story are too many to list. One example -- Suzanne met a boyfriend at the 1996 wedding of John Kennedy and Carolyn Bessette, is with him for four years but has a new husband (not the boyfriend) and a year-old baby when the defining event of the book happens in 1999 -- three years into her 4-year relationship with the earlier boyfriend. In another instance, we meet Kate as she finishes the diary and is pondering whether she can forgive her boyfriend but when we come back to that at the end of the book, there appears to be none of this questioning about returning to him. Even without these annoying and distracting oversights, the plot is unbelieveable, trite and simplistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"No \\"Bridges of Madison County\\"","review":"At first I hesitated to buy this book because I felt it would not meet my expectations. Then I read some of the reviews and saw the author on the Today show and decided to take a chance. Boy was I disappointed!!! The story and characters were just not believable at all. I was hoping for another \\"Bridges of Madison County\\" and instead got a cheap romance novel. [....]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Patterson should stick to what he knows best, this isn't it.","review":"Sorry, Patterson, this book will never be another \\"Bridges of Madison County.\\" I've always loved Patterson's books, having read them all. I bought this one against my better judgement because I like the way he writes and was willing to give him a chance to try something new. How sad because he certainly missed the boat on this one. In a word, it was drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another page filler","review":"James Patterson has reduced his once great story telling ability to drivel! He hasn't written a good book for a very long time. His Alex Cross novels were great reading but all the current onces are strictly formula.This book was nothing but pages and pages of ridiculous nonsense. I had given up on him years ago but live in the hope that maybe 'this one' will put him back on my must read list. Nope, not this time again. There are so many other authors worth reading instead of Patterson. Forget about it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Every bit as ordinary the second time around","review":"I despised this book the first time I read it, but recently I picked it up to see if my judgement had been clouded. It hadn't. This book is so awful I feel compelled to write this review to *prevent* people wasting money and time on reading it. Its every bit fluff, pop culture reference name dropper, thin translucent characters and awful narrative and grammar that can possibly be,I've read *fanfiction* and tenth grade essays more fulfilling than this novel. I won't go into the plot--its not worth it. I'm not a cold hearted person at all, hey one of my favourite novels is Judy Blume's \\"Tiger Eyes\\" (and i'm 19!) this book just made me laugh, and NOT in the good way. I'm sorry to say but only simple minds can be pleased by this very, very ludicrous, watery effort by James Patterson, a doctors office/airport/beach read at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass the Insulin!","review":"Diabetics everywhere, beware! You will need to adjust your insulin dose to deal with all the sweetness in this book! Call me cynical, but I think Patterson and his fans would be far better served if he stuck to the thriller genre. I am a mother who adores her sons; I have also been in love with a marvelous man. But this too, too idyllic and too, too tragic tale with its thoroughly predictable ending is just too, too much. It is sort of like trying to make a meal off cotton candy--pleasant on the tongue, but absolutely no substance to satisfy. Cloying at best; a minor waste of reading time at worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite, Predictable","review":"Katie, the pregnant heroine of the story, was left by the wonderful house painter-cum-poet Matt Harrison. He gives her a diary to read to try and explain his departure, the diary his perfect, dearly departed wife Suzanne wrote for their much-loved, perfect baby Nicholas. I had a hard time finishing this book because it was torture to force myself to read any more of the trite, cloying phrases. Sickeningly sweet, predictable, smarmy, just oozing with smaltzy sentiments. Get the picture? In other words, terrible if you want real literature instead of a greeting card."},{"rating":"1","title":"My first Patterson book a real disappointment.","review":"Admittedly, I'm not finished with it yet, but I'm very disappointed. The writing is juvenile and the characters are shallow. Patterson doesn't seem to have any insight into real women at all. These characters seem based on stereotypes of sappy, romance novels.Not enough real description. Too much use of generic adjectives like \\"great,\\" and \\"real fun.\\" This just tells me he doesn't understand his characters. As a result, neither do I."},{"rating":"1","title":"i can't believe most people liked this book!","review":"I thought that this book was not very good at all. I, an 18 year old girl, felt like it was below my reading level. It was written for 13 year old teenie boppers. The characters are not complex or described well at all. The plot is predictable and not very interesting. I read the book in about 2 days because I was bored and it just bored me more. Anyone with intelligence would not like this book. Go for a Nicholas Sparks book if you want a romance, it at least is a little more in-depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimme a break!","review":"The trend seems to be for novelists in an established genre to branch out into other types of fiction. Grisham and Baldacci tried it with spotty results, and now Patterson. I was interested to see how Patterson would handle a love story, and found that he handled it poorly. The characters seemed shallow, the outcome was predictable, and the romance was so idealized that it became ridiculous. Not only was the plot unbelievable and naive, but there were several details in the book that defied common sense. First: how would a physician with a heart condition who barely survived childbirth allow herself to become pregnant again, and not terminate the pregnancy if she did? Second: cardiac surgery involves large incisions down the center of the chest and down the length of one leg, as well as potentially down a second limb. So how could Matt not have noticed this, and why would Suzanne have to \\"confess\\" this surgery to him? Stick with writing thrillers, Mr. Patterson!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money on this one!","review":"My book club picked this book. What a waste of time! We all hated it! Why on earth would you have a book with the main character dating 2 men named Matt? Unbelievable, predictable and boring. What was the purpose of the name dropping throughout the book? For example, Katie went to JFK Jr's wedding, or listing the book titles that a character owns. Was Patterson trying to make us believe that this was a true story? Any reader who is older than 12 will know from page 1 that this book is a weak example of fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimaginative","review":"This was the lightest, quickest, and most thoughless read I have had in years. My bookclub chose the book, and to be honest, I have no idea what we will discuss. There was nothing thought-provoking about the book, and the parables were agnozingly simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love James Patterson's books.....but not this one","review":"I normally love James Patterson's books, so I was disappointed with this one. His suspense novels are awesome! I knew where he was headed with this one right off, and I just didn't care for the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it, couldn't finish it","review":"Calling it a \\"fast read\\" doesn't begin to describe it. The book almost isn't there: short sentences, short paragraphs, short chapters, big type. This isn't a novel; it's a chapter book, only it has sex in it and it's shelved alongside the books for grownups.The story was hardly there either. It was more like a set of cues for a guided fantasy. If other readers are finding it moving and meaningful, I'm happy for them. Personally, I found I wasn't enjoying what was happening, and I didn't care what was going to happen, and anyway I was tired of doing all the work; so I put it aside and never went back."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Patterson Flop","review":"HELP! I must have missed something while reading this book. I did not need any kleenex to read this Danielle Steele look-alike. How beautiful and wonderful and perfect can everyone be? James, PLEASE go back to mysteries! I was so amazed to read the reviews that raved and raved over this book! Thank heavens this was a library book and I suffered no outlay of cash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read for Irving fans","review":"As a die-hard fan of John Irving and the ilk of sad, exploratory, and introspective novels that showcase characters over plot, I found this book and the characters richly developed. Not quite at the level of a Cider House Rules, it nonetheless captured (and kept) my attention the entire way through. I will definitely read more Patterson after reading this book. I am sure many will find the book a bit \\"mushy\\" or romantic, so make sure you can endure a good helping of romance before picking it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't recommend this book to a mother","review":"From the very beginning of the book I was emotional. About halfway through the book, after blubbering for most of the book, I realized that it was going to get more sad and ended up flipping through the last 50 pages or so. It was very predictable and as a mother of a one year old son, it was very hard for me to read. I was drawn into the book and read most of it quickly but I was hoping for a happy ending and was sadly dissapointed. I would raed another book like this if Patterson wrote it as long as someone could tell me in advance that it was a happier book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What can you say about a mother who died?","review":"I'm normally a fan of Patterson's work, but really, this was a piece of drivel. His publisher should have paid him NOT to write it -- or at least not to send it out to the bookstores. Love Story all over again, with less of an excuse. Couldn't Katie figure out where the diary was headed from the first page of it? I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend for anyone who is a serious reader","review":"Every part of this book is contrived, I did not feel any sympathy for any of the characters at all.Not even a good romance here. Would not have read past the first page if not reading for a book group. We may get 2-3 minutes worth of discussion our of this book, if that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I thought this might be a nice summer read. What a disappointment! It is trite beyond belief. It really is beyond belief. If you love good writing, don't bother. I might have liked this when I was 13, but probably not then either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheeseball Trash","review":"This book must have been the worst novel I have ever read. The writing is repetitive without reason and trite to begin with. How much does the author get paid for every \\"Isn't it lucky\\" that appears? And who even says that? Eww.The characters were entirely unrealistic and ironically plain at the same time. The plot (if you even count it as a plot) has absolutely no point to it... This was a bomb of a venture for James Patterson. The prose is banal, cheesy, and without any depth. This book was a complete waste of my money, time, and energy. You couldn't pay me to read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotionally powerful!","review":"This is the first time I have read one of his books, and I could not put this down! I managed to read all of 266 pages in one day. The way he writes this diary from a woman's delicate emotions for her child is unbelievable. I was able to visually create every little detail in my mind, and actually place myself in this book, as if I was \\"watching\\" this family from afar. I definitely think that this should be a movie! To anyone who hasn't read this book yet, get out the hankies, because you'll need it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"throwback to 30 years ago","review":"All you people who said this was not typical James Patterson were right. This is typical Erich Segal writing tear-jerker surface-level Love Story in the early '70s just to show he could do it and make money at it. I have to say this book was pretty schlocky, but if you want something that reads fast (which I did this week) and enjoy reading about the perfect lives of yuppies, by all means pick it up. James Patterson is capable of much better writing. I got the book free from someone else, so I dont feel I was taken. If you like romance, family stories, personal tragedy, whatever, there is much better stuff out there to choose from. And if you like Patterson, he's published better stuff, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't believe James Patterson wrote this...","review":"You really won't be able to believe that the same person who wrote Kiss the Girls & Hide & Seek wrote this book. At first I wondered if I'd have a hard time believing this love story...but I didn't at all. I was immediately drawn into this story. I could not put it down!Unlike any of his stories before, this is a story solely about love. Of course, there is the mystery about the diary that the mother Suzanne wrote for her son Nicholas- what happened to her? So as you're reading, there's an urgency to know what will happen, as well as you're enjoying the sentimental romance. Neither disappoint.This was one of the best romance books I've read in a long time. It was a perfect size, quick reading with a story that leaves you begging for more. When I finished I cried in a way that a story has not made me cry in a very long time. You must pick up this book- you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...Patterson is so talented","review":"It has been a very, very long time since a novel made me cry...this one did it...and in such a beautiful way. I've always been a Patterson reader and was surprised and delighted to read something so different from him. Please write more like this..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet story...very touching!!!","review":"This was definitely a quick read and also very different. I think Patterson had a way of telling this story through the diary, and yet switching back and forth between Katie and Suzanne to get his point across. I also think perhaps this story touched on his own life and it was written with heart. My thoughts anyway. Deep love is such a wonderful thing to get and have for however long we're lucky enough to have it. You could see that Matt wasn't ready for another relationship, so he walked away. But he loved Katie, so he wanted her to know \\"why\\" and he left her the diary. I'm putty in a writer's hands when it comes to romance, and I thought this story was a sweet one. I do think Patterson is a better mystery writer, but I'd admire his efforts on this one. I have one more book of Patterson's to read and then I'm moving on to someone else. I don't think this book was boring, but it wasn't your super-duper romance. It was just what it was...\\"sweet\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captive","review":"I read this book in one day, I could not put it down. A very different James Patterson but just as great as ever. I strongly recommend this book. You will love the characters and the writing is extraordinary.I have since passed it on to all of my friends who have all equally enjoyed it as much as me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Willing Suspension of Disbelief?","review":"I was excited about reading the book - saw it was a NY Times Bestseller. But I was disappointed. Very formulaic. And I had to suspend my disbelief in the most extreme way to enjoy reading the book. It reads very quickly anyway! I guess Mr. Patterson should stick to what he does best - mystery suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sweet story, but a bit too sappy for me.","review":"If you like stories dripping with tears, you will probably enjoy this story. The story is about a young woman who meets the love of her life, they marry, have a child, and tragedy is always just around the corner. There doesn't seem to be much uplifting about their lives, except perhaps that the memories they make are very nice. This is a fine escape from reality for awhile, and an overall good read, but the story lacks depth, is too predictable, and is gift wrapped at the end, leaving the reader feeling as though it can be put aside and never thought of again. I prefer stories that leave memories with the reader themselves. Still, as Danielle-Steele-ish as it is, you may find that it is poignant in parts, and touches your heart in others."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of fluff","review":"This book was the choice of my all-female book club; I had my doubts about it before I read it, and it was even worse than I expected. I found the characters and many of their actions unbelievable. And the ending: how convenient that a man who had recently lost his wife and infant son would so easily decide that he had found a new \\"love of his life,\\" who of course, was pregnant with his child. Instant replacement family coming up, and of course everyone will live happily ever after. I was annoyed and disgusted with the book from about the second page. However, most of the other club members liked it much better while acknowledging that it wasn't exactly a literary masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"clicheed and predictible","review":"This was a very disappointing book. Great effort was made to make it contemporary by including the most predictible references (\\"the ordinary couple met unbelievably at JFK and Caroline Bessett's wedding!\\") - please! List of current restaurants, \\"in\\" places, etc. were used to fill the space that substance should have occuppied. Fortunately, the type was large and there are many divider pages so it didn't last long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty lame","review":"I gave this book two stars because it did hold my attention, sorta. But as one insightful reviewer put it, the story reflects the male perspective entirely. I would hate to think that a well-educated, intelligent professional woman would allow herself to get pregnant because she was \\"sure\\" her boyfriend was planning to propose. And the emotional gushing--especially towards the end of the book--was really over the top. Okay for escapist reading, but don't expect any lasting insights from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!","review":"Be sure to have plenty of un-interrupted time to read this...Not only will you not be able to put it down, but you will definitely want some time when you're done, to reflect, and then to go hug your loved ones.I also absolutely loved the 5 balls illustration!!! What a great concept, and yet put so simply.Thank you, James Patterson for hitting another one out of the park. You are one of my favorite authors, and I can't wait to read your next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this book...it haunted me","review":"I love James Patterson and the Alex Cross series, and while I knew this book would be nothing like his usual, and I knew it would be a tear-jerker, I was not prepared for the horrid ending. I would recommend NOT reading this book unless you want to be incredibly sad. I was truly haunted by this book and cannot get it out of my mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written for a second grader","review":"I was looking for an easy summer romance to escape through. What I found instead was the most simplistic and predictable novel I've ever read. I did not feel any empathy for any of the characters and found that reading the novel was a waste of time. To be fair, I have been called a literary snob by some friends, but this novel was written for someone with second grade reading capabilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"A quick read, but you'll never get that time back","review":"If you hated The Bridges of Madison County, you'll hate Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas. This book is a quick read and a page-turner, but it gives you nothing of substance. The characters are wholly unbelievable -- about six months after a tragedy involving one \\"love of his life\\" a man does NOT move on to another \\"love of his life.\\" This book is written by an advertising professional for a specific, targeted market. Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas has references to a variety of music, products and brand names that might make you identify with the book's characters. It refers positively to The Bridges of Madison County, so if you thought that book had something worthwhile to say, you might feel the same way about this book. If, however, you'd rather nourish your mind when you read, then skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written at Second Grade Level","review":"After hearing so many wonderful things about this book, I was really excited to be loaned a copy. I made it through about 17 pages, then decided I couldn't take any more of the horribly simple writing and trite comments. To quote one, \\"She had wanted to be with him all the time. Corny, but true.\\" Not one paragraph is over 3 sentences long and the book is full of italics for emphasis as if the reader isn't smart enough to know what's important.It saddens me that a book this bad would make it to #1 on the New York Bestseller list. There are so many more wonderful books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO CONTRIVED!!","review":"I had high hopes for the book as the jacket said it was a best seller. Boy was I wrong! I felt the story was too contrived and that the author was forcing me to feel the pain Katie was going through. The character's lines were so bad I felt like it was torture for me. I normally get weepy over beautiful love stories but this time it was like Patterson was forcing me to cry. I found myself skipping a few pages since I was bored out of my mind. I read this in the plane and was done in less than 2 hours. I'm sure Patterson's other works are good but this one was really bad. It's so bad that I am embarassed to have the book lying in my room. Read it and see if you'll agree with me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please, stop jerking my emotions!","review":"Calculated and overwrought, this book was not bad enough to stop reading, but not good enough to actually enjoy. It was as if the author sat down and said, \\"Hummm, that Madison County book did pretty well, let me do one of those.\\" The characters were cardboard stereotypes and the actions and plot were designed to wrench tears out of the reader. Stick to Anne Tyler if you want stories with real heart to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"sappy and unrealistic","review":"It took me a seven hour plane ride to finish this book and it was seven hours I will never be able to get back. It took everything I had to keep from busting out laughing at how rediculously unrealistic this book was. Suzanne's diary entries to her infant son, Nicholas, were overly dramatized and extremely hoaky. I can't even begin to believe how a best-selling author was able to think up such garbage. Don't even bother with this one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you love good literature, run away. Fast.","review":"Go to the Hallmark card rack and pick an I Love You card at random. Read the sappy, trite, pre-packaged sentiment. Then expand it into a novel. Voila! You've got Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas. I have nothing against a good romantic tearjerker, but the operative word is \\"good.\\" This is a DREADFUL book, trite, predictable and poorly written. It reads like the work of a lovestruck teenager, not a professional novelist. The ultimate arrogance is when the character Matt writes a slushy poem for his wife and infant son that's supposedly purchased by Atlantic Monthly--which wouldn't touch a piece of dreck like that unless the entire editorial staff ingested hallucinogenic drugs. If you love good writing, stay far away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry and sappy","review":"I'll admit that I haven't read any other books by James Patterson. However, if this one is any indication of his writing style and prowess, I don't think I'll bother. I teach junior high school, and I honestly believe I have some eighth graders who could have written the story as well or better. It took me less than two hours to read the entire book, and I had pretty much figured out the ending within the first twenty minutes of reading. Ordinarily, I like the idea of reading the diary or journal of the main character (such as in the short story, \\"Flowers for Algernon\\"), but Suzanne's diary was simply too hard to believe. It didn't read like an authentic voice. I just finished reading \\"The Lovely Bones\\" by Alice Sebold, an author who can really write. In comparison, this book was VERY disappointing. It really reminded me of something an average teenager could write in their language arts class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure syrup","review":"A promising beginning which degenerated into unmitigated mush. The characters could all be wearing halos, they are totally unbelievable, all supposed to be beautiful and flawless. An attempt at being a tear jerker. In my case, it failed since no one was real. I can't believe the author was serious. Same genre as Bridges of Madison County and Love Story, only more so.jpsul"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I was expecting a sophisticated, deeply moving read. Instead, I found a book in which the characters were so superficially drawn that they were completely unbelievable. Although the story is based on events in the author's life, it is hard to believe that everyone was beautiful,and sensitive. That no one experienced genuine feelings of ambiguity or uncertainty -- the kind that every-day people experience. For me, the book felt like one big cliche."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Easy Way to Make Money","review":"James Patterson must have needed a quick buck when he wrote this. It is derivative of many other romance novels, for instance, Message in a Bottle. Why does someone always have to die to make the story romantic? Can't living people enjoy romance too? I was sorry I spent my own money for this book and would warn others not to spend theirs on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little too fluffy","review":"This book was a very quick read. It certainly tried to pull on all of the emotions, but I just found the whole thing to be your typical romance fluff. The ending was so predictable. If you normally read Patterson's novel and think you would like to read this as a change of pace, I suggest you skip it, unless you like weepy, emotional romances. I don't, and I certainly wish I would have spent my money on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste Of Time","review":"I wish I had read all the reviews prior to purchasing this book, but I just kept reading \\"the best seller\\" list. Whoever marked this one a best seller doesn't know what they're talking about. This book was a total disaster, both in concept and in writing. I wonder if the author was an unknown, it would have made the best seller list...I seriously doubt it. How I could have wasted my precious time reading this is a mystery, but I kept hoping it would get better, but it never did.Don't waste your time or your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Classic Love Story....Beautiful!!!","review":"I absolutely loved this book! It had me captivated right from the start. It took me through so many different emotions, I wasn't exactly sure what direction the story was going to take and I definitely was surprised and touched. It is one of the most beautiful stories I have ever read. I felt I was right in the story. The life lessoons brought especially got to me.

I am now going to purchase more of James Patterson, like tomorrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Words can't explain","review":"Having never read any of James Patterson's books prior to reading \\"Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas\\" I can't compare them. But I can compare it to other books I have read. This book is exceptional, one that nearly everybody can relate to. From the characters personality, the dreams they each have, to the lessons they have learned, there is something for everybody. It was a quick read, and a good one.

I hope that this isn't the last of his romance novels. I've never felt like telling strangers to read a book, but I caught myself at the bookstore wanting to tell a lady that she should read this book! I have shared this book with five other ladies and have had nothing but praise from each of them! My daughter-in-law read it in one day. She couldn't put it down! Thanks for listening! I would highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Excellent","review":"This book was just what I needed. I couldn't put it down. It was filled with romance, mystery, sad and happy endings. I think people could learn a life lesson from this book-[the five balls].

Normally I am a true crime, suspense girl, but this, along with a few of Patterson's other books were given to me by a family member. I think everyone needs a dose of emaotion from time to time and this one did just that.....sent me on a rollercoaster. I finished it in a matter of hours. I look forward to reading the other James Patterson novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I read this book last night instead of watching summer re-runs on TV, and to tell you the truth, the time would have been better spent watching the re-runs. Seldom have I been more disappointed in a book. I've read some of James Patterson's suspense stories, and they held my interest to the end. It did occur to me that this was a bit of a stretch for him, but the hype given to the book stirred an interest in my romantic heart. I should try to remember that there is not necessarily any truth in advertising.I hate to think a tree was killed to provide the paper on which this book is printed. James Patterson should stick to the genre in which he has already gained a good reputation. Hopefully, he will quickly write another suspense novel with which we may wash away the taste of this story. This book would not have stood a chance of being published on its own merit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not recommend buying this book.","review":"This is the first book I have read by James Patterson and I wish I had my money back. I cant finish this book it does have a good storyline and could have the potential if written by another author such as Nicholas Sparks to have been a wonderful intriguing book but as it is it is extremely boring and mind numbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst","review":"Recommended to me by a friend who clearly is a romance-book-lover. Insipid story, amateurish writing, completely uninvolving in every way. I guess there is a market for this kind of treacle but it isn't me. On the bright side, though I hated the book, at least it convinced me to finish my own. If a hack like James Patterson can make millions calling himself a writer, so can I!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching","review":"This is a great book with a touching story! This is the first I've read of this author and enjoyed it very much.I also recommend Pop Goes the Weasel which is very different from this one but superbly written as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"I was at the airport and waiting for my plane to board when I found this book. I have read a couple of James Patterson books and had just finished 1st to Die. I knew when I picked it up that it was not going to be a \\"normal\\" James Patterson book. I read it in about an hour. It was okay. Not great by any means. It got to be pretty predictable. When you started reading and you could tell that Matt was not ever going to cheat on his wife, you knew that something had to have happened to make him start dating Katie. Since I pretty well knew what was going to happen it made it boring. But it's nice to know that he can write something other than blood and guts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived Pathos","review":"I gave it one star because it was a quick read, thank goodness. I would hate to think I invested any more time reading something so disappointing. Not 10 pages into the book and I already knew where this was headed. It's not believeable that a mother would write to her son in this fashion without the obvious being so obvious. It's hackneyed, haggared, and horrible. I want my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tripe guaranteed to lower one's I.Q. by a point or two","review":"A member of my book club selected this book. Reading it was actually painful. The fine folks at Reader's Digest, Touched by an Angel and Chicken Soup for the Soul have nothing on Mr. Patterson. Thank goodness for the many blank pages that have been inserted to make this bit of fluff appear a little more substantial, and thank goodness for the 16-point font. Two hours wasted on this garbage were two hours too many."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soulful Summer Read","review":"This is a wonderful way to wile away a lazy summer's afternoon. It reads quickly; even the slowest reader could get to the last page regretably in a few hours. A touching and meaningful story that will pull at your heartstrings.I was in the mood for a \\"Bridges of Madison County\\" kind of treat when I picked this book up and was not disappointed. ....A sweet series of memories with a story most realistic and honest.If you want something to cherish and invite your imagination, this is a story beautifully written with an intrigue of its very own. Patterson is best known for his interesting & mysterious tales. In its own way, this love story is exactly that and more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, sappy, unrealistic. Don't waste your time!","review":"I have nothing against a good tear jerker, but there is nothing good about this book - it is completely unrealistic. Those sickeningly sweet love letters to baby Nicholas were so sappy that I just rolled my eyes through the whole thing. Who would actually write letters like that to a baby?I can't believe that this book would make anyone cry. Well, on second thought, maybe I do understand......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really, really, but REALLY bad!","review":"The first and last James Patterson book I have ever read. I picked this one up in an airport, compelled by the #1 NY Times bestseller rating indicated on the cover. That has to be a lie, as I can't believe anyone who has ever read a love story and is over 12 could possibly rave over this book.I was truly shocked at how bad the book was. Patterson has the vocabulary level of a high school sophomore at best, while his character development is equally immature. The whole book is lifeless and boring, the story predictable and pointless... in short a complete waste of money. Mills and Boone are way better if you're looking for sappy romances.Bottom line - don't buy this book. I'm throwing mine out as it's too bad to even give to anyone. Honestly, I haven't ever reviewed a book before but this one was just too bad to ignore. I was also curious to see if it was really so highly acclaimed. Phew ... I'm relieved to see there are a few sane people around."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Book I've Ever Read","review":"Sappy, totally predictable, unrealistic, totally lacking the the true emotion of the story. The best part of the book was that it took less than two hours to read. There are very few male writers that can write from a woman's perspective. Wally Lamb is one, James Patterson isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"James Patterson or Nicholas Sparks?","review":"This could have been another one of Nicholas Sparks emotional and sappy stories. In the tradition of Message in a bottle, The Notebook, and The Rescue by Nicholas Sparks... James Patterson must have followed the formula for a predictable story. The characters were \\"perfect\\" with ideal professions and beauty.I had grown tired of James Patterson novels. However, since this one seemed out of his normal thrillers I gave it a chance. What a waste of money. Makes me long for Alex Cross!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal !","review":"I was familiar enough to know that this James Patterson book was not his traditional style. What a phenomenal read. I couldn't put it down. I read the book in a little over 2 hours. It is like you are right there in the book with the characters. Four days later and I am still thinking about this book. I would recommend it to anyone, but keep a box of tissues nearby."},{"rating":"1","title":"I kept reading despite wanting to barf...","review":"I bought this book while on vacation, and literally read the whole thing while my fiance was taking a nap one afternoon. From the very beginning, I thought that the story was way too sugary and predictable. And the constant talk about Nicholas being the perfect baby, and Matt being the perfect husband, and life in general being just so wonderful and perfect... ugh, it was just too much for me. I gave it two stars instead of one because it did keep me reading. Within the first 50 pages, I thought I had figured out what happened to Suzanne and wanted to confirm... it turned out I was right.I agree with the reviewer that said James Patterson probably wrote this book on a bet, that he could write a Nicholas Sparks kind of book... he's probably somewhere laughing about all the money he's made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another side of Patterson","review":"OK ... so those of you who wondered what James Patterson was doing writing a novel without Alex Cross may be afraid to take a chance,, I know that I was hesitant. This book is a fine example of what a great writer that Patterson is. Apparently based somewhat on some life experiences of his, this is a true page turner. As a man, and a Cross fan, I couldn't believe this was Patterson...BUT...I couldn't put it down. Yes, so it is somewhat of a \\"woman's book,\\" ... but come on guys ,,, if you have a heart your gonna enjoy this as much as any Patterson you have read. 5 stars for James -- and his storytelling abilities...you have got to read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A young lucky mothers perspective","review":"I read the first 14 pages of this book on line and new I had to have it. I asked for it for Christmas and got it. I read it the same night. I couldn't put it down. My heart is still aching for Suzanne and Nicholas and for their moments together. The magic she felt at seeing her babies smile or hearing his laugh. The terror she experiences at the thought of losing even a second with him, really makes you step out of your life and look at all you have to be thankful for. It gets so busy, so routine that you forget how precious our time here is, this book, this story, puts you back into perspective. I am thankful I read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"An incredible story that touches every emotion. Patterson is a terrific writer. He draws you into the characters lives from page one. It will leave you tingling inside with a need to read it again. One of my all time favorites. I definitely recommend reading this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Started off with possibilities....","review":"I was really looking foward to reading this book. I heard mix reviews. I read the book in two days. I was really hoping it would get better, instead it got sappy. It wasn't lucky that I bought this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!! What a book! James Patterson does it again.","review":"Based on the title, I did not think I would like this book. James Patterson made the characters come to life. I know I would have liked Suzanne as a friend. I am sorry it took so long for me to buy it. The book was absolutely wonderful. It was a quick read -- I read it the same day I began it. Please do not read the end before you read the beginning. This is truly one book you may read over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book...TEARS WILL COME","review":"I got this book from my sister who knows I like to read James Patterson. I started reading it, and it got really good. James Patterson knows how to capture a reader, and knows how to tug at the heart. I've read some of his mysteries, and I now know that he can write romance as well. Keep up the good work!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very different for Patterson","review":"This book was amazing. From the moment I picked it up, I was captivated. If you're an avid fan of Patterson's Cross novels, this might not be the book for you. However, if you want to read something different and a real tear jerker this is the book for you. I hope that everyone enjoys this as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas","review":"This book is SO VERY DIFFERENT to the normal James Patterson books which entail murder and plots etc. This is an extremely well written book and I loved reading it. (In fact, I loved reading it so much, I've re-read it about 3 times over). It is a romance novel but it is not a sloppy bleeding hearts romance at all. It is extremely sad and will tear at the heart strings. I can't rave enough about this book and in typical James Patterson style, there is abit of a twist to the storyline. But this really makes it all come together and is fantastic. I would strongly recommemened this book to anyone - not just James Patterson Fans!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. Brilliant writing with many surprises. Had me in tears. I highly recommend reading this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing...","review":"James Patterson can truly change his style of writing and this is not an exception. Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas is a tale of love, sadness, hope... I recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diary in a Bottle","review":"In this case, you can judge a book by its cover - or at least by its size. A slim volume holding a slim, insubstantial tale. After writing a series of unique and popular thrillers, Mr. Patterson has decided to rework the story of Message in a Bottle. Why would an author with hi$ own con$iderable following $witch to this mindle$$ romantic drivel? He $hould be embara$$ed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like it...","review":"I don't see how anyone can call this a surprise ending, this book had nowhere else to go from the very start; there was only one ending possible. Fans of John Irving's 'Prayer for Owen Meany' will know what I am talking about when I say that this offering from Patterson is 'made for television'. The parable about the five balls in the air was interesting, at least, although I fail to see what it has to do with this sappy love story. I hope Patterson checks this genre off on his 'to do' list and goes back to his strong suit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Different for Patterson but......","review":"While I am a fan of the author and appreciate the fact that he is branching out, I found this novel to be just a little too corny. I can also enjoy a well written love story, which this tries to be, but after finishing this book in one day, I felt as if there could have been much more. Somewhat predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-o bad","review":"Patterson's latest is his worst yet. I knew not to expect his usual, but this is beyond the pale. It reads like a serial in a woman's magazine. I can't help but imagine he, or someone close to him, has suffered heart problems and this self-serving, maudalin tripe is a result of reflections on that. I cannot believe the professional reviews. This is not merely lighthearted or breezy--it's just poorly developed and written. Where are Patterson's editors? Once you become a big name is there no one who will tell you when something needs a lot more work?"},{"rating":"1","title":"SAP!","review":"Is it just me or does the character Suzanne sound like a 13 year old most of the time? She's sweet, yes, but for someone who supposedly has been through so much, and is an intellegent doctor, she really lacks depth. I hate to trash anyone's hard work. It was a sweet love story, just not a very realistic one. Wait until you can check it out of the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back......","review":"I wish I had read the reviews before I picked up this stinker. I would like the author's address so I can return it to him. One book-like new-only thrown once. This was so contrived. I didn't like the way the author took such shortcuts to set a mood or describe a scene. He mentions a certain song or singer and you, the reader, are to do the work of imagining an image. The author name drops too much to save him the work of writing what he's trying to get me to see. He has no idea of how women really are. I'm usually a pretty good speed reader, but I was able to go through this at lightening rate, dispite my gagging at all the saccharine. I threw it against the wall at the end.Was this the result of the author losing a bet with someone?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Not much of a plot; a central male character who is portrayed as every woman's dream (tall, dark, handsome, sensitive, understanding and good in bed) but who nevertheless dumps his girlfriend in an unbelievably callous way for no good reason, two central female characters portrayed as intelligent professionals - one of them a doctor - who nevertheless can't handle contraceptives; and the perfect baby, who sleeps thought the night at 2 weeks old!!!! (This last bit the most unbelievable part for me.) The library had it filed under 'Crime Fiction' and I was waiting for the sudden twist, so you can understand how disappointed I was when it turned out to be Mills and Boone rather than vintage Patterson. IÄm only giving it one star because 'none' is not an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF TIME!!!","review":"I picked up this book from my mother who had raved about this sweet, quick read... WELL!!!! Although it didn't take long to get through this book, it was a COMPLETE waste of my time. The author opens the story as if the main character, Matt, did something terribly unforgivable to his wife, Suzanne. So, throughout the whole story, you wait in anticipation to discover what sort of horrible crime Matt committed and why Katie (Matt's girlfriend and recipient of the diary) questions Matt's character. Basically, the book builds up to NOTHING!! What a LETDOWN!!! I would never, ever recommend this book to anyone and I still can't figure out what my mother liked it... hmmm... it must've been Matt's surreal romantic character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse Book I've Ever Read","review":"This has to be the worse book I've ever read. Someone paid James Patterson a lot of money for this drivel. It is not only sappy and unrealistic, it is also so very badly written. Worse than a first novel - my 10 year old niece writes stories with more depth. My theory is that James Patterson made a bet with someone that he could write a romantic book from a woman's point of view that would be a bestseller, and that he won his bet and is laughing at us. The fact that this is a bestseller is extremely discouraging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Sappy For This Author","review":"I was expecting some more of James Patterson's Excitement. I was totally disapointed . It is a hoaky and predictable love story.I did not feel connected to any of the characters. References to Ally McBeal Maybe he should write for Harequin Paperbacks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just beautiful","review":"You could read this book in a flight from LA to San Diego. You'll hate Matt at the beginning but you have to understand why he did what he did. While reading the diary you'll cry, if you have them you'll have reveries about your children's first days. You'll laugh a lot and you'll cry a little but you'll hate Matt a little bit more, every page you read you'll hate him more and more... till the end that you'll understand why he did what he did and that worth the reading of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saptrap","review":"I was sorely disappointed. This book is implausible, starting with the notion that a new mother/physician has time to write lengthy stories to her baby. Then there's the perfect man/housepainter who's absolutely too good to be true. Aspects of the plot seemed unconnected. What did meeting at John Kennedy Jr's wedding, or the lawyer Matt have to do with anything else? Lastly, some phrases were repeated ad nauseum. I wonder how many times \\"Susannah, Nicholas, and Matt forever\\" appeared in the text? (from a real mother of two/wife of thirty years/physician)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Suzanne's Drivel....","review":"This book was predictable from the get go. I knew the ending within 10 minutes and was relieved when it finally came. I skimmed a large portion of the book because it was nothing but the same sappy diary entries over and over and over again. Suzanne's voice is not believable. It's as if Patterson forgot that the character was writing to her child. God help me if my mother ever gives me the juicy details of my parents first time.Even if you're a dedicated fan of romance I would say this one is a gamble. Its only saving grace is that it's short."},{"rating":"1","title":"life is too short!","review":"I read this book this weekend and all I can say is - DON'T! Unless you are housebound and this is the ONLY reading material you can find and you have already alphabetized your soup cans and organized your sock drawer -- PUT IT DOWN! This is embarrassingly awful. Life is too short to waste time on this sort of thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story that touched my broken heart!","review":"After reading this book I recommended, well begged my best friend to read it, as you can see from her review, (wenmille). I loved it and she hated it. Well, I believe everyone is entitled to their opinion but sometimes I think it just refreshing to sit down with a good tear jerker. After losing my boyfriend I found that I could relate to this story and that it actually gave me hope. I'm not saying that this is one of Patterson's better pieces of work, especially for those who are used to his other books, but why bash him for trying to reach others by touching their hearts, even if they did tend to meet at Caroline and John's wedding."},{"rating":"2","title":"And Alex Cross Isn't Even Mentioned","review":"For those of you who like me got tired of Patterson's pattern for writing, this book is perfect. It is a beautiful story about love and not so mushy that men won't enjoy reading it. After some coaxing from me and my boyfriend's mother we got him to read it and he loved it as well. The story is delightful and touching."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fabulous Read!!!","review":"I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!! Suzanne's Dairy for Nicholas by James Patterson was one of my favorite books this year!! This was a wonderful a moving novel that so poignantly tells a story of love and love lost!! I was pregnant with my first child when I read this book, so I was especially touched and empathic to such raw emotion on so many levels.This is a light read which kept me guessing right up to the end. I had never read any of James Patterson's books before so I had no idea what to expect...I was pleasantly surprised!!You will not be diappointed!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This is a very sappy book. The charactersare one dimensional and the relationships arecompletely unbelievable. It is a very easyread but is not worth spending your time andmoney on."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books","review":"I was encouraged to read this book by a friend, and I did it reluctantly. I was surprised, however, that it was actually a lot worse than I had imagined it would be. How this book could even be published is beyond me. The writing quality is so poor and so elementary, I cannot believe Mr. Paterson is such a respected author. This is one of the worst books I've ever read with a sad attempt to be a romantic novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel","review":"This was a very formulaic novel, which will no doubt earn its author a great deal of money. Trite, already done, not terribly complex. An easy, quick read, but found myself gagging throughout much of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreck with a capital D","review":"I cannot begin to say how much I disliked this book. If not for the fact that I had to read it to lead a book discussion group, I'd have burned this copy so it wouldn't find its way into someone else's hand. The only thing I can imagine is that Patterson had a yacht payment due and needed the money, hence this drivel. An embarrassment to anyone over the age of 13, this book has little to commend it. Sophmoric writing, telegraphed plot, namedropping, cliches left and right...I can't even recommend it as a decent beach read, unless you intend to cast it out on the ocean afterward.To paraphrase Dorothy Parker, this book should not be put aside lightly--it should be thrown against a wall with great force.I'd like some stars of my own for having survived reading this!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst book I've ever read","review":"I find it hard to believe this book makes people cry. I couldn't keep from rolling my eyes, cringing and groaning throughout. Completely unrealistic. Unsympathetic characters. Stupid \\"twists\\" (the two Matts -- give me a break). Like a previous reviewer, I have never written an online review, but I feel compelled to do my part to save people from this book. I'm not opposed to a romantic \\"tear-jerker\\": ten years ago I sobbed uncontrollably on a bus while reading \\"The Bridges of Madison County.\\" But THIS book, well, take your pick of adjectives: cheesy, schlocky, sappy, stupid. In a word: bad. (And not the good kind of bad.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, please.","review":"I'm sorry -- this is someone's work. It came out of a personal experience. But it stunk. I know this is the type of book to be hailed as a great love story, a 3-hanky tear jerker, with just oodles of depth and human emotion. It'll most certainly be a reading-group staple. It's simply awful. It's loaded with cliches, characters that are simply not to be believed -- down to the baby. Even HE was idealized to the point of making the reader think, \\"oh come ON now,\\" when you'd read something. But honestly, I think I could have stomached this more if it weren't for the wink. Gag. At least the main character didn't wear sandals, or have his shirt constantly tacked to his body with his manly sweat. I'd say,skip it. There are better fluff books to take to the beach, that are plain old fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word....\\"pap\\"","review":"Honestly, this reads like dime store romance novel. Each character is perfect in every way...save the predictable tragic death(s). Each is beautiful, sensitive, intellegent, talented, from wealthy backgrounds, yadda, yadda, yada. Even Suzanne can't help but compliment herself repeatedly throughout her diary. She breaks her arm patting herself on the back about how \\"lucky\\" she is in every way. Even the baby is \\"perfect\\". Suzanne happily calls him \\"showoff\\" when he holds a bottle at 2 months, rides around on the back of her bicycle at less than a year, and speaks numerous words before his first birthday. Give me a break. My teeth hurt."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was unappealing","review":"I read this book with dismay and increasing disappointment as the plot meandered. I have read other books by this author and found them interesting and enjoyable. This book, however, missed the target. Although the story line might have gone somewhere, it didn't and quickly became indigestable nonsense. You wanted to care for the characters, but you were not led there; they and the story were very superficial. The ending was predictable and unappealing. I would be very careful in selecting other books by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I promised myself I'd never pick up another James Patterson novel after reading the ridiculous ending in \\"Roses are Red.\\" However, I decided to give him one more chance with \\"Diary.\\" This book is a cross between \\"Bridges of Madison County\\" (which is actually referenced in the book) and \\"Love Story.\\" Sappy, improbable, and at times, it seems that the author has not paid attention to what he has written. For example, Suzanne frets about telling her lover that she recently had a heart attack. Evidently it doesn't occur to her that, during their lovemaking, he has probably noticed the scars from her recent heart bypass surgery. After years of reading Patterson novels, I hate to say it, but this book was a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much ado about nothing","review":"This is the worst book I have read in years. The characters were one-dimensional and full of self pity. The book itself was flat like day old soda. If I ever hear the term \\"isn't it lucky\\" again it will be too soon.Patterson should stick to writing mysteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNEXPECTED","review":"I JUST WIPED THE TEARS AWAY AFTER FINISHING PATTERSONS LATEST EFFORT. I WASN'T SURE I WANTED TO READ THIS TITLE SINCE MY USUAL GENRE IS MYSTERY, BUT I AM SO GLAD I DID. I THOUGHT IT WAS LIFE AFFIRMING AND FULL OF HOPE AND SIMPLE."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment!","review":"The premise of the story was good enough but this book was way too syrupy for me. My suggestion - don't waste your time reading this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Syrupy, Too Predictable","review":"This is definitely not the worst book I've ever read - but it certainly isn't one of the best. \\"Suzanne's Diary...\\" too often reads like the smarmiest of self help books. Every page is packed with cloying life lessons, cliched explanations of joy or sadness (\\"...happiness flooded our hearts and every room of the beach cottage. It came like the high tide on a full moon\\"), and enough warm sentiment to make you gag. The whole book is designed to warm your heart and change your life - but goes about it in such a way that you feel like it's being shoved down your throat. The worst part is how predictable the book is. From page one it is easy to see exactly where the story is going, and Matt's \\"secret\\" about his past with Suzanne is not hard to figure out. I'm sure there are people out there who would love this book for the very qualities I just denounced - and in its favor I will say that the book is at least a very fast, light read. For me, it's just too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Finished It - Don't Ask Me Why","review":"Given that I rather enjoyed Sam's Letters to Jennifer, I thought I would have a similar affinity for Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas. I have often been wrong in my life; for instance, when I assumed this.I knew what was going to happen in this book from about the fifth page. There wasn't a single surprise in this novel, effusive jacket-blurbs to the contrary notwithstanding. I saw every situation coming from a mile away. I would have thrown it against the wall in disgust, except that I kept hoping that it would improve, and that I would leave it with the feeling that I took away from Sam's Letters to Jennifer. No such luck. Blessedly, the font is so large and the chapters so short that it is only about as long as a good-sized New Yorker article (and isn't nearly as demanding), so it only takes about an hour to read. Barring a rave review from someone I trust, it will be the last hour I spend with Patterson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it","review":"I loved Sam's Letters to Jennifer, even though I like Patterson's mysteries much better. But this novel is just so sappy and unrealistic. No one is that perfect, no relationship is that perfect. You come to hate these characters! And it is so boring and predictable. You can predict exactly how it will end! Terrible, awful! This book is a bad imitation of a Nicholas Sparks novel. Don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a genuine love story","review":"i thought this book was great. i loved the format and the unfolding of the story. i have to admit that i gave the book four stars instead of five simply because there were times that i knew that the book was written by a man and not a woman. for example, when suzanne found out she was pregnant with nicholas... she calls matt and tells him over the phone and asks him to bring home an EPT test so they can be sure. do women who are seriously in love really announce the birth of their baby that way?the story didn't make me cry, but i was compelled to keep turning the pages! not only did it make me want to check out martha's vineyard, but i am ready to taste one of patterson's thrillers now."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 1/2 stars actually - a nice change for Patterson","review":"As a longtime Patterson reader, I know he can write, but this style surprised me. This is real different for him, as we are used to the fast crime dramas he puts out. It was still an enthralling and a fast read, and yes had those short chapters that tempt you to \\"read just one more.\\" it can easily be a weekend book.We discussed it in book club, mainly the ending, and we didn't all agree on whether we liked the ending or not. A well written romance, albeit sad in parts. Read it and decide for yourself. I liked it and recommend it for romance lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't love it more!","review":"This is now one of my top ten favorites. I was truly engrossed in the book and could not put it down. Patterson put himself in the league of Nicholas Evans concerning love stories. I highly recommend this title to anyone who enjoys a heart-warming love story."},{"rating":"2","title":"James is that you?","review":"WOW! Didn't know such a soft sensitive side of James existed. I was waiting for someone to come up dead or some kind of plot twist. All kidding aside it was a very sweet book. A little on the Nicholas Sparks stlye of writing but overall I liked it. I thought it was a sweet story and it made you feel sad for all the characters. I guess James Patterson needed a break from all that murder mystery writing to write a sweet, touching, love story. I confess I needed quite a bit of Kleenex by the time the last pages were turned. I recomend this book especially if you need emotional purging, this book is on point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy & Cheesy.","review":"What a surprise! I have expected more from a well-known novelist. This book reads like a Harlequin Romance. It is overly simple, completely unrealistic, as if the author wore pink shades while forming his characters. Everybody in the book is too perfect, all the relationships are so melodramatically wonderful. The book is an easy cheesy read that's for sure but has no literary value!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Like It At All","review":"If you are a diehard James Patterson fan this is not the book for you. The plot was totally uninteresting. Why couldn't Matt tell Katie the truth he was sleeping with her and having a relationship with her why the lack of candor it boggles the mind. By the time I finishing reading this book I didn't feel sympathy for none of the characters in the book. James Patterson needs to stick to what he knows.

For starters, it was just poorly written. But add to this: a complete lack of thought-provoking ideas, sap so thick that you could boil it and make maple syrup, and a completely uninteresting plot.I enjoyed the diary concept that the author employed in this book. But save yourself the trouble and rent a movie. I can almost guarantee that you'll get more out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will The Real James Patterson Please Return","review":"Suzanne's Diary For Nicholas is a sweet love story, but it's not another Bridges Over Madison County which was a GREAT love story. The book was simply confusing and not at all worthy of Patterson at his best. Matt is the central character, who in the beginning has apparently broken the hearts of two women...Suzanne and Katie, the woman he has been having an affair with. As the \\"diary\\" unfolds we learn more of the gushy details of his life with Suzanne while Katie the most current girlfriend agonizes over his past. The \\"romantic\\" ending makes Matt look silly and transforms a good guy into a real sap.Please bring back Alex Cross and a wonderfully suspenseful series that James Patterson brought to life for his readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish from Pollyanna Patterson","review":"If there were a lower ranking of 1 star, I would assign it to this waste of paper and typesetting.

The story was supposed to be endearing but came off as cheap, shallow sappy drivel that was disconnected. The writing seemed to shoot for vivid and picturesque but only achieved remedial. I finished it only to formulate a complete opinion. That's HOURS of my life I will never get back. These books are like a champagne hangover, every few years we do it and then say 'Never Again.' I hope I can remember this in a few years.I recommend Laurel K.

I found myself insulted by the story's predictability, as well as the format used by the author; Addressing every entry of the Diary \\"Nicky\\", etc. became irritatingly redundant and insulting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy","review":"We read this book for our book club, and the only person who liked the book was the one who recommended it. The characters were not real - just a little too perfect. The author did a terrible job trying to capture a woman's point of view - his tone/style sounded the same whether he was writing the diary for Suzanne or Matt.The most positive comment from our book club was that this book gives hope to aspiring authors, because if it made it to the best sellers list, then they have a chance as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your time","review":"I am not sure why or how this got published - it is boring and sappy.

I would rate this a zero if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Unlucky' Sappy Drivel","review":"One star only for how 'luckily' short this book is. I got queasy from the unbelievable sugar-coating and smarm. And unbelievable it is. Not based in reality, and certainly no depth. I bought this book based on the Today Show interview and was expecting to be moved or at best, entertained. Neither happened. This is not a thinking womans read, nor a sensitive mans 'time well spent'. Save your money. Wait for the made-for-T.V. late night movie when you have a bout of insomnia. It should clear up by the 3rd commercial break. Ouch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An unforgettable love story.","review":"How good is this novel? Good enough to tingle your heart into the night with shear delight. The novel is layered with sentiment and simple spiritual truths, while acknowledging the reality of pain, healing and loss. This novel is a departure from the thrillers he is known for, but readers will be pleased to find fast-paced suspense in this love story. Though there's not a murder to be found amongst any of the pages, readers will find the familiar short chapters and surprising twists that they've come to expect from him, while those just looking for a good love story will find it here too. This novel captures beautifully the joys of a new family interlaced into an unforgettable love story.

Some of the parts were a little sappy, but overall, a story I don't think I will ever forget. Keep some tissues nearby while reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"...5 stars for the concept, 2 for the book","review":"I have to admit...this book was a real let down. The idea was fabulous, five star. I looked forward to it for months. Unfortunately, the book was too poorly written to do the story justice.The diary was totally unbelieveable (how many of us refer to our spouses by their names, when speaking to our children, rather than by \\"Daddy\\" or \\"Mom\\"? Patterson does this through the whole book). As well, Patterson writes the story with a real male (forgive me guys...) lack of feeling. At no time did I feel any sorry for the anyone in the book, as I never really saw them as people. These two very huge issues left the book unsatisfying and almost boring.Again, I thought the subject was terrific and could have been done very, very well....best seller material. But, I truly feel I could have written a better version (which is not saying a whole lot)...but I really would have loved to read the book had it been written by someone really good, like Lavryle Spencer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Icky poo","review":"This was a saccharine, annoying book.

All I can say is yuck - I can only stand so much syrupy, sentimental goo."},{"rating":"2","title":"touching","review":"I have never read a book by James Patterson, but I felt this was a tear jerker. It was moving and heart wrenching at the same time. I would definetly recommend it. It is an extremely quick reading. I was engulfed in each character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy","review":"I'm obviously the only person that found this book disturbing. I mean come on, you think you're in love, he disappears and leave you a book written by his DEAD wife! Nobody else found that to be creepy? I didn't find it romantic or sweet, just weird. Of course he loved his DEAD wife and child. Of course you're never going to live up to her. Just get over it and find a man without so much emotional baggage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwrought and predictable...","review":"The so-called foreshadowing used by the author just knocked me over the head..by page 30 I already knew how it ended. The overwrought love story glosses over the affair, and fails to explain we such a happy husband with such a perfect wife would seek an extra-marital affair in the first place. The ending was highly improbable, as if Katie's pregnancy could some how replace the loss of Nicholas (which by the way, who didn't know he was already dead by the time the diary started?) Don't waste your time crying over this one..especially if you are a woman with a history of heart disease and an unfaithful husband."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or your money.","review":"Cheezie book!!! How dare James Patterson make reference to Bridges of Madison County and use the beautiful and trajic love story of John Kennedy and Jacqueline Bisset Kennedy to sell this shallow nothing of a so called novel. If offends me for him to try to equate this with \\"Bridges\\". Not even in the same galaxy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Once you start you just can't stop!!!","review":"This book was absolutely amazing. I can't believe James Patterson! He was able to capture the true feelings of a woman...not an easy task! Throughout the entire book, I found myself in awe of his ability to speak the female heart. This is one of those books I just had to finish. I couldn't get to the end fast enough. What a sweet, crazy, twisted, romantic, heartfelt story! The writing was carefully planned out and I would recommend this book to anyone...without hesitation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Did I mis-Read, I thought the author was Nicholas Sparks???","review":"I am absolute lover of a good mystery novel entwined with love and adventure. Besides being a James Patterson fan, I am also a lover of Nicholas Sparks (Message In a Bottle, A Bend In the Road) and John Grisham. When I read the last page of Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas I looked over at my husband and said \\"Honey, I seriously beleive Nicholas Sparks and James Patterson are the same person.\\"This novel made me cry, laugh and reminded me to call my love ones to just say HI. I read this book from cover to cover TWICE in one week! Two Beautiful stories linked into one book with a touching ending. A true masterpiece.Seriously, though....Is James Patterson really Nicholas Sparks....Hmmmmmmm....Read for yourself to see if you agree..."},{"rating":"1","title":"suzanne's diary for nicholas","review":"I have one word for this book, lame!. It was Love Story, Jonathan Livingston Seagull and The Bridges of Madison County all wrapped in one poorly written novel. It is loaded with erroneous information, such as: a two month old baby holding his own bottle, a one year old baby speaking many words and my favorite, radiation therapy for weakened heart valves! I bought this book as my library had 729 holds on it. After reading it, I lent it to my daughter without comment and she read the book and had the same opinion, lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment!!!","review":"I have read just about every Patterson book, so you can imagine how disappointed I was with this one. It's cool to explore a different genre, but in so doing why not use some of the devices that made the old one work so well. How about interesting, multidimesional characters, how about twists and turns of plot, how about some conflict and tension in the love relationship, how about some good old-fashioned realism. This was just a tad to syrupy sweet for my tastes. It was a page-turner, though, I kept turning waiting for something unpredictable to happen, a total shocker. Alex Cross, where are you????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This book was horribly written. After reading the first 10 pages, I knew it was going to be terrible. I finished it just because I wanted to know how it would end. It was an okay story line, but terribly written. I could not believe that James Patterson even allowed this book to be published. He should be ashamed. It was written only for the money, and he is obviously making money from it, but I would be embarrassed to have my name attached to such a terrible piece of writing. I have loved his other novels and was shocked at the lack of quality in this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"sappy beyond belief","review":"It must be my age,but I know no men like Matthew and quite frankly I am glad I don't. I love sensitive men but this guy is just too much. I also figured out the book by the second chapter. I read it all for a bookgroup discussion; out of 30 of us ,of ages 20 thru 78, only one liked it and she was 20.I was also thouroughly sick of poor Susannah and could not believe she'd write love scenes for her son to read later. Not many people want to know about their parents' love life. I love my children immensely but would never gush over them as she and Matt did. I am assured by my sons,both of whom were suckered into reading this book also, that they were glad I was \\"normal\\". Oh well, to each his own. I am glad James P. s getting some good reviews for his new genre. I do enjoy most of his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You Like Nicholas Sparks~You Might Like This","review":"I know James Patterson has been receiving some acclaim for stepping outside of his normal genre & I know that the inspiration for this story is based on his own personal loss of love. However, that is the only reason I can come up with to give this novel 2 stars. I'm all for a sweet romance, but this was too much. The writing was too syrupy and the \\"pop culture\\" references were corny. I found it tacky that he used JFK Jr & Carolyn Bissette Kennedy as the means to which his main characters met one another. If you are a fan of Nicholas Sparks writing, you may enjoy this one, but both are a little much for me. I really wanted to like this one, because the concept the novel was written in was clever (as a diary) and the story could have been a tear jerker, but I didn't get to feel for the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"James Patterson Lets Me Down Hard!","review":"I watched with anticipation a TV interview with Patterson on his latest novel, Suzanne's Diary For Nicholas, and bought it. I have long read and enjoyed his suspenseful crime novels. Now I realize this was a departure. But I found it to be sophomoric, soapy, deadly dull, altogether a very disappointing read. I felt suckered in and resented it. I hope to save others from getting ripped off. Save your money and wait for his new release coming out this fall. Truly, it could have been written by a student assistant (might have been). I started to just abandon the story, but decided to stick it out to the bitter and predictable end. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This book is really, really good! It may start off a little slow but soon you will be hooked and won't be able to put the book down.

Why it's on the best seller's list I will never understand. In short, this book is a made for TV movie on paper. The plot is obvious and the writing is juvenile. The author does not convince this reader that a woman was writing in a journal. What the author has convinced this reader of, however, is that books will be published if the author is sellable, not the work."},{"rating":"2","title":"very moving","review":"An excellent book, straight from the heart.The only reason why it is not more stars from me, is that it is very very short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas","review":"This was a very moving love story. I could place people that I knew in similiar situation within this book. This made me really feel the emotions that the characters and my friends were going through. I read this book within a day and I am very grateful that I did. I haven't been moved by a love story in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cor ny, cor ny, cor ny!","review":"Although this book did keep some interest to read it fairly quickly; I still thought it was the corniest book I ever did read. It is about a mother writing to her son, a mere baby; yet she is writing about the first time she and his father were passionate. What child would want to read about their parents doing that?????? He continually wrote one particular line: Suzanne, Nicholas, and Matt forever. I felt like I was reading some highschool yearbook. I couldn't get over the fact that a man wrote all this mushy nonsense. The only reason I did not give this only one star was because it wasn't completely boring; just not very good either. I do not recommend this book unless you enjoy a dorky kind of mushy goofy romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Been there","review":"I had the fortunate experience of meeting Mr. Patterson at a book signing in NJ. The story intrigued me because I too lost my first wife only to find happiness years later. My wife read the book and it gave her a sense of what I went through years ago. I can imagine how hard it was for you to put your experience into words. Thank you Mr. Patterson for writing a book that will always remain close to my heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will the real James Patterson please stand up!","review":"Wow! I bought the book for my Father-in-law who has been reading James Patterson books for the last 2 years. Maybe to kill 3 hours and while away my time before a 12-hour flight back to Manila from Paris, I pored through the book knowing the popularity of JP books, some of which I saw on film. I finished the book in 2 hours and realized in the end that it was a waste of time. I should have slept in the airport lounge and could have come out fully rested. First, the storyline was not original. Second, the names were very confusing, 2 Matts in one book???? Third, what's with all the italicized words? Fourth, what happened to Children Rhymes and limericks of love for titles? I really believe Mr. Patterson submitted his daughter's work to his editor and got away with it. tsk tsk tsk.

What is up with this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Patterson sold out","review":"Is there a writer out there who went down hill as fast as Patterson? His first five or six novels were page-turners; I bought them the day they showed up on the bookstore shelf. Then he sold out and started writing fluff like this. That was bad enough, but to add insult to injury he decided to let people trade on his name. Why do writers do that? Why does Patterson let people put their name on the front cover of a book so that an unknown can sell a few copies? Is it to put some extra money in his pocket? He's got more money than God so that can't be it. It makes no sense. I'll never buy another book that he writes or has ghost-written. He's everything that's wrong with novelists today"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather Cheesy and Predictable Love Story","review":"I could see how lame this book was going to be after the initial couple of chapters. I could also predict the ending with more precision than any other Patterson novel I've read. Not that there weren't some nice twists and turns in the middle, but the book was just plain nauseating. I lost track of how many times Suzanne mentioned how happy and perfect everything was in her life.This certainly isn't your normal Patterson novel, so proceed with caution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas was a let down.","review":"I have read many of James Patterson's books and have enjoyed them very much however I was very disappointed with this book. This book was short and easily read in two sittings and (not that I like long drawn out stores), throughout the book I had the feeling that it was quickly written just to get another book published. The book also kind of irked me because it was filled with names of people and places that were dropped throughout the book with the attempted pretense of being \\"cool\\". The twists and turns that Patterson is usually expert in creating were dissappointing and predictable. The story was charming but I couldn't shake the feeling that it's been done before. Perhaps if I enjoyed reading \\"romance novels\\" I would have liked this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas","review":"The paper cover of the book was in very bad condition; however the book itself was fine.

I really liked and i recomend."},{"rating":"1","title":"insultingly simple and sweet","review":"First of all, I like his suspense books, and I like a good romance, but this book is a pathetic attempt to cash in on the Bridges of Madison County, Message in A Bottle type of book.

I would say, pass on the book, and wait for the movie which will undoubtedly follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hackdom knows no bounds.","review":"If he isn't busy killing off women with menace, now he's killing all of us with this syrupy, trite garbage. Patterson would be the first to tell us he's a serious writer, but put this in the heap with the worst of Danielle Steele and Jackie Collins. But hey, it's that time of year when his name has disappeared from the best-selling lists, and so here comes another work that took about 20 minutes to put together. Bridges of Madison County looks like a Nobel prize winner by comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Drivel","review":"I bought this book because I read the great reviews : boy was that a mistake. I was robbed when I parted with my $ for this dreadful book. The story was a sickly sweet, sugary, bubblegum tale of pure drivel.I hung in there until the bitter end waiting for something to catch my interest but it never happened.If there were any tears to shed it was tears of joy that I had finally finished it !The most nauseating part in the whole book is when she refers to her baby son Nicky as \\"Nickey Mouse\\"..oh please !I wish that instead of buying this book I had put my money towards a big slice of cake ..that is the type of sugar and sweetness that I do like to digest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short, Sweet, Predictable Yet Endearing","review":"This very quick read(however, which Patteson novel isn't?)and while the story is quite predictable, it was still very moving and enjoyable. While I liked all of the characters in the story, the idea of this idyllic living was a bit farfetched. Certainly not the real world as most people know it. I will continue to read James Patterson as soon as his novels are published."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should come with a warning for new moms","review":"Although I enjoyed this book very much I do think that new Mothers and expectant mothers should be warned that it is a tear jerker. Although most of the novel is very upbeat and cheerful, some of the book is very sad and touching.It is a very good novel and like most good novels I thought about the book and its characters for more than a week after reading it and part of me wishes that I could know some of the characters better or even write my own ending for them.I would recommend this book - but proceed with caution if you have young children or your are expecting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A page-turner.","review":"I came across this book and I was taken back, I thought \\"James Patterson isn't he the guy that wrote the Alex Cross series.\\" I decided to pick up this novel and read it, as the book jacket was so intriguing to me.

She can't understand why everything in their relationship seemed to be going so well until a diary arrives from Matt about a new mother Suzanne. Through Suzanne's diary of her new marriage and child, Katie begins to understand Matt.I have recommended this book to numerous friends and family members. Everyone has only good things to say.

As the prior reviews have stated, it is shallow, Hallmark-esque, trite, cliched, tired and dumb.

No more. What a disappointment and waste of time! Too many inconsistencies to mention here.

It seems that the author was simply trying to fill the pages with words - forget about literary style!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, horrible book!!!","review":"This book was so bad I can't believe it was published. The characters were completely unbelievable. Everyone in the book is perfect with perfect thoughts and perfect experiences. The best part of the book is knowing that baby Nicholas would not have to be raised by his gushing, idiotic mother who obviously had read (and believed) too many Harlequin romance novels. Also, having experienced some of the problems that this woman supposedly did during delivery I can tell you that the descriptions of those problems and how they were solved were completely inaccurate. I felt embarrassed for the author the entire time that I was reading this book. I have never read a James Patterson novel before this one, and I never will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hooray!","review":"I always wondered if I could write a novel, and after reading this bestselling travesty I am certain that I can!

Unfortunately, he has not been able to successfully transfer this ability to the subtle, character-driven style necessary for his latest endeavor. The book is a disaster! The characters are cloying and two-dimensional. The minimal plot is practically non-existant and thoroughly predictable. Don't waste your time...."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time","review":"I read this book in three hours, and have never read a more sappy and poorly written book in my life. It reminded me of a love story I read when I was in the 6th grade; it sounded like a 6th grader wrote it. I have never read one of Mr. Patterson's books before, but know they are extremely popular. I couldn't believe that his writing skills were so poor - is this how all his books are written? And what is with his use of italics? Can't he get his point across without them? They show up every few sentences - very annoying. The storyline, although based on a true story, was so overtly mushy, was his point to depress readers?

This book is very amatuer, predictable, boring, and nauseatingly \\"sweet\\", so much so that it's almost fake. The way that it's written and the phrases used makes it sound as if a 15 year old wrote it about her first crush. I figured out the ending after about page 30, and spent the rest of the book wishing that he would just get it over with already. A very very disappointing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful story full of passion, loss, and new love!","review":"This book is one of the best stories I have read in a VERY VERY long time!

As other reviewers have said, it's just page after page of melodramatic romantic cliches and flat characters. I thought the characters in this book were just cardboard, one-dimensional saps. I felt no connection to thm at all.Note to mention, the the poetry (I use the term loosely) that \\"Matt\\" wrote was painfully, page-skippingly bad.Even a mediocre story can be saved by great writing and an ear for good dialogue and romance. Unfortunately, this book isn't one of those gems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gag me with a rubber-coated spoon","review":"This sappy story of love and tragedy has no basis in reality.

Don't waste your time on this sentimental drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Shallow Hallmark Card","review":"This book is a shallow as today's bad Hollywood love stories. It's contrived and insultingly lacking in depth. His characters say things like \\" Aren't we lucky? Life is so precious.\\" and\\" Don't be a cynic... anything but that.\\" Page after page of corny, shallow diaologue and happy, happy people. The end had me laughing and that certainly wasn't the response Mr. Patterson was after. Mostly, I'm put off with how saintly Patterson depicts his heroine. I mean here is a diary that even in it's dark moments is sweet, loving and perfect. Anger doesn't exist in this diary ever. There is no PMS, no difficulty paying the bills, or stress of being a mother while working full time. I'll stick with Maya Angelou when I want a life affirming message from a woman. Maya at least comes from a real place, while Patterson's puts on a woman's point of view like a man dressed in drag."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was rolling my eyes by the end.....","review":"I thought this book was horribly predictable. The concept could have worked but the characters were transparent. If you are looking for light summer reading go with this book but it will go quickly, it is a real easy read. If you are looking for a well-written, thought-provoking book, do not go for James pattersons newest novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring Back Alex Cross!","review":"This has got to be the worst book I have read this year. Mr. Patterson, whose books I normally LOVE, has tried to write a romance novel a la Nicholas Sparks. The book goes back and forth between Katie (present time) and Suzanne's diary for Nicholas, whom we find out is Katie's boyfriend's wife and Nicholas is their son. Oh the angst, oh the unhappiness. Is it a tragic love story? Yes. Is there a happy ending? You'll have to read it to find out, however, I'd wait for the paperback or even just borrow it from the library. Nicholas Sparks fans may love this book, but that's iffy 'cause I liked Sparks first two novels and this is not up to par with those.I can respect Mr. Patterson for trying something new, but give it up! Go back to the thrillers!Thanks for reading! ~Pandora"},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy Much?","review":"This book is rubbish! Not to mention a bit creepy. What mom writes about her sexual encounters in a diary meant for her son? The characters were flat, annoying, and completely unrealistic. The plot was... nonexistent.

Entertaining at times. A quick read. This was my first James Patterson book. I understand he has some really good ones. I should have started with something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nicholas Sparks-esque but not nearly as good","review":"I read this book on a recommendation from a friend and while the story was sad and at times, romantic, the whole diary format was a little irritating - who writes full dialogues in a diary? If Suzanne was truly keeping a diary, it should have been editorialized synopses of events rather than an exact play-by-play of every word spoken. And I don't know any mother who details past romances for their children - why would they care. I think that was the most annoying part of the book and I just couldn't past it. The story would have been better told by Nicholas Sparks - I didn't shed a tear and I am usually sobbing after every Sparks novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light, fun read, but not a *good* book","review":"This book reminded me a lot of \\"Bridges of Madison County.\\" It was overdone and corny to the max.

Bleh."},{"rating":"1","title":"I loved to hate this book or visa versa.","review":"Have you noticed people either love this book or hate it. I disliked it for many of the reasons already expressed; it is predictable and contrived with little in the characters to which I could be attracted. I read this book because a colleague of mine thought it was the best book he had read in a long time. Despite my opinion being diametrically opposed to his, I think it gives some insight into what people want in a sappy romance. We like beautiful, clean, well educated, empathetic people who can fall in love with each other. Unfortunately the wrapper in this case is as paper thin as its characters. I give it two stars only because there will always be large part of many readers including a small part of me who will be drawn inexplicably to this sort of 'novel by recipe' e.g. Love Story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quit Bashing Suzanne's Diary For Nicholas","review":"Although this book is predictable, it is still a touching love story which is very well-written. This book reduced me to tears and reduced my mother to tears on two occasions. Just because it's predictable doesn't mean it won't suck you in and make you feel the character's emotions. If you like James Patterson, if you like stories about love, or if you just enjoy a good book, I recommend Suzanne's Diary For Nicholas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this Patterson book!","review":"As I read this book, I kept wondering why Katie didn't just go to the end of Suzanne's Diary and find out JUST WHAT had happened to her?? I found the fact that she didn't very annoying. Here she is supposed to be a smart book editor, and and a carpenter-and she sits around reading this diary given to her by her lover-for days-PLEASE. No one has that much patience when her heart has just been broken by her lover, Matt. I won't give away the ending-Patterson does that early on. I bought and read the book because I understood it to be a true story, based on Patterson's own life. I can't wait for his next book, Violets are Blue. I did enjoy his Where the Wind Blows, and 1st to Die-but as for this one, too sweet and cutsey. Maybe he should kneel down and ask for forgiveness from everyone who did not like the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad but Beautiful","review":"From the beginning, the novel leaves you in a gripping mystery.

I predicted everything. It had no more depth than the four-hundreth Daniel Steel-recipe. That Alex came back to her in the end and was merely waiting in the wings for her to \\"understand\\" was beyond hokey.

Not all choose to write them down is all. A heartwarming read about what we all would want from a courtship, marriage and motherhood, but do men like Matt really exist?"},{"rating":"1","title":"too good to be true","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I bought for an easy summer read but was wanting my money back by half way. First of all, why 2 men named Matthew? It is fiction, use a different name. Secondly, there is no one that perfect as the main male character. Matt was made out to be so perfect, it was not believeable. It was too sappy, and the ending, come on. Patterson should have left the child alone. She was the perfect mother, she wouldn't have endangered her child if she was that ill. And another thing....when Suzanne first slept with Matt. She didn't tell him about her heart attack...well wouldn't he have seen the scars from the bypass surgery? This one's going to the library book sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love and Romance for the Supermarket Checkout","review":"This is an unabashedly horrible, horrible piece of creative expression that should have been ritually burned or thrown out to sea once it had been written. Trees should never have been cut down to provide the paper for this awful abortion of a narrative. Think how better the man- and womanhours that were spent publishing this book could have been spent--even aimless wandering behind just-off-the-interstate gas stations can tell you more about the human condition than this hardback excrement; read the litter strewn behind such a gas station--it will have more depth of soul, purpose, and humility. If there is a hell, this is the book they give you in the waiting room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nicholas Sparks-esque but not nearly as good","review":"I read this at the recommendation of a friend but just could not get into it - I found myself talking out loud about how ridiculous the diary format was - who documents entire conversations in a diary?

And I don't know any mother who tells their children of past romances - why would they care. The story would have been better told by Nicholas Sparks - I didn't even shed a tear in this book and I am usually sobbing at the end of a Nicholas Sparks novel.

Corny, contrived, predictable, and almost totally unreadable. Mr. Patterson has been slipping lately, but this time he has fallen completely off of the horse. I know this book will sell about a gazillion copies, but that don't make it art. It stinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful story","review":"I've never read a book by James Patterson as I prefer contemporary fiction and romance novels over other genre. However, if you enjoy books by Nicholas Sparks, Robert James Waller or Richard Paul Evans, Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas is a must read for you.Some may feel that the diary portion of the book depicts the relationship between Suzanne and Matt as a fairy tale. However, as a mother who has written letters to her children sporadically as they have grown up, I felt \\"her\\" entries were endearing. Many would agree that if you were to write something of this manner for your child, it should be about the wonderful ways they grew up and the special times that were shared with their family.This book would be best enjoyed on a lazy Saturday or Sunday afternoon when you have the time to devote to yourself, and don't forget your tissues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear Diary, What a waste of time I committed ...","review":"...when I read this trite, silly, pointless novel written by a guy who apparently thinks he knows how women think. As usual, however, when his female characters think, they think about some guy and how wonderful he is and how they live to make him happy and he should live to make her happy on and on and on ...I haven't read anything this overwraught and predictable since I stopped reading short stories ... The woman is always rich and beautiful and tragically wounded. The man, also rich and beautiful and tragically wounded, acts upon his grief or anger by doing something hurtful to the woman who loves him. Then the story is some pablum about how she either finds happiness with another man or he comes to his senses and woos her back....If I could give this book 0 stars, I would. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"HAVE YOUR SUGAR LEVELS TESTED AFTER THIS!!","review":"Let me say I'm one of the biggest romantics in the world and I love a heart-wrenching love story but this book could almost be considered a satire on love stories. The only part that really brought me to tears is when the dog died. How predicatable was this story especially when you realized Suzanne had a heart condition? How else could it have ended? Could Matt have been anymore perfect? He reminded me of a charactor I created for a short story in Junior High. Besides the charactors that never developed, the juvenille and saccharin writing style, the absurd thought that a mother would write of her romantic escapades in a diary to her child, I think what bugged me the most was Patterson's constant name dropping. It really sent the shallow feel of this story over the top. This was a real disappointment. I don't mean to insult anyone, but those who say this is the best book they have ever read really need to expand their choices in literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sickening","review":"The reader who said Suzanne's sappy letters to Nicholas were nauseating was right on the money! The book was way too consumed with these sickening letters and when Suzanne referred to Nicholas as \\"Nickey Mouse\\", that pretty much did me in.Boring, SAPPY and unoriginal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a heartfelt story that'll bring a tear to your eye","review":"I just finished reading this heartfelt book. The love these characters share just oozes from the pages. The story is written from both of the main female characters point of views. You can truly empathsize with each as you read. I must admit it is a page turner and a tear jerker. Having a 2 month old son of my own, I can definitely relate to the overwhelming love that Suzanne feels for her child and I felt compelled to cry at the end. If you are looking for a warm, heartfelt, easy reading love story than this is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This is certainly a change for James Patterson. I loved this book and could not put it down. When I got to the \\"Matthew\\" chapter and started reading, I had an idea of what happened but that did not stop the tears from falling. It is good to read something opposite from what I am use to reading from an author. I plan on reading this again because it is a book that you could read over and pick up details that you might have missed in the first reading. This book made me think of different things that has happened in my own life."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Waste of Time","review":"Along Came a Spider was so great.James Patterson should stick to what he knows best.I really tried to like this book.

Patterson focuses on only four characters, so I really got to know them. Katie, the reader of the diary; Matt, her boyfriend; Suzanne and baby Nicky were all developed well and I grew to love all of them immediately. I find it refreshing to read about truly nice people. This book is not complicated; I started it one night at 10 p.m. and kept going until I finished, about two hours later. It made me happy and reminded me about what was truly important in life. While these people are very nice, they are not perfect. We could all strive to be less work oriented and more family oriented. I could pretty much see what was coming throughout, but like the characters in the book, it is an honest, straightforward book about love and family that moved me."},{"rating":"1","title":"nazism rears its ugly head","review":"ok ive tried to keep an open mind about these guys. their music is incredible and intense however some of the lyrics on this cd are very troubling i honestly can't see this as anything more than pro nazi content. ive noticed hints of that in other places within the industrial music scene but noone has taken note of it. preachers are saying that during the end times anti semitism will grow laregly in europe which is where most industrial bands are from and although these guys are from nyc they have a strong german influence. ive been hoping these preachers are wrong but with third reich from the sun being such a hit my hopes are dimming. im also into punk and in the punk scene lyrics like that would [get you] kicked. i honestly hope im wrong about my assumptions regardling the bands beliefs but i just can't see that happening with lyrics like these. this is a very troubling sign of whats to come in the future for industrial. i hope the punk kids will speak out"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album by any measure!","review":"As great as Rammstein's music that of HG is a must for intelligent industrial metal listeners."},{"rating":"2","title":"The evolution in metal","review":"über alles continues the space odyssey that began with Transmission from Uranus with it's sci-fi style. now enter über alles. We are now into a very wagnerian space-opera. The music is furious, intense, and very breathtaking. The integration of industrial and metal music brought us to the mainstream Ministry, then White Zombie and then Static-X. Following the tradition of high quality industrial-metal, Hanzel ünd Gretyl can now claim the place of the best industrial-metal band. With the military-style Third Reich from the sun, the ultra-catchy ich bin über alles, the groovy komm zu ens to the decadant fury of SS Deathstar supergalactic (listen it right now. I'm serious), this album is sure to please everyone who can accept that putting electronic into metal is a good thing. This is the evolution of metal, and bands shouldn't fear using technology to do their music. Hanzel ünd Gretyl does it incredibly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing to say the least","review":"I have no idea what book the other reviewers read, but they must have gotten a different version of this book than I did. The brief sections on Ieyasu's rise to power and ultimate appointment to shogun and leader of a unified Japan in more comprehensive histories, namely Sansom's three volume series, provide more background, information and insight than this book. Not only is this book the most basic of introductory works on Ieyasu, but the style in which it is written is meandering and, at times, confounding. The entire book is full of flashbacks that would have supposedly taken place in Ieyasu's mind from just prior to his ascension to shogun until his death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Space Saver","review":"I love this product. I have a BMW with a USB Connect for my iPod in my center console. The console is very small and there is not much room.

Although you do need to put the whole thing in the freezer, that means you can just grab it and go. As our son got older, we were able to bring one bottle and a bit of food, either in the diaper bag or just in this bag. And it keeps everything cold for hours. One downside: although this product claims to be easy to clean, I am about to buy a new one after about a year and a half because the product has begun to smell since a bunch of milk spilled in there and sat for a while. We have not been able to get it clean and odor-free, despite wiping, soaking, etc. Until then, if a bit spilled, we just wiped it up when we got home, and everything was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the nursing mother","review":"This is a fantastic bottle holder.

The holder states on the packaging that items should stay cold up to 12 hours so that is why I purchased it. I followed the instructions and put it in the freezer a week prior to using it and I kept it out of the sun and heat. It did keep the milk cold for most of the trip; however, I was not confident in the milk from hours ten to twelve so I poured it out just in case the temperature was not cold enough. I did not want to risk getting my son sick if the milk was bad. Overall, I think the product was good but I would not rely on it for twelve hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed...","review":"I wanted to love this product but I couldn't. It's bulky since the ice pack is built into the cooler. Like other reviewer says, you have to put this whole thing in the freeze. So, it's big and cumbersome (can not fit into a diaper bag really) and holds very little. Good concept since it does stay cold for a long time but just not efficient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haven't used it yet","review":"I haven't needed to use it yet, as my baby isn't here yet (8 weeks to go!!) but it appears to be good quality.

I use it for night time storage. I don't feel it actually last for 12 hours. I put 2 bottles in the bag around 9-10PM each night. I usually warming the last bottle around 4AM each morning. I always hear watery sound, when I take the last bottle out of the bag. I guess the ice pack is already melted by then. This is inside a house with air conditioner on.

The title track will break your heart even if you've never been so fortunate as to have a couch dance. Lots of reworked cover tunes. Lots of fun. Jeffrey Evans went on to form '68 Comeback, (another good band, often lo-fi). A favorite tune of mine from this is Louis Collins which features a well-placed NWA sample. Another great album of theirs is Dedicated Fool which was released on Homestead Records and features such songs as Tight Capris and The Sperm Count. Definitely an underrated band in my book.

I currently have two cats and a dog and, as most pet owners will agree, pet hair goes where it wants. This isn't something that is going to save you from using your vacuum on your furniture, but it will take the hair, dust, lint, etc off your clothing. I've used regular lint rollers and they are a wonderful thing, but always having to replace the sheets can get expensive and becomes a hassle, especially if you don't have any more on hand when your cat decided to jump on you after you dressed for work. The Lint Wizard saves you from that with a simple flip of a switch, or rather a \\"slide\\" of one. I've used it to remove pet hair, pet dander, and dust with ease, then a simple slide and empty the compartment. Depending on what or how much you've picked up you might need to slide it more than once, but if it saves me from buying lint sheets or being covered in cat hair I can handle an extra slide or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not purchase","review":"I have a 25 punds beagale that sheds everywhere like crazy.

The sticky rolls didn't work too well on my jacket because there was just too much lint, so this thing combs right through it. For lint balls, I recommend getting those lint removers that has a blade in it.

Every concept is explained at length, with much verbiage. This makes it a great book to use for self-study. The book was written many years ago, and the treatment is somewhat dated. This shows up, e.g., in the treatment of quantum mechanics which uses the inner product notation while most modern books would use the dual space notation. Another feature of its age is its complete lack of graphs or charts (the only exception being the section on Boltzmann H-Theorem). Nevertheless, the lucid and detailed discussions more than make up for the lack of pictures. As a matter of fact, it may contain yet the most clear introduction to quantum mechanics itself, even though that is not the main purpose of this book.

We were trying to figure out what the problem was instead of just sending it back (at first we thought it was just the car charger). We finally figured out that the part where you plug all the adapters in was loose and called initial. We were just out of our 90 day warranty when we called, and they wouldn't honor it. Found them very rude in the world of customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great player. \\"Onboard\\" zoom mode, anyone?","review":"This player is a very great value. I would have given it five stars if there was some way to adjust the contrast. Dark areas are sometimes difficult to see. The picture is sharp and clear. The player successfully plays DVD+R discs just fine. I have not had any freezing yet, but need to play more movies. Does anyone have a player that has all three modes specified in the manual. The manual states that it has an \\"onboard\\" normal, full, and zoom mode. I only have two and my Initial 5820 (a great player) has the three."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Warning!","review":"This product worked great for six months, and then it just stopped working. And let's face it, who wants to send their portable DVD player away to be fixed? Once they break, how much confidence can you have in them?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery connection unreliable","review":"The picture and sound on this unit are decent. However the connection between the player and the battery is not well designed, so the battery can slide a little bit and then the player loses power. This is extremely annoying since you have to start the movie from the beginning again. Unusable, I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I purchased this unit for my daughter for Christmas, from Circuit City for $280.00 We watched one movie on it and it was ok. The picture isn't real clear and the volume stinks, but you get what you paid for. Since that time I spent 3 days trying to get a movie to play with out it freezing up, I could only shut the power off to get it to work again. I went through 5 movies and all the same thing. Needless to say, I returned it, and I am hoping it didn't ruin my new DVD's. From the reviews I have read, I am going to shell out another 100 dollars and go with the Panisonic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this DVD player","review":"I thought I would give this model a try because of the low price. When I got it, it didn't work. Specifically, the screen remained black and would not play any video even though the DVD was whirring inside. I explained the situation to Amazon and they are going to cheerfully refund my money, plus shipping charges for the return. Because of the glowing reviews, I am going to buy the Panasonic instead and not waste any more time with this less expensive model.p.s., Received the Panasonic DVD player today from Amazon (February 3, 2004). Just as the reviews said, it is fantastic. So glad I substituted this Panasonic model for the cheaper brand. Well worth the higher price."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent value","review":"This is an excellent player. We originally purchased the 5.8 inch model which was also very good, however, the 7 inch screen really does make a difference in viewing. Picture is very sharp, sound is good, quality is solid. You really can't beat the value of this unit. Works great in the car to keep our 2 year old son entertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constantly Freezes Up","review":"I purchased this DVD player as a Christmas gift for my son. It has been a problem since the second movie I put into it. Sometimes it never finishes loading and I have to shut off the power, pull the out the dvd and start over again. Other times it starts and then freezes in the middle of a scene. First few times a light tap on the cover would allow the movie to continue. The problem has gotten progressively worse until it is not worth using the unit. The company felt it was the dvd itself. After I mentioned that it was multiple dvd's and that they didn't freeze in the same place each time, the rep decided to have me return it for them to look at. If they feel that it is a problem with the unit, the best I can expect is that they will cover parts. I still have to pay for the repair. I would not recommend this player at all. Spend the money and get a better brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you like silent movies","review":"We purchased this player to take on a family vacation for my two children to watch movies while we made a 12 hour drive. We used it several times for approximately 2 weeks prior to leaving and loved it. An hour and a half into the trip we turned it on and there was no sound. No matter what we tried the sound would not come on. The kids were really bummed and it made for a much longer trip for them as they were greatly dissapointed. I refused to try another one from Initial and just got a refund. I am waiting on my Mintek to arrive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Freezes up","review":"4/30/05 - Bought this one month ago. This model did exactly what other reviewers said it would: it freezes up 2-10 minutes into whatever you're watching. You have to turn off the power in order to \\"reboot\\", and then it all happens over again. Tried several different DVD's, and it did the same thing. Worthless, is the best word to describe this product. I guess you truly get what you pay for.

I have owned 9 players and also purchased the 2 year free replacement extended warranty (thank goodness). My first lasted 7 months before the screen broke. My second lasted 4 months before it quit playing. My third free replacement broke in 4 days. Every time it was a different defect. Comp USA has replaced so many of these that they no longer offer a free replacement warranty on this machine. Spend a little more to get a good machine!

The picture quality is really excellent, but unfortunately I only got 15 second to 5 minutes of viewing in before it would freeze up. After 2 weeks of continually freezing, or refusing to load at all, it's back where I got it and I'm saving for a namebrand. Whatever causes these same problems in all these 1 star reviews is still going on, mine was fresh on the shelf when I bought it in October 2004."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful experience with two players","review":"I got 2 DVD player and both had problems. The first I received had an annoying \\"tac-tac-tac\\" and got really hot. I returned it and I was sent a replacement. The replacement although the same model, was an older one with same estrange features like having to connect the battery with a cable to run the player with it... still this model also had the annoying \\"tac-tac-tac\\" so I returned it.

If you shift it to the right while the unit is operating then *POOF* it shuts off. It's particularly annoying since that happens to me once a week or so on the bus.2) This happened to me twice (different movies) - the machine froze on a frame and would not play about 1 minute of the movie. These disks were not in good shape and were probably scratched there, but I felt the player didn't handle it well.Overall - It's worth the $200 if you need a portable player."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was neat while it worked (1 day)","review":"I bought this for my wife for her birthday (3 days ago). We watched a DVD that night, in the dark and quiet of our house, and it was great! Small screen, yeah, but it was pretty neat anyhow. She watched a DVD in the car the next day, the sound was not loud enough, and the screen was difficult to see in the daylight. Then we got home and turned it on and it said \\"No Disk\\". Tried many different disks. No luck.I returned it yesterday. Bought an audiovox unit (D1710) today.We first saw the Initial 1731 in Wal-Mart. The guy working there said it best. \\"Yeah, they are great, when they work. Look at these two. They have done nothing but sit in the display case and they are broken\\".

I had it for about a year and had no problem, except that the color was peeling which was not a big deal. But one day, after such good treatment the dvd player screen jammed and couldnt open. I slowly pulled the screen up only to find out that the screen was loose and shaky. I then plugged it in to see that the screen was completly blank even though the rest of the DVD player was working. What kind of cheap junk is this- didnt they screw the screen to the player well. When i contacted amazon they asked me to contact the manufacturer which i am still waiting for their response.If you are thinking about buying this junk then think again, read all the reviews and youll know that this junk is not worth it.

The screen would freeze and we would restart, then it would lock up again. I've probably written only one other review in 5+ years I've shopped Amazon. This product was so bad that I wanted to warn others. When we hooked it up to our TV, the picture was also bad. When I returned it, the store clerk told me that she gets these back all the time, and that she rarely gets back the Panasonics.

Better to spend an extra hundred bucks..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skips and freezes","review":"I bought this DVD player a couple of weeks ago. Unfortunately I tore off the code to send in with the rebate before using the player. The second movie I viewed on the player skipped all over the place and I couldn't watch the movie. I returned it and wanted a refund but the store wouldn't do it because the URL was not on the box so they exchanged it. However, the second DVD player froze 2/3 through the first movie I viewed. I went back to the store and asked if I could exchange it for a more expensive one of another brand. They refused, saying I couldn't do that without the code on the box. They exchanged it again.

We changed and played several discs, but the little green dot in the very same placed remained. We exchanged the unit the same day for the same brand and model, out of the box there was another little green dot in a different space on the screen. We also noticed that when you turned the screen, there was much distortion (important if you have in the car and more than one person is viewing). We returned that unit and replaced it with an RCA (almost double the price). We have only had the RCA one day, but we like it, no picture distortion and defintely not a little green dot to be found>"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away From Initial","review":"I hate to say it, but the people who have given this item good reviews haven't owned the player long enough. Initial's build quality is very poor- it is a fact that if you buy a product from Initial, it WILL need service. It is only a matter of time, and, unfortunately, not that much time. Now, you have your new DVD player that you were all excited to purchase, but it's worth jack because the screen hinge completely broke and it won't play movies. You now get the unenviable task of contacting Initial's customer support. It's a nightmare! I think their customer service is comprised of a bunch of 8 year olds in a sweat shop in India.Trust me on this one, go with a proven brand like Sony or Toshiba, and you won't regret your decision if anything ever goes wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch your warranty date!","review":"This unit worked great - until exactly one year after I received it.

I can't just look blankly at a wall for 60-90 mins! I've used it for over 75 hours so far (I plug it in a nearby outlet) without any problems. The volume is great, picture quality is good. I gave it 4 stars because of 2 really stupid omissions: 1) the lack of contrast in dark images and no way to adjust the contrast. Brightness can be adjusted, but that only goes so far. 2) When viewing a movie at 100%, there's a 1/2\\" to 1\\" border all around the image. If you do a \\"full screen\\" view, the image fills the screen, crops part of the top, and stretches/distorts the image to fit. Zooming \\"squares\\" off the image leaving a 2\\" border left and right! Why not just fill the entire screen and use the correct proportions?!?

All of the negative reviews have all happened to me too. The problem is, it takes longer than just a few times of using it for the problems to arrive, they start after the warranty is up. Every positive review this player gets is from people who have just purchased it. The most annoying thing is that the picture freezes up and you have to keep resetting the movie. This was frustrating to me, but even more to my kids. We purchased this player because it was the cheapest we could find. We have now decided that you should not buy a DVD player by that criteria.

A must have for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"childhood music","review":"my sister and i grew up listening to the moody blues, eric clapton, and the cranberries, my mother's favorite groups. one of our favorite things to do was dance around our family room after our father got home form work to \\"i just shot john lennon\\", \\"ode to my family\\", or \\"nights in white satin\\". and sadly, as we grew up, we stopped listening to this music. recently i reverted back to the cranberries and moody blues as comfort music and i'm happy to say they are once again some of my favorite groups. (on the other hand, my friends prefer blink 182 and ludacris, so just dont get it) the music on this cd is some of my favorite by the cranberries and definitely the most recent of their stuff that i like...the next 2 cds are a downhill path, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"A really good album, but personally I preferred their first two. But nonetheless, this is very good. They add more of a punk sound to some songs, but still manage to do some pretty ballads, like \\"When you're gone\\". Dolores' voice is still as beautiful as ever in its sometimes haunting quality. \\"War Child\\" was probably inspired by her guest appearence on Pavarotti's War Child concert the previous year, which you can hear on \\"Pavarotti and friends for the Children of Bosnia\\". Dolores does a wonderful duet with Pavarotti of \\"Ave Maria\\". It seems that some reviewers were disappointed with this effort, but I think that after a few listens it will grow on anyone. Give it a chance...it really is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inject your soul with liberty","review":"This is one of the Cranberries best albums. It has both more punk rock numbers than the earlierco0mpilations, as well as more ballads.My favourite songs on this CD are:Salvation: A punk rocker all about the problem of the youth and drugs , with a good message...When You're Gone: A beautiful Cranberries type love song.War Child: A ballad about the horrors and senselessness of wars.Forever Yellow Skies: Once more a punk rock number. These songs actually have very poetic wording.The Rebels: A song all about the youth of the singer.I Just Shot John LennonAnd the exquisite ballads:Will You Remember? With a very strong Irish dance flavour.Joe: A nostalgic and dreamy ballad.Cordell: A spiritual piece all about life and death. One of the Cranberries best songs..."},{"rating":"2","title":"They did it again!","review":"...and this time with a new style. This time The Cranberries have put a more rock emphasis on their music while in No Need To Argue and Everyone Else Is Doing It, they put a more emphasis on pop/soft rock. It is a new sound from the cranberries that you will quickly fall in love. Songs like \\"Free to decide\\" and \\"War child\\" make you really question what you believe in. Satirical and ingenious, with their own sound; this is The Cranberries."},{"rating":"1","title":"small model","review":"unable to judge the size by photo-much smaller than expected. better to have something in photo that gives size comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nearly 5 stars","review":"Despite the editing errors and the premise of an alpha male demanding his woman submit sexually to his brothers because of their abusive youth (did push my comfort zone somewhat) I would have given this story 5 stars and understood, or tried to understand, the need these 3 men had to connect through their women.If only Marly's Choice hadn't had a scene where Cade tried to set up a real orgy (with another woman & man and his brothers, himself & Marly). For me, that attempt blew the brothers \\"need to connect\\" through sex with their siblings' women all to hell and back. It really turned me off and made the whole premise of the \\"need to connect\\" ring as phony as a three-dollar bill. Fortunately the remaining books in this series avoid any \\"outside the family\\" sexual attempts.Aside from that one scene the rest of the book was good. The characterizations were fascinating, the sex was hot, the story interesting. Love Lora Leigh's writing and can't wait for more books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked it but...","review":"... It's not for everyone. Marly was raised with these brothers for the last 8 years or so and is like a sister for the most part. The lines of incest are not clearly drawn in this book... But that said - Cade is a great leading man and obviously loves Marly - as she loves him. That he has issues from childhood that makes him need to share with his brothers is a twist that Marly seemed to see as a potential from the begining and loves him anyway - even though he seems to hate himself for it almost. She is a strong character that seems to be a perfect match for him... I also really enjoyed brother Sam and am looking forward to his story.I don't always enjoy Lora Leigh's stories but when she writes complete books there is always good character development and a decent story. Out of the 4 Books I have read of her's (Menege Magic, Surrender, Feline Breeds: Book 1 and Marly Choice) this and the Feline Breeds book seem to be her best effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Implausible plot, poor writing skills exhibited","review":"This book was recommended to me as good erotic romance, which may have made me expect more than I found. Ms. Leigh's writing skills are very poor, and the fact the error hadn't been corrected during the editing process has made me leery about buying more books from Ellora's Cave. As for the story line, I found it very hard to believe that any dominating type man, even one who had been abused as a child, would allow his brothers to share his woman, much less insist on it. I also found it impossible to believe Marly or any other modern woman would consent to such an arrangement in any circumstances."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must","review":"My favorite read I think this is like the seventh time of read this now. Love this series, not for the faint of heart. Very steamy and intense"},{"rating":"2","title":"Marly's Choice is a Keeper!","review":"This is the one that started the August Family Series. Ms. Leighsets the stage for one of the most sexualy intense and erotic reads on the bookself. Cade is the Alpha Hero every woman wants (his brothers Brock and Sam are not bad either) and Marly is a woman who knows what she wants. Cade does not stand a chance.Cade is the protector until Marly has had enough. Then therelationship is threatened by family secrets and outside forcestrying to tear them apart.Ms. Leigh's books are all on my auto buy list."},{"rating":"1","title":"if i could give 0 stars, i would!","review":"Ok! i hated this book! i couldnt even finish it! (I tried!) The sex is hot! I mean smoking hot! But... the story just made it all feel dirty! I've read many books with hot sex! (hello i bought this!) but...(spoiler alert) i'm not into the if you love me, you'll do my brother. what?! or by the way baby thanks for doing my brother but now can you do a girl! if you love me u will! what?! I couldn't stand the H. (jail needed for him) & I thought the h. needed help (like professional!) I love a good steamy read. I even like some plan old smut every once in a while!!! but this book i hated! o & did i mention the dont tell me no or I'll rape you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely disturbing","review":"Like only a couple of other reviewers, I found this book to go beyond the alpha male/submissive female role. In my opinion, the men bordered on bullying, abusive behaviors. Why would any man force the woman he loved to engage in sex with his brothers? Especially to \\"prove\\" that he loved those brothers? I simply do not understand that plot/conflict since I am not the dark of a person. While I have read several of Ms. Leigh's other books, and have enjoyed several, this series left me feeling...less than happy and thankful that I am not that dysfunctional nor spinless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over all??? Left a bad taste in my mouth........threw it out.......","review":"I'm gonna keep this one short and sweet......I usually love Ms. Leigh's books and storylines. BUT this one - well - it's in the trash. I got towards the end and was literally disgusted with the way the story twisted. It ended poorly and left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Don't get me wrong ...I'm all for different strokes for different folks but this storyline bordered rape and gave \\"dom's\\" a bad name. And then when you think everything's gonna be okay - the lead male \\"he-man\\" demands another life altering change of the female lead stating \\"if you love me - you'll do this one last thing\\". I have never been more insulted for women all over the world!!! Sorry - I love a good dom/sub storyline but this was ridiculous. I was going to get the other books in the Men of August series....but not now. I'll stick with her other storylines from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Nasty!","review":"Okay, I don't have a promlem, in general, with the idea of multiple sex partners but this was just nasty. The inexperienced women in this series are constantly being hounded and berated for not immediately laying down and taking it from multiple partners. The premise of this story is ridiculous, the brothers were so abused that they have to screw each others women to show their love? In what universe does that make sense? The only thing this series left me with was a serious case of nausea! I love Ms. Leigh's series with the Breeds but this book has me seriously wondering about her mental health. I honestly don't know if I will even read her Breed series now. This book left me feeling tainted by association. Do yourself a favor and look for a new author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"just ok","review":"Personally this book didn't do it for me. There are some really hot sex scenes but that's about it. It doesn't normally take me two and half weeks to read a book but thats how long it took me. I finally finished when the cable went out in my hotel room due to a storm. There are so many things left unsaid that its ridiculous. They all have secrets, then there was this huge build up to a stalker for it to end in a paragraph. I saw great reviews for books two and three but I can't bring myself to purchase them because I really didn't like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"love lora leigh","review":"IT IS ALITTLE TWISTED BUT INTERESTING.

Or hey, even a couple of brothers like the August men!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No better than rape","review":"What happened to safe, sane, and consensual? The girl wasn't given a \\"choice\\" at all. As another reviewer said - no is supposed to mean no. In this book no = permission to rape. Condoms seem purposefully ignored, the psychologocal issues in the men's need to \\"share\\" are both unrealistic and icky...The sad thing is that this could have been so much better. The sex scenes, when they aren't being abusive, are great. With more creative thoght the menage could have worked way better...for instance the girl could have initiated the group interest (the seeds of that are there and could have been better developed). The abuse story is a weak plot device at best - why not have some other relationship between the three men that doesn't leave such a foul taste after reading this.Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"stay away","review":"im one of lora's biggest fans but this series i didnt even finish. im all into alpha males ect but this was over the top and degrading. hello august men ever heard of therapy? this book was a waste of my time. the way they treat sarah in the second book made my stomach turn. no woman in her right mind would let a man come in her house to use her shower after screwing his brothers girlfriend when hes telling her he loves her and cant be without her!! ans he acts like its normal to sleep with her the same day!! no way this book is a no go sorry lora"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some f...... up people !","review":"Who the hell thinks of this. 3 brothers so messed up that they have to have sex together. Instead of them going to therapy to try to get help, they decide to demoralize the women they love & turn them into sex slaves. I have to say that I like the author's Breed series, but I am a little disappointed in this series. To think a woman wrote this crap. Such weak women, to let the men dictate what they will do sexually."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least it was free","review":"I like Lora Leigh's books, her breed books etc. But this one....holy crap, can you say whiny, spoiled chick and 3 guys who need serious counciling and to stay the heck away from women until they've had it? Sorry to say if you were looking for a good Lora Leigh book, this aint it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"I have read many books by this author, she is very talented. However, I had a hard time getting into the characters in this book. It was tough keeping up with Cade's constant mood swings- I want you, but I'm conflicted, but I want you, that I can understand. But, he was cruel, mean, not at all the kind of guy we want the girl to end up with The weak, boring, Marly put up with being treated like a piece of trash. While some scenes were hot, most left me feeling like I was creeped out by these damaged men. I'm not sure I want to buy the rest of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"read book AFTER watching movie . . .","review":"the movie kinda sux actually. except for a FEW main points, its very different from the book. i would recommend watching the movie BEFORE you read the book for the 1st time, cause once you compare the two, you'll never want to watch the movie again except to see Pattinson's heavenly face.oh and PS. it contains a SCHMUCK of an audio commentary. totally un-professional, un-informative, and stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad it is low budget and poor casting","review":"When I look back at watching the movie at the theater I am not as bummed out about it if I remind myself it is a B movie. I just loved the book and was disappointed that some of the character were poorly casted and the scenes cheesy. I am 31 so maybe I am not the target audience but I am sad that this wasnt done right, just didnt do the book justice. Edward wasnt casted right, yeah he's cute, but he and Bella had no chemistry on camera and that is the whole point of the story. Hopefully the next movie will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piss-poor Entertainment","review":"I'm a 21 year old male. I know this film wasn't made for me. But as a teen romance/horror thriller, it sucks on every level.The teens are all stereotypes. The disaffected girl (a 3rd rate Winona Ryder) falls for the creepy, pasty \\"rebel\\" who gawks at her. Their romantic scenes consist of staring at eachother and stilted cliche dialogue.The story is really unintelligent and boring to watch unfold. So much bad dialogue and cheesy action without any redeeming charm or romance. Just bad Suburban teenage fantasy for moronic teenagers. If your child is mildly smart or has personality, they will probably just laugh at the disposable cultural phenomenon that is \\"Twilight\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visually rich and entertaining!","review":"This is the perfect film to see with your parents without worrying whether or not they'll be uncomfortable. I went to see it with mine (they're in their 50's)and we all loved it.I haven't read the book this film is based on, but look forward to reading it now.

Two snaps, \\"HATED IT!\\" I can't believe people got sucked into this whole franchise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible I tell you!","review":"The acting and storyline of vegetarian vamps is cheesy. This movie can't compare to Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles, Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992) or Underworld movies. It's obvious why tweens like this movie, but I can't understand why some adults enjoy the Twilight series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Original story, too much of a love theme.","review":"I love how this is an original vampire movie rather than blood, guts and gore. Don't get me wrong, I am a sucker for a good vampire movie (Queen of the Damned is among my favorite movies), but this one has too much of a lovey dovey love theme. And it makes Edward look bad when he sparkles, he looks like he is gay to a point. But despite that, I love how the storyline is about people and not trying to kill everyone. Two stars is for the originality, but it's too mushy and hardly related to vampires."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring movie, unless you're 13","review":"I'm going to sum up my review in a few short sentences.

And would someone please tell me what's so hot about Edward??"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm addicted","review":"I thought this series would be very geared to teens but I am in my 30's and I love them.

Awesome movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly for girls...","review":"I mean it. I liked the book, that was more endurable for me. But this movie? I felt like it was made JUST for one gender.the story was stupid, and after reading the Dresden Files, how this movie portrays vampires is simply bad. The visuals are weak. The final fight is not executed and choreographed well. But I didn't fall asleep. Plus, it was so stupid i laughed. So I'd give it a 3.5/10. Poor and atrocious. But guys, if you want to laugh at the performances(especially Pattinson's) go ahead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy...","review":"Although the movie maintains the integrity of the book pretty well, it comes across as a cheap imitation. Bella stutters and blinks throughout the whole movie, which was VERY annoying. Some of the scenes were so contrived and cheesy, that one had to laugh. The movie has enjoyed so much popularity, I think, in part because the actors are very attractive, and it is an anguished love story, with Edward playing the part of the perfect gentleman, every woman's fantasy. I loved the Twilight saga in book form, but I have to admit that the movie seemed very low budget. I hope, considering Twilight's success, that with a new director and larger budget, New Moon will be a production of higher quality and standards. Still, Twilight isn't bad if your looking to kill a few hours with silly entertainment in the movie theater."},{"rating":"2","title":"watched it twice","review":"i loved this movie.i liked the second time better.i can't wait for New Moon. I'm excited to see how it turns out.the acting was wonderful my daughter is obessed with Rob.i will treasure this dvd for years when i get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable","review":"\\"Twilight\\" is a romantic vampire movie with all the emotional depth of an after school TV special. The story can be summed up in one sentence: Teenage Bella, played by buck toothed Kristen Stewart, moves from Arizona to Washington and falls in love with a vampire named Edward played by Robert Pattinson.And just like an after school special \\"Twilight\\" contains bad dialogue, bad acting, and no suspense whatsoever. Also, the voice overs by Stewart throughout the film wear thin quickly, and the camera work is amateurish at best.The lamest thing about this movie is Edward the vampire. Pattinson's acting in this movie is just awful and the make-up to make him look pale is cheesy. In some scenes in which the character is wearing a T-shirt you can see that his face is pale but his neck and shoulders are not, as if the actor applied the make-up himself.Yes I know that this movie was made with 13-year-old girls in mind, but they deserve better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another vampire movie to add to all the rest","review":"Will Holloywood ever stop making these typs of films? I mean come on do we really need another inaine move about some vampire that falls in love...? Just add to to the other hundres of movies and books and even TV shows of the digital age.It wouldn't be so bad if they could stick to a single mythology of the Vampire instead of jumping around every myth ever created from everyones opinion. Don't get me wrong, I was a HUGE Buffy (NOT the movie) and Angel fan when they were on the WB but now everything that comes out with vampires is just another vampire movie. They are all the same...unrequited love and people end up dying so they can find that 'love' that can never exist because they come from compleatly different worlds! HOLLYWOOD!!!

A baseball game with vampires in the middle of the day? Don't give me the overcast lack of sunlight excuse, I have solar panels and they still pickup UV light with full cloud cover. Ridiculous that everyone falls head over heels for this vampire flick CW style. Uhhhh....ever hear of True Blood on HBO?

If you're curious; I suggest finding another movie.

We'd also laugh at some of the special effects. Seeing a sparkling vampire and hearing the line \\"This is the skin of a killer?\\" Is actual one of the funniest things I've seen.Pretty much wins best unintentional comedy of the year. That's pretty much what you don't want for a movie.The only thing I can say is that the coloration of the film was pretty. Other than that, its not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Piece of Garbage","review":"This dvd is the worst piece of garbage that I have ever wasted 2 hours on. The movie adds random things that are not in the book, the acting is 2nd rate at the very best, scenes that could have been somewhat decent were completely ruined by the lack of soundtrack. The characters were undeveloped, crippled with a shaky storyline in the first place created a horrendous movie going experience. This movie was a waste of 2 hours of my life that I will never get back. Read the book instead, it is a cute quick read.

My promo code worked, I started the movie, and after 2 hours I'm about 1 hour in, thanks to the video \\"connecting\\". I know that many people have had this problem, and I'm sure part of it is that so many people are trying to watch the movie in the same time frame, and while I'm not one to complain about free things (and am more than happy to sit through the occasional buffering), it's starting to get ridiculous.

How you really have no look at how intence their feelings are for each other. Which is a bad start for the movies they plan on making which stem from their feelings for each other.

I must say this first one is very good! I like how it's more contemporary and up to date. I haven't watched a vampire movie since the 80s or 90s! There are a lot of things in this movie that I didn't know about when it comes to vampires. The chemistry between Bella and Edward whew! There was just enough action, romance and intensity. Now, I wouldn't recommend watching it on Amazon Instant Video as I did. The video kept freezing and buffering. So annoying! I checked my screen saver which was off. My connection kept going from high to low. I don't think it has to do with my internet connection or my PC either because I watched other videos with no problems. In any case, I'm on to the next one.

That is, under the right direction. When I think of how they SHOULD have made Twilight, I think of something along the same lines as Interview With The Vampire - sprawling, creative, and somewhat epic. Instead, some Catherine Hardwicke was given free reign of this movie, even though she's only ever produced mediocre-at-best films in the past. After watching Twilight, I can see her flare for cheesy melodrama is strong, and her cinematic flare is poor. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teeny Bop Pop Vomit","review":"Unfortunately, as we all know, this was amazingly popular with the ladies. It a essentially a massive sexual fantasy. To hook up with this amazingly perfect and powerful undead being is every girls dream? Seems pretty twisted to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twilight","review":"Twilight (Two-Disc Special Edition)This movie did not meet my expectations after reading the books...too much was changed from the book version which made me not care for the movie...the books are great and fantastic I could read the books over and over again. The movie is okay but could have also been great if it would have followed the book a little bit better. I hope the next movie follows the book a little bit better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whats up with the $32.99 retail price?","review":"Most first run of top dvd releases are 29.99 - this one is more, and sets a bad precedent. Stick with the paperback book at 10.99 - rent the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"online rentals...ok...unbox system....not ok...","review":"i was very disappointed when i first \\"rented\\" this movie because i could not get the unbox to work correctly. i tried downloading it, and something happened and the unbox just shut off...wouldnt open, come up or anything. i deleted unbox and emailed customer support. they sent me a new rental and i tried unbox again. same thing happened. i was very frustrated and called customer support and spoke with somone right away, no wait. i requested a new (third) rental so i could try to watch it online. amazon.com sent me a new rental and i watched online with no other problems. in the end i was satisfied with the customer support and finally the \\"online rental\\". i would recommend the online rental but not the unbox...its a waste of time...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK - Try Again!","review":"Having read the book, I found the movie quite superficial and therefore, disappointing. I was left feeling as if I only got half of the story. Sadly, I usually do find that most books are better than their movie counterparts. Perhaps they will do better producing the sequels in the series. Do yourself a favor and read the book , skip the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome DVD!!","review":"I absolutely love this DVD and it was sooo much cheaper than anywear in town... The commentary was really endearing and insightful and the extended & Deleted scenes are really amazing!! Ive already watched it several times and it just came a week ago!! I love this movie and this version is much better than the regular DVD which doesnt have all the deleted scenes or the 7 part documentary of the making of the movie!! Get this version if you are a diehard fan cause it is sooo worth it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"I was interested in this Movie from the pro mos. I did not read the book. But I bought the DVD, thinking I could share it with other family members.The Movie was a drag. It was totally uninteresting and lacking any tension or drama. As a reader that has all the Christine Feehan and Patrical Briggs novels, this offering was so lacking any interest and drama. If I could give it less then one star I would.All I can say is see the other two mentioned authors for good reads. But you would have to read them."},{"rating":"1","title":"really bad","review":"just read phoenix childs review for my opinion. that's how i feel in a nutshell... they really messed up a potentially great vampire story... i think i'm mostly bitter because i was tricked into seeing this movie because the i liked the book so much. and this isn't a case of \\"fiction books are hard to recreate\\"... it's a case of this was a really bad movie... it was almost like they did the bare minimum - or less than that - because they knew the young girls would pay no matter how bad... and those same girls are the same who are actually saying this movie was good. o well... write off those 2 hours of my life and move on..."},{"rating":"2","title":"LET ME INTRODUCE MYSELF","review":"Hello. Please let me introduce myself. I am the newest \\"Twilight\\" fanatic. It just came on my satellite dish, so I figured I'd watch a few minutes of the thing, just to see what all the excitement was about.I was instantly mesmerized, and plan to watch it a lot more. The chief allure, methinks, is that the movie is a wondrous updating of the Gothic romance, with impossibly over-wrought lovers in spooky settings. Edward is a perfect gentleman, Bella's love is unconditional. No premarital sex here! Also worthy of mention is a really sublime baseball scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for Just Teens!","review":"This entire series is being touted as a \\"teen\\" story, perhaps because it has teens as the title roles. That being said, I remember another \\"teen\\" romance by a fellow named William Shakespeare called Romeo and Juliet that still endures the test of time. I believe Stephenie Meyer's saga will as well. Although not as good as the books, Twilight the movie allows you to put faces to the story and is well worth watching, even for a 56 year old woman like me :0)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Guilty Pleasure that's more akin to a drug habit","review":"I guess I need to preface this by saying I'm kind of a movie snob and a pop culture reject. Anything that's \\"in\\" I tend to detest without even knowing it first.And I'm 30. And married. With a son.But, oh, the guilty pleasure of this stupid movie. I have watched it, my cable bill confirms, 15 times and yet I keep wanting to push select again on the On Demand menu.It is addictive and soft and romantic and stupid all at the same time. And I love every second of it.I will also suggest the books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...not what I was expecting","review":"I am a huge Twilight fan. I absolutely LOVED the whole book series. In fact, I have to admit, I became a little obsessed with it all. I got the movie and watched it expecting the best...and I thought it varied too much from the book. My hubby couldn't wait for it to be over then couldn't understand what I thought was so good about the book. Something else I figured out while watching this...I can't stand Kristen Stewart. I simply don't like her in this. I really wished this movie was half as good as the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Went No Where...","review":"I was not a huge fan of the movie, I guess if I were a 15 year old girl I would appreciate it a little more. I give it 2 stars for the mild action it had through out.The movie really just did not go anywhere, the acting was no so great on all levels, the makeup artist needs to be fired and the special effects were like a 1962 karate flick.Overall boring, loss of interest several times through out."},{"rating":"1","title":"It didn't work","review":"I would have loved to watch the movie today, but my code doesn't work so I'll just have to wait until it comes in the mail."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Slow Painful Death","review":"I have a friend who is into Twilight, and she made me read the entire Twilight series so that we could have something to talk about. If she wasn't such a good friend I never would have voluntarily endured that torture. She is now dragging me to each of the movies. For once in my life, I went to a movie thinking that the book series was SO terrible that the movie might actually be an improvement from the book. To my chagrin it was even more painful than the book. I recognize this series has a cult following, so this review will probably not help anyone else. However, just writing the review is somewhat theraputic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good enough...for burning","review":"This makes the book look a thousand times worse. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my entire life, and I usually cut some slack during reviews. But this is horrible. Awful. The director and the screenwriter must have been drunk, on drugs, haven't slept for weeks, or are in the mental health institute. What's the big deal about the Twilight series? Why did so many people get hooked? This answer will not be solved by a competent, non-brainwashed Twilight fan. Nope. The movies are much worse than the books and that's saying something! The plot and scenes were all either screwed up. The director added new scenes, which were not great. The sparkle effect was terrible. I bet there are loads of parodies out there making fun of this movie. Even my friends who like Twilight think this movie is a total disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"No vampires","review":"This is far from a vampire movie. The author has even said she knows nothing about vampires."},{"rating":"1","title":"very bad acting","review":"I have enjoyed the Twilight saga books for what they are (I'm not expecting them to be War and Peace, etc, but entertainment), but this movie is abysmal. The editing is choppy and the acting by the leads is lacking, especially Stewart. Her main expression is a blank stare and seems depressed and rude (was she on Xanax throughout the filming?). Bella was not depressed in this book. I think the character maybe smiled once during the whole thing. Put this on your Netflix if you're curious, but don't waste your money buying it. On the positive side, the soundtrack and score are wonderful. Also, some of the supporting cast is delightful such as Billy Burke, Kendrick, Welch, Greene, and Lutz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie, Better Book","review":"The movie was good, but the book was much better. They had to cut so much out of the book to turn it into a movie. My husband went to the movies with me without seeing the movie and said it was a good movie but it did not have the same impact on him as it did me because he did not know the background. I found that there was a lot of information left out of the movie, but it is understandable. I would have rated the movie at a 5 star level if I had not read the book first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disappointed at first but then loved it!","review":"Yes I was a little disappointed with the movie when I saw it at the midnight showing. I am a Twilight fan, but I am also the bad movie goer when it comes to movies based off of books because I compare every little thing in the movie to the book. But once I put all of that aside, I can re-watch this movie and love it each time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordered for my daughter","review":"I don't like it, but I ordered it for my daughter who liked it. So we averaged at around 2 stars. There you have it. I like my vampires with more grit and more blood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"The action is feeble, the acting is dire, the direction is lamentable and the plot is abysmal.

This is strictly for fans of the book. The love was lame, the action was awful, and the main characters were jokes if any of the other characters where the main characters it probably would have been ten times better. The only reason this movies so popular because everyone wanted it to be good but it wasnt and everyone is still living in their dream world. Dont buy this movie its the worst decision you could possible make...ever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"LOVE the book...

It is not a story about blood and guts and vampires. it is a love story that most will remember. This is the first of four books written by Stephanie Meyers. It tells the love story of Edward Cullen a vampire and the human love of his life Bella Swan. The musical score is superb!!! I could listen to it a million times. Take my word for it. Once you watch TWILIGHT you can't wait for the other 3 books and ECLISPE is due out in June. PS Read the books too they are fabulous!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"spectacular","review":"This movie was very well done. Kept you captivating throughout the whole movie.

They ruined a beautiful love-story with horrible directing, cheesy acting/poor casting, and a not-well-hidden low budget.Read the book instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixed feelings","review":"It seemed like the movie dragged but sped through the book. I was disappointed they missed a lot of key elements of the book. I think I was trying to be overly optimistic about the adaptation. I did enjoy it though (the concept is amazing and as I am a hopeless romantic it was great!) and I will be there at Best Buy with my copy of the special edition DVD (can't believe March 21!!!) I can't wait until New Moon comes out though I am a bit nervous as the director of American Pie will be producing this vampire romance (I hope he keeps it clean)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight DVD","review":"The two disc DVD was great.

Was thinking it was too high school. Then someone who is as critical of movies as I am, told me it was really good. It opened my mind enough to see it one day while sitting at home with nothing to do. After watching it, I blogged on my twitter, etc-I was wrong! It really was such a good movie! The hype is not just hype. I gave it the credit it deserved. It was better than most movies I had seen recently like Drag me to Hell, The Orphan, Paranormal Activity-(boring)..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dont know if the book was this bad or its just the movie.","review":"There is nothing special about this movie. What was the fuss? A bunch of young teen girls thinking this movie was good. The acting is terrible. The scene where she gets bitten and crosses her eyes trying to look infected i lol. The scene where Edward carried the girl through the trees was hilarious. The movie was supposed to be serious i guess you wouldnt know it by watching it. I couldnt even watch this movie again, hard enough getting through it once."},{"rating":"1","title":"are you kidding me?","review":"Although I was not expecting much from this adaptation of a terrible supernatural romance, the film quickly plummeted to the ranks of the worst I have ever seen. The acting is alright, but the film is washed out, the music is laughably terrible. To be fair, most of the dialog is pulled directly from the book, but it's pretty horrifying out loud.Video on Demand? Does anyone really need this movie instantly?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so bad, but still bad enough.","review":"If I were a female or something similar to that, I'd have liked it more.

There ya go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The movie was great and arrived on time. The \\"extras\\" are great. However, we preordered and the purchase was to include a link for a video download to view Twilight on release day. I received the link 5 days later, a big disappointment. We would have been better off purchasing the movie locally. Lesson learned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie was good, service was questionable","review":"I ordered the movie Twilight a month ahead of its release date to ensure I would have a copy for my tween kids. The release was on a Saturday, and on Friday we received an email from Amazon stating that they could not guarantee delivery on the release date, but would offer a free 24 hour rental(online) from Amazon. Feeling releaved, I passed up the opportunity to purchase the DVD as I shopped on Saturday (I saw THOUSANDS of copies). When I came home early evening, I realized that the DVD had not in fact arrived. We had dinner and then I prepared to download the movie from Amazon online. I was put into a \\"queue\\", I am assuming because of the demand for the download, and as of 10:30 pm my kids still could not view the movie. I ended up having to order it from our local cable company to avoid hysteria from the kids. The movie finally arrived on Monday, however in the future I will never pre-order a movie from Amazon again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight","review":"I really enjoyed this movie.

My friend's daughter who the gift was for loved the movie however.My advice is save your money and buy just the dvd alone, I would not rate this set as good value for money and amazon should be ashamed at the money they charge for this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even the stars disrespect this movie","review":"Twilight [Blu-ray]I've owned this movie for years and watched it countless times. But for the first time that I watched it with commentary from Rob, Kristen and the director. The comments that Rob and Kristen make (especially Rob) gives the impression that they didn't like the movie or their performance in it. And it kind of makes me feel stupid for liking it. Adimittedly it is my least favorite of the movie franchise but they seemed to really hate it. Plus their knowledge on the making of the film seemed very limited. And Rob especially didn't seem to understand what was going on most of the time. Through a lot of the film if they weren't making fun, they were quiet or asking questions they should know the answer to. I hope that they don't do the commentary on the rest of the films. It's a shame that they have such distain for a franchise that made them famous and rich."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Addition to my collection!!!","review":"Being a huge fan of the \\"Twilight\\" saga by Stephenie Meyer, I was thrilled to see the book brought to life on the big screen. I felt this movie was well done considering the meager budget and time constraints. No book EVER translates perfectly to film, and there are allowances which must be made. Mrs. Meyer was very involved in the creative processes of the filmmaking, and I believe that shows throughout. Everyone I have recommended this movie to has returned to me later to thank me because they enjoyed it as well. Glad to have it as a part of my movie collection !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight DVD","review":"I bought this for my daughter or her birthday and haven't watched it myself.

Pleasantly surprised at the story, development of relationships - and, well - the whole premise of vampires attempting to seamlessly blend into modern day society. Very subtle in quaint in some parts, yet just enough action and suspense to keep it moving. Even my 9-yr-old son liked it (instead of making fun of his 13-yr-old sister). OK for families, nothing risque - makes for good dinner table conversation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ed looks even better in Blu-Ray!!!!","review":"Ok. So I must admit. I am a Twihard.

I found the concept of the film much more interesting than the actual story itself. Stewart and Pattinson have nice on-screen chemistry but the the film slushes along where it should flow evenly.

Personally, I prefer Lost Boys or Interview with a Vampire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful...","review":"I read all the books before the movie was even a concept...and I'm kinda bummed I did. After the books the movie was complete let down. They tried to cram all the finer points of the book into a 2 hour movie and failed miserably. The book was rich in detail and the movie wasn't. \\"Bella\\" had a few voice overs in the movie, but not enough to know what she was thinking or feeling. Mostly, \\"Bella\\" just looked confused and frustratingly awkward. This is one of those instances where Hollywood took a great story and turned into a mushy Cliff's Notes version.

With any huge series you expect or at least hope the movie does the book justice. I went into my movie viewing experience expecting the film to be a fraction of what the book was...and i was correct. I think the potential for greatness was missed in Hardwicke being the director. I have watched other films-Thirteen included- and always found her methods to be undeveloped and choppy. In that regard she didn't disappoint. The movie could have shown the development of Bella and Edward's relationship so their devotion to one another was understood. I feel like she and the screen writer took a great plot and skimmed it down so much it was on the verge of terrible. Please don't misunderstand me...I love the books, just not the movie. Had i not had such an attachment to the books i wouldn't own this movie. and i'll be honest, since seeing it in the theaters i haven't watched the dvd-except for the special features."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Film for Pre-Teen girls","review":"I saw this in theaters, after my girlfriend wore me down with demands to see it. It was corny: glittering vamps, whiny, clingy, stalker-like Kristen Stewart, constant kissing, and love-sick scenes that make you want to puke. If you're a man, don't bother. If you're a woman who like real romance but isn't a sucker for this drivel, don't bother.

Of course I will still buy it though to go with my Twilight collection. It did have some pretty good special effects, but I wasn't quite feeling it for the 'movie' Bella and Edward like I did the 'book' Bella and Edward. Still a good exciting and romantic watch though."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOULD'VE GIVEN THIS 5 STARS BUT...","review":"i would love to have invested the [...] bucks for this whole set had they had an extra dvd in there. the only blue-ray player we have is the PS3 downstairs but if my daughter wanted to watch this in her room, now she can't. we'd have to always watch this downstairs only and that would suck, pardon the pun. would've made a great early birthday gift for my teen, but now i will just invest in the regular 2 disc set--i've already invested lots of cash toward the books, movie, t-shirts, pins, etc... but the books are wonderful--they got my daughter reading, which is a feat in and of itself, and we love, love, love the movie! my daughter became an instant fan after seeing the movie and now is waaaaaay into it more than me and i thought i was a mega fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"In my Glory!","review":"I opened my Msn email and was pleasantly surprised to find out that I could get a free showing of Twilight.

I purchased today and couldn't wait to get home to watch it. Ugh... what an utter disappointment. The movie is just lame and, even in the beginning, things are different from the book. I'm not going to list anything b/c I don't want to put any spoilers out there. However, what's with the lack of chemistry between Bella and Edward? I think they could have had a better actress play the part of Bella -- but that's just my opinion, I guess. Overall, though, I think the movie would have been better if I hadn't already read the book. What a let down :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight","review":"My former students loved it.

I didn't have the preconceived notion of what the characters would look like...I already knew!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bare Bones","review":"After reading the series this movie was a complete let down! Watching the movie was like reading only the first sentence of each chapter. Too much was left out which caused the entire movie to be \\"Missing\\" something...Kinda like having Pizza without the sauce and toppings.Had I watched the movie before reading the books I would never have given the books half a chance and the books are excellent! Fantastic story to read..once you start you don't want to stop.Do your self a favor..read the books first..then RENT the movie if you just have to but don't waste your money on buying the movie..not worth $15.00!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have movie!","review":"I am a big Twilight fan.

Edward is what a vampire should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"After reading all 4 books and the partial draft of midnight sun, all in 4 days i couldn't believe how great the books were... I fell in love with this series even though it is based towards teen girls. The movie however failed. They jumbled the sequence of events in the movie, and lets face it the acting was pretty shotty... i mean come on even the \\"i know what you did last summer\\" acting was better than rob. Now I loved the books and have read them quite a few times but the movie falls short! I'm sorry but the director made it look like more of a music video than a movie, and i got lost with the other characters. I hope that the next movie is better now that there is a new director. I wasn't hoping for a coen brothers flick, but i was hoping for better acting and better follow through from book to movie. (kristen stewart did embody bella perfectly though) PLEASE DO A BETTER JOB.... please..."},{"rating":"1","title":"spend your money on the books not the movie!","review":"After having read all the books and seeing the movie I'd say buy the books and rent the movie when it comes out. The movie is mediocre but the books are good (if you can get past Bella being such a weak, wimpy character. Not a great role model for girls. She often faints, falls down alot and apologizes all the time. A bit of a doormat in my opinion) But if you like vampire/paranormal romance it is a must read. Chaste but romantic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mediocre adaptation but watchable.","review":"The movie is good, not better than the book but it hits all the key points. Like most book to movie conversions, there is a lot of stuff that isn't explained so I recommend reading at least book 1 in the Twilight series wait a couple weeks then watch the movie or you are likely to be comparing the movie to the book (like i did) when watching it. I watched the movie a couple times after that and I was more comfortable with the actors portrayals. Definitely a romantic vamp movie. Don't compare to any Anne Rice novels this is in a category of its own. It's a guarantee you will want it in your collection if you are a Vamp movie buff.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!! Can't get enough!","review":"I just LOVE the Twilight Saga! Just can't ever get too much of Edward! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent rendition of the novel","review":"Now, no movie will be exactly like the book...but this is pretty dang close! Visually, this movie is exactly how I pictured Forks, WA when I read the book. If the acting between Bella and others seems awkward...well, that's her character in the book...shy and awkward! Both Kristen Stewart and Rob Pattinson play Bella and Edward (respectively) to a tee. There are a few extra plot tweaks thrown in that are not in the book but that you will certainly enjoy. Also, see if you can spot Stephenie Meyers' cameo! I highly recommend the DVD extras with deleted scenes and the making of the movie. Definitely a wonderful keepsake for Twilight fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Second disc not dubbed right","review":"I loved the movie.

But the movie proved me wrong. I hadn't intended to watch it, but a friend rented it from a Redbox DVD center, and even one dollar was too much for this film.I watched it out of curiosity. it was like a car accident - horrid, but you can't tear your eyes away as the carnage unfolds. The acting, plot, and villains are ludicrous. I liked Isabella Swan's actor in 'Speak', but she did herself a huge disservice by starring in this film. Some of the sequences, scenes, and plot points were ridiculous. Glittering in the sun? Poison in a vampire bite? Vampires not having actual fangs, just dumb pointed teeth like a piranha!The ending was slow, torturous, contrived, and painful. I'm amazed someone greenlighted production of a horrible book and turned it into an even more horrible movie. This is what makes it hard for me to have faith in humanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep Wooden Stakes Handy When Approaching This Movie","review":"Only barely post-pubescent girls can be excused for declaring this movie \\"good.\\" Adults and the \\"Twilight Moms\\" that callously dare to sing this movies' praises are clearly just interested in Hollywood's latest male cheesecake and aren't objectively reviewing the film itself. The two main characters have the chemistry equivalent of rust, and the film itself the charisma of Ben Stein's character in \\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off.\\" Between the choice of watching this writing-deficient offal again and committing suicide, I'd really have to think long and hard which I'd choose. Final review: 122 minutes of pure unadulterated suck punctuated by numerous periods of mind-numbing boredom. I've seen the previews to \\"New Moon\\" by the way, and, though I haven't seen it (and never will), judging from the previews, I'm pretty sure the filmmakers have outdone themselves with an even worse film. One wonders how that was even possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"just love the series.

We've seen all this before, the constant struggle to not feed on human blood and the consequences of falling in love with a human while being gorgeous, immortal, and practically indestructible was fully and far more artfully covered by Anne Rice and her more believable and thought-provoking characters of the Vampire Chronicles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twilight","review":"The disc will not play.

I called support, and waited over 20 minutes to get somebody who couldn't fix the problem and had to be put on hold again to transfer to somebody else.

Too bad really because the great story gave it so much potential. The first problem was that they didn't stick to the book and actually cut some of the best parts of it. If you have such a huge fan base, why change what we loved? Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings are perfect examples of not messing too much with a good thing. The acting was just horrible. Where was the grace and elegance? No charming banter - no sexy strong confidence in Edward. What a waste. What was the author thinking I wonder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twilight","review":"I just watched the film and quite frankly don't understand what the all the hype about this film is. I guess if this is what 13 year old girls are watching then they must be just as annoying. Thankfully, I am not one of those.The girl is annoying, why would anyone care to be her friend or even befriend her. She is unsympathetic, rude and plain irritating. The acting between the two leads doesn't make me care about them. The plot boring. It tries too hard to be 'dark' but doesn't succeed. Frankly, I'd just wish he tear her throat out and drink her blood and be then end of the series. Can I say thank-you fast-forward.I give it 2 stars for the fact, it didn't deserve a 1 star. I'm just glad I didn't have to sit through this movie in the theater.

The Author wrote a compelling story, and I dragged a guy friend of mine to go see it the day it came out in the theater. The movie was excellent. Usually I don't like to watch movies after I have already read the book. But they made a visually stunning movie. They showed the emotions that you read in the books almost to a T. It was more than I expected and I ordered the movie as soon as I could pre order it. Thank you Stephanie Meyer for giving this single mother something new and interesting to read. And then the movie to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't watch","review":"Even after nearly three hours of downloading the video to my computer, all I got was an error message saying that it couldn't play the video---can anyone say \\"bait and switch\\"???"},{"rating":"1","title":"twilight code","review":"I was sooooooooooooo happy when I got the e-mail that I would be able to watch the movie the day it came out but my code did not work I was so unhappy!!!!!!!!!!

And now that i have seen it i have to say that we all lost another chance for a great movie.Dont get me wrong, the actors were ok but not the right once for this movie. There is realy no magic between them, which is the one thing a bookadaptation like that needs. The only character i liked was Ashley Greene who did a good job. The weak script and poor tricks were certainly not helping either. The whole thing looks to me like a incoherent line of scene which were glued together by some amateur, needless to say what the result is, a poor movie, something u watch to pass the time but nothing more.I get really scared when i think about the other books from this series, and what these butchers will do to them when they turn them into movies.My advice, buy the books and dont waste your money on a movieticket or even worth, the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage for Garbage.","review":"People that are into these kinds of fads need to be put on an island and left to their own devices.

Other than that the movie was boring as hell.Not to mention that vampires aren't really scary when they share things in common with My Little Pony, i.e. sparkling in the sunlight.Glad I only rented this and didn't buy it or see it in theaters."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Where for art thou, Edward?\\"","review":"In the tradition of such storied romances as ROMEO and JULIET and TITANIC's Jack and Rose comes TWILIGHT, a not-so-simple tale of boy-meets-girl when said boy turns out to be a vampire! Brooding Edward Cullen only has eyes for sheltered good-girl Bella Swan, yet their love is doomed from the start, for although Edward is unquestionably the finest hunk of undead flesh ever to walk the earth, he still has to pass gas. Will Bella's wholesome heart and tireless devotion be enough to purge Edward of the flatulent fires burning within him, or will night fall and cast a dirty, lingering pall over their love like a child with a disposable diaper?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie does not do the book justice","review":"I know the book is always better but I think this movie just doesn't capture the characters very well.

These super intense kissing scenes...I don't know... the way Edward kisses Bella... it looks like he really needs to pee or something like that.For my taste the movie is too melodramatic and whiny. There are some cool scenes though. Probably watching it on a big screen would be more fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twilight sucks the life out of you.","review":"Didn't read the book, don't want to, saw the movie, hated it. Everything about it was horrible all across the board. There are so many things wrong with this movie, where to begin? The make up. When your trying to make someone look pale, you don't just paint their face, you also go past the jawline and paint the neck as well. The vampires looked like clowns. The actress who played Bella looked too self-aware, the actor who played Edward looks like an American Idol reject. The screenplay read like a Lifetime movie or an after-school special from the 80's. With vomit inducing dialogue like \\"hold on little spider monkey\\" it's really difficult to take this movie seriously. This film is not going to age well, it's already bad now so in 5 years what will become of it? The movie Interview With A Vampire is the only film in it's genre that closely portrays and understands the vampire lifestyle. The new generation just doesn't get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight movie","review":"I found the books to be much better but have enjoyed the movies as well. To be honest, so far my favorite movie from this series has been Eclipse. They got a better director and did a much better job on the filming. But Twilight starts the journey and fits in fine. Not just like the book and, if you're anything like me, you can pick it apart comparing it to the book. But then again, very rarely is a movie like the book.

I decided to take a chance on the movies. I was unable to find the first movie Twilight at any Redbox within 25 miles, so I opted to purchase for 14.99 on Amazon on Demand. The connection & clarity of the service was Great; too bad the movie was AWFUL ;(. I realize movie adaptations are entirely different than the books on which they are 'loosely' based, and for the most part I can usually enjoy each story on its own. However, this movie version was wooden, lame, and completely lacked the intensity of the novel. I recommend waiting until you can find a .99 rental! I think the other 3 movies in the series are better than this first installment (or maybe I just severely lowered my expectations)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book was so good, the movie was so bad...","review":"I loved this series of books and was so looking forward to the movies.

Now, I'm an addicted fan. I bought all the books but I started reading from the first book cause I wanted to see the differences from the movie. I also bought this special edition set which is great. It has a great bonus DVD. I'm sure every Twilight fan will love to watch. Specially the extended and deleted scenes are great to watch. It's sad to know, Kristen Stuart's favourite scene is deleted in the movie but you are able to watch it at the bonus dvd. There is also the dream scene of Bella, where she thought she saw Edward in her room.

Nothing ever was developed well and the jumping from scene to scene was just too much to allow you to suspend judgement.And the extras were introduced by the producer who was a wanna be hip spaced out mommy.

It was almost like the director felt that he had to really dumb down and sterilize the movie in order for his target audience (teenage girls), to be able to understand it. Quite frankly, I think they should feel insulted at how elementary the movie was translated from the novel. Unfortunately, I saw this on opening day and all the female audience seemed to care about was oggling at Robert Patterson and \\"OooOOOoooing\\" every time he appeared on the screen. Maybe the director was right and depth of plot and suspense DON'T matter to the target audience.

After seeing the trailor and that Kristen Stewart was going to play Bella i had zero interest in seeing the movie, knowing that it most likely will be full of holes, not as passionate and directed toward the pre-teen/teen audience. Now that it's release is nearing i don't think i will be able to help myself, i will most likely give it a try but my expectations are low and i could tell just by the bits i saw on youtube that the movie is definately missing...something. I just hope New Moon will redeem the Twilight saga and make for the wonderful world i invision while reading the book. Now i guess i just wait for Midnight sun...ooops where not suppose to talk about it, i forgot ;p"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For \\"Real Men\\"......","review":"This movie is clearly for young white girls or people who are in love with the jonas brothers....I asked the My Movie rental store for my money back....This movie suck----Real vampires would have sucked her dry, Not invite her to dinner..."},{"rating":"1","title":"How utterly disappointing!","review":"This movie was a huge disappointment. Everything about it was all wrong...the cast, the scenes, the story. I saw the movie after reading the first two books and I was absolutely shocked and dumbfounded with the HORRIBLE acting and the less-than-stellar casting job. Kristen Stewart ruined Bella's character and there was absolutely nothing about Robert Patterson to fall in love with. Watching the movie was depessing after having loved the book so much. I was really afraid after watching it that these were the people that were going to be in my head when I read the last two books because I knew it would ruin it for me. Thankfully, I somehow blocked the faces of the untalented actors out and was able to still enjoy Eclipse and Breaking Dawn. If I were Stephenie Meyer, I would be heartbroken over the slaughtering of her book into a movie. I would never spend the money on this movie and I will not go to see the next one that comes out. I'll stick to books with this series...."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid stupid stupid","review":"idk how people enjoyed this movie if your a fan of vamps then def stay away first off hey glitter in the sunlight? who are they liberachi vamps? stupid movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Bites!!","review":"If you actually read the book, then you will find the movie AWFUL!! I bought this thinking that it wouldn't be great, but I didn't think that it was going to be 2 hours of absolute crap. I think movies should be true to their origins and this was definitely not a good representation of the book. Even if I hadn't read the book, I wouldn't have found this movie entertaining or enjoyable in the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You Read the Book I don't thing you liked it","review":"This was a huge dissapointment. I think they missed the point of the book completly. They made it seem creepy in parts that were supposed to be romantic. And the was it was shot and the directing, the field and the tree part how they circled over and over was terrible. They should have put more time into parts like the Cullen's house, and how Bella and Edward love each other. To me it seemed like they were facinated with each other but not in love.Basically the music suckThere was almost no dialogeThe dilogue there was suckedThe filming was wierd with all the circleingRomantic parts like Edaward admitting he watched Bella sleep and Edward playing the piano became creepy"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THE BOOKS, and I LOVE THE MOVIE!","review":"Yes, the movie isn't the best in terms of effects and other aspects, but I loved it just the same. I have actually seen the movie 8 times and I'd say, it just gets better every time. I also finished re-reading the series and it still felt like I read it the first time. I still can't put down the book and somehow, it made me cry more. I just love everything about the Twilight Saga. Thanks SM for this wonderful creation of yours. Just pre-ordered my copy of the DVD. Can't wait! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"YEAH!!! Twilight on DVD","review":"OMG!!! Pre-ordered now. I am not missing this opportunity. I absolutely loved this movie in the theater. As a die-hard Twilight fan myself and my daughter, we can not wait to get this. Even though the movie seemed to be made with less quality, the plot and actors were just incredible. A+++++++++ All the Way. Go Twilight!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie is terrible","review":"i hate this movie it stinks theirs no plot no charecter development and all the charecters are cut board cut outs none of the actors have chemistry with each other either this movie stinks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the book series stinks to do not waste your money on this buy something else instead"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get bitten by The Twilight Saga","review":"I'll admit that when this first came out, I had no interest in seeing this. I never would've thought that one day I would be a Twihard. I first saw this last year on FX. I didn't get into at first though. Sometimes it takes time for something to grow on me and then I'll be a big fan of it. A few weeks later though, I became a fan. Now The Twilight Saga is my favorite movie series. It is very romantic and the characters are likeable. I know that these movies have gotten some criticism for bad acting, but I can't see why. If you're a guy, you might not like this because it's a romance movie and there's not much action,. Although, I do happen to know a few guys that like the series. Overall, it's a movie I would recommend seeing. I also recommend the other movies and the books."},{"rating":"2","title":"For all ages","review":"This is written for youth, but I have friends in 30's, teens, 40's and 70's that have enjoyed it. It might classified as a romance, and thr romance is epic, but I enjoy the making of vampires and shape shifters into human friendly creatures just with special powers"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't Believe","review":"I was really surprised that they changed the movie from what was seen in the theater. Edward told Bella to Google something? and When did he become som human, that he could not articulate about the colors of his eyes? OMG!! I was so upset. I really hope that there is a second version on the DVD or I will definately send it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"more promised, less delivered","review":"When I received the complimentary rental because I'd bought the movie, I tried to download it, but I was unsuccessful. My daughter wanted to watch it so much that I ended up paying to see it online, but I'm still waiting for the download to allow me to watch with her. It is taking forever and I'm not even sure it will work when the download completes in some 3 1/2 hours. This is disappointing, to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Working !!!","review":"I would have loved to have seen the movie this weekend, but I couldn't get it to work. I tried the promotional code several times to no avail. It would have been nice. I'll have to wait for the UPS driver to bring it to me tomorrow. Bummer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight","review":"While not as close to the first book as I'd like, it's a pretty good movie. When I initially saw it, I really disliked it but my friend told me to give it another chance and he was right, the more you watch it, the more it grows on you. Pretty good interpretation of the story, if not completely accurate, but what based-on-a-book movies are?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow that was bad...","review":"You know, I've never seen a movie where the ENTIRE cast phones in their parts more or less. Out of all of the actors, I only have heard of three and had seen them in something other then Twilight, and I know at least one of them can act.The script for the movie took what was bad from the book and just made it worse; you can tell that this was just a paycheck for the actors, and that they didn't really care about the movie. And that they were working with a bad script made from a mediocere book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEESY! Almost painful to watch","review":"I'm a fan of the Twilight books, but OH! This just hurt to watch! EXTREMELY cheesy, everything forced, just corny, ugh, it is just uncomfortable to think about.If you haven't read the books--don't start with the movie! If you like the books, rent the movie if you must just to see Edward and Bella in the flesh.Only reason I gave the movie 2 stars is because of the Baseball Scene--much cooler than I had imagined when I read the books. Other than that--ouch.I suggest just looking at pictures of scenes to go along with what you read, and skip actually watching the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please read the books!!!","review":"This movie leaves out a lot of critical and heart-pounding scenes from the book. This movie is very choppy, also. Please, I beg you, if you watch the movie first before reading the books...you may not want to read the bokks, however, they are 120times better. This comes from a person who always would rather watch a movie than read a book. Don't get me wrong, I have seen the movie 3x already just because of certain characters are hot, and some scenes are rewind-worthy."},{"rating":"2","title":"My New Favorite Movie!!","review":"I liked the movie so much, that I went out and bought the complete twilight sage books! It has been years since I touched a book, so you know that this movie definitely got to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies...","review":"One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Horrible acting, terrible special effects and poor writing make this a really bad movie. I actually enjoyed the book somewhat (although it is not great either), but the movie lost any charm the book had. All the best dialogue was non-existent and the relationship between Edward and Bella was portrayed as more of an infatuation than love. There were dramatic parts that were so cheesy that my friend and I could not stop laughing...I actually thought we might get kicked out of the theater....and we are 39 years old! I think this movie could have been better than the book if they had a decent writer and competent actors. Pattinson and Stewart are decent actors if they have better writing, but the high school friends are just bad. Funny - it reminded me of the Star Wars movies in a way...such bad writing that it made good actors look like they couldn't act."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um...Wow, that was... Wow...","review":"I knew this movie was going to suck before I saw it. I guess my crappy movie senses were tingling. Anyway, I read a 4 book and loved them so when I heard about the movie I decided to go and see it. Bad, bad idea in retrospect. It was nothing like the book.The Movie: Edward and Bella stare at each other for about an hour and a half. Then a battle breaks out. The End.The Books: Just read them."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give it a zero.","review":"::cue sing-song voice:: SUH-UH-UCKED. Worst dialogue (and lack there of) ever. Edward and Bella always looked like they were going to cry or vomit, or both. Bella delivers her monologue in a flat, boring monotone, like an emo robot. Edward kept wanting her to stay away, but he was the one approaching her. She loves him for no reason fathomable by intelligent minds. The villain doesn't start the chase until the movie is almost over, and is killed about 15 minutes later. In a two hour movie. Lame plot. Angsty. Too many inconsequential characters. The list of what is wrong with this movie (as well as the book series) goes on indefinitely.In short, it was unbearably stupid. The only way I made it through the whole thing was by watching it with the Rifftrax on. I was with Mike Nelson when he suggested killing himself half way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappiest movie ever","review":"Please, do not watch this movie! The acting is horrible, and so are the special effects. Many of the good Edward and Bella scenes from the book have been taken out or horribly rearranged. I saw the movie in theaters and had to fight to keep from laughing through it. I don't understand why it is getting all of this hype, because in all honesty, it was a total piece of crap. I thought Stephanie Meyer wanted the movie to portray the book correctly, but it doesn't at all. I almost feel embarrassed for her, for I am certainly embarrassed to say I saw this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly disappointed","review":"After having read the whole series and then watching the movie, I was sadly disappointed. The acting was horrible, the story line was incomprehensible - the heroine is supposed to be a klutz, and yet it shows her falling one time on the driveway?After the attack on Bella by James, in the book Edward is trying to save her life, in the movie Carlisle, has to tell Edward to stop because \\"he's killing her.\\" Sheesh.I think if there are going to be additional movies made for this saga, they need to give the \\"stars\\" acting lessons, and stick closer to the story line.My 10 year old daughter even thought it was horrible! She thought the guy who played Jasper was the best actor in the movie, and he only had one sentence!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Horrible Movie with bad plot, Bad Charaters, and more.","review":"Note: Twilight fans are voting all my reviews down because they can't stand a opinion.Twilight is perhaps one of the worst series ever made. It starts off with this girl named Bella and she falls in love with this guy named edward, who contains no emotion or anything of the sort. bella finds out Edward is a \\"vampire\\" (if you can even call him that) By using google. Yes, google. The Search engine. if that isn't enough, when edward hits sunlight, he doesn't die, oh no, HE SPARKLES. Yes, you heard me, sparkles. I am not gunna say anymore because it is so horrible. Just take it from me, don't buy this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a terrible movie","review":"I have to say that the books didn't grab me, but the movie is much much worse. Acting is at best poor. Direction makes the plot hard to understand (even after reading the books). Whatever you do don;t buy this unless it's for somebody who really can't live without it, or maybe for somebody you aren't fond of.Worst movie ever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this supposed to be about Vampires?","review":"This movie was a joke! I can't believe the hype around this film, it was boring! Only some action (if you call it that) at the end. I know, it is a love story...please! I mean, come on, a vegetarian vampire, that's weak! And don't get me started about how when the sun hits him he glows! ewww Awful movie folks, don't waste your time or money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ughhh Bad acting by all parties","review":"Ok we fell for the hype and rented the DVD. Just Yuck. Bad acting all the way around. Bad make up - I mean come on... The vampires are supposed to be pale, we get it. Did they all have to look like heroine addicts who had not washed their hair in a month? And Bella's parents... Really? A cop for a Dad who has NO CLUE HIS CHILD HAS GONE TO ANOTHER STATE with a group of strangers?Perhaps the books are better. I certainly hope so, because this movie was truly awful from an adult's perspective. The pre-teens in our life all loved it which is just as well, as every word spoken throughout the movie was clearly written for children rather than adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not so special edition","review":"While I LOVE the books & the movie did deliver... the special features left much to be desired. I found more on the internet than on the second disk. In fact - EVERYTHING that's on the 2nd disk IS online. So I say, don't wast your $ on the 2-disk. Bye the movie & Google all the behind the scenes footage and interviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"sadly disappointed","review":"I bought the movie hoping it would be decent since the books had been wonderful. Now I wish I could return it. The acting sucked and they edited out most of the love scenes and other important plot points. The only characters they even remotely kept similar is Edward and Bella. They completely changed Esme's story as well as Jasper and Rosalie. I am so disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad acting and to many Pauses. One word: Rifftrax lol","review":"I hate vampires, the only thing i watched this for was the hilarious Rifftrax commentary making fun of it, which make's the movie great when it's being mocked. Bella needs to take some kind of language class, she pauses to much. No doubt devote fans are going to attack me, but whatever, their souls their loss of taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a musthave for Twilight Saga Fans","review":"I love this movie!Can't stop watching it, and all of the bonus material on the second disc is great. I especially enjoyed seeing how they created the fight scene in the ballet studio between the Cullens and James.This is a definate must have for any fan of the series. BTW, if you love these movies and haven't read the books...you're really missing out. The books are so much better than the moives!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Item should be called Ultimate Twilight Ripoff","review":"I purchased the Twilight Ultimate Collector's set, sold mainly on the jewelry box that \\"appears\\" to have a mirror. Turns out the box was made of cardboard with aluminum \\"hinges\\" and arrived broken apart. The mirror was a shiny plastic. The compartments were also plastic. Who ever heard of placing jewelry in a cardboard box. Lol. The watch didn't work, even after putting my own battery in. The charm bracelet appeared tarnished.
