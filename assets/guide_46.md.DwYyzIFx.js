I remember see'ing it when i was a young lad and enjoyed it then and still do now. A must for any fan of horror or whatever category people would put it in. A movie about a rabid dog that traps a mother and her homo son in a car a little boring in the begining but becomes a very good action filled .Worth the money as it was one of the first dvd's I purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"King Adaption","review":"This is adapted from a Stephen King novel about a killer dog. King is the most popular name in horror. As a straight horror film I thought it was depraved. A mother and son are pursued in a car by the dog for several minutes. Contains dog on man violence."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN!","review":"I'm not a fan of Stephen King film adaptations. The only one I like is Carrie bec it was directed by Brian DePalma and featured terrific performances by Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie. Cujo is boring and not all that suspenseful. I couldn't wait for it to end. Not worth purchasing. Okay as a rental."},{"rating":"2","title":"CUJO SUBTITLING","review":"PLEASE I WANNA KNOW IF THE MOVIES HAVE SUBTITLES...ITS SO IMPORTANTE...I NEED TO BUY MANY...BUT I NEED TO KNOW IF IT HAVE SUBTITLES....THANKS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sucks!","review":"I'll cut to the chase....Plot ..., movie ..., not scary, will put horror fans to sleep...BAD MOVIE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, Don't get mad, this is worse than \\"The Shining\\"","review":"Oh man do people get mad at me when I say that, but it's true.

Once again Mr. King eludes the big screen's grasp!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A four-star short subject, a two-star feature","review":"The first hour or so of CUJO basically kills time. Then comes the exciting part where the rabid St. Bernard dog terrorizes a mother and child who are trapped in a stalled car. That half-hour would have been a scary short subject but sitting through CUJO's boring first hour made me wish I was late for the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this movie","review":"i have always loved horror flicks but this one is def one of my favs the price is amazing cant beat it ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book was a million times better","review":"This movie was pretty bad. the book was much better. i read the book when i was ten and loved it. i ordered the DVD because i loved the book so much. It was to bad i did because i thought the movie was pretty bad. The dog that played cujo was so small, he's supposed to weigh 200pounds and be the size of a horse. I felt so bad for poor Cujo though. What suprised me the most was that the DVD had no special features, not even a theatrical trailer! if u wanna read Cujo read the book first."},{"rating":"2","title":"blooper","review":"i have watched the movie several times........but have never noticed the blooper when cujo is at the window and the phone is ringing...you can vividly see a hand reach up and pull him out of the window......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cujo (Bluray) (25th Anniversary Edition)","review":"Cujo is a classic tale of what can go wrong in normal life. By now you know the story revolves around a rabid St Bernard named Cujo. The story does a great job in showing how man's best friends can easily become your worst nightmare. This bluray version of the original movie does do it some justice by providing improved visuals - the upgrades are not significant, but noticeable. This is an easy recommend for any fan of the original movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the worst horror flick I've seen.","review":"\\"Cujo\\" is such a poorly-made horror flick that isn't even really a horror film at all. It's more of a family melodrama turned bloodfest. In the first half, there's no humor or personality in the characters at all, so when the last half begins you start rooting for the dog to kill the annoying son and neurotic mother. Which brings me to the acting. This movie has got maybe the most annoying kid ever in a horror film, Tad Trenton. Even when the dog attacks don't occur, he whines like a baby. Such poor acting, huh! I was kinda waiting for Michael Myers to come knive him to death. He was THAT bad! He was not likable, humorous, or real; just a whiny baby that his mommy should have spanked HARD! I've never been so hard on a child character in a movie, but Tad in this movie deserved to get his comeuppence, which unfortunately, he didn't. When it comes to a scary movie, this one just let me down and wasn't scary at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"This dog is too cute to be vicious","review":"...and that's all I'm gonna say about this movie. I have always had a hard time hating the dog or being scared of it. It looks too cuddly and cute. You can totally tell that it is just sitting there, being told to grunt, but that in real, all he wants is just a bone and a hug. They should have picked something like a black Doberman or something or some other kind of beast. But a little cute Saint Bernhard? Speaking of miscasting for a role. I really wanted to like this movie, but because of their choice of dog I couldnt and if anything, it just upset me to see this dog be artificially made to look evil and be all bruised etc. The whole time I was thinking \\"awww\\". So good idea, wrong dog. If the audience wants to schmuse with it, it will not be scared of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog Lover Having Second Thoughts","review":"I am a huge dog lover, but this movie had me looking at canines in a different light for quite some time while I was little. For some reason, I always relate this movie to \\"Sandlot,\\" but this dog really was ridiculously mean. The scene in the junkyard made my eyes widen a couple times, and I'd give this movie four stars for being entertaining. Scary? Not at all. The book was even more grotesque, and I enjoyed every minute of it. All I kept thinking through the book and the movie was \\"What is taking so long for someone to shoot this dog?!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly A Complete Bore","review":"\\"Cujo\\" is about a rabid St Benard who turns on a woman and her son, adopted from the Steven King novel. Not much to say about the film. It's rather boring with notthing to grasp your desire for entertainment, save where the dog makes a few scary poses. The actors do little to enliven things or make sense of it. Plus the direction, story and editing is often sloppy and nonsensable. Plus, I've sworn the the blood in the gory scenes looked orange instead of red for some reason. In the end, \\"Cujo\\" is often forgettable and is more likely to put you to sleep than scare you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"Basically about a woman and her young son trapped inside their car for days because it broke down and outside theres a killer st.bernard dog with rabies that tries to charge himself in at the car at a number of points in the movie. Overall Its defenately not the best horror at all. It did keep me waiting to see what happens next, but it wasnt good at all, poor storyline and ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"This is a timeless Stephen King Film, has some great thrills, and scenes that will haveyou jumpin' out of your skin.....Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading photography of the product - Shows 3 pieces, delivers just ONE","review":"Every buyer should be aware of the fact that what the image of the product shows is not what is actually delivered. I bought it thinking of a 3 pieces set according to the image shown. For my surprise AMAZOM only delivered one single piece referred to as STD 977115. It is neither legal nor fair to use such strategy to grab the attention of potential buyers. Please be aware of such strategies and check the descriptions meticulously before ordering. The product itself is very good though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Children's movie","review":"This movie is a very good movie for your children. It teaches them values in life and to trust in God for everything. It also teaches them self worth. Even though Harvey feels that he is worthless, he comes to realize that God is in control and will help him if he will just trust in him. I think this movie is a very good movie for the whole family, especially children, to teach us all values in life. As cruel as this world is today, we all need something to give us a good laugh while inspiring us to go on with life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not be misled!","review":"The above two reviewers were either high or in league with the Wards (who acted in, produced, and gutted stuffed animals which were then used as puppets within the film). This is a sorry excuse for entertainment that is to the Muppets as sewer water is to champagne. I could have overlooked the shoddy workmanship, bad acting, and dirty camara lenses had it at least been mildly funny, however, any attmepts at comedy fell far short. This film takes place in a variety of sets, the kitchen, the garage, the barn, the backyard, and the church parking lot. I could go on but let's not get mean. This is a home movie that does not deserve any association with the greatness that is The Muppets."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Legend Is Born: Ip Man","review":"This movie tells about the life of the Ip Man, how he mixed two great martial arts technique's. And becomes one of the great's Martial arts Master of his time to this day. In the story Ip Man is betrayed by his 1/2 brother. The Chinese and Japanese where at war at the time Ip Man was growing up (Ip Man was Chinese) he had to fight the against Japanese and help out the Martial art school he was attending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Camera Speed ruined the action sequences","review":"This kid's talents and efforts don't hold a candle to Donnie Yen. When Yen, Jet Li, Bruce Lee made a film, one could appreciate the natural fluid movements of the martial arts choreography. This film looks hopped up on Camera speed ( similar to how Jason Statham ruined Transporter 3 ). It took way too much away from the action sequence as it is appreciated and intended to be. The story line was fine....Ip Man's young character was fairly well done. But as said earlier....Yen had to be shaking his head in disappointment that the filmography was not properly continued."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had high hopes for this movies. I mean the first two about Ip Man were great... so I really expected this one to at least compare to those ones. But there is no climax... there's just pretty much the same tone throughout the whole thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iip Man Legend","review":"The item came in a nice clean package and it was on time. I am very happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ip Man: The Legend is Born","review":"This film although lacking Donnie Yen, still far exceeds almost every other martial arts film prior. When someone knowledgeable about martial arts can watch a film and see a skilled martial artist, director and very well thought out choreography it's beyond pleasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon sold a Factory Mistake, Seller won't fix it...","review":"Normally I would have given this a 5 star rating, since I own the series, but I received one of the videos with NO SUB TITLES, and NO ENGLISH at all, it was all in Chinese, which from an action and story perspective was great, because it really filled in some background and was great to watch, but with out the subtitles it was useless to me to really follow. I usually watch the movie reading subtitles first, then I play the movie again to really watch the action....This whole thing is really distracting and upsetting that no one is willing to step up to fix this issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good flick!","review":"My son and I enjoyed the movie. My nephew also enjoyed it, glad it came with blue ray and DVD. Great deal too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This being a prequel I had very low expectations , but being a big IP Man fan I wanted to see and was very surprised at how much I enjoyed this film and actors. Fight sequences were great and storyline fantastic. The actor that played lead is a fantastic actor and martial artist as good as Donnie yen. Definitely looks like a younger version of him. This is a must have film for martial arts fans. Highly recommend. Small piece of trivia The real IP Mans son has a role in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not currently compatible with Mac OS X v. 10.4.8 and later","review":"Adapter does not work with my MacBook running OS X version 10.4.10 due to driver incompatibility.StarTech technical support advises \\"kernel change\\" beginning with OS X version 10.4.8, probably is causing incompatibility and they're working on patch as of 24 Jul 07.Full marks to the responsive, knowledgeable tech support team but this product's not targeted to Mac users in other ways: 1) inaccurate installation instructions; 2) software provided on mini-CD not playable on MacBook (requires CD player that ejects a drawer/cupholder); 3) necessary installation files hidden in nested folders with cryptic titles.So Mac users, before you order this USB to Ethernet adapter, recommend you check with StarTech on current driver compatibility with your OS version and be tech-savvy enough not to need the manual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it's advertised to be","review":"This is advertised as a folding door.

After what seemed like a very long time I received the two extensions. I figured they were shipping it in two shipments. After not receiving the for awhile I contacted them and was told that the add wasn't written properly and that I was actually only ordering the extension. My account was credited and they told me to throw the extensions in the garbage. I just looked it up and it is advertised and discribed in the same way but is no listed as currently unavailable. Not a big surprise. I did give them zero stars, but they won't allow that.

And Rodney Jerkins remix of \\"Overprotected\\" is awful! The original is waaay better even if her vocals are too whiney, but on the remix her voice just sounds even more worse! So in conclusion, I probably spent a little more money on this CD than I originally wanted too, but the metro remix is just too beautiful..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all Costs","review":"I can't Understand why Britney Spears is Forced to Cover a Song on Every Album She drops.Joan Jett&the BlackHearts Threw Down on there Original Version of \\"I Love ROck&Roll\\" but this Britney Cover is really wack.She has no Edge ot Tone in Her Vocals whatsoever to me.DarkChild's Re-Mix is pretty weak as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A comedy about life on the other side of America","review":"This well done film won at Sundance in 1993.

A great rental, if you can find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A comedy???","review":"Come on now, let's face it: This movie is awful! Another reviewer, trying to be kind, I think, suggests it might be enlightening for those who don't have the experience of living in an ethnic neighborhood. But really, there's nothing insightful about the situations in which these characters find themselves; they're boring, and offer no new aspects of a foreigner trying to make it in a foreign land. It's all cliches, and loaded with scenes with absolutely nothing happening! Okay, how about the positive aspects? Well, some of the characters are pretty likeable in my opinion--the main character and the hostess in the restaurant, in particular. That's the only positive thought I can muster for this one! And by the way, someone called this a comedy? I must have fast-forwarded through that part."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Movie With No Ending = 1 Star","review":"This movie was a Sundance winner? I heard this was a great movie so I was very excited about my lucky purchase. But I'm not sure what bothered me more: the poorly lit sets or the wooden acting by some of the lead actors. Probably the most bothersome thing about this film was the lack of an ending to the story.Did the writer forget to add on the final scene so the audience would have some sense of where the lead character's life would take him? Or did the director just decide to call it a night knowing the audience would be denied have a satisfying (good, bad or ugly)ending to almost 2 hours worth of watching and caring about the lead charcter.A celluloid slice of life into the dilemmas of the expatriated maybe, but we still need some kind of conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"I baught this DVD based on the name, thinking it was going to be geared towards beginners...not so!Although the movements are extreamly beatiful and the music in the background is very calming, unless you have a pair of video glasses it is very hard to follow these instructions.First of all, it might have been a good idea for them to shoot this video in a room that has mirrors. Being a former Martial Arts student, this is always a big help being able to see the techneque being tought from all angles.This DVD starts out with a great history and demonstraits how each movment is uses as a defense, it also shows you the full form from all angles. The problem is that because you have to move in a complete circle, it is hard to see the next move from behind.This definately takes practice, but I strongly recomend purchasing a pair of video glasses to avoid a crampted neck!Personally I found the DVD to be extreamly long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trouble Playing on My DVD Player","review":"I have a very good Blu-Ray DVD player that plays all sorts of DVDs. However, I found that I could not play this DVD on it.The only way I can play it is on my PC. Although the content provides a great deal of visual detail, the interface is poor. You have to figure out how to navigate and use the DVD, with no guidance from the material in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works At Your Pace","review":"This is an great video for the practicing or aspiring martial artist who is interested in learning more about the history and benefits of Tai Chi. The DVD provides an ideal format for individual instruction, using short, well-labeled chapters that include each of the various postures presented at a comfortable, learnable pace. Master Liang is an exceptional teacher who provides perfect presentation of the 24 postures in appropriate detail, at a variety of angles, including specifice inhale/exhale points throughout the form. Of particular value is his solo presentation of each posture, followed by the self-defense presentation countering an attacker. For those who want more, also included is the longer 48 posture form. A must-have to complete your library!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"It is a very good video. I like the way they show it from the front and back which a lot of videos do not. It does go a little to fast (verbally) in some places making it a little difficult to follow. I have tried several Tai Chi videos before finding this one, and it has most of them beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased with my purchase","review":"I love the different views & angles.

Has anyone else had this problem? When you are facing the instructor do you mirror his movements or try to use the same leg and arm moevments he uses? Any help would be appreciated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bduh","review":"Well, I honestly exptected more from this DVD. I expected a pleasant background, explanation, music... anything! All you will see is a man practicing Tai-Chi about 4 times in an empty room. Two times facing the front, and two times facing the back. I liked the applications of Tai-Chi, but it kept referring to a book - which I don't have. I guess it was my fault for not getting more information about this product before buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Tai chi purchase","review":"I've just started looking into Tai chi, and think it may be the best exercise for me.

Therefore, I've given it a good number of stars, and at this point would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Intro to Tai Chi Chuan","review":"As the title of the DVD notes, this is simplified Tai Chi Chuan. The DVD provides an excellent introduction with background history on Tai Chi and the health benefits of adding Tai Chi to your daily workout.The 24 and 48 postures are presented in detail along with martial applications. I was able to follow the movements fairly easily as they were shown in a slow progressions with clear explanations. I would definitely recommend this DVD to a person looking to incorporate Tai Chi into their life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tai Chi for beginners","review":"This Tai Chi dvd is very helpful. As a person who has attended a 6 week class in tai chi, it was very easy to follow and told me everything I need to continue in this martial art. You can either do the routine following the master, or have him show you exactly how the various postures should look, going slowly over them. Each section of the dvd is seperate and easy to find. You can delve as deeply or shallowly as desired into tai chi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good video","review":"Good video to learn the technique. I especially like the fact that he faces away to help you learn it in the right direction. Would be enhanced with a mirror for him to face. Also think it is great for an intermediate tai chi practitioner. Beginners may have trouble learning the movements."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good dvd","review":"A highly skilled taijiquan teacher shows and explains the 24th form simplified tai chi chuan form and it's application in detail.I'm always recommending the book and the dvd to my tai chi chuan students in germany."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Big Book!","review":"This book surprised me because I have four of the other Art and Architecture books and they are little chunky things. This must be from a different publisher. Anyway, it's very informative and has tons of photographs (why wouldn't it?); I have perused it, but not thoroughly. These books are as interesting because of their 'history' coverage, as for their pictures of buildings and artworks. I plan on getting a couple of others, possibly in the same series; I think there is one on Andalusia, the Louvre and Berlin...?

NOTHING LIKE THE REAL DEAL! YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!","review":"OK Amazon since you asked...Made the mistake of ordering this from Amazon (Fulfilled by Fragra). What arrived was NOT Bellodgia. How do I know this with certitude? Simple. My Mom's nose and ordering another bottle DIRECTLY from the SOURCE (the Caron Boutique inside Phyto Universe on Lexington Ave in NYC). Bottom line, you DO get what you pay for--the $38 dollar bottle of who knows what that arrive from Fragra had absolutely ZERO resemblance to AUTHENTIC Bellodgia obtained directly from Caron ($98 with 2 Day Shipping). N.B. Caron's formula has NOT changed since it was first introduced in 1927 and there are only THREE (3) places to ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY get AUTHENTIC Bellodgia: 1 in NYC and 2 in Paris.Finally, in all fairness to Amazon (and Fragra) I did receive a Full Refund fairly quickly without a big hassle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classy Fragrance","review":"This is a classy vintage fragrance that still works today. My grandmother wore this perfume all her life after she smelled it in the 1930's on a woman wearing a fur coat with fresh violets pinned to it. She never tired of the scent and it was her signature until she died at 102. I have worn Bellodgia off and on for many years and have always found that the eau de toilette has great staying power without being overwhelming. Although I am not as faithful to it as my grandmother was, I keep coming back to it as a classic, warm scent that is flowery, spicy and sophisticated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Firebird camaro gen4 portfolio","review":"A good collection of what seems to be most of the articles from road and track about the gen4 fbody cars.

This book is great for review of the multiple choice section, the free response questions in this book were really easy. What I did I joined at www.apcentral.collegeboard.com and I used actual AP Calculus Free Response questions to practice all the way up to the test. Using this book and those free response questions I think it definitely helped me pass the AP Exam. I would definitely recommend this book to people who are serious about passing their AP Calculus exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best book for review.","review":"This book was very difficult to follow. It contains both AB and BC sections, but does not specify which sections are which. It is difficult to see where they are headed much of the time, as if they are rambling with no direction. I found it to be very unhelpful and confusing. It was wordy and complicated. I often felt like the authors were trying to impress me with their knowledge when all I wanted was a clear, concise review! I recommend the Cliff Notes instead, which is about half the size and much easier to read and understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Egg noggin anyone?","review":"The basic premise about adding calcium may be true because it will make you feel fuller.

I know we are all trying to diet, but diet food gets boring and it seems its always the same. Edita has breakfast recipes, like Chocolate Breakfast Whip...I love getting my chocolate fix early. She has great snacks, shakes and smoothies that are really different and tasty. She has lunches with great soups, and awesome imaginative salads. There are dinners, like Salmon Bugers and a terrific tasting and good looking Stuffed Tomato recipe. But my favorites are the Bedtime Snacks and Desserts--try Pink & Blush Trifle; Cheesecake Cookies and Cinnamon Apple Tart. If this is the way to get thin and lean, I say \\"let's eat\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drink Your Milk & Lose Weight","review":"Well, it seems Mom was right. Based on what I have read in this book, the value of the calcium in milk extends beyond bones and into weight loss. It was a fascinating read.

BUT - The sound quality if terrible! The whole CD sounds like (if any of you are old enough to remember - the old 78 records) very scratchy throughout. I sent it back and Amazon sent me a new one which sounded the same. They graciously credited my account.At their suggestion, I then ordered from one of their outside sellers, Import CD's, (my choice of seller) and the CD sounded the same. Amazon thought that maybe it was their own shipment that was defective. I have requested Import CD's to reply to my request to send it back and after 10 days I still have not heard from them. I did inform Amazon 2 days ago but have not heard from them regarding this seller either. Needless to say I am very disappointed. I would love to have this CD IF I could find one that was not defective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective CD","review":"When I previewed the songs on Amazon they sounded ok and I thought, these are some neat songs from the 50's to have.

First time I can remember ever getting a defective CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Sound","review":"Like a previous reviewer the CD I received also had very poor quality sound. It sounded like it was recorded straight from a much abused LP. I have well over 300 CD's and have never experienced such poor quality sound on a CD.

The narrator has a sort-of nasally voice and a small New York accent, but that is the only \\"bad\\" thing I can say about it, which is nothing. At the end of the video there is a part where you can count the cars (there are over 100!) on a long freight train. We crack up listening to my son count 1-13 and then start back over at 1 again and keep going 1-13 until the train passes and the DVD ends.

I was somewhat on the fence about buying this product due to some of the reviews. I don't regret my purchase one bit. I guess I did not have much of a problem since my two TVs are only about 15 feet away. It takes some time to get the right channel and antenna direction, patience is a virtue. I don't know how it works with a wireless network, since I haven't purchased my laptop yet. I did not rate it a 5 just because there still is some fuzz/popping from time to time through the speakers. Other than that, great product.Note: I realized that if you live in a townhouse or a condo with close neighbors, you will most likely get interference from time to time. My neighbors wireless laptop does interfere, and switching channels on the box does nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"works as expected.","review":"Very easy setup and it works as expected.

I tried all channels, relative positions of antennas, and with and without wireless phone and internet router functioning. Nothing improved the quality of the image, full of \\"ghosts\\".

I tryed using it on between 2 tv's no less then 30' apart from each other and one wall to pass through and I can't stop the fuzz and popping. I would compair it to antiquated \\"rabbit ears\\". The signal is average when you are touching the antenna and standing on one leg, but the moment you walk away it goes fuzzy and makes loud popping sounds. Not to mention that 800ghz is the same band as most wireless home phones.

The receiver was less than 60 feet from the transmitter, and the advertised range was up to 150 feet.

I have about 50 feet and at least 3 walls (on two separate stories) between the transmitter and receiver. Picture quality is mostly good (Standard Definition), and sound can be a bit tinny.

Put it my Grandmother's house as a solution for her bedroom. Only $15 more than the convertor boxes, and she gets all her channels. Only two slight complaints. The little ir blaster that you put over the sensor on your video device needs better adhesive, fixed that problem with electrical tape. Get a very mild interference when the microwave is on(2.4Ghz), but again not a huge deal, best not to shoot it right past the microwave, but I had no choice.

The antennas are barely hanging on by a couple of very thin wires that will break eventually and then it's toast. I ditched cable, so I watch TV programs over the internet by connecting my laptop to the TV in the bedroom and stream it to a TV in the living room. I also used it with my wireless security cameras. The quality could be better, but that was my trade-off over spending more money on a new TV with built-in Wi-Fi, or buying another converter box for my older model TV.

It wasn't too bad until we turned on our cordless phone to use it and the tv went nuts. Static and crackling. We have returned it because I can't imagine watching TV and never having the phone ring or not using the phone. Not worth the money or hassle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"May need to do some work","review":"It is good to see many positive reviews for this. Don't be discouraged if you buy this and don't get good results. You may have to do some work. First, you must follow the directions and ensure the correct sides of the antennas are pointed at each other. Next, you must ensure you have a clean channel selected from one of the four choices. I got the worst reception at channels A and D, but B and C came in clearly. Pay special attention to all 2.4 GHz transmitters you own, by seeing what channels they transmit on. I found the interference was not my wavelan, but my Logitech wireless joystick, so check the bands and frequencies of everything in your home that is on 2.4 GHz and choose a channel that is not in use.

Still, the same thing, and I was only going through 2 walls, a total of 20 feet. So, just for the heck of it I gave them line of sight. a 17 foot span, line of sight.

The football is so much more real, the movements are much less robotic than 2001, you can't beat the computer with the same plays over and over and over again, I mean this is a true strategy based football game, and that is just playing a single game. One thing that I do think should be added is the ability to create your own plays, and I think that whoever rated the ability of the players was a bit harsh on some people, especially the rookies, but hey, that's life, they have to earn it.

This model is a little higher and much quieter.However, the rubber baffle in the sink drain that helps muffle the noise has a much smaller center opening. That's great for blocking sound but also blocks some of the garbage and water on the sink side. This makes it more likely to need to push the garbage into the disposer... an increased safety hazard.Also, you'll need a 1/2\\" screw-in cable clamp for the incoming electrical line. I wish that had been noted on the box so I could have purchased it in advance.Those are the only two reasons I didn't give this a fifth star. Excellent otherwise, and hopefully will last as long as the InSinkErator it replaced."},{"rating":"2","title":"My third InSinkErator","review":"Just went through a kitchen remodel and a new garbage disposal was part of it. We have had 3 InSinkErators over the past 31 years and this is the first one larger than a 1/2 horse. This one is the best so far and I can recommend it to anyone. Hint about the installation since I am getting on in years the weight of this one was more than I could manage without my arms getting tired so I got my small car jack and it helped hold it up while I got everything aligned and then it slipped into the collar. So quiet you can hardly hear it running. Great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"They really missed it","review":"This could be a nice product. It is expensive enough to make me think lots of positive things about the product and the company. The disposer did not have all of the parts included. The missing part is one that is installed at the factory and is not sold separately. A week has passed since I called the Customer Support at InSinkErator. The initial promise was to send me the part FED EX two day delivery. I called again on Wednesday and I could not get any information from the Customer support person other than the problem was logged in. No shipping date nor carrier was available. This is very frustrating that they would let a product ship with out proper quality control and now be so unresponsive after their mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks great","review":"We are remodeling our kitchen , so we have not put it in yet, but I'm looking forward to a more powerful disposal"},{"rating":"1","title":"insinkerator evo excel 1 HP disposal","review":"this has to the loudest disposal ever and it said it was very quiet, not much that can be done now"},{"rating":"2","title":"How do you describe perfection?!","review":"As other reviewers have noted, this diposer is expensive, and worth every penny. It is a great example of you get what you pay for: grinding perfection that is virtually silent! The first time I used it I thought it wasn't working because it is barely detectable over the sound of running water. There is no comparison between this disposer and most of the cheap models on the market. The exterior is clad in gorgeous brushed stainless steel, not plastic. If you were designing an industrial style kitchen without cabinet doors this disposer would fit right in. It's almost too nice looking to be inside the cupboard!"},{"rating":"1","title":"InSinkErator Evolution Excel","review":"I have bought InSinkErrator before but now it is junk. I had to buy a insert for $50 extra for it to work with a cast iron sink. I was willing to do that but that did not end my problems. The cover is a piece of junk that fills up with waste when you use the disposal. Furthermore to fill the sink when you want to you must turn the insert over and you have to keep moving it to get the exact spot where it will hold water. What a junk disposal the company now makes. It use to be good just four or five years ago. Do not buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chicken bones, BE GONE!","review":"We replaced an old worn down wimpy (and LOUD) disposal with this gem.The install was easy enough by myself.

Tonight, I sent the bones and carcass down the drain. I did it at a gradual pace, slowly feeding it... In shock that it would and did actually devour the remains... I was likely too cautious, but 4-5 minutes later the chicken remains were out of sight. ...and this while the family was sleeping down the hall.It seems to have issues with lime peels though, but I won't knock a star for that.

First I wanted an inexpensive one, but after reading reviews decided the last thing I wanted was to have to listen to a wood chipper grinding away in the kitchen for the next 10 years. I finally bit the bullet and ordered this machine and I'm glad I did. It not only looks great but it is really, really, REALLY quiet. You can use it while everyone else is sleeping without waking them, and the manufacturer actually encourages you to stuff your garbage into it. It's supposed to chop it up so fine that it can't clog your pipes...we'll see. It definitely has the power to do it. In this case Amazon was by far the cheapest with no tax and free shipping, and I was surprised by an additional unexpected discount that showed up at checkout."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this garbage disposal!","review":"We moved into a new house and the previous one was for only a two person household and was very loud. 2 days after the warranty period was over it stopped working.

I did not have to replace the collar that goes in the sink. The new one latched into the old collar. No leaks.I did have to cut the drain tube to length to fit, so have a hacksaw handy. No big deal.The old one would not grind enough and sometimes I'd clog the drain even though I had turned on the disposal.This new one never does that no matter what I grind in there.I read the reviews about how quiet it is. They're all true. You really can barely hear it when its running. If there's stuff in there getting ground, you can hear it, but its certainly not loud. With nothing in there, and no water flowing, it really is almost silent.My only knock against it is that for this price it should come with a cord. I stole the old cord off the old disposal."},{"rating":"2","title":"The in-home warranty is no-hassle","review":"I won't go on about how awesome this disposal is, the previous reviews are all accurate. I did have a warranty issue however that I wanted to share. After eyeing this disposal for years I finally decided to pick one up from my neighborhood Lowes. Installation was a snap as I had a previous model installed. However when I went to turn it on it was dead. I double-checked the installation and verified power was coming to the unit. For whatever reason I just got a bad apple. These things happen. I called In-Sinkerator and they gave me a local appliance repair shop to contact for the warranty. The next day they were out, verified it was a unit problem and replaced it (and installed it) with a brand new unit at no cost to me. And I still have 6 years, 364 days left on the in-home warranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet and easy to install","review":"Installation was easy and the product is extremely quiet. The only hangup I had was that my original builder hard wired the previous unit to the electrical wire (which should have been no problem to deal with since this is common) but my previous unit used an elbow connection out of the bottom of the old inSinkErator and the flexible conduit was attached to this elbow connection. This new unit has a elevated lip on the bottom of the unit that did not allow me to just screw in the old elbow connection as there was not enough clearance. It required a trip to the hardware store to get a new flexible conduit holder that went straight down from the unit. Ironically, this elevated lip was cracked on my unit from the factory or from shipping but it does not seem to provide any function so I did not return the unit to Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"This thing is a beast!!!","review":"This is awesome, I can throw anything in there, from banana peels to chicken bones!

But the title is not very zen it does not do justice to this story. Heller had a story to tell and it is a mind blower that keeps on giving!

Unfortunately, the passage of time is quite apparent in the work product of the author. It is true that \\"Picture This\\" is full of witty insights into history. But the plot feels forced, the comedic timing is off, and in the end, the book seems like a hodge-podge of \\"gee wiz, that sure makes ya THINK about things\\" types of statements. I think it's a safe bet that anyone who reads this novel has gotten there by way of Catch-22. This was also the case when \\"Picture This\\" was released. Something more is needed to justify the book's 351 pages in hardcover besides basic assurances that \\"the world is f****d up.\\" You're better off just reading your copy of Catch-22 again.

I didn't expect to be treated to a 326 page long variation of Larry King's obnoxious observations in USA Today, set in ancient Greece and Holland of the 16th/17th century. The chronology is totally mucked up, it seems not because of some artitistic reason, but because it was cobbled together without any sense of structure.Finally, an author who seriously suggests that some of the dutch provinces are perhaps not even known to many INSIDE the Netherlands (hey Joe: this isn't the US you're writing about) doesn' instill too much confidence about getting his other facts right.One of the few books in my life I didn't finish (maybe the second half is a LOT better)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and Small","review":"I bought this for my home office.

The Eaglesmade a country-rock concept album explaining all those statements. The Eagles start with the tale of Doolin-Dalton, gunfighters in the old West. The trail unwinds through anxious young men to a man losing it, to a dying relationship, to a lonesome stargazer trying to find love, back to a gunfighter. The second side echoes the first although the lyrics reflect the loss the first side had brought on. It was a brilliant concept and it almost completely worked. The album lacks a complete vision of one person bringing all the ideas together. Frey and Henley worked completely together and stood each other up on some issues while in England, Roger Waters always got his way over the others in Pink Floyd.

It is a little shorter than most, just a little, but you can feel their love for the music when you listen to it. If you are looking for a CD that you can put on repeat and listen to for hours, this is it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish fulfulled.","review":"The album isn't what I wanted. I wanted the song desperado. Love that song. I have heard the album and it's good. They are so surprizing in their music. One really has to hear it to believe it. They are an American band that isn't afraid to try on different sounds, breaking in a culture different from their own. It's a soild ablum, and really fun to listen to. If your into surprises, and philosophy this album is for you. They go deep lyrically, and mix in a shocking, fun vibe of sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their very best","review":"The critics have pretty much always held up Hotel California as the greatest Eagles album and the first Greatest Hits collection (1971-75) as all we really need from the pre-Hotel days, but I have never agreed. While Hotel is an undeniably impressive record, it is clearly the product of a different group than the Frey/Henley/Leadon/Meisner quartet which was the nucleus of the first four albums. And of those four discs, which are all great, Desperado is simply the best. From start to finish, this record is nothing but one great song after another. I love them all, but on side two (on my vinyl version!) we get \\"Certain Kind of Fool,\\" \\"Saturday Night\\" and \\"Bitter Creek,\\" three of the best things these guys ever did...For me, this group was just never the same without Bernie Leadon's bluegrass influence and Randy Meisner's rock & roll heart. This stuff is endlessly listenable. Truly a \\"desert island disc.\\" Essential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Western Americana - Arizona Style","review":"IF you like the stuff Gram Parson's did with the Byrds, you might not like this, it's more esoteric than Gram.

I highly recommend this effort, it's got an undercurrent that's missing from today's country..."},{"rating":"2","title":"the outlaws were real","review":"I am in agreement with the majority of the writers that Desperado stands as the best of the Eagles, and certainly among the most completely realized concept albums of all time. I would like to note that the Dalton Gang were real outlaws who terrorized the Kansas/Oklahoma territory in the 1880's. They met their demise trying to rob two banks in their home area on the same day. The dead outlaws were laid out to be photographed in the custom of the day, and a replica of the photo featuring the musicians is on the back cover of the album. A video was also made which starred, in addition to various Eagles, friends such as Jackson Browne. You might wish to read the chapter on Desperado in Stranded (G.Marcus, editor), a collection of essays by rock critics about their desert island discs. This one is surely one of mine. Not a perfect album, but 5 stars anyway for quality and coolness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply put...a masterpiece","review":"Released just a year after their debut album, \\"Desperado\\" is a continuation of what the Eagles did better than anyone, make country rock for the masses. On this album the Eagles took the next step and made one of the greatest rock albums of all-time!\\"Desperado\\" is my all-time favorite Eagles record. Every song on here is a winner, and could have very easily been a radio hit in the early 70s'. The song writing on this album is also first-rate and it shows just how talented the guys in this band would become. Songs like \\"Outlaw Man\\", \\"Outta Control\\", \\"Doolin' Dalton\\" and \\"Desperado\\" are highlights, however, you'd be hard-pressed to find any duds on this baby.This album is absolutely terrific as it was, but when it was remastered and re-released it made an awesome record even better! I suggest if you like the Eagles, or anything from the 70s' you give this album a shot. No way you won't love this monster the whole way through!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Eagles' best albums","review":"This is not a 5-star classic, but I don't think any of the Eagles' studio albums were.

I sold this to a used cd store a couple of years ago, and I can't say I miss it that much. I have the song \\"Desperado\\" recorded on cassette, and I have the \\"Eagles Live\\" on cd, so no problem. This is definitely the handsdown worst studio release in the EAGLES discography. \\"On the border\\" is only slightly better than this one. \\"One of these nights\\" is their final one with Bernie Leadon and is their best effort, so stick with that one instead of \\"Desperado\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing Comes Close","review":"This is my favorite album by the Eagles. It has a simple elegance that is missing on their later efforts. Hotel California also is great but I still rank this one as their best.

I got size 4 and there's still a little bit more room to grow for my daughter who is now wearing size 5/5T dresses (Gymboree, GAP, etc). The order came promptly (signature required) with an instruction sheet for returns.

I purchased this anime after seeing some information about it before it was even dubbed. There is a lot to this anime as it has it's sentimental moments and it's moments of brash comedy. It's humor can be described as lewd to an extent, as it has a major sense of fan-service. If you are looking for an anime that is funny, a little ecchi, and can still maintain a decent story, then this is a good anime for you. Needless to say I went out and bought the second season the same night I got done watching the first, so that has to say something!-Fudgetruck's final verdict: \\"A good clash of comedy and story.

A lot of the songs in \\"The Very Best of Fingerstyle Guitar\\" are in the Fingerpicking series so for me this book was a waste of money.However, if you don't own any of Hal Leonard's Fingerpicking songbooks, then this book is a great buy. There is a great mix of songs, including the ubiquitous \\"Yesterday\\" by the Beatles. You get a little classical, pop, holiday and Latin among a wide skill range so any guitarist with beginning through intermediate skills should not be bored. The CD is also a nice touch and something that isn't available with the Fingerpicking songbooks.All in all, I highly recommend if you're starting out with fingerpicking.

To begin with, antennae itself is much larger than it needs to be to do what it does. Secondly, the design requires the drilling of a one half inch diameter hole to allow the largest part of the connection to be made below the mounting surface. The alternative would have been to design it so that you could bring the smaller connector up through a three sixteenth to one quarter inch hole to make the connection in the body of the antennae. Generally speaking, in marine applications the larger the hole the greater the likelihood of a significant leak."},{"rating":"1","title":"connector and service problems","review":"The connector on the antenna I bought (from Amazon, quick delivery) FELL OFF the cable when I rerouted it after its first year.

Sirius's antennas are small, compact and low profile. But, this does work. I use it in Colorado where I boat in the mountains and foot hills and have not had any problems with the reception. One more thought, the terminal that connects to my Roady XT cradle partially broke off. It still holds the connection (friction) but it does come out time to time.

There are presently no singers that even approach the mastery of the repetoire recorded on this album which Gedda sings perfectly and easily.His refinement and power are unexcelled.

Their opposing personalities, lifestyles, and food obsessions are rooted in dark, disturbing histories that are graphically revealed through flashbacks. The story is told as a narrative: it begins slowly with an investigation by a police inspector into disappearance of one of the women. It picks up in the middle and is carried forward along with the investigation to a final, stunning conclusion.The imagery and characterizations are vivid although I found it too macabre for my taste. Also, the lower production quality was a little distracting, giving it a disjointed B-horror flick type feel.

Whose fault is it? Cambridge University Press or the bookseller? Please beware that many book retailers do not supervise the merchandise they offer.Ah... in case you wonder, returning the book is out of the question since I live in Venezuela, a country with strong foreign currency control laws and where all mail,aside from extremely expensive courier services, is unreliable. I therefore must forcefully trust the seller's ethical principles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves more attention","review":"Denton does a breathtaking job of staying in touch with the sound and spirit of authentic Native American flute (NAF) music, while moving beyond the limits of most recordings in this genre. The NAF is a natural choice for music that is spiritual, heartfelt and evocative. Denton lets the flute speak, and she keeps the arrangement simple, so that nothing districts the listener from the beauty of her creativity. Other NAF players may have wider recognition, but this little-known artist can hold her own. If you're interested in NAF music by Native Americans who are more traditional, try John Rainer Jr., R. Carlos Nakai (choose carefully with Nakai), or Tommy Wildcat. Avoid artists who encumber the NAF with synthesizers and other electronics. Seek out instead those like Denton; sure-footed enough to walk the simple path, and return with the fruit of her journey to share with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy cover","review":"Cover fit well over the table and all the chairs.

I've purchased other brands, and it is not only better priced, but looks like it will last for years longer. In fact, the only complaint I have is that it is so heavy, it was hard to use the drawstring tighteners at the bottom. I am very pleased with this item. It fit perfectly on my rectangle table with 6 chairs.

Just had it for one month so I will not be able to give a full report till spring of 2011. Get the large size if you have a table and six chairs.The cover also has a cinch cord on the bottom to pull the cover tight. Only one suggestion. If you live in an area that receives a substantial amount of snow, I would lay some boxes or some item that will not tear into the material in the center of the table to form a 'tent' shape to repel snow and rain. I will adjust my rating after I examine the cover next spring"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT INVESTMENT","review":"I have a nice patio set, but had to 'unassamble' it everytime I used it because the chair cushions would get wet and dirty with the pollen, the rain, the wind, etc...Buying a cover for each of the 6 seats was almost more expensive than the patio set and I wasn't happy about the idea of removing the plastic cover from each chair ...So I was thrilled when I found the Table & Chair cover - our patio set is a fairly large rectangular table and six very wide chairs and the Veranda Set cover fits perfectly. It seems very resistant; we've had rain the the last few days and the cushions are completely dry. It is very easy to put and secure, love it.Even my husband declared that this was a great investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality","review":"I bought this cover over a year ago to cover my wood patio set.

It works, just not perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks sturdy and well made!","review":"We bought this since the ones at Local hardware store were junk, This has a 3 yr warranty we will see if it lasts more than one summer"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Durable","review":"This is a replacement for another cover that lasted me only two years before it tore.While it has not yet experienced the extremes of a Northern Westchester Counter winter,which is the reason I only rated it at four stars, my initial impression is that the material is much stronger than the more costly cover I originally purchased.I have not experienced the problem others have reported related to the wind lifting the cover. Perhaps this is because my cover is a perfect fit over the table and chairs that it protects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disintegrated after 6 months","review":"This cover worked great for a few months. We live in Southern California, where it rained about 3-5 times in the past 6 months. When i went to lift up the cover it ripped. I tried another place it ripped there too.

They are very heavy duty and we have them on all of our outdoor furniture in the off season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cover","review":"Very good cover, get the largest one because even the large was just barely big enough for my patio set. The quality of this cover is really good, it's thick and heavy will definitely last a very long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Durable","review":"I bought this cover exactly 28 months ago and it is now ripped and useless. While it seems very sturdy, it does not stand up to rain and wind very well. The material deteriorates and seems to get mildewy, then it starts to tear. I am going back to a cheaper cover made from car cover material that lasts just as long, but costs much less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent cover, clips work well","review":"My patio set is rectangular with high-backed chairs, and I went through every full patio set cover that Lowe's and Home Depot offered in store - every single one of them blew off in our Texas winds, even with the pull strings pulled tight. This one has stayed on and kept water out, due to the two plastic leg clip-close straps in addition to the pull strings. It may make more sense for them to be \\"kitty corner\\" from each other, as they are on the same side, but it does the job well regardless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deterioates quickly..","review":"This cover only lasted two years. And what was worse was the underside decomposed and stuck to my granite table taking out some mortar from the table. It almost ruined my table. I would advise not getting this cover unless you have steel or glass tops and you do not get too much rain. Otherwise, look elsewhere. The warranty is short so that tells you something."},{"rating":"2","title":"NYC patio set","review":"The cover worked out great. I bought it for a very large rectangular patio set and was shocked that it fit everything. The handy straps that ties to the chair or table legs help with the fit. Just wish they put more of those straps in, there were only two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Value for the $$","review":"I searched around for a new cover after the first plastic cover from Sears I had on my patio table set was ripped to shreds after just three years (two of them held together with duct tape). I paid almost $30 for that one.This is a great value for the $$. It seems they've thought of everything: leg ties, pull strings, vents, attractive colors, heavy-duty fabric. I bought the umbrella cover as well. I'm thinking about buying the really large table cover to cover a coffee table and two chairs out on the patio....You won't be disappointed.UPDATE: September 2011. So it's been four years since I bought this, a bit dirtier (just hose it off), and faded (the darker bottom color is not so dark anymore). BUT it is still in great shape!! None of the leg clips have fallen off, the handles haven't ripped, nothing. This thing has held up well on my west-facing covered outdoor patio . I continue to recommend it to anyone who will listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value; Great Product","review":"This is a very heavy duty cover which will keep my table and chairs covered all winter.

We live in South West Florida and had yet to have experienced any bad weather this year, we needed covers that would hold up in our rainy season.I have to say that I am so impressed with the quality of the Veranda covers, they have a good heavy weight material and fit very well plus a three year warranty. For once my Husband did not complain about cost and was very happy with my purchase.Amazon had the best price especially when you apply super saver shipping ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good price, quality product.","review":"The sides do not come down very far when covering my table and chairs as my chairs won't fit very far under the table. I was able to secure the cover well and although it will probably pool water in it as the chair backs are higher than the table, I can remedy it by placing something upon the table to elevate the center to allow run off.I haven't had this on through any storms (we recently had Superstorm Sandy and a Nor'easter the week after in NJ and I didn't want my new purchase to fly away, but it has met with some moderate winds and seems to not even be affected by it.. the fabric is reinforced and durable in appearance so i assume it will hold up over time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy duty","review":"Very heavy duty, nicely made cover. The elastic around the bottom does not gather as well as the ad says it does, mainly because the fabric it's made of is so thick BUT because it's a well made cover, I don't think I'll have any problems with it blowing off....it seems pretty sturdy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesnt last long","review":"Bought these covers last year for my patio table and couches and all three of them became brittle and tore. They did a good job protecting from the rain as long as there wasn't any wind since the straps weren't positioned in the right spot to keep the corners down. Wouldn't buy these again and am currently looking for a new brand since mine are in shreds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cover","review":"I like these covers. This is the 4th cover of this brand and style that I have purchased. I also own 2 chair stack covers and a patio heater cover. These are the best that I have found to date. They are well made and have weathered rain, snow, sun and wind with little show of wear. They have out-performed other, more expensive covers I have purchased in the past from \\"outdoor\\" or \\"garden\\" stores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs more than 2 tie-downs","review":"Material appears to be tough and durable. Size is as advertised and fits perfectly. The major dissapointment is that the cover has only 2 tie-downs - diagonally from each other at the corners. This is not enough. There should be at least 4, one at each corner. In a relatively light wind, the cover blew off entirely and dragged the two chairs to which it was attached across my patio. The manufacturer had a good product but decided to go cheap and only put two tie-downs on the cover. I will have to figure out a way to modify the cover myself so that it will be useable. Because of this significant flaw, I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Veranda Patio Table & Chair Cover 70932 Lasted 2 Seasons","review":"I expected this product to last more than two seasons.

Not thrilled to have to duct tape the rips."},{"rating":"2","title":"good buy","review":"very nice coverings. fits well. fabric is solid and fits chairs and tables well. worth the price! Protects my furniture well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attractive and well made but...","review":"I used this to cover a patio table and chairs on our deck. Unfortunately it was difficult to get the cover tight around the furniture. Pulling the string to snug the bottom of the cover was difficult. There are two hook and eye loops that I placed around table legs, but even with those a strong wind blew the cover off. I'm going to see if I can come up with a solution to better attach it to the patio furniture.Update 1/15/2013I mistakenly identified the straps as hook and eye. Instead they have click buckles similar to those found in a child's car seat.In order to eliminate having this cover blow off in a strong wind I tilted the chairs forward so that the front of the backs rested against the top of the table. Since my chairs are a spring sling design this allowed me to reduce the size of the bottom of the cover to an area smaller that the top. I also looped a rope through the handles of the cover to tighten it more than I could with the cover's elastic hem cord."},{"rating":"1","title":"So So","review":"Disappointed in this cover. I measured my table before ordering and according to the measurements it should fit - well it doesn't. It does fit over the table, but not with chairs under it, I think the biggest problem is that the chairs are taller than the table so it doesn't cover the all - but don't most chairs sit higher than the table? All of my other covers are this brand and we've had good luck until this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Large size was too large","review":"Definitely there is the need of the size in inches for this kind of products. I purchased the large size as I didn't want to have the medium and then have to return it (as I'm outside the US), but it was too large."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sandy took it off","review":"I was not happy that it didn't tie down that well.

Some songs would be stronger, one can tell, if a guitar (or any bassier intrument) were present to add some weight to the song structure. But in addition to this, Expedicion might not excite loyal listeners because there is a serious lack of revolutionary ideology in these songs. And as largely a collection of 'romantic songs' these lack the intimate feel and philosophical intelligence of his trademark work. Still, a very talented artist offering well crafted songs, if not watered down to reach, it would seem, a larger, less critical audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite!!","review":"Owning ALL of Silvio's music I was anxious to get my hands on this one. I was not disappointed!! Once again Silvio proves to be a lyrical and musical genius. This album is so melodic, soothing and just beautiful. To me is like a painting, a beautiful painting that could not be put in a canvas and was put into sound. I know we are all used to his guitar strumming and his powerful lyrics. But in Expedición he goes to the more sublime.Totí has to be my favorite song. Only he can take an endemic little black bird from his native Cuba and put into one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. Ese hombre and La Mancha are also two excellent songs. I love this album entirely. Highly recommend it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"mmmmm.......great !!,but a little disappointed...","review":"I loved the design and the look of the album itself, just by looking at it when I got it, I got all excited but....when I played it....I don't know, the lyrics are great but there are some songs that the music just dosn't go with the song. Some of the old ones I reather just hear them in the old beat up versions from years ago.

In which case, as my friend the Shaman said, you need purification... because only those who are strong in spirit can conjure Binah (the Sefirot of Understanding) at this level without the body rebelling its control."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good!","review":"This one has revenge, love, loss, and everything else ol'Wolvie is known for.

Ellis did not bring any new insight into his character. The plot is a little-bit hackneyed. An old killer known as White Ghost resurfaces to take revenge on Wolverine. The overly scientific explanation on how he survived the blast (based on a broken and too pliable bacokbone) is way too intellectual. Anyway the invertebrate survives and plays with Wolverine's mind using pre-planted sound blasters in the woods. Since Ellis is soo intellectual, these things have to be wired up, Why can't Wolverine simply follow these wires to his hideout??? No need to rely on smell trails etc.I see clear parallels in the Irish-speak dialogue as spoken by the White Ghost with Garth Ennis' Punisher story (Kitchen Irish) on dealing with the IRA. Someone is ripping material from another. Absolutely no originality here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ellis and Marvel do not mix...","review":"It's all pretty standard gansters and mutant story with artwork that appears to have been drawn too quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok toy, It didn't last long","review":"It was a good learning experience. This little device does not have a speaker so I salvaged one from an old radio. Later I learned the necessity of mounting and protecting such a board when I broke it. The sound quality was minimum and something that a person would build on a breadboard for dis-assembly after proving to themselves they could make it. Make sure you look up soldering techniques. Cold solder joints look soldered when they are not. Youtube is your friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Voice Changer.. but if only you could hear it..","review":"The construction of this board is the only 'educational' value it offers. The parts are durable enough for casual work, assuming you have some basic soldering skills. A novice to such work can easily overheat and ruin some of the parts, so be careful. The unit itself seems sturdy, with strong connection and switches. The output is garbage! You can barely hear anything from the speaker, even at maximum volvume. It's a toy, and should be considered such when you go to purchase a voice changer module."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Rhodes","review":"Though I am not real hip to the work of Steve Talaga, I enjoy it.

But those promoters gave 5, then I give 1. Just to be honest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smug","review":"Well having grown up in Oceania, I was quite interested to read the review to see what an outsider's perspective of the region was like.Unfortunately I found the good things about the book (his description of the places, and people he encountered), rather spoiled by the views presented by Mr Theroux.He seems to believe that having spent a short amount of time in a number of different countries gives him some great insight into the peoples that live there.I find Mr Theroux to be racist (particularly about the Japanese), smug, and extremely condescending. His book is full of little inaccuracies which those who read the book and don't know the region well are probably not aware of.It's easy I think to generalise about people based on a few examples that you encounter, but is it really useful or worthwhile?So read the book if you don't come from the region, but just don't believe everything he says..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Vanity Project","review":"What's next for the unflappable Paul Theroux? Will he buy a collapsible dirigible for a tour of Antarctica? Will he dis the residents of the South Pole writing profundities into his palm pilot from 1000 feet above??? One gets the feeling, reading this book, that if Paul were to ever really get himself into a particularly thorny situation, all he need do to save his carcass is pull out his platinum credit card. There's never a sense that Paul will ever put himself into any REAL danger; will ever endure true risk whilst on his many global travels & travails."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pompous English prejudice meets whining about flies.","review":"This guy isn't funny. He is a whining bore. Half way through the book, I threw it out.John Dowd writes a great book about kayaking. \\"Alone At Sea\\" by Dr. Hannes Lindemann is a great kayak adventure story.This book is about a whining, self-centered, British ex-pat, island hopping and complaining about everything, everywhere he goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother...","review":"But, if you can get over the writer's ego, condescension, racism, ego, morbid look at things, sarcasm, ego, ego, ego that is prevalent and predominant in this book, you'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A host of truly strange encounters and adventures\\"","review":"Well-known travel writer Theroux (The Great Railway Bazaar, The Mosquito Coast) sets out on a journey after his marriage fails, and there is a dour mood to this travelogue's beginning, partly because Theroux thinks he may have cancer. But over the course of his travels across the Pacific in a collapsible kayak- from New Zealand to Samoa, Tahiti to Easter Island-the journey begins to change him, and the tone improves dramatically. Theroux manages an audience with the King of Tonga, a look at cannibalism first hand, Mormons missionaries in the wilderness and a host of truly strange encounters and adventures. It's one of the best of Theroux's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the whole, a satisfying read","review":"To be honest, it took me a while to get into this one. I found the sections on Australia and New Zealand uninteresting and somewhat disorderly, and not any way as compelling as what was to come. The book took off as soon as he hit the north-eastern coast of Australia, camping on the beaches around Cookstown etc., and his subsequent journey to the Trobriands, and on across the pacific. The portrayal of the characters was really excellent, and I found myself sharing in Theroux's humiliation at the hands of the islanders, escpecially the teasing he endured from the children in the Trobriands, frightening really.Like my title suggests, this was a pleasant enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting although laces with anti-Japanese sentiment","review":"Not a bad read but I was disappointed by the author's tirades against the \\"Nipponization\\" of the Pacific. I'm sure the author does not use the term \\"Nipponization\\" in a affectionate manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating, Racist, Filled with Bias, Ignorant & Uninformed","review":"I think I made myself pretty clear with the title. But, if further explanation is necessary: Theroux is exactly what he claims to abhor about tourists & travelers. He's an egotistical, self-centered racist who has paddled aimlessly around the world in lieu of actually parenting the children he chose to have and be a husband to his original wife. The only reason I kept reading is bc I was traveling to many of the places about which he wrote. Additionally, I lived in HI and was interested in what he had to say about it. Ultimately I was embarrassed that I had to share Oahu with him. And if he mentioned one more time about his claim that scads of Japanese brides throwing themselves off hotel balconies...I mean really. If you're looking for a fact based book about Oceania, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a self-indulgent POS about a man's traveling mid-life crisis, you can have my copy. Thank God I only wasted a quarter on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Painful but hard to put down","review":"I have mixed feelings about this book. I found it somewhat unpleasant at first because Mr. Theroux seemed to be relating the trip to his personal problems. But that tapered off and the book becomes increasingly positive. He paints mildly unflattering pictures of the people he meets but is stoic about difficulties such as dangerous animals, terrain, and weather conditions. When describing life among the natives and natural surroundings, the pages fly by.I would not take what he writes as gospel (I do have some experience with one of the islands he visits) but in general his opinions feel insightful to me even if I don't necessarily agree with every detail. More importantly there were large sections of the book that were hard to put down and there were many times that I felt that I was there. All in all, I'm impressed by the journey and the intrepid Mr. Theroux."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book, shame about the editing","review":"I really enjoyed the book, being fond of Theroux and his travails. Unfortunately the kindle version is appallingly edited, filled with cheap typos and errors - in one chapter the chapter title is repeated 5 times in CAPS in the middle of the text; in another I counted 32 typos. Pretty dreadful, shameful, cheap editing by the publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Theroux has a poor impression of everything non-American","review":"I read all 500 pages of Theroux's 'Happy Isles of Oceania,' and even though I enjoyed some parts of it, many chapters left me wondering about what the heck is going on in this guy's head. He was very mean-spirited toward Australians for one, calling them racist drunks. There are no racists in America, right? Also, he continuosly criticized the French government for 'destroying' the cultures on the French Polynesian islands. Yes, some of it may be true, but what about the Americanization of Hawaii? I noticed Theroux had no complaints about Hawaii -- of which he discussed with the chapter heading 'Paradise' -- turning into a motorized society with natives working at McDonald's restaurants."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes - he should have stayed home","review":"It's been some years since I read this book but it still comes back loud and clear - what a bitter person he was. He \\"toured\\" the South Pacific right after he got divorced - and he distrusted and hated everybody. The book was published as we (me, wife and 2 teenagers) we sailing thru the SoPac in our sailboat - and having a wonderful time with the people, the islands, the beautiful environment - where people were happy and environmentally concerned - and this was 1991-1995. We loved it all and he was a bitter fool to miss it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paddling Theroux's Bias","review":"As an Australian and a good friend of several Pacific Islanders, I was quite offended by this book. Theroux makes sweeping generalizations about Australians, New Zealanders, and Pacific Islanders that are derogatory and border on racism. This book was written at a time when Theroux was very depressed, as he freely admits, and therefore has a great deal of negative bias. Although he does pick up a measure of optimism as he goes through the book, it is impossible to know how much of his discription can really be trusted. Slightly amusing, but not for those interested in what Oceania is really like!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific reading","review":"I find Paul Theroux's travel books to be a delight to read, and Happy Isles of Oceania is one of my favorites. Reeling from a split with his wife, PT begins his journey on a book tour in NZ and Australia, and then travels around much of Oceania. He kayaks and camps on most of the islands, and makes many discoveries about the various people and cultures. Most notable is the natives' consistent use of the ocean as a toilet and a garbage dump. He hikes in NZ's southern alps; explores the Aussie bush; attends the unusual Yam-festival in the Trobriands; meets the King of Tonga; insults a politician from NZ; plays Robinson Crusoe for a week; contracts a disease; gets stung by jellyfish; makes friends; drinks kava; wonders what drew Robert Louis Stevenson to Samoa and Paul Gaugain to Tahiti; and visits a Hawaiian island that few are allowed on. If you like PT's other travel books, you'll love this one. If you haven't read any, this is a great one to start with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Theroux should've stayed home....","review":"Good grief, if I wanted a tale filled with hours of tooth-gnashing hatred and bitter invective I can just go to work. It's certainly not the sort of atmosphere I enjoy when reading a travelogue to try and escape my workaday existence.I understand that the South Pacific is not the ideal place, but it is depressing to read Theroux' constant struggle to express any sense of joy in his travels or the people he meets along the way.For an alternative, more light-hearted, still realistic take on the South Pacific with far less spleen, I highly recommend Tony Horowitz' \\"Blue Latitudes\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"better using your hands","review":"Bad product, poor quality manufacturing, cheap metal construction, didtn't work well, easier to make burgers by hand.

Being that it is made in China, where all the recalled toys with lead paint are made, there is no way I will use this ever again.

WOW. They were wrong.I got this chunk of cardboard home and my cat wanted nothing to do with it until I added the catnip that comes with it. Then he was interested in licking it and rubbing his body on it. I made the mistake of putting this setup on my rug so as his body weight tip the box it fell in the rug along with the catnip that now the cat is destroying my rug to get to.I don't suggest this product for any cat as this ingesting cardboard cannot be healthy for cats."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is cheap CARDBOARD","review":"Not only is this the ugliest thing I have ever mistakenly purchased, it is made of cardboard!

I picked it up from my local PetSmart, and boy, it sure does work! I put a little bit of the included catnip on it, and my kitty jumped on the scratcher like, well . . . like a cat that's smelled catnip. I've had it a few weeks now, haven't added any catnip since that first day, and she still loves scratching. I think she's clawing the sofa and bed less, but I'm not sure, since she can be very sneaky and could be doing it when I'm away. However, when I am home, I just pat the cosmic cardboard scratcher, and she pounces on it and picks on it like a good cat. In other words, I give it two thumbs up, and my cat I'm sure would give it two paws up as well. Oh, and one more thing, I think I will buy the refills, but it seems like the current set of cardboard will last at least a few months, but like I said, I just recently bought this and can't say for sure. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"I don't have this exact one, but from the same company. I tried it without the catnip and my cat wouldn't use it at all.

I was lucky in finding a large scrap steel block that just fit inside. With this, my 15lb Russian Blue completely loved it and abandoned all furniture scratching with a few days of friendly encouragement. Considering it's so inexpensive, I would highly recommend this product if you can find some way to anchor it in place!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved by both cats","review":"Both my tabby and my himi love this - they much prefer the incline to a flat scratch box. I only wish it was a bit more sturdy as at the bottom it's came apart. Yes, I could fix that by glue/tape/etc but it would be best if it didn't come a part. That said, I'd buy it again and recommend it as well since both cats use it frequently. No wasted money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good scratcher","review":"The delivery was quick, and my cat loves it. He loves the space underneath it, and puts all his toys in there.

While it is rated to handle 8 sheets of paper, putting more than 4 sheets in at once causes the motor to struggle and slow considerably. It is under-powered. The \\"auto stop\\" feature stopped working about 3 months ago, so it has to be turned off after each use. Emptying it is a pain because it leaves pieces of shredded paper dangling from the top - it always makes a mess.This morning I fed it 8 sheets of paper and it died. The paper is jammed in the cutters with no way to remove it, and the motor is locked up. (remember, this unit claims it can handle 8 sheets).

So I inspect for paper shreds and vacuum the underside of the cutting area. After several attempts the mechanism will once more take paper. A few times late the overload light comes on again!

Upon checking the \\"chewers\\", I found paper stuck to the rollers that do the cutting. I found one piece stuck in what must be the shuttoff switch, and after some work was able to removed the stuck piece. After a few more sheets, it again stopped shutting off.

Only problem is the bin does not fit smoothly into place. From our first use, we had trouble getting the bin to line up with the safety switch and it never did seem to fit right. It seemed necessary to force the bin into place to get the on switch to make contact. Needless to say, after only 2 times of emptying the bin, the switch broke and the shredder would no longer even turn on.

The Shredder must be shut off after each shredding. I suppose the shredder is okay if you don't have children and don't mind turning it off between uses.Now for the No Service. They are prompt to return your first call. This is good. Bad is the fact that I was told there were no service centers in the whole state, and would have to pack it up and pay shipping both ways. I can buy a fellowes shredder for the price of the shipping and have a new shredder that works safely and real service if I need it.Go for a walk tonight and hold your child's hand firmly, they are little no longer all too soon.Sami"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value!!

Basically it is the same as the 1984 edition, except they threw in some grasses and sedges. To help sell the book they changed the front cover to look different from the 19997 version, but all the wording and photos are the same. This threw us off as we purchased the book thinking it was different than our 1984 version!The did add the grass/sedge section but other books deal much better with this section than they did.I am not entirely pleased with many of the photos in this book, are out of focus or are just badly taken.

The pros are Maazel's tempo choices, which are consistently well-judged at 16'19 / 14'18 / 26'12 / 23'39 // 79'32, and the excellent control and attention to detail that Maazel brings. The bad news is that this is a rather studio-bound and, even more disappointing, a rather earth-bound Bruckner 8. Maazel fails to bring that extra level of intensity and conviction to the work. At budget price, it is a good place to start, but you'll need to hear Furtwangler/VPO, Knappertsbusch/BPO, and Celibidache/MPO to find conductors who, in my opinion, really do this work justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bruckner at budget price","review":"This performance of Bruckenr's 8th symphony with Maazel and the BPO brings many great qualities. Perhaps the most important is the playing of the BPO. The orchestra plays with its customery combonation of power and finesse. For the most part Maazel's view of this work is excellant. There are a few points where he pulls the music slower and slower that I'm not sure works (1st movement). The ending of the final movement is teriffic and I havent heard it done that way by anyone else (even Karajan)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great picture......Poor design","review":"Owned about 2 years before it went caput.

I played this music at parties and everyone loved it. I also own some Ottmar Liebert and Marc Antoine music, but I prefer Behzad.

But don't discount uses for this 2-lead antenna yet, especially at the significantly reduced prices (one-half to one-third the cost of newer antennas).I can't recommend using this on your auto - but works fine as an alternative installation for my Dephi Roady indoors. I attached the antenna to my office window which has a clear view of the southern sky. Works fine - 3 bars.

Angelripper's vox are in top form, scratchy and deep at the same time. the title track is a classic, and so are \\"Tired and Red\\" and \\"Remember the Fallen.\\" the only mis-step is the last cut, \\"Don't Walk Away\\" which is not a crappy song, but it just doesn't fit with the rest of the war and death theme of the recording.

I just wanted game ideas for my toddler at home.For me, I skimmed the book and quickly identified what could be done at home and what was just too involved. The book is great and even calling out how to adapt the plans based on a budget.. build this, buy that or just use this. Each plan seemed to have levels so you could fit it to your needs. Many include suggestions on how to adapt the games for special needs kids.It includes some 50 activities - and I would say only about 10 or 15 can really EASILY be implemented in a home with a single child. Still, just having 10 new ideas on how to play with our toddler that don't involve him tackling mommy (no child, I'm not a football dummy) has made the book worth the money.

It was a good idea to make a movie that had this kind of popular sport in it, but like I said, the acting and casting was ok, but the directing, and the plot made this movie plunge into the dark pits of wrath.

The other reviews do a much better job than I ever could so I'll leave that with them and say, if you want to have some fun one night with your buddies or even your significant other, do this.Stay home.Get some good booze. Start drinking. Put the movie in when you start feeling a buzz and then hang on. You'd be amazed what kind of social theme's, problem's and solution's you can come up with when you're drunk and watching this movie.Obviously DON'T DRIVE after seeing this movie and after consuming LARGE amount's of good booze.This movie came out in 1975, but it still tickles you to no end today, drunk OR sober.

I love it","review":"I just saw this film laying around in a cheapie-bin and I had never heard of it, especially since it's a movie with Stallone in it. It's not his first film, but its close to it.I'm glad I picked it up, it's a wacky Cannonball/The Running Man kind of thing across America. A few racers and their co-pilot race across the country in their modified hot-rods, in not only a race, but they get points for running people over... it's hilarious to hear what points you get for what. It's got some gruesome scenes, but funny to me, because they're so sudden.It reminds me of a TROMA style movie. I guess if you're a fan of TROMA (Toxic Avenger/Class of Nukem High/Poultryguist) you should love this. It's not brilliant acting, its no academy award winner, but it's fun. So you pukes who who gave Titanic 5 stars wont like this movie at all. This is a popcorn flick for mindless entertainment... so just enjoy the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitly a must for cheese-ball sci-fi fans..","review":"Definitly better than I had anticipated!

Well, I think having said that anyone who's played the game will know pretty much what to expect. I once heard someone say that this movie was supposed to be some kind of social satire, on Social Darwinism or something? Well, that is very difficult to believe. Sylvester Stallone's non-porn debut (yes, it's true, he used to make porn movies) is an all-out blood n gore fest, complete with ludicrous over-acting, campy gags, naked women and cheesy spatter-type special effects. While not everyone's cup of tea, and it's certainly not Ingmar Bergman, it is very fast-moving and fun (what could you expect from Roger Corman) and probably contains one of the highest cinema body-counts this side of Peter Jackson's Braindead.

Actually not that many of the latter - the satire (such as it is) could have been much sharper and more extravagant here. Did the Director feel that stepping up that side of it would be too shocking?Otherwise the movie has an agreeable facile sense of the period (bad hair styles, would-be funky music, absurd sets, inane plot, cheapo design all round).

Don't get me wrong, the kills are still gory, but there is a tinge of humor to each one that takes the edge off.The film's short running time is one of its strengths as well, allowing the audience just enough breathing room before the next high speed hack and slash.If you have a thing for broad, bloody, action comedy, this one's for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"God Movie","review":"This is a good movie, but one that I would watch once in a while.

In her older years her joints are aching and she has arthritis. We started her on Nupro Joint Support which was a BIG mistake. After giving the product to her for 3 days, she started eating LOTS of grass and had trouble moving her bouls. She has had bad diarreah which is the same color as the Nupro. This was her only diet change. The Nupro has given her extreme gastro intestinal problems and I fear we may have to take her to the vet. She does not eat foreign objects or injest unknown foods. We feed her Orijen and natural beef/chicken/giblets/veggies. Nupro has really messed her up. DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!! I am filing a lawsuit against the company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what we were hoping for...","review":"Our breeder recommended that we use Nupro nutrional supplement for our golden retriever. He has allergies and she suggested that the supplement helps with that. The company also promotes this product as helping with allergies. Unfortunately it made our dog's allergies worse. Within days of starting the supplement his ears were inflamed and messy, he was biting and licking at his paws and he lost some hair on his tail.We also tried the Nupro supplement, without joint support, for our shih tzu. It caused loose stools for her. My parents had the same reaction with their shih tzu.We have since discontinued use of both products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bargain!","review":"This product is brand name and is a wonderful value on Amazon.

We purchased the 5 pound Nu Pro Silver to help our dear Angel, a Yellow Labrador therapy dog, with the hip discomfort she's developed. We mixed it as instructed into a gravy and set it down before normally voracious Angel and she actually backed away from it. We thinned it out more and still noticed just how strong the garlic smell is. She wouldn't touch it. We then mixed just half the gravy with a can of food. She still wouldn't eat it ! We were shocked because she is not finicky. We could not get her to accept her food with the supplement unless we used only 10 percent the recommended dosage...and that just won't have the benefit we need. The garlic smell is pervasive after adding water. We feel there should be some warning in descriptions of the product. We are happy other doggies are benefiting from Nu Pro Silver but wanted people to know that the strong garlic smell puts off some dogs.

His coat was very dull, he was scratching all the time and he had hot spots where he was tearing out patches of hair leaving sore spots. The Nupro supplement was great, within weeks the scratching and biting stopped in months he developed a beautiful coat. After a few years he developed the hip problems with soreness and limping so we switched him to Nupro Joint Support and it also worked great.

She struggled to get up and wouldn't even finish her much loved walks. She barely had the energy to even shake, her coat was not shedding out, she licked incessantly, and started smelling like her body was decaying. After 3 days on Nupro (no kidding), her energy level picked up, she seemed perkier and happier. After 3 weeks, she is now running with our other dog, beating me to the end of the walks and overall just doing much better. Tia is happy! My husband has even commented how much better she is doing and he was a skeptic. Our Pitbull is also more limber and energetic after using Nupro. I am so glad I did not resort to just medicating Tia for arthritis and am ordering more Nupro when I am done with this post.

My 9 year old Lab has arthritis and was in pain even though I have been giving him a prescription drub obtained from my vet. The drug has been helpful, but with the introduction of Nupro Joint Support, Monty is almost back to top form. He can play frisbee again without limping after a play session. He can also swim vigorously again. AND HE LOVES THE TASTE!! I mix it in with his dry food, and then moisten it all with warm water. It has a rich, meaty aroma. He gulpts it right down. His coat most certainly has a sheen to it again. This is a cost effect, and reliable product. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"May seem pricey, but it paid for itself.","review":"Have been using this product over the last 6 years on my four large breed (rescued) dogs. Two of my dogs started with severe allergies & one had alot of nutritional challenges when I began using Nupro. After three months, the difference was tremendous. The price of the product seemed high, but I wasn't spending any for allergy visits at the vets. Not having my dogs on the recommended steroids for allergies made it worth everything.I switched to the Silver Joint as help for the progressive dysplasia in my oldest dog. Three of my rescues have moderate dysplasia (elbow and hip) and one has a badly healed fracture with arthritic problems. Again, WOW. We all walk two miles a day, even years after the vets believed my oldest would be crippled and in constant pain.

I tried 2 or 3 different products and then came across some positive reviews for this Nupro and gave it a try.After about a month on Nupro (guessing here- at least 10 months ago when first tried it out) I noticed quite an improvement and things just got better from there. Neither of 'em limp anymore and are quite agile again. Their coats are beautiful too...the Lab has always had a nice coat, but I've seen a remarkable improvement in my Border Collie's coat- it was basically dull / flat looking but now has a nice sheen and his skin isn't flakey like it was previously.

We're talking basic plug-in speakers on a little iPod with a minimal amplification power (it is designed for headphones), so I wasn't expecting big sound or beefy stereophonics. However, I was expecting better than what this provides.First, the design is awkward. It's overly large and heavy to balance on the top of your iPod. It has a tendency to swivel and come off if you move it. If you have a skin on, it won't plug in properly at all.Second, and IMO more importantly, the tones were horribly tinny, there is next to no midrange and barely any bass unless you change your EQ to bass booster. I feel as if I would have better sound if I cranked up the volume and pumped the music through my little ear buds.Overall, I strongly recommend against this."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry I bought it","review":"tinny sound - big mistake to have purchased it - invest in a couple of auxiliary speakers instead"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Step Below Useless","review":"It sounded like a good idea but \\"what looks good from afar is often times far from good.\\" Even with a brand new Duracell alkaline battery this thing sounded like a cheap transistor radio when attached to my iPOD.

We put about 12 lullaby songs on it, and for a quiet room playing soft music, it works great. Sound is perfect for what I wanted to use it for.I'm sure the battery life might be a bit of an issue since it says a singe AA battery will last 8 hours. Generally we put it on when we put the baby to bed, then we check in on her a few hours later when we are going to sleep. So doing the math I expect about 3-4 days per battery.

I bought it to listen to my iPod in the car, and it's not loud enough to be heard over road noise. The only way to hear it is to hold it up to your ear while you drive, which isn't safe.Also, from a design POV, it swivels around annoyingly because it doesn't have a second pin to fit into the lateral second hole atop the iPod, which both the iTrip (which is also useless) and the iTalk (which works pretty well) have. Granted, these second pins and the iTalk and the iTrip are functional. But it really wouldn't take much to attach a dummy pin to stop the swivelling.

I even tried ramping up the level of the signal feeding into the Podwave with a portable \\"Boosteroo\\" pre-amp, and that didn't much improve matters (using an iPod Nano as the signal source). I think that with better components (slightly larger speakers, better amp, and a short extension cable) the Podwave would be useful. As it stands, it's more of a \\"better than nothing\\" gadget.

I've gone out for walks with my Ipod in my chest pocket, and it sounded fine. No, of course there is no pounding bass, keep your expectations moderate, but it doesn't sound bad. You can't expect Hi-Fi from something this small. Yes of course I wish it was louder, and Hi-Fi, but size and portability is what I was looking for, if you want something loud spend $100+ on something else.

The German diction in the arias and dialogues is clear throughout, and Furtwaengler gives you time to let the dramatic and musical high points sink in. Elisabeth Gruemmer as Agathe and Rita Streich as Aennchen are both in gorgeous, silken voice. Karl Boehm is a forceful Kaspar, roaring and menacing. Hans Hopf as Max is the weakest of the main characters; it takes some close listening to warm up to him. But a Max whom Kaspar can dominate fits the drama well enough.

The quotes from Skilling are \\"great\\" entertainment when you consider they occured all pre-meltdown, but the author's defense of Enron's \\"creativity\\" (which resulted in the loss of billions of dollars and had a negative impact on millions of lives) really turned me off.Instead of trying to justify the inclusion of such a ethically bankrupt company such as Enron, the author should have added a chapter on, when creativity turns criminal."},{"rating":"1","title":"...uh, where's the big idea?","review":"Great title, but it's a little like eating rice cakes...you're full for a minute and then realize you digested a few rice kernels puffed up with air to look and feel like something substantial. This felt like an ad for herself and her consulting business. It's the psychological profile of a sychophant. Do you think I liked this book? I was drawn in by the hype...the work of some amazing PR person...which resulted in a story in the NY Times Biz Section. I really can't imagine what these reviewers are talking about. It was difficult to navigate through the poorly designed (editorially and artistically) text. What's more, you can flip through this thing in a half hour and get all you're going to get.

I was expecting drama, drama and more drama.The main characters were the bread and butter and here I was reading saltine cracker material. I proceeded to place this book on my bookshelf and shake my head in disgust.In A Chocolate Affair there were some sections where I could sense Sheila was rushing things and/or tired.

The performances are all superb, including a movie-stealing performance by first-time actor Fred Thompson--who plays himself! The music is by Francis Lai and is one of his four best scores (the others being A Man and a Woman, Love Story, and Bilitis).Why this A-grade movie, produced by Dino De Laurentiis, did not get better promotion I don't know, but don't let this mistake make you miss this movie.And yes, if any movie deserves to be on DVD, this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"This was a very interesting movie and from what I understand pretty accurate.

It is difficult, if not impossible, to describe Aikido techniques in text; thus, proper illustration and easy to follow photographic sequences are critical to any Aikido text. This book has the most illuminating graphic representations of Aikido techniques of any that I have read so far. They even thought to number the photos in the sequences (a supprisingly novel concept). The accompanying description and explanation are quite well written. I wish all Aikido books were this well done.It should be said that this book was written by Gozo Shidoa, the founder of Yoshinkan Aikido. Yoshinkan is a style that your local dojo may or may not practice. However, I find myself continually comming back to this book despite the fact that my own dojo doesn't practice Yoshinkan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can take a lot of confusion out of learning aikido","review":"This isn't your book if you want to read on spirituality or history. However, Shioda does an excellent job of detailing, and giving proper emphasis to, throws and \\"controls\\" found again and again in variations of techniques. He points out common mistakes. I find that reading this book enables me to duplicate classroom demonstrations I'd previously found much more difficult to understand. I think Shioda's combination of meticulous photography, along with the book's comprehensive scope, makes this book a great text if you practice for fitness, love of physics or aesthetics, or self-defense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice cream at an excellent price, great for gifts.","review":"I purchased these lotions last year for my Christmas gift-bags.

I am so happy that this book exists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celebrate People","review":"This is a great book to get children (and even some adults) beyond egocentric thinking, to expose them to diverse cultural icons and to the celebration of individual differences. Each page is richly illustrated in colorful \\"where's waldo-esque\\" detail, providing plenty of stimulation to keep children focused and interested through its entirety. Some of the visual images do reflect outdated cultural stereotypes, but do not detract from the main theme."},{"rating":"2","title":"'People' contains a basic message that is not out-dated","review":"I bought this book for my 6 year old who had started to point out the differences she saw in people. With the help of this book I have been able to explain to her in terms she can understand that it is ok to be different. Together we have studied the detailed pictures & explored the differences between our lives and people in other parts of the world. (And yes, we have even discussed that some of the pictures show details that are out-dated.) With the help of this book my daughter is learning that people can not control those things that make us different: skin color, hair texture, shape of our nose and eyes, and that we should not judge each other based on these things but to celebrate our differences. And we fully agree with the book: this world sure would be a boring place to be if we all were the same! This Christmas we will share 'People' by Peter Spier with our family and friends!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution advised","review":"Although I understand the praise this book receives, I'd like to issue a note of caution. In some cases, Spier has given us the exotic depictions of the cultural groups he presents. In many cases, that exotic view is outdated. In essence, he has frozen some cultural groups in days past. Unless a teacher or parent points this out, children may believe, for example, that today's Eskimo people (who prefer Inuit or Inupiat to \\"Eskimo\\") live in igloos, and that American Indians live in tepees. That is simply not true of these two groups. I wonder about others he's depicting. I hope teachers and parents point out these errors in presentation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"people","review":"I think this book is cool.

As an elemnetary school teacher I do not think this is an appropirate book for kids.To begin with, every student should be represented, and accurately, in the literature used. Negative images and inaccurate stereotyping of people and cultures in children's fiction books is harmful to students whose ethnicity is being portrayed. Students should be able to see themselves and their lives reflected in the books they read. When you look at the illustrations at that book for example the page where the clothes are shown it doesn't reflect the reality.

Not with this toaster. There's some blurb about the bagel button allowing the toaster to adjust toasting times, but the bottom line is that both sides are toasted - so with the wholewheat bagels I use, I have the choice between toasting the cut side while burning the other, or leaving the cut side just about warmed through before the other side burns.I've no doubt that if you want to toast bread, this is a perfectly adequate toaster. For bagels, it's just about useless, unless you like your bagels **extremely** lightly toasted.

This toaster produces very inconsistent results. The adjustment knobs are purely decorational - they do nothing to control how dark or light my toast comes out. Sometimes I set it on the dark setting and my toast will pop up barely toasted. Other times I set it on light, walk away to do something, and I return to charred bread. Only one side's elements come on, regardless of whether or not I have the bagel button pushed in. I've always had good results with basic toasters until now.

I hate to think what would happen if I pushed the setting past 4. Settings 1 and 2 do not cook the toast completely in one cycle so you have to stand there and watch it. BUT if you use the third setting, you still have to watch it because it will burn. IF you check your toast mid-cycle, DO NOT walk away!

I like to drain my tofu, slice it, marinate it, and then bake it (for use as part of a stir-fry.) This particular type of tofu, however, is true to the \\"silken\\" variety. If I were using it as part of a recipe that didn't require firmness as part of the equation, I'm sure it would be fine. However, you have to be EXTRA cautious when handling the tofu because it is \\"silken\\" (and therefore a ton more fragile.) In addition, if baked, it produces a very unappetizing, rubbery texture.

The store bought kind is more dense and this one is more of a smooth egg tart texture. I had trouble frying this up the first time. It broke apart. To remedy this, I put it between two towels and placed a small cutting board on top for about 30 mins. This will extract some of the water making it easier to fry up, slightly denser.Or, while frying, I let it form a golden crust before I move it. Something I didn't have to do with the store bought version but is a lot easier than it sounds. I love the texture in your mouth. Instead of shoveling the tofu in my mouth I now appreciate the smoothness and the flavors the tofu absorbs. My niece calls it \\"tofu jello\\" and eats it happily.

I'm sorry that I read it. It's a decent book, but not great. It was not worth my time. The characters are flat and uninteresting, the dialogue is flat, and it wasn't much of a page-turner. Basically, it's an unexciting book that leaves you on a down -- kind of like the Swedish personality in general -- which is a theme of the book itself.

That leads to the second problem: the police officer at the center of the novel is, it seems to me, not very good. He misses a lot of obvious stuff. Oddly, where the novel covers a lot of the everyday details of the man's life during the investigation (lack of sleep, spilling ink on his shirt), it gives short shrift to the actual investigation. (For instance, it isn't clear that the police bothered to interview the neighbors of a murder victim until much later). The detective comes off as not very bright, and that's not what you want in a mystery. I was happy to end the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"DREADFULL!","review":"I've enjoyed the Wallander series, but this is beyond bad! It's a short story padded to 420 pages and the 'story' is ridiculous.When you're a famous author you have to keep pumping out books even if you have nothing to say anymore (the couple of million in advances and royalties or so, does come in handy every few years), although this book seems ghostwritten. Either way, it's terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you, Len","review":"Len, thank you for recommending that people begin with Mankell's first book and proceed from there. Too often, books are read out of order and in most cases, it doesn't work as well. I think, series, especially, should be read in order. Not only do you miss a lot of the characterization, but most writers get better as they go along. This is true here, with Henning Mankell. Also, there seems to be more than one translator, and that can also make a big difference. I'm really enjoying these books and highly recommend them. But I do miss Martin Beck! West New York, NJ 09/13/08"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Police Procedural","review":"Older readers will recall the fine series of police procedurals featuring the Swedish policeman Martin Beck. These books, by the Swedish writers Wahloo and Sjowall, were nice combinations of crime fiction and social commentary. The Kurt Wallender series by Henning Mankell is a worthy successor to the Martin Beck books. The stories are well plotted with good characterization and an interesting central character. As with the Martin Beck books, an underlying theme is the reality of Swedish life as opposed to the goals of socialism."},{"rating":"2","title":"An accomplished debut by a promising young Irish poet.","review":"Chief among the book's pleasures are its acuteness of observation, its accurate evocation of rural and urban Ireland and its verbal wit.

I found it an antidote to a busy life. If you can't get outdoors, live in the city perhaps, it's a way to escape without going anywhere, like good books are. Some of the images he paints have me planning a vacation to places I wouldn't have otherwise wanted to visit, like Nebraska (no offense meant to Nebraskans, I'm sure it's a great state). Halfway through the book I got curious about the writer and looked him up. It was devastating to learn he could see such beauty in the world but not enough to keep living.

It's meant to be used with any DVD Player that is Progressive Scan compatible that is hooked up to an HDTV. Don't use it as a scource for HD television because HDMI cables are better if you have a digital cable or satilite box with HDMI output. HDMI cables are getting cheaper if you buy on online. But the most important part about this was I got it for cheap. If you are looking to save money when hooking up your DVD player with 480p Progressive Scan to an HDTV.

I really haven't compared to other brands, say, Monster, but according to other reviews, these work just as well.

But in every other sense, these are very good value for money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe I'm not enough of a geek,","review":"But I can tell ZERO difference between this cable and a Monster that cost more than 3x more. Of course, this is noticably better than hooking up three old-style stereo RCA cables to my component video jacks (which is what I was doing before :) but when I did an experiment and hooked up my friend's $60 cable, I noticed ZERO improvement.

I went back and forth between a set of \\"high quality\\" cables, and these cheaper cables, on a 47\\" LCD TV... There is a noticeable loss of quality if you're running at 1080 - but at 720 it becomes impossible to tell between the two...Overall, I'd say since 720 is native for the XBOX - these cables work perfectly for that purpose. I wouldn't use these if you are trying to up-convert from 720 though... you're better off going with different cables for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware, item is not Philips brand","review":"I purchased this item and recieved the CMPLE brand 318-N component cable.

But when I compared the performance of these Phillips cables with Monster THX 500 cables (bought at Radio Shack) and Radio Shack brand cables using my (non digital, low def) Panasonic DVD recorder/player I found that the Phillips cables gave the least bright, least colored, image of the bunch. The monster cables were clearly the best. I would have saved some money by adjusting the TV settings if it were only a matter of color saturation, but I figured ramping up the backlight setting to the max to compensate for the dim image probably wouldn't be that good for the tv.Funnily enough, when I did the same test with an older Panasonic DVD player, the original composite cable gave the best image.

So I hit the internet and read reviews by many people who were disappointed, and many by big fans, who were trying to spread PFTSOB around. I looked around for this cd and found that it was 17 dollars at best buy, I didn't want to spend that much on a cd with mixed reviews.Eventually, I decided to download Truck Stop Sally, a song that good and bad reveiwers alike seemed to think was good. It is a story in a song about a girl who was beaten by her father. After only hearing the song twice, I got the entire cd, and I now think that it is well worth the money.PFTSOB reminds me of Nirvana and other raw rock bands. And, altough it is very different from Constantine's songs on AI, it shows another side of him. And it is very possible to like both sides.

I wan't completely surprised that this would not pass my test -- if it has both an explicit and clean version I already wonder. The band has never pretended to be anything other than a metal band, so that was no surprise either. Let's just say that we'll wait for Constantine's solo CD to come out -- the one that might contain \\"My Funny Valentine\\" and \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" on it -- before my daughter gets her own copy.

Someone might say that Della Casa is not dramatic Ariadne different from R. Strauss's intention. However, she is just like a beautiful and graceful Greek princess. Her singing is impeccable and radiating.Hilde Gueden is not a typical coloratura either but her Zerbinetta is one of the loveliest/sweetest one.Irmgard Seefried as Composer, Paul Schoeffler as Music Teacher and Murray Dickie as Brighella are also marvellous.No one could excel Karl Boehm's 'Ariadne' in tersms of the Viennese charms and exuberance."},{"rating":"2","title":"So good it hurts","review":"I bought this roller at the suggestion of my trainer who wash helping me get over the kinks of some really tough work outs.

It does hurt, but rolling out those sore spots lengthens the muscles and breaks up the tight spots. Constant pressure on a knot with slight rocking will break those up too.

I usually have soreness on the 2nd day after a major leg workout, but not if I finish up with this. Sometimes I forget or just don't have the time, and then I regret not using it after EACH workout because I'm much more sore and stiff. I also have used the Spri rollers at the gym & I like those a lot too. If you are looking for something just a tad less firm, less painful I'd say to get this:SPRI High Density Foam Roller. It's a few more dollars but seriously doesn't hurt as much, it's still firm but for some reason it just doesn't hurt like this one. If you want a DEEP tissue roller, this will definitely do the trick. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Recovery Utility!","review":"My gym has a couple different foam roller, and other misc roller, options to use. However, the one that I found most helpful was this one from Perform Better. I generally put a lot of stress on any sports products I use, especially when I'm putting force/weight on it. So, I was worried that I was going to warp any roller I purchased. However, after a few sessions using the different rollers available at my gym I realized that PB's version outperformed the others bar none. The level of firmness and overall quality is solid and I worry not about letting my body roll over it with as much pressure as I can have applied at any given point along the roller.If you're looking to help yourself out and want top notch quality then the PB Elite is for you.

I loved \\"The Blue Suit\\", \\"LA Without A Map\\", and \\"The Murder Book\\". \\"The Cloud Sketcher\\" is not only his most ambitious, but also his best book to date.This book is a passionate love story that begins in the back woods of Northern Finland in the early 1900's and continues through the Finnish Civil War. It ends in New York during the twenties.What intrigues me most about this book is that it captures a time and a place about which I knew very little. It's got everything: a wonderful love story, history, politics, architecture and murder and it's all interwoven in a very compelling way. I could not put this book down.To me, \\"The Cloud Sketcher\\" delivers what I expect from great literature. I highly recommend it to all who appreciate beautiful writing, a riveting story, and a unique journey into an incredibly vivid world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh. Interesting but derivative.","review":"I was interested in seeing how it would turn out. However, I wasn't riveted.

She is delving into a different place with this record. She is not afraid to show the tenderness in her soul while singing this song. If you have heard some of Wynonna's other work you know that her voice is extremely strong and sometimes intense. This single is the first time she does not totally show the extent of her vocal capacity. She choses to keep it simple and sweet with this song.

Somebody used a psychic probe on an Earthman, wiping out his memory, and dumped him in a small village on the planet, Florina. The woman who takes charge of him and the village's townsman eventually team up as the man begins regaining memory, and all become embroiled in political machinations. We're introduced to the planet Trantor, the center of the Galactic Empire.While this is the last of the Empire trilogy written by Asimov, it's the earliest in the fictional time sequence, occuring in an era much later than that era covered in the Robot novels.This is an engaging, tightly written novel with twists which will keep the reader involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold Bel Canto","review":"Some gifted souls are born to BE Norma. Others just sing Norma. Ponselle, Callas, Caballé--great Normas. Sutherland: an efficient singer who ends up leaving the listener cold and uninvolved.

Callas reigns supreme in this repertory; and watch Caballé with John Vickers on DVD! By the way, my favorite Sutherland: Lakmé, Esclarmonde."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing Norma","review":"Sutherland was awesome as Norma during the 60's and 70's. Unfortunately, this Norma was recorded much later. The voice has lost a lot of the beauty of tone, but her technique still amazing. For a much better Norma, look for the 1964 recording with Sutherland and Horne in the absolute best of form, which is to say, probably the best bel-canto duo of our time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious disappointment","review":"It's doubtful that a large voice capable of singing fiorature with strict 'a tempo' technical fireworks --- albeit with contrasting slower, 'expressive' sections --- is sufficient in itself to create a convincing Norma. With 111 performances under her belt, at least this performance of Sutherland fails to convince me that she understands Norma's predicament and can relay in 'musical' (dare I say, 'artistic')terms. Lurching between the turgid and rather graceless 'Casta Diva' to the bullet-like precision of \\"Bella a me ritorna\\" is not very eloquent (Bartoli does this sort of thing with greater flair). With a conventionally 'uglier' voice, Callas is still to be preferred. Perhaps Sills as well (haven't heard her, but she consistently understands what she's singing)...Deutekom in Vienna was more vital, while Caballe comes closest to the ideal combination of feeling, technique, and 'bella voce'. All-in-all, uninteresting as art, except perhaps to fanciers of large canaries."},{"rating":"2","title":"To the other reviewer who thought this was her last norma","review":"This is not the Norma with Caballe.

You have Corelli, Simionato, Sutherland, Ghiaurov, and Tozzi all in perfect form. I think the sonics are pretty good here. Sure, you have some audience noise, but that should be expected in a LIVE PERFORMANCE. And, what excellent voice Franco Corelli is in here! He sings the role of Raoul as if Meyerbeer had written it for him. His high notes just seem to float out effortlessly and excitingly. I have never been a card carrying fan of Franco Corelli's, but he sings with a fire and ardour here that, I feel, has been missing on his studio recordings. A truly wonderful recording and any fan of really great singing MUST own this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"LIVE RECORDING, VERY BAD SOUND, PEOPLE making noices,etc","review":"The singer are all very good and they are in top condition, but the LIVE recording is thecnicaly so BAD that you can not enjoy it at all.

As for Corelli, everyone knows he is the Prince of verisimo. So, the Vienna reviewer better go back to his music class and improve on his probable F grade in opera 101."},{"rating":"1","title":"Musically inaccurate to the max","review":"I concede that Sutherland, Corelli et al are in excellent voice, but what they sing is a heavily-cut, slowed-down performance of the music. Corelli, who never had a high D, also avoids the C in the Act II duet...not that I \\"only\\" listen to music for high notes, like some folks do, but Meyerbeer wrote those notes in for dramatic purposes so they are part of the score. Sutherland herself was so upset with this performance that she finally made a complete recording of the opera (at proper tempos) two years later with her husband, Richard Bonynge, conducting.I would, however, recommend the cut but terribly exciting Nicolai Gedda performance over this one, or Sutherland's commercial recording. The Gedda-Tarres-Shane performance is unbelievably intense!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could hear it...","review":"Theoretically, Les Huguenots is great music. Unfortunately, itsounds like this performance was recorded in a barrel. In some parts,the coughing of an audience members drowns out the music. Pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I read all of these reviews and thought this record it was something it was not. As another reviewer said- there are no high Ds or D flats from Corelli (adjust your record players guys!) and I only hear one or maybe two Cs. His voice his superb of course- glorious, magnificent, almost unique tone, and fabulous uppper register, but there are better Corelli records out there if you want to hear these thrills and really, apart from the duet which is haunting, the CD is not such a thrill. Sutherland does sing really well (but who said her voice was as big as Nilssons? how could it possibly be like this? it is a colloratura and nothing like Nilsson's!!!). The music is pretty hammy and sounds like it is cut all over the place. If you want to hear truly great LA Scala performances try Otello with Kleiber(1976- best record I have got) or Forza del Destino (1978) with Caballe' and Carreras. Only buy this one if you are a real Corelli fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"to the tasteless reviewer, Corelli is the KIng of Verisimo","review":"And Sutherland didn't sing the verisimo portion of Meyerbeer's many facet of his Hugenotts. Sutherland sings the coloratura's impossible writing than even Meyerbeer said was probably impossible to sing. Well, you know what? Not only is Sutherland a Goddess in her role as the queen, she fulfills Meyerbeer's dreams of a true dramatic coloratura who can sing anything. Corelli is every bit her equal and Simionato. Their singings is legendary. As for Sutherland's so call 28 curtain calls after the opera, it's true, but she received 30 for her Lucia. This is a historic recording. Callas was asked to sing the role of Valentine vs Sutherland's Queen. She chickened out, and smartly so. For if Callas was to confront Sutherland at La Scala, Milan, Sutherland would shame Callas's and she knew it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"This is a great recording. I must say I am young, but my knowledge of opera is great and i know good singing when I hear it. Franco Corelli is my favorite tenor. Though, however great his singing is, i am not going to be biased, he left out most of the difficult music. He edited a great deal from the tenor part. Though, what he does sing is the greatest display of pure masculine testoternone driven tenor singing ever displayed. Sutherland had one of the greatest instruments of the century. Although you cannot understand anything she says, which is not acceptable to me personally, her instrument is gold. However, the greatest singing on this recording is Simionato, her heavy mezzo is to me the greatest ever and she displays it perfectly here. If you are a fan of the old shcool singers you will have to learn to deal with bad recording quality. If the singing is good enough it all seems to disapear anyhow."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Singers vs The Score","review":"Interesting mix of reactions to this somewhat creaky recording. My 2-star, \\"feh\\", is not based on the singing, which is quite good (to say the least) . . . and if that's why you buy these things, you'll probably be relatively happy here . . . but on the fact that (a) the opera has been slashed like cheap goods after Xmas; and (b) the performance has all the drive of a Studebaker running on 1 cylinder. If you are interested, therefore, in \\"Les Huguenots\\" as an opera in every facet, youwill be disappointed.Much more rewarding, although the singing is not at Sutherland-Corelli level (although the cast is not exactly a throw away)- is the difficult to find French/Erato live (Montepellier) performance that is truly exciting to listen to - great visceral drive and panache by all involved - and is note complete (on 4 discs)!! THIS is why Huguentos was one of the great hits of the 19th century.Depends on why you listen to opera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless and expensive","review":"I'm exclusivly pumping and was looking for a good way to store expressed milk in my freezer.

Upon getting it home and using it though, it was useless. When I read the fine print on the box, it says it will only hold 24 if there is only 4 ozs in each bag. I assume they just want you to squish them on top of each other, which is just annoying.I, too, went back and bought a $1.99 ice cube storage bin which is the perfect size, and actually makes rotating th oldest easier, you just add to the back, unlike this product, where you would either have to put a marker in, constantly move each bag forward into a new compartment, or pick each one up and look at the date."},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea, bad concept","review":"I got this as a gift and I wish I had a gift receipt to return it...I takes up too much space in the freezer and only holds 12 bags.

I didn't really use it for storage at all. I used it to freeze them, ensure that milk wouldnt leak from the tops as it was stored upright and create uniformity. Then I put them into the door of my stand up deep freezer. It worked awesome. Obviously, using the product for storing 12 bags only isn't that practical or inexpensive. But for freezing purposes I found nothing to be better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"I am using this product now as it seemed like a good idea at the time, but I would not have purchased it if I had put some thought into it. Firstly and I think this is a bit dangerous for exclusively breastfed babies, the ounces are off on the storage bags. I know I placed 3oz in the most recent bag but it comes up as 6oz in on the bag. This is not good especially if mom is not home and a caregiver might be fooled into believing they have enough milk on hand. Secondly, the storage bags are expensive. Ziploc snack size bags are much cheaper and I am going to try those to see if they fit so I can as least make the most of the small spaces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great storage containers!","review":"For those people complaining the containers only hold 12 bags there is an easy solution: take the bags out once they are frozen. Once they are frozen in the block shape you can stack them or lay them flat and then you have space for new bags. I used these with my last pregnancy and my husband and I loved them! We tried freezing just the bags but then they leaked no matter how many times we checked to make sure they were sealed all the way. if you uses a little common sense these are great and you don't have to worry about leakage.

I even tried putting it on my outside wall with no luck. I returned the item and got the Terk Edge desktop powered FM antenna, and that did the trick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"This antenna works well for me. In comparison to a standard non-amplified dipole or my older less-expensive Terk antenna, it provides a stronger signal that is largely free of noise to my receivers. My situation is that I'm located about 50 miles from the nearest city from which most stations are broadcast. Many radio stations are too far to receive well. This antenna has largely fixed that problem. This is a (bi-)directional antenna and works best for radio stations with the antenna length perpendicular to the directions (front and rear) of the radio stations you wish to receive. In cases where radio stations surround you, an omni-directional antenna may work better. Also note that you need some signal to work with, so if located in a sub-basement no antenna may help you."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERK FM-50 not worth the money","review":"Buy the $5.00 Dipole flat twin wire antenna at Radio Shack, it does just as good a job."},{"rating":"1","title":"VHF Antenna works just as good","review":"Before you buy an antenna like this try splitting your VHF antenna signal and running that to the receiver.

The antenna pulls in radio stations from distant cities that broadcast on the same frequency as my local favorite just fine, but the result is an unsatisfactory, irritating, garbled mix of at least three radio signals from my speakers. The windshield antenna on my car, when parked in the driveway outside, never fails to pick up this favorite station perfectly clearly in comparison. I got the best results just connecting my radio with the 75 ohm to 300 ohm converter jack included with the antenna and leaving the antenna and its coax cable out of the picture altogether. I could have bought that component at the local Radio Hut for peanuts."},{"rating":"1","title":"A simple pair of wires worked far better","review":"I set this thing up in a room in the middle of our work building and a simple pair of wires worked better.

So the product may have been damaged in shipment but Amazon could not send another for me to try as at the time they were out of stock. I tried the product with and without the amplifier and noticed absolutely no difference. I tried it in different places in my home as well. It just did not work for me at all.

The amplifier does absoulutely nothing. As is the case with most amplified antennas. The noise created by the amp somtimes causes interference. I am an experienced tech who does install low voltage system for a living and have done so since 1980. I have this up high in attic and I get pretty good reception I do not get the vast majority of NYC HD stations. I do live a good distance away from NYC in NJ approx. 60 miles. Depending on the area you live and distance from towers I would say to take that into consideration, and if possible go to an outdoor if possible which will give the best reception. The key as with any antenna is height, and good quality cable use RG6 or better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reception...finally!","review":"I am very glad to have laid out the cash for this antenna.

I bought this to use on my motorcycle. I thought the small size, especially the flat body, would fit nicely into the top of a tank bag. I also bought a special handlebar mount for it. Unfortunately, I've had nothing but trouble with it. It's slow to acquire satellites and to recalculate routes. Whether you're driving a car or a motorcycle, it's not up to the task of keeping pace with changes in your route. Maybe it was intended for pedestrians only. The user interface for the GPS is not intuitive (at least, not for me), Worse still, it freezes often when trying to download maps and when deleting stored routes. The Garmin helpline in the UK could only tell me to reset the machine each time. Not very helpful. My guess is that the combination of palm PC and GPS was too much for Garmin to handle.

Had problems with stuck reeds, out of tune notes (every harp in the set was a touch sharp). Also these harps have pretty large airholes, which makes finding the notes easy, but causes you to reallly work hard to bend and project your sound. Plastic casing has a rough finish, and will leave your lips very chapped and sore after a few minutes of serious playing. The body is also alot thicker than most, making it hard to seat properly at the back of your lips. Would work well for a beginner just looking to explore the instrument, but certainly not good enough for serious musicians."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"These are worth the $30 you pay for them, but they just do not stand up to a quality harmonica. I am a beginner player and bought a Hohner C Marine Band harmonic to start out and have been playing that for about 6 months. It was time for me to buy harps in a different key and the 7 harmonicas in this set looked like a good way to get a variety of keys at an affordable price--and it is. However, after having learned on a Hohner Marine Band harmonica, there is no comparison in quality. The Piedmont set has no where near the tone or sound quality and the amount of wind required to produce the same volume or note is very noticeable. These can not way match the quality of a better harp and there is simply no way to go back. These are fine for the price, but if you want to play for real, get a quality harp like the Marine Band, even if you're a beginner."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are Hohner harps, but....","review":"When I first started to learn harp, I saw these and bought them. I figured, Hey, most of all the keys are used are in the case, so that will save me some money. I found out that the harps are cheap plastic ones, made in China. Yes, they have the Hohner name on them, but these are made in China, not Germany. Not everything made in China is bad, but I feel that when you are a beginner on harp, you need to find a good quality harp, like a Hohner Special 20 or a Crossover or mayby a Lee Oskar, in the key of C, then branch out into other keys. A beginner and pro alike needs a good solid quality harp, one that is airtight, and makes bending easier,which these harps do not. All in all, I would not recommend these harps. The only thing that is worth the money is the nice case they come in. Spend your money on one good harp, and if you want to buy these, give them away to kids to play with."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are junk!","review":"These are by far the worst harmonicas ive ever played. The high and low notes dont even play unless you blow real hard into each end. This is more like a gift for a very yound child to play with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah not worth it even for a beginner","review":"Had to give this set one star just to get the review to post...Actually zero.I picked up this set at Guitar Ceneter, thinking that it was a good deal for the price. I was expecting \\"pocket pal\\" quality. I have to say that I am not pleased with the set. The C harp leaks and everyone of the harps will have to be tuned and gapped. I would not reccomend this set to even the most novice of players, as you will spend most of your time trying to figure out if it is the Harp or you that doesn't sound good. Get individual Harps and get what you pay for...you definitely will with this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy harp set","review":"This is a sucker buy!

They are some sort of composite material. The screws fell out of two of them in two weeks and the key \\"imprint\\" wore off two. They are very lightweight. I like Hohner but not this package"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money or time,Very discouraging","review":"Four of the harps in this set were bad when i received them, don't even buy them for beginners I think it will only frustrate and discourage them from playing. The case is nice but thats about it, spend the money on something better"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good set for great price.","review":"This is a great set for a beginner, at a great price. Yes, they are not as high a quality as a professional set but they do great for the price. Yes, they bend nicely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Toy","review":"Cheap toy. Low volume and low quality tone. Cheap, lightweight plastic. Requires more wind than a normal harmonica. If you have ANY experience playing harmonicas or are a musician in ANY capacity spend the money for a better set. If you are looking for a toy for a child to play with you found it."},{"rating":"1","title":"These harmonicas sound dull","review":"The price and case is nice, but the plastic casing of each harp leaves them dull sounding compared to my other harmonicas. I thought I'd round out my set with all the other keys, but these harps sound like they are playing underwater with no vibrancy. I guess you get what you pay for. Might be okay for a kids starter set, but if you are serious about playing harmonica, look for better quality than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great value!","review":"My son asked for a harmonica for his birthday. The name I thought of was Hohner and began my search on Amazon. When I found that I could get a set of 7 I scooped it up!

Great starter set!"},{"rating":"1","title":"peidmont blues harmonica set","review":"They were in a neat case.In fact the case is the only thing that was really useable.the harmonica's in the key of c, e, f, g, and bFlat are not useable at all for a complete scale.I would hate to know that someone was using the Hohner name on an item such as what I purchased.I still use a Hohner Marine Band that has been in my posession for the past forty years(40)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what we ordered","review":"We wanted to get a nice harmonica for our son's 10th birthday. When I found this set I thought I would give it a try. Our son was thrilled. He uses them all and loves the variety! I agree the case is very nice. People are speaking of an odor from the harmonicas, but we smelled nothing. I believe this would make a great addition to anyones music collection. Certainly better than other store bought \\"kids\\" harmonicas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap is as cheap does!","review":"Darn, got the Piedmont Blues set from Hohner...plastic comb..OK...plastic shell..not OK...cheapy reeds...Bad! Thought maybe they sounded bad because of the plastic shell...so switched out with shell from special 20...it fits perfectly but still sounds dull and no volume! Total bumber man! Was hoping to find replacement reeds for my Special 20s but no go. The brass reed plates are obviously not of the same quality or thickness as in the other standard harps Hohner offers. These are perfect for kids just learning and that is it! I will be giving these away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this","review":"The case is nice but the harps are cheap. I was told they are the best. not true in my case they are not that good.

All the harmonicas worked. The reeds were soft, (easy to play). They are great for car trips. My daughter and I jammed on them and she ended up taking them home with her. I will probably get another set. They come with a booklet that has a few songs that young people may not know. If you want to explore harmonica music this is the way to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have returned it...","review":"Some of the harmonicas were fine, but a few of them came with broken reeds. In addition, the harmonicas didn't last very long at all. I thought it was too troublesome to return it, so I continue to use some of them for practice, but of the seven harmonicas, only two work well now."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't be fooled by the good reviews","review":"first let me start out by saying that I am a beginner. I bought these harmonicas so that I can learn on them, however that's not the case. They are not air tight, some notes do not want to play and it takes a lot of air to get something out of it. Also, these harps are made in china and the quality hohner harps are made in germany. Oh, the case is nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"deserves zero stars","review":"Not even good enough for a beginner. Most of each unit doesn't work. Quality is the bottom of the bucket. Waste of money.

A couple of them just don't play right. Disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty crap harmonicas","review":"Bought this because I only had a Harmonica in the key of C and I wanted a cheap set of a few more so I could play a wider variety of songs. I gotta say, these harmonicas are pretty mediocre. The plastic is pretty cheap. When you open the case they smell strongly of plastic. And some of them had bad holes so not all the harmonicas worked right from the get go. I knew all this going in and bought this anyway, so it really was my bad. I knew I should have just splurged on individual harmonicas. The case isn't even worth the price. I'd definitely say to skip this product. It's not even worth it as a practice set. What good is a harmonica that you can barely play cause it won't produce proper notes?"},{"rating":"1","title":"nice to look at but not to play","review":"Was very disappointed with this set. Should have known better when I saw the price. I've caught better harmonicas than these at Mardi Gras parades off the floats.

Bending is difficult, and it will trash these harps. Half of them needing adjusting the reeds to even get a sound. Save your cash, get a Suzuki promaster and be satisfied. All metal, chromed, and sturdy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surrender EVERYTHING, even wisdom, intuition, faith","review":"At the beginning the book really enchained me. Gave really good hints for practising, what to do.The more I've read, the more I could read about this suggested practise of surrender. Unfortunately the author emphasizes this practise too much and ends up with surrendering everything, wisdom, intuition, experience, faith.I was also little surprised that he suggests to surrender the Silas for the sake of ...? Namely to surrender to detain the Non-Truth resp. Lie. He really suggests to surrender the Truth (to lie), for the sake of well-being!Due to the lack of wisdom in this book, it's only 1 star worth.

I have been an avid movie-goer and movie-lover for years, and the only other Movie Encyclopedia I had was several years old. Unfortunately, when I got this book home I realized that MANY names were misssing. For example, Pamelyn Ferdin who was in a Clint Eastwood movie called \\"The Beguiled\\" in 1971. It seems there is no consistency regarding who he includes in this book, and who is left out. It should be ALL or nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh no,another book by maltin","review":"this book is probably just another annoying book with wrong information,like most (or all) of maltin's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect, but indispensable","review":"Initially about a year ago I made the mistake of following the other reviews which panned the book, and did not buy it. I then gradually realized that some of my favorite short bios on IMDB.com were excerpted from Maltin's Encyclopedia. Of course at that point I bought it. There are few, if any, other volumes that quickly give you the sum-up and low-down on 2,000 movie industry people. To say the book has errors and omissions is to me ridiculous...a perfect book would cost a few thousand dollars. Meanwhile, IMDB.com is available as a backstop for searching out hundreds of thousands of details, which wouldn't fit in a reasonably sized volume anyway. Generally speaking, I've gone wrong far more often in rejecting something based on a review or an opinion about a book, movie, etc., than in consuming something recommended -- you can always bail out if a recommender was wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leonard, how could you?","review":"I can't believe Leonard Maltin would put his name on this compilation of misinformation. He must be spreading himself too thin and hiring interns to do his writing.

They're nice bags. Check the dimensions - these are pretty small bags. I could get a 2 liter bottle of soda in each one but not much more. I would have given them a 5 star except for the buckles. They use snap buckles for opening/closing. The adjustable straps move one end of the buckle. My complaint is that these buckles are not very easy to use. You have to line the 2 end up EXACTLY straight or they won't buckle. It got tedious at times. Other than that they were good bags."},{"rating":"2","title":"rehab","review":"This movie has all of the action and reactions expected in an up and down drug movie.

These two using buddies portray very real life issues and troubles of todays drug addicts. After rushing their musician partner to the hospital from a drug overdose they jump from problem to problem all the while trying to get help in kicking their habit.

Not wanting to judge too quickly, I read another book by the same author following the same caricuture, er character.The author can't even keep his own characters straight.

To compound matters, the \\"product support\\" that's free is virtually worthless. I can't figure out how to get to a helpful place- seems to require a series of mysterious downloads.

More disturbing is that other operations like selecting different emails are also slower.The UGLYAs other users have indicated, don't open up your email (Outlook Express in my case) too soon after reboot or AntiSPAM will not load. Very strange. Wait until you hard drive starts buzzing before you open the email application.In the past, I also experienced crashes when hitting the \\"This is SPAM button\\". Strangely, I have not had this happen lately.If your SPAM level is only about 10%, don't bother with this program.

If you're an Outlook Express user then this program will be totally useless to you. It seems that the infamous \\"'This is Spam' button crashes Outlook Express\\" bug from the 2004 version is still there [...] After going through the usual uninstall/reinstall/change every freakin setting routine, I spent hours trying to find a solution on the symantec tech support site and on other sites with no luck. The Symantec tech support site is terrible. I couldn't find any place to report an incident through email or post it to a support forum or anything like that.

It is really disgusting that Symantec has leveraged the Norton brand, formerly known for quality, with the cynical money grab that is Norton AntiSpam. Absolute junk software, with comically bad support. I hope to see a class action lawsuit against Symantec for selling this product that they certainly know is defective in a myriad of ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unsatisfactory results?","review":"I found this software to be VERY dissapointing. It just does not work very well? I use Incredimail as my e-mail provider, and find Norton AntiSpam to be less than helpful. It is very good at always mentioning Norton AntiSpam on my spam e-mails, problem is it doesn't block most of them? So what is the use of having an AntiSpam program?

Now I am really wondering about the quality of other Symantec Norton products in general?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Non functional","review":"Nine out of 10 tries to open Outlook Express have failed since I first installed this product. I suppose that's one way of stopping spam; you don't get any email at all.

The 2005 version is nothing but junk when compared to the 2004 version.

Each day is only a page long, with a verse and then a reflect and pray sentence or two. The story that is told to reaffirm the verse is very basic, but gets the point across. I find this book to be a fantastic discussion starter. While the book itself doesn't get very deep it certainly opens a door to discuss all kinds of things with my kids. And tells it in a way that I might not thought of explaining it to the kids to begin with.I highly recommend this book whether you only have 10 minutes to spend on it on certain days, or have plenty of time to discuss.

The authors used a tone and examples that teens will probably find engaging and even funny.Each devotional was one page long, so they're quick to read. For each day, a short reading from the Bible was assigned. You needed to look it up yourself. Then a Bible verse was quoted, often from the assigned reading. Next, the main text was mostly a story or matching game that illustrated a point from that day's reading. A paragraph or two tied the Bible reading and the example together and stated the point clearly. The authors then suggested some things to reflect on and a prayer. They also sometimes suggested an activity that might help put the lesson into practice or remind you of the lesson.Overall, I thought the points were good ones and that teenagers would be willing to do these devotionals. I'd recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Devotional for Boys","review":"This devotional is great. It is a little out of date with the stories it tells, but it gets the point across.

It was mostly a shortcoming on MSD's website where if it didn't understand your engine, it would default you to this. I could have saved 30-40 bucks just buying fully premade ones for any other small block ford, but now I do appreciate being able to shorten/lengthen and route cables to give the engine a really clean, finished look.The wires and connectors are great and of true MSD quality.Resistance was even better than advertised, sometimes just 2-3 ohms, but never more than 10 for any wire.The kit comes with 8x 8.5mm wires (standard is 8mm) that have the spark plug end on them. You cut it to length and put the distributor end on with the included tool.

All of a sudden this album came out, and I would turn my radio on a 6 in the morning to get ready for work and the first single was Let's Stay Together. Well, I looked forward to hearing this song every morning. And then I would hit the clubs at night and they started playing What's Love Got to Do With It. I was mesmerized by Tina from then on. I actually bought the LP and wore it out. Then the cassette and remember blaring this album in my 76 Regal while cruising. Finally bought the cd, and it will always be one of my favorite albums of all time. I Might Have Been Queen should also have been a single.

It isn't the worst that I've heard (that dubious honour goes to one with a person coughing repeatedly next to the microphone), but it sounds rather hollow, almost as though the sound is being piped through a long tube. If having the Karajan \\"Traviata\\" is your goal, Anna Moffo's voice is spectacular, and Karajan's direction is expert (as expected)...and the price is certainly reasonable.In sum, if you're looking for a copy of Karajan's \\"Traviata\\", this is it...if you're just looking for a copy of \\"Traviata\\", you might think to sidestep this one in favour of something with better sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical post-it.

That is how one titles an essay. It is NOT a technical book that will lay out how to write. It's a collection of well written essays about different factors that will help you write better. The negative reviews are a bit ridiculous in their complaints because they expected something other than what the book is (ironically a lot of them are poorly written as well). If you're a professional writer, this probably won't do much for you. If you like writing and want to clean up your craft a little with this collection of tips, then it'll be great for you.

William Zinsser holds the view that writing is a craft that one can learn only through constant practice. One of the best things about this book is that Zinsser takes a dry topic and presents it in an entertaining way.The book focuses on improving clarity by eliminating clutter in one's writing. Zinsser lists many of the most-common mistakes in writing; this section made me cringe, but reading it has improved my prose.Zinsser is an opinionated man and that will grate on some readers' nerves.

Following years of research and many rewrites, my inner Mr. Anal is now pressuring me to painstakingly retrace my own work--hopefully, the last time--and ensure that I have adhered to 'all' of Zinsser's recommendations.On a bitter-sweet note, from one aspiring writer to a legend, William, I 'hate' you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish everyone would read this book","review":"This is a well written book on writing well.

I liked the author's style. Of course, sometimes the geography section of any true crime book can be a little slow. You can always feel free to skim those parts and get to the nitty gritty of the crimes. I think the prosecution did not prove their case and I guess I have to read the other account written on this Olivia Riner arson mystery. I don't feel the author was too slanted towards one side or the other. I think she was innocent too. You should never assume a foreigner can understand their Miranda rights without help from a translator or an attorney of their own. This is like the Amanda Knox case in that she was subjected to a foreign jury system without much help in the beginning. Both women were trying to be helpful to the other country's police and got in way over their heads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly written and unconvincing","review":"I found this book to be very clumsily written. The author's diction is too informal, and he rambles from one subject to another with little or no transition between topics. I was annoyed by the vast amount of irrelevant information that he included. For example, he interrupts his account of Olivia's first days in the Fischers' home to give a seemingly pointless account of the celebration of St. Nicholas's Day in Europe. Mr. Davis is also obviously biased in favor of Olivia Riner. I had the impression that he had made up his mind about Olivia's innocence before he even started his research for this book. He repeats outrageous charges and wild rumors about the Fischer family which were proven false in Joyce Egginton's book, \\"Circle of Fire.\\" I believe that Ms. Egginton's account of the Olivia Riner case is far superior to Mr. Davis's."},{"rating":"2","title":"good stuff","review":"i've been feeding my cats this brand for a month now and they really like it a lot.

There are a few amusing moments. The humor is very much that unique, quasi-satirical comedy that Trey and Matt are know for. The problem is that they had yet to perfect it when this movie was made.If you keep in mind that this was a very early attempt a movie-making for two hilarious individuals, you'll feel content.

The word musical in the title threw me off, I admit it. I don't like musicals. The original music in this movie such as It's a Shpadoikle Day are melodically beautiful. Match that with the hilarious lyrics and you have something special, lightning in a bottle.Southpark is a very original and a very funny show but This movie and Team America blows SP away.BUY THIS FLICK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still no Shatterproof!!!!","review":"Had to purchase this one due to the fact that I'm in some of the Special Features.

However, I give this, dare I say cult classic, only 4 stars as the cut song \\"Shatterproof\\" is still missing from yet another Troma release of this film...sigh. What's wrong with you guys? I know it's an issue with Trey thinking that the song makes Packer seem too tough, but so what. Throw it in as an Easter Egg...something. Fans of the film want to see the scene. They would eat it up.

Low budget, I think by buying a copy of the VHS, I paid 1/2 of the development costs. This makes Attack of the Killer Tomatoes look like a classic of film work. Oh you can enjoy the film and have a good time. I suggest having several beers before watching though. The humor will make more sense. I loved South Park the movie, this ways obviously their first attempt at a movie and they needed the practice. The songs use many of the same music from the Southpark TV show. The Braniff-Beleive It sounds are constantly playing in the music for this movie which was a little confusing. Frankly, it looked like a college film school project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen","review":"I love South Park and I liked Baseketball but this movie wasn't funny at all.

He plays Alfred Packer, a cannibal who rides a pony named Liane (played by Duster, based on Parker's real-life ex-girlfriend who done him wrong; it's safe to bet she was a real horse's ass). When Liane is stolen by a band of ragtag trappers, Packer goes after them with a vengeance - and a healthy appetite. You really have to be be in the mood for this odd fare.Staci Layne Wilson"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's be honest ...","review":"This is not a good film. I wanted to like it because I love South Park and I think that Trey Parker and Matt Stone are comedic geniuses.

Making a musical about people eating human flesh? BRILLIANT! This is an amusing little jaunt into nerdy absurdity.Some gold-diggers(men actually mining for gold)set off on a dangerous expedition from Utah to Colorado in search of riches. They meet some friendly Japanese Indians? and battle against some troublemaking trappers along with the harsh elements.There's gore and gay songs and humor along the way. The sick side of Troma actually seems toned down quite a bit though, this is no BloodSucking Freaks.Overall, this is some nice entertainment although I expected more grotesque killings and raunchiness. Still a worthy production from those crazy Troma folks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trey and Matt have done it again!!","review":"I am one of the hugest fans of South Park and I have to say that this movie rocks!!!!!!!!!!!

Some of my favs from the '80's scene in Boston were recorded by New Rose, so it's more than a little frustrating to find that a rare Turbines recording is actually Willie Alexander (great though he is, doing one of his greatest songs); Barrence Whitfield is not the band doing Jungle Fever, and The Lyres are not doing This Party Sucks...c'est la vie..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Long, Long Ago World-But Not That Far Away","review":"The translation by Burton Raffel in this book is by far the best I have ever read.

To this end Kazantzakis is unparalelled(If you haven't already, score yourself a copy of \\"Zorba the Greek\\" to see what I mean.

The FM reception using that was pretty poor and it was difficult to position so that it was not a eyesore, so I decided to try the Terk. It does work better than the single wire antenna, but not as good as a simple dipole wire. I find that I need to keep the gain turned way down or there is a lot of added hiss (thus defeating the purpose of an amplified antenna).

Then, a sloppy vocalist is hardly capable of singing Rossini's Armida to perfection, learning this most difficult role (Sutherland never sang it) in five days only, a time in which other famous songbirds struggle with just one cadenza. A sloppy vocalist isn't capable of doing \\"I Puritani\\" and \\"Die Walküre\\" in the same week.

Her aria \\"Oh Quante Volte\\" is a bore to me. The stars of this recording (made live from La Scala in 1968) are Luciano Pavarotti and Jaime Aragall. Yes Romeo was written for contralto, but I'll take a tenor (expecially Aragall on this night) any day. Their passionate singing is incredible. The Romeo/Tebaldo duet is unforgetable as it is ended by Pavarotti and Aragall on an amazing high note. I have also heard the RCA recording with Kasarova/Mei/Vargas. But I believe this Gala recording makes a better argument for the opera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Battery But Bad Idea","review":"The battery itself is very nice, and the idea behind the speakerphone inside the battery is very appealing. The only problem with this is the presentation of the speakerphone addon, specifically the microphone. It does not amplify the voice while ignoring the static/background noises, like most speakerphones.I *HIGHLY* suggest that if you want a vibrating battery and a speakerphone accessory, you should spend the few extra dollars for a cheaper battery, and the speakerphone desk-charger. THAT item is very useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cermax knives are scapels","review":"Pro: These knives are so sharp that I really, really am cautious when using them.

They re really that sharp.It will slice a tomato with little or no pressure. You have to be aware that the knife has gone through the tomato if you are holding it to slice it or you will go right into your hand.If you do a lot of cooking and need a very, very sharp knife, the Cermax is the knife you need.Con: These knifes are Not dishwasher safe. it is marked right on the box.

As the credits rolled at the end the crowd boo'ed and largely classified the movie as a failure. This redux is about the same. Art house reviews will praise this as a \\"masterpiece\\" but even the actors and crew suggested this was one of WKW worst films. He simply had a vision that was too grand and had to stymy it down into this compressed version of a movie. For those in the know, this is an epic tale that spanned 3 books and although this movie is loosely tied to the books, the characters lacks all background to make it significant to the audience (for instance Jacky Cheung's &#21271;&#19984;). This was a failure the first time around and nothing's changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"at at first you don't succeed...move on","review":"On principle, I object to filmmakers going back years later and re-editing and rethinking a movie they made. But if you're going to fiddle with the past, at least present the new cut side by side with the original, something this DVD fails to do. Not that it matters: director Wong kar Wai hasn't had any more luck creating a compelling drama out of this mannered action flick that prefigures the unique style of his that would flower on great films like Chungking Express and In The Mood For Love. But everything he attempts here -- basically trying to bring a depth of performance and genuine conflict to an action flick -- is done much better by Ang Lee with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.

The producers could have erected a big sign outside the studio lot which might have read something like this: \\"On this site will soon rise a new Looney Tunes Moooovie, uninspired in design and plot, with stodgy humor and no style at all.\\" The story is awful, the dialogue is cheap and the plot holes are incredible.

A lot of things in the movie was trying to be funny but it was only making the movie more stupid than it already was.

It is not a family film. It is full of inappropriate scenes, dipicting the actresses scantily clad in extremely tight suits or dresses. This is not a movie for little kids, it would have been great without all the innuendo, movie producers nowadays just throw in something nasty into a \\"family film\\" so they have a reason to rate it PG so more people will see it because \\"everyone knows that G rated movies don't draw as many people as a PG or PG-13 movie, right?\\".Other than that it is an OK movie, with some laughable humor and okay actors. The cartoon characters seem overdone. Steve Martin is good but they put him in an incredibly annoying role.In short, do NOT buy this movie for your young kids, it is not appropriate.

He is pretty mean to her in the beginning and then as soon as they are married and he is back to being a duke his personality changes completely and he's like a totally different person.

Megan is awesome and fiesty, but not annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down!","review":"I thought that the story was very cute. I like the mix up in her stories where both of the lead characters discover that they love each other, but they either try to deny it or they are afraid of telling the other person. She makes Devlin seem like a cad at first, but then his soft side comes around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I have a feeling this author's friends may have wrote these reviews, because I've read better material in Reader's Digest."},{"rating":"1","title":"This battery does not fit in a V60c for Verizon","review":"I ordered this battery for my V60c and it does not fit the phone.

The battery is shorter, thicker and the contacts did not line up with my phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great battery for a great phone","review":"Lith Ion batteries are the best. I get over two full days of battery life. The talk time varies, depending on if the talking is continuous or not. The life of the battery is shorther than Nokias, but I don't mind because it charges in a short amount of time (this is the only reason I don't rate the product a 5). Overall, great battery for a great phone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for upper undergrad math student.","review":"Because this book has made it into a 2nd edition should say enough (in this area of study). The book has wonderful notation that makes sense and problems that start out easy and go up from there! There is also extensive use of math computer programs (mathmatica & maple) for problems and examples. Wonderful book & one of my favorite undergrad texts!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only works randomly","review":"I read all the positive reviews and gave this product a try. Unfortunately, I experienced the same problem that only one reviewer had: the heart monitor only worked at random times.I would put the strap on, tried adding gel to allow better contact, but the watch would monitor my heart rate for a few seconds and immediately loose its signal.I returned it. Too bad since it looked like a nice product from a well known company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have a Heart Monitor","review":"The watch is somewhat large...I thought I should have gotten the smaller version. However, after wearing the watch I actually forgot I had it on! So far everything is working as described.Update 11/2/10 - The watch is actually falling apart. Adhesive no longer is holding silver part of face to watch. Watch still functions but parts are separating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice and Basic HRM","review":"I am very pleased with the functionality and style of the watch. My previous HRM was from Polar. Not only was it so ugly on my wrist I felt I could only wear it while working out, it only lasted 1 year before it began malfunctioning.This watch does everything a serious but not UberGeeked athlete would want from a HRM. It gives you chrono, it gives you zones, it gives you an easy to read display. It doesn't take a degree in engineering from MIT to work its different modes.Good watch for a fair price."},{"rating":"1","title":"A True Disappointment","review":"I purchased this product in March and have used it faithfully since. The heart rate monitor works fine. Unfortunately, this watch is neither water proof nor water resistant. During a swim with my children in a local pool (max depth 7 feet), water leaked into the watch and shorted it out. I plan to return it under warranty, but thought that \\"ironmen\\" or swimmers should be aware of the difficulty I have expereinced."},{"rating":"1","title":"My heart stops beating","review":"As a serious runner, I bought this watch so that I could see how hard my heart was working during workouts. Apparently my heart just stops because the heart rate monitor frequently just stops working. No heart rate signal. Nothing. I thought a new battery in the chest strap would fix the problem, but it didn't. The monitor will work fine for a while during a workout, then just stops. I am quite disappointed with this watch because this function is one of it's distinguishing features that sets it apart from other sports watches."},{"rating":"1","title":"watch vs heart rate monitor","review":"The watch is fine however the heart monitor works only some of the time. If I had to do this over again, I would not have purchased the item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't use in the water!","review":"Great watch... great heartrate monitor.Just don't expect to use it in the water. I clouded up after only 1 swim. I sent it back to Timex... they replaced it, but my new one did the same thing only a few week later when I wore underneeth my leather motorcycle jacket on a warm summer day ride when my sweat did the same thing. Chances are... the button was pushed by my jacket sleeve allowing persperation to leak in."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Just Didn't Work","review":"I looked forward to using this watch and monitor for my running adventures but as soon as I looked at the blank face of the watch I knew I was going to be disappointed. I returned the item and was reimbursed in an expedient manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Heart Rate Monitor","review":"First heart rate monitor I've ever owned and it works very well. No problems whatsoever. The chest strap is a little short for big guys however. Still, highly recommended.Update 1/15/13: Just a quick update. I have used this heart rate monitor almost daily for almost a year now and it's never missed a beat. Still totally reliable and accurate. Just wet the chest pads with a few drops of water before you put it on and you will get immediate, accurate readings. Still highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get your heart racing","review":"Watch and monitor worked fine the first time out. I am not a triathlete so I probably don't stress it as much as some but I do use it when I work out or go running and it gives me the heart rate data that I am looking for. Recommended for the average cross training athlete who doesn't want to spend $100 for something to tell the time. I have not had any problems with it recognizing the monitor as some have on this list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works fine occasionally","review":"I've had this heart rate monitor for about 8 months now and if it's not for the fact that I'm cheap, I would've tossed it long time ago. The watch itself looks okay, the band is plastic and cheap looking. The main complaint that I have about this watch is the heart rate monitor reliability. More time than not, my heart rate can't be picked up. I've tried every trick in the book, but still have trouble with it. Everytime I put it on, I have to keep my fingers crossed and hope that it will pick up my heart rate, but most of the time it doesn't. When it does work, very occasionally, the heart rate is pretty accurate.Just save up some more money and buy a Polar to avoid all this hassel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good HRM.","review":"This HRM does everything I need.

Works great and easy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You Like Haiku, You Will Hate This Book","review":"The cover is lovely and inviting and a casual glance through the pages may tempt you to purchase this book. Do not be fooled. This is not haiku.Haiku, as you know, consist of three lines with five, seven and five syllables respectively. In this book, the translator, apparently laboring under the delusion that Western readers only like poetry that sounds like it came from a Hallmark greeting card, has made two unfortunate decisions. First, she has changed the syllables to 6-8-6, instead of 5-7-5, and second, she has made sure everything rhymes. The result is painful to read. A sampling:The hail beats down amainA hunted hare bursts from the reedsAnd races o'er the plain.Or:The snow fell in the night,And people rouse each other upTo see the lovely sight.I repeat. This is not haiku. Nor is it enjoyable to read page after page of sing-song little rhymes when one is feeling like reading haiku.Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sorry production.","review":"For those of us who remember the show, these are a poor substitutes.The continuity and editing are sub-standard at best.The flow of scenes are staggered and jumpy.The amount of action is high.

The band has a sound that is unique to the music scene today. As their website states, \\"Intense, raw energy fused with sex, serious contemplation, and excess.\\" Truck Stop Sally is a lyrical gem. The song will stick with you long after its over. All of the songs will have you singing (and possibly banging your head) right along with the band. I highly recommend picking up this CD as soon as you can!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Earthy and Sensual","review":"The music on this CD is an earthy, raw sound that is deeply moving and sensual.

Constantine was an idol wannabe that couldn't even make it with the teeny boppers. I thought there was hope for him after hearing some of the songs he did on the show.

This CD stinks.Don't waste your money or time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really want a Constantine CD...not this.","review":"I didn't buy the CD...I couldn't make it past the samples. I loved Constantine on Idol. I didn't think he was the best there, but I thought he was near the top. Performance wise though, this guy can perform on stage...I just love him. This music though, not impressed. I understand why he would want to promote his original band, but he really needs to give it up and go out on his own. He did so good on Idol and had so many fans. Granted, I'm sure some will buy this CD just because they are a fan. And I'm sure that there are some that will love it. I'm not one of them though. I really wanted to like it, but I just can't. That said though, I would really like to see the Constantine from Idol make his own CD. Now that one I would buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Rock & Roll band","review":"I am a big fan of Rock & Roll music and I am a big fan of this band. I heard them play long before I even knew who Cnstantine was, at a little club in NYC.

I had a feeling it was all about the American Idol hype, but I loved Constantine so figured I'd trust in him, at least. I also bought Bo Bice's CD which is simply wonderful, so I figured Constantine's would be just as nice.Oh my God. This is horrendous. It sounds like a bunch of guys just jamming in their garage. It is very ill-timed on drums and riffs, all over the place. It is absolute garbage. Don't waste your money. Wait for Constantine to put something out on his own. His band stinks, and has obviously just used Con's 15 minutes to make their own 15 minutes, which they do NOT deserve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's be real","review":"After hearing this attempt at rock, it's rather disappointing. I realize that I will probably offend most of the world when I say this but Constatine's band is more of an American idol than he is. Growing up in the music industry and producing my own albums I've heard talent and the band has that. But the vocals lack. Next all of you that hate me by now will say that I'm jaded. Not true otherwise I'd be trying to sell you my CD's. I suggest anybody who just loves Constantine buy this album. Anyone who loves music stay away from it otherwise you just promote more bad music. Constantine go to the theatre where you belong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talentless poseur","review":"I can't beleive so many people bought into Constantine's shtick! He tries way too hard here. This isn't any different than any of the other recyclable hard rock acts like Godsmack that get shoved down our throats. I'm glad he is off Idol-just seeing him ham it up each week and seeing all of the teenage girls out there lap it up made me want to vomit!

The quality only enforces the belief of some, that the band rushed this project while constantine was on the show. They knew the bus was leaving without them.

I was terribly disappointed with this CD, however. There is little evidence of the strong voice & charismatic singing on this CD. It's very grunge; very Nirvana meets Nine Inch Nails, and fails to be original or exciting. I think these pieces must have been recorded a long time ago, before Constantine developed a sense of personal style & identity (at least I hope so.) It's not bad for it's type of music, but is't not amazing, either, and simply does not show case the amazing voice Constantine posesses, or any particular grace or talent of the musicians.I hope Constantive breaks out, soon, and makes his own CD, or that the band really finds Betty's soul, if they keep working together. I found this CD to be soulless..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pray for the soul of WHAT!?","review":"This is by far one of the crappiest albums I have ever listened to. The sound was rushed.

The same person must have one of the following hobbies: 1 glue sniffing 2 being a pretty good relative to constantine.I gave one star. One star for fooling people into letting him create a cd.

Why the hell is Amazon putting them in the same category as all the other American Idol (..) So what if Constantine was on A.I., Betty's music is nothing like what you see on the show, it's great raw alternative power, my personal favs are Truck Stop Sally, Rich (...)and Some Of My F'd Up World, which is an almost straight up STP tune.

The problem is I could barely hear him. The bass is way too loud. The guitarrist is ho-hum and the drummer is (barely) so-so.The whole CD feels underproduced; this sounds like the demo CDs bands peddle around to labels in order to get signed, rather than a finished product.

A bit to hardcore for a debut albumn. Maybe payback for not getting further in AI, I really think he can sing and does have talent, when he did David Cassidy's I THINK I LOVE YOU, it was a good take on a old 70's song. Then when he did Queens Bohmeian Rhaposdy it sent shivers down my bones, (no Freddy) but not bad. Sorry this is just a disappointment, better luck next cd.

The music is dated, derivative, watered down grunge with vapid, embarassing lyrics.The people calling this the best CD they have ever owned are simply members of the band's street team on orders from Betty bassist Craig to spam this site with faux positivity. This is a two-star Alice in Chains rip-off at best, a money-grubbing cash-in on Constantine's newfound fame at worst.Constantine escaped the obscurity he was destined for as Betty front man with his run on American Idol, but if he doesn't leave this garage band he will be forgotten after all. Don't encourage him to stay, Constantine fans. Save your money and support his solo efforts instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haven't listened to anything else since I got it!","review":"Seriously. The beats are addicting and are worthy of cranking it up full volume. If you are looking for Constantine's version of \\"My Funny Valentine\\", this is not for you - but if you pass it up, YOU'RE CRAZY! This CD is fresh & original and will leave you wanting more. When I played it for some of my co-workers, they were pleasantly surprised after only the first couple of seconds - \\"Hey, that sounds pretty good - I wasn't expecting it to be that type of music.

Clearly something happened during the intervening years. Whereas Beattie's early fiction was full of odd characters, delightful non-sequiters, and brilliant dialogue, PICTURING WILL is dull, dull, dull. The characters are totally bland and whereas a muscular plot might have fleshed them out more, there is no plot to speak of. Beattie looks at the lives of character and explains, explains, explains; she doesn't DRAMATIZE. This tendency not to dramatize was brilliantly exploited in her earlier work, which recreated the ennui and anomie of her characters lives in prose that was razor sharp. PICTURING WILL is filled with none-too-original characters doing nothing much in prose that is lackluster and undistinguished. PICTURING WILL is so bad it makes ANOTHER YOU look distinguished."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring!","review":"this was required reading for LIT 101, and it was one of the most boring books i have ever read.

The only problem I found was if you hook up a cable input to the input of the Terk switch for locals it throws horizontal bars (slightly) rolling through the picture (mostly noticable when the screen goes black in between commercials). To solve the problem I injected the cable channels after the switch with a diplexer. There are also other switches that do the same thing as the Terk switch but I haven't tested any of them (AVI & ZINWELL.)I think the cable injection into the switch would be the same on these switches too.

DirecTv receivers see all 3 satellites and have the option to receive free HD TV from local towers. The BMS-58 switch works as a combiner routing all signals through 1 coax cable. This makes running cable cheaper. The diplexer then splits the signals at the DirecTv box. I also use this for TIVO with no issues.As some has stated... the unit does run hot. But not so hot that you can not touch it. I built up the mount 1 in. to allow air flow through the rear of the unit. I found that this makes the unit run slightly cooler.I also had to install a DC block on the off-air antenna input in order for DirecTv to receive. The manual does not state that.

Now and then the band sound a bit tentative, which is understandable given their youth & the fact that this is their debut. But this is one album no prog-rock fan should be without. Also, anyone who enjoys the music of Pink Floyd, Roger Waters, Kate Bush or Peter Gabriel. Outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even a great perfume house can come up with a stinker","review":"I have been collecting perfumes for 50 years.

A very good overview of coffee from it's beginnings to the present, and a real eye-opener on it's effect on world economy and politics over the centuries.

The illustrations and sidebar notes included fit in nicely.Perfect to accompany \\"un tinto\\", as they say in Colombia."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Opinions of an Opinionated Man","review":"For all those who have read and loved a Rushdie novel, Imaginary Homelands provides more of the same biting humor, insightful thoughts, and elegant prose as Rushdie shares with us his thoughts on everything from censorship to Stephen Hawking. A fair amount of time is spent on criticisms of various novels and authors and I, for one, found it fascinating to see what such an acclaimed author thinks of his peers. Given that this volume contains numerous essays, you will definitely want to pick and choose what to read and will probably end up doing so over an extended period of time. But you must at least take the time to read a little. As always, Rushdie's language is beautiful and forthrightness admirable."},{"rating":"2","title":"lively essays that explain a lot","review":"These essays are interesting, if only because they tell us at long last what kind of mind could possibly have produced novels like _Midnight's Children_ and _The Satanic Verses_. The answer: a very playful, very thoughtful one. The essays and reviews here are not always very deep (sometimes they sound more like book reports than like reviews), but they always have a freshness and stylistic beauty that is enviable to say the least. There is a wonderful sense of humour at work here. Even the essays I disagree with I revisit now and then out of admiration for Rushdie's writing.That said, there are some pieces in here whose contents equal or surpass their forms. The Carver obit is sad and fitting, and the more personal essays are poignant insights into the author's condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eclectic Essays","review":"This is an excellent collection of mostly short pieces about a variety of subjects. From politics to religion to literature, Rushdie is well informed and opinionated. I found him particularly good on Islam and India. This kind of book is great for the gym or train, since most of the pieces are quite short. Two of the last pieces give his perspective on the fatwa that turned his life upside down after the publication of The Satanic Versus. I was intrigued to see that he regrets delaying the paperback publication version for three years as a concession to the Islamic radicals (I remember waiting for the paperback version so I could see what it was all about)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"What a product should be, not high performance but quality like oem works great and the product came on time and good packaging"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the Deed !!","review":"We use this stuff on our Bichon Frise.It works pretty good and agrees with him.Recommended !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Old Time Flick","review":"Watch this movie and you'll see why William Holden became known as an all around good guy as well as a Man's Man.

You care about these people in the movie.On first look, it was a shock at first to see William Holden this young. In this film, he looked about 19 and didn't even have the deep voice I was accustomed to hearing in his movies from the \`60s on. However, I've watched this three times and enjoyed it all three times, especially now that it finally came out on DVD in late 2007. No problems with the transfer, either.I didn't recognize Lee J. Cobb, either, who played Holden's father, a Jewish man with a beard. Barbara Stanwyck, meanwhile, played her typical role: tough gal with a soft heart underneath. Yeah, boxing fans might find a few credibility problems but overall, this is a good story and well-acted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Music","review":"The only thing I have to say about this CD is GREAT!!

I got a chance to see her live in Dec '04 and she sang a couple of the songs from the album and it was awesome! Vanessa's voice is stronger than ever and the music arrangements on the CD are rich and powerful. My favorites are 'Never Can Say Goodbye', Midnight Blue', 'Send One Your Love', & 'One Last Bell To Answer'. There is a lot of jazz & soul with a hint of pop in the mix. This is the best album I have purchased so far in '05!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawless Pop album","review":"It is as if Vanessa never stopped recording! She is in step from where she left off. Even though this is an album of covers of her favourite love songs of the '70, Vanessa has the unusual ability to take nearly any song & make it her own, which she does! Thankfully, these songs are moderate to lesser-known songs, so this is not your oridinary covers album! I missed her Sophisticated style of doing pop music very much & I'm glad to see her back in top form. Listen to the sound samples. The first single (a cover of the Stylistics hit) \\"You Are Everything\\" is transformed into a smooth, sultry, romantic mid-paced ballad that makes you wanna get close that special someone in your life. Her voice is silky smooth & highly charismatic! The songs are romantic & sung with passion & wisdom. Among the Top 10 Diva albums of 2005 (I'd place \\"Everlasting Love\\" in the Top 5)! This album will satisfy the long-time Vanessa fan and even music lovers new to her work!

I can barely keep my eyes open when this music comes on, because it is so tepid. She has a great voice, but she interjects absolutely no emotion into these songs. It irks me, because it could have been so much better than it is. She picked great songs to cover, but they are songs that need life breathed into them, not songs that should just be song note for note, which is pretty much what is going on here."},{"rating":"1","title":"after dinner Kool-Aid Music","review":"I have always dug Vanessa Williams but nobody has truly done Her vocal range Justice IMO.

The look would be very expensive to achieve, and the book doesn't cater for real-life \\"not so big\\" circumstances, like how to deal with small blocks of land with neighbouring dwellings close by (e.g. terrace houses).

In the unique blend of keen observations of naturalist and hunter, of ruminations on literary pursuits, and of environmental activism, Bass paints most intricate tapestry on narrative. One of best nature writings. One of the best appeal for preservation of our vanishing wilderness. Let us all hope that somewhere in our government there is a reader who will be touched by grace of this book and be compelled to act."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully original - Originally beautiful","review":"Rufus is not your typical MTV fare. His dreamy melodies and harmonies drift you off into a world full of chaos and lust. Wonderful orginal combination of classical motifs, modern poetry and drunken piano and vocal performances.

Track 4 is my favorite, if you like that one, then you'll love the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a CD you have to buy!","review":"I first heard Rufus Wainwright on NPR. I was immediately taken by his sound and his story. I bought the CD and I haven't been able to get it out of my head since. I can't descirbe it, really. But it is some jazz, some honkey-tonk, some rock and a lot of blues. The lyrics are witty and intelligent-and a little bit curious. The melodies are hauntingly addictive and he is a genious on the piano. He reminds me a little of Randy Newman but the sound is almost from another era. You will not be disappointed after you hear Danny Boy and Matinee Idol."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Essential CD!","review":"Rufus is the best songwriter working today, yet he's relatively unknown. Poses, his second CD, is an easier introduction- this CD can get a bit slow for mainstream taste, but this CD contains THE BEST and catchiest song written in the last decade, April Fools. Nevertheless, all of the songs are brilliant, but be prepared to spend a little time to get to know them. Most of them grow on you as opposed to instantly embedding themselves in your brain, although April Fools with win you over from the first note."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetic and peaceful","review":"I bought this CD on impulse after listening to less than one song and immeidately loved it.

I loaned it to a friend who loved it.\\"It's yours!\\" I said.I'm glad it found a good home because it was destined for the garbage can.

People seem to think that Roofie has some type of Tom Waits, Randy Newman thing going, but.....he doesn't. Oh god, this is very bad. My fiance (who usually has great taste) loves the song April Fools and has forced me on countless occasions to listen to Roof-Dog's inane stupidness. April Fools is a very bad, whiny, annoying song that seems to never end. It's still the best song on the album, though. He tinkers at the piano like some highschool new-age-folkie wannabe.

The sad thing is that the music is actually pretty good, but the unbelievably grating voice of Wainwright ruins it on every track. He sounds like PeeWee Herman after generous dosing with Haldol.

Rufus Wainwright's self-titled album holds a sense of personal expression that is very touching while having universal appeal in both musical styles and lyrical content. His idealized concept of love is truly romantic while wild analogies and melodies give an ancient concept new flare.

I don't agree with the previous review, which claims that \\"Rufus Wainwright\\" is full of droning, downcast melodies. Songs like \\"April Fools\\", which is something I never seem to tire of, \\"Foolish Love\\", \\"Millbrook\\", \\"Beauty Mark\\", and \\"Matinee Idol\\" all have upbeat melodies and somewhat playful, though meaningful lyrics. I think said reviewer got his or her albums mixed up...\\"Poses\\" is the much more mellow album of the two. I am unable to choose a favorite song on this album. It would have to be a 12 way tie.

So much for naivete."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and boring","review":"This is not one of those great cds you can listen to from beginning to end. You'll find yourself skipping to the next song over and over again, and then you'll find out you're at the first song again. The songs are droning and are extremely boring. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting and Uplifting - both at the same time","review":"I bought this CD after I had purchased the second one (upon a friend's recommendation). I wish I had known about this CD back in 1998, when it was still new. Rufus showed incredible talent, both in composition, and in lyrics. Two standout songs for me are 'Barcelona' and 'Sally Ann'. Both of these songs evoke a sense of dreaming and longing and hope, that you normally don't hear in a typical pop song.As an openly gay man, his songs speak to the experience that I want to hear - what it is like to be young and gay. I truly believe that Rufus Wainwright will achieve great things; this CD is a testament to his potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"HAUNTINGLY BEAUTIFUL","review":"Rufus Wainwright's stunning debut is nothing short of one of the greatest albums of the 90's. The music is hauntingly beautiful, evoking tin-pan alley and Randy Newman-esque melodies with beautiful orchestrations and fantastic production. One of the most expensive debuts ever, Rufus apparently recorded over 50 tracks and edited down to these remaining classics, including the jaunty single \\"April Fools,\\" the lovelorn \\"In My Arms,\\" and the dark \\"Barcelona,\\" easily the greatest track on the album (and there isn't a bad track on it). The Japanese import features a GREAT bonus track, \\"A Bit of You,\\" and is well worth the extra bucks. Too bad we can't hear more of the deleted tracks (HINT: Dreamworks, why not a limited edition box-set of all the studio sessions??? We Rufus fans would die to have them!!!). Can't wait for \\"Poses\\" - had to buy \\"Moulin Rouge\\" and \\"Shrek\\" to get me prepped for it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"will be considered a classic in 10 years time","review":"You know all the greatest works have had their detractors. I guess it's because they challenge the listener. Rufus' album is masterpiece, yet one cannot fully absorb or appreciate after one or 2 listens. This album actually demands the listener's attention in this world of quick edits and MTV. Rufus has an amazing voice some incredible lyrics and great arrangements from Van Dyke Parks who has worked his magic before with Brian Wilson. See him live and you'll find out why he is going to be big."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Cup of Tea","review":"For me, Rufus was not an acquired taste - I loved his voice and his songs the first time I heard them a little less than a year ago. In fact, I literally listened to nothing else for a month after buying the CD, and I still play it several times a week. My only complaint is that I've been waiting a year for his second CD! In today's fragmented music scene, I suppose it's not surprising to see the negative reviews on this page. I'm sure they don't understand my enthusiasm any more than I understand their disdain. I'd suggest that anyone who was interested enough to come to this page should give Rufus a listen, because if you like his stuff at all there's a good chance he'll become a favorite, as he has for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"overproduction","review":"\\"Anything worth doing is worth overdoing.\\" Incredible melodies are lost in the cacophonous herky jerky, merry-go-round, overproduction. How much more beautiful would \\"Foolish Love\\" be if it were stripped down so one could actually hear the melody. Instead it is a barrage of eight voice thick harmonies with 3,082 simultaneous countermelodies. \\"Beauty Mark\\" nearly hits the mark but as soon as a melody one can hold on to emerges rufus rips it from the hands with a drastic time change. Rufus never met a note he wouldn't sing until his face turns blue. A little stacato would help. Most songs take ages to unwind...they are so deeply wrapped up in instrumetation and vocals..that rufus slowly deconstructs them at the end as if to say...\\"This is all of the stuff that was underneath there...see?\\" With such a talent for songwriting! Every note need not be massaged as if it were the last. take it easy next time. Every song doesn't have to be the swansong."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell is everybody talking about?","review":"This is the most over rated album of 98. Its melodramatic sap. He's a male Celine Dion! Get over yourself, Rufus."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are you all talking about?","review":"I saw Mr. Wainwright on the \\"Late Show\\" and honestly, I was waiting for Paul Schaffer to stop the performance and tell us all that it was a joke! With voices such as Joni Mitchell, Dylan, Indigo Girls, etc. I really don't see how this compares. I can only speak of the live performance, but I found the tone of his voice to be harsh and unappealing, his pitch was mediocre at best, and melodically he left much to be desired. Is anyone listening to this man's voice? It's terrible!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dreary Litany of Sleepy Moans and Groans","review":"After hearing (and loving) Wainwright's latest effort (Poses), I ran out and bought this CD in the hope that it would reflect an earlier but equally good collection of songs. What a disappointment! With only one exception, this CD is replete with extremely dreary, monotonous, uninspired, sleepy melodies. (When I read some of the other reviews, I can't help but wonder if I listened to the same CD that they're talking about.) Wainwright, whose style and delivery remind me of Peter Allen's, shines when the melodies lift and shift (as they do on most cuts from POSES) to take advantage of his sometimes whiny but unique voice. But on this CD, most of the songs are dark, boring dirges, exacerbated by the singer's morbid droning."},{"rating":"1","title":"By love or sih-ih-ick-ness...","review":"\\"Is that a Billy Joel song?\\" \\"No, I think it's the Partridge Family.\\" (true conversation)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Charming Debut.","review":"Rufus's first cd is quite great, its the last one i listened to by him and well, i must say its my least favorite, which isnt saying much in the way of how much i enjoy Wainwright's albums.

They are the thinnest tarps I have ever seen. I ended up buying a good silver tarp just in case and then using this blue tarp on top of the other. In less than 4 weeks you can already see through the blue tarp and it has the stretch marks that you usually see after 12-18 months. We have not even had any bad weather yet. I doubt the blue trap will survive the first good storm. The blue tarp is also already shedding little blue pieces, the type of deterioration that one usually sees at the end of a tarps life. Unfortunately I bought two of these.

The core of the hard-workin' all-star Blues Brothers Soul, Rhythm & Blues and Blues Revue are alive and kicking on this album.The only slow spot on this disc is Belishi's rendition of Guilty, but it is done with such passion that it is forgiveable. The highlights of the album are Belushi's version of Do You Love Me by the Contours that rivals the original (with a little James Brown thrown in for good measure), and Paul Schaeffer's masterwork of Booker T's Green Onions, and it feels like Duck Dunn and Steve Cropper never missed a beat in all those years.The album is over all too quickly, and it is with this reluctance that it doesn't deserve a full 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Know It's Only Rock-n-Roll","review":"There is no doubt, the Blues Brothers was a great live performance. With an all-star band backing them, Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi could take off on a romp through classic songs recorded by legendary artists that were dusted off from the back pages of pop culture.Recorded at the Universal Amphitheatre in Los Angeles, California, and released in December 1980, the 10 cuts - which clock in slightly over 30 minutes - is a high-energy tribute to the music which is the backbone of rock-n-roll.The commercial success was fleeting, as Made in America peaked at number 49 on the Billboard album chart, while the only single, Who's Makin' Love, stalled in the 39th slot in Billboard's Top 40. But it remains an excellent representation of Joliet Jake and Elwood Blues educating the audience, as much as having fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Their Best Album","review":"\\"Made in America\\" is not one of my favorite Blues Brothers albums. One reason why is that the songs in this CD are not their number one hits. Some of these include the \\"Perry Mason Theme,\\" \\"Riot in Cell Block #9,\\" and \\"Going Back to Miami.\\" Besides the bad song list, the CD sounds crystal-clear. If you are looking for a really good Blues Brothers album, I'd suggest the \\"Briefcase Full of Blues\\" and the \\"Blues Brothers Movie Soundtrack.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the best!!","review":"I love The Blues brothers!!

I thought, I was in a bar hearing macho beer drinking fight stories and not reading about martial arts. It wasn't a good read, nor informative about martial arts or zen. I don't recommend this book at all. It doesn't properly portray karate or zen at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Budo or brutality","review":"I found this to be a disheartening book. Although the author's descriptions of the intensity he brings to his training (and fighting) are amazing, most of the book represents, to me, the dark side of the martial arts. Sabat's highest view of spirituality seems to be the degree to which he can endure physical privations, that he never loses a sparring match or fight and that he shows no mercy. Although the samurai, his apparent models, are to be respected for their training and fighting intensity and prowess, they serve as poor models for a citizen of the 20th century. Their ethics never rise higher than \\"honor,\\" expressed in doing only what is good for me or my \\"tribe\\" (family/clan/nation). Spirituality that doesn't ascend past \\"us vs. them\\" will only bring us more war and conflict."},{"rating":"1","title":"mostly about his ego not art","review":"I bought this book awhile ago because I thought it would be a good read, I found out my first insights aren't always right. I like the intensity in his training, but his ego almost took away from the whole book. Sabat makes himself out to be invincable and thats not what the arts are about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battles of a modern blow hard","review":"As a novice student of Hapkido, I was interested in reading this book because of the reference to Zen in the title. I was soon to learn that the book had little or nothing to do with Zen.

The editing was so poor that I am convinced that my nine year old daughter could do a better job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sabat the ignorant A-Hole","review":"Want to read a book about a dufus who likes to bully people with his meager martial art skills and lack of any buddhist enlightenment?

Also the title is very unoriginal and Sabat seems half-illiterate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumbest Martial Arts Book Ever?","review":"Stupid book supposedly about the silly subject of street fighting. But there are almost no street fights in it! Poorly written. If the author had trained in a Mixed Martial Arts gym and taken his beatings regularly via sparing, he probably would have been alot more humble than what he comes across in this book. Why the publisher went with this book is beyond me. Do not buy it. However, if you want an unwitting expose of alot of the things wrong with traditional martial arts, this would be a good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The fighting spirit and endurance of Karate","review":"Jack Sabat shoves a very brutal experience right into your face. His story starts during the Vietnam War, training for 2 years under the most savage and painful circumstances, practicing endlessly until bloody and injured. He demonstrates the indomitable attitude posessed by all the great Karate masters. This is not a mystic book, nor an intellectual one. It is in the vein of other great karate stories, where the author suffers tremendously seeking the enlightenment born of total commitment to success. Many other teachers have left record of their awesome endurance and one-pointed concentration on total mastery. This is the theme of Karate-do itself, that knowledge and wisdom come through the overcoming of great hardship. Zen and the Art of Streetfighting is a rough book, with harsh edges. Many martial artists will be challenged by it, forcing them to train ever more dilligently in the arts, and to dedicate themselves more totally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"This book is terrible. Jack Sabat is a sado-masochist. This book details the various ways he tortures himself and his students in training. There are occasional moments where something worthwhile is written. Unfortunately, they are few and far between. Basically Mr. Sabat brags about the pain he has endured and the pain he has inflicted on others. I came to despise him so much that I found myself hoping he would be defeated in the fights he describes. Take my advice and spend your money elsewhere. C.W. Nicol's book Moving Zen is a far better choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameful","review":"This \\"Street Fighter\\" only recounts stories of fights in Dojos. Mostly with people who are already intimidated into believing that he can't be beaten. That's half the battle. I'll bet dollars to donuts that if the author ever has the misfortune to be attacked in the street he will be shot or stabbed before he even realizes it is a fight.Vietnam was a vastly more comfortable war on an aircraft carrier.He visited the Phillipines to learn Karate. Obviously Filipinos don't have any worthwhile arts of their own.I won't even start on the childish understanding of Zen. Hint: Satori is not a psychosis.For a genuine look at the mental/spiritual side of Karate try C.W. Nicol's \\"Moving Zen\\".The truly regrettable thing is that this person is a teacher, therefore the culture of bad manners and dishonesty toward strangers, has been passed down to another generation, tarnishing the cultural treasure that is budo.Give your ten bucks to charity.

For those who have attained the rank of Black Belt and now feel that their training is complete, this book shows that your training never ends, it is only abandoned by those not ready for the task set before them. I hope that those who read ZEN AND THE ART OF STREET FIGHTING will look at the harsh (and often crude) style that the author chooses to write with, and view it as the symbolism that it is. A symbolism that was not meant for a beginner to understand, but for those who would see themselves as \\"masters.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Open minded","review":"This books takes you into true life. What budo is truly about, self knowledge. This book discribes his quest for self inlightenment, and must be understood that way.

He has trained great fighters such as Sensei \\"The Iceman\\" Chuck Liddell (UFC contender), and Sensei Tony Bacerra (national champion in Karate). I cannot stress enough that when you read this book you understand the point I have made that it is about HIS quests/trials. It may seem self centerd, but remember the book is about him.BTW he would win in most all fights on the street. He is a very powerfull fighter. Also...

Although made after the war, this is a Disney money-saving effort of that time which is much lesser now. In all honesty it's ironic that something which was once money saving has been turned around by the very same company to become money-making! HOWEVER, I love Disney and would say that those interested in the progression of Disney material would benefit. It wouldn't make a great long-term entertainer for children though."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best i have ever seen","review":"This melody time has the story of Johnny apple seed in a well liked and simple told eazy for my 5yr old to even understand.I also like the story of little toot , that teaches to be good.many newer disney film seem to miss the mark of old fastion truth.

A number of interesting clips - the wintertime one, the bumblebee one and johnny appleseed stand out. There are unfortunately an equal number of segments that seem to drag or are incredibly dated: the trees and the samba segments come to mind.However, the worst thing about this particular DVD is that the Pecos Bill segment has been obviously edited from the original to remove a cigarette from Pecos Bill. This seems the height of hypocrisy - plenty of new Disney films have no such resistance to cigarettes appearing onscreen. This version of the film stands as a bad example of spineless political correctness for no reason that benefits the end product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disney Gold Classic","review":"I bought the DVD because it included the ballad of Pecos Bill. This was done with Roy Rogers and the Sons of the Pioneers back in the late 40s. The story is animated and narrated by Roy and the band with song and clever lyric. It is a great story and the music is pure western lore. It is interesting that it has been edited to make it politically correct meaning that Pecos Bill doesn't roll and smoke his cigarettes as he did in the original version. It is certainly a classic and enjoyable to have in DVD quality sound and picture.

It even occurs for books that are only related by their title and have completely different content (e.g. the Harold Bloom collection of criticism regarding All Quiet on the Western Front is presented as if it's an edition of that book). In this case (War and Peace), the Kindle edition is NOT the translation that's mentioned in the product description (Pevear and Volokhonsky). In fact, it's impossible to know who translated the Kindle edition, even after the file is downloaded (most likely it's the Aylmer and Shanks edition, produced early in the 20th century). While probably not intentional on Amazon's part (it's almost certainly the result of a sloppy database), the result is clearly false advertising.

Lots of characters to keep track of -- Tolstoy's characters are portrayed in terms of how their lives and viewpoints change over time and through their experiences, so you get to know and understand them quite well. A more intellectual theme that runs through the book is the notion that history is not really defined by the actions of specific hero figures (i.e, Napoleon or Kutuzov), but rather the collective actions of many people in a almost fatalistic sense. The end of the book is a somewhat repetitive essay on \\"what is history?\\" I can only assume that there was an academic argument going on over this question back in the nineteenth century.

She remembers people talking ABOUT Nick, but not Nick. She is also, in my opinion, a useless character. She has nothing to contribute to the team. Monroe can identify supernatural species. Rosalee can create antidotes for poisons and spells gone wrong. Juliette is a vet and should be able to contribute something to the mix, but the writers have no idea what to do with her.

Chai covers the Chinese government's reform efforts across several economic sectors, including agricultural, industrial, financial, trade liberalization and foreign direct investment. The chapter on non-state sector business fully rounds out Chai's portrait of the current state of the Chinese economy. We [...] recommend this fascinating book to anyone who wants a scholarly review of the economic issues facing China before, during and after market economy reforms. The better your knowledge of economics, the more useful this book will be to you, but even so, it will intrigue any reader who has more than a passing interest in China."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thorough overview of China's economic reform","review":"The research of J.C.H.

But he is a hell of a woodworker. I lucked out and bought this book at my local library's yearly book sale. I got it and four other related books for five bucks. I would buy it at full retail just for the jigs and sled diagrams. Some have complained that there are no measurements included, well how could there be? The idea of the book is to give you ideas for your own applications. I don't have the room for all the jigs shown in this book, nor would I ever use em all if I did.

The chapters are not very detailed and don't actually contain any directions for doing most of the cuts or processes. The most frustrating thing is where he will say \\"just use this very handy jig\\" and then gives a very crude drawing of the jig with no explanation of how to build it or even a basic layout. A MUCH better book is Kelly Mehler's The Table Saw Book."},{"rating":"2","title":"History of New York","review":"This an extremely well written book. It is written as a satire so I am not sure about the historical accuracy although I have read nothing to make me doubt it. It is written from the Dutch perspective which makes it interesting.

It examines 27 different styles, giving a brief description of the history of the style, training progressions, training methods, fighting strategies and free sparring. The only downfall of the book is that due to the wide range of styles discussed, it does not go into depth on any of the styles. However, once you obtain this background, you can then select books that are more in depth on a particular style. I enjoyed see the stylistic difference and learned some of the background of each style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but not everyone is in it","review":"This is a very good book about kali and Filipino martial arts.

Enjoy the movie like I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Military Thriller","review":"A great storyline and edge-of-your-seat action and suspense make U-571 a great military thriller that should not be missed by anyone. The storyline concerns a group of soldiers who embark on a dangerous submarine mission. Their mission being to capture a German Enigma sub in order to recover and decode German documents, is what makes the action satisfyingly suspenseful. This film does not sacrifice story for action, as is the case with most other films. Therefore, it is my opinion that U-571 is among my favorite films. The missing star is due to the soundtrack of the film; I would not reccomend buying the soundtrack because of the poor musical scorethat goes with the film. But that's just my opinion. Anyway, I highly reccomend this film to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"This movie is OK. It is not a good movie nor a bad movie.

You can take it or leave it."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"This movie is the best I ever seen in this type. The action is incredible. The sound effect is impressive.

This WW2 sub film had all the typical \\"sub\\" plots like running silent, taking it deeper, engineers fixing leaks, and sending up an oil slick and debris field including a dead body. The unusual twists were utterly unbelievable.Recommend U571 for a Net Flix rental and buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Stinkeroo","review":"Now that we've had a full generation of Americans who have not served in the armed forces, we're being subjected to foolish, overly-romanticized films like this.Supposedly based on fact, this silly flick focuses on the efforts of a Navy submarine crew to capture one of the top secret Enigma code machines from a German U-boat during WWII.The story of how the Allies cracked the Enigma code is a fascinating one, but you won't learn anything about it here. Instead you'll be subjected to the usual round of fiery explosions and machine gun fire that have come to characterize Hollywood films during the past 10 years -- no matter that they are historically and technically inaccurate. Add to that a wretched performance by Matthew McConaughey, who takes himself far too seriously, and you've got all the makings for a boring evening."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Great - That's All - True Excellence","review":"U-571 is by far the best submarine movie out there.Some criticize it for being inaccurate, take a listen to the director's commentary. Johnathon Mostow was very concerned about the accuracy of this film. I don't see how anyone can call it inaccurate, it isn't.As for the fans of Das Boot, there is one critical thing wrong with Das Boot, it's not the right way to portray German submariners. They were portrayed as good people fighting for the wrong cause, that isn't true - Nazi submariners were probably the most pro-Nazi of all German soldiers. They were very passionate about fighting and U-571 does a great job of portraying that angle - the correct one.If you're looking for an accurate portrayal of WWII, U-571 is it. It may not be factual, but that's ok - who cares - if you want facts, watch the Discovery Channel. It's full of action and suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing effort","review":"U-571 is a shallow rip-off of \\"Das Boot\\". The characters are not well developed, and the obvious references to \\"Run Silent, Run Deep\\" (personality clash between CO and XO, and the \\"dive! dive!\\" scene) don't come off. The theatre trailers suggested to us that the American crew in the German sub (which ran pretty well and looked amazingly ship-shape inside for having been all shot up in the seizure of the Engima) had to get through Allied combatants to get back to safety. Overall, a very disappointing treatment of an interesting premise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another action movie","review":"If you like action movies where reality is suspended then this is one for you. Lots of shooting, big and colourful explosions, bad guys doing the dirty and being shot, and so on. If you get frustrated by movies where the good guys shoot five for every one that the bad guys shoot, then save your money - or buy 'Das Boot'. The 5:1 rule seems to apply whether it's hand guns, naval guns or torpedoes. The unreality extends to the ships taking part, the accuracy of gunfire, the damage that results, and the physical impossibility of some of the disasters that strike, and the heroic actions that recover from them. As if that wasn't enough, the script is apalling, although the actors make a 'heroic' attempt to make it work. I can't believe anyone would think this is reality, and nobody should be getting upset that it doesn't do justice to the sailors who did the real work. It's simply using a couple of tidbits from history to create a typical Hollywood crash-and-bang action movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic try of depicting WW2 special submarine operation","review":"Regardless of the well known fact that Americans are always lucky in whatever they do (e.g. not one single torpedo dud in the whole film), we are again shown why the Germans lost the war. There are way too many scenes in which lucky fortune counts for the film heroes and again the always incapable Germans. The atmosphere in \\"Das Boot\\" (1981) is much more intense. My vote is 1 out of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOW ARROGANT AND IGNORANT CAN YOU GET?","review":"The enigma machine was discovered by the BRITISH - not American's. Robin Hood was British, not an American, so on and so on. Why does Hollywood feel it needs to take British Hitory and fables, and twist it round or make it ridiculously inacurate so that gullible people think it's therefore part of American history? Come on people, I know America is a new country, but make your own history instead of trying to steal ours, we wouldnt try to say president Linoln was actually British, sheesh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pale shadow of Das Boot","review":"The HD DVD is a very fine transfer, and the audio is great. That said, this movie follows in the fine tradition of Hollywood doing a lame imitation of a great foreign film.Where Das Boot strove for claustrophobia, along with a sense of humanity, U-571 delivers a story full of explosions but devoid of accuracy or emotion. In the end, you don't really care who lives or dies.That kind of says it all, except that if you're interested in naval realism, don't expect if from torpedo shots that make miraculous hits, and depth charges that pop every second for, oh, it seems like minutes. And the back of the German \\"destroyer\\" seemed to look a lot like the low rounded back of a tugboat, which was odd as the destroyer in the combat sequence looked credible."},{"rating":"1","title":"U-57...1 star!","review":"I REALLY didn't like this movie! It was about 30 minutes too long for what it had to offer. And besides it's special effects and talented cast that isn't much. I not only dislike it for the fact that it is boring, but it is not historically accurate which has hurt some other recent films like The Patriot and Perfect Storm. For better submarine films, check out The Hunt for Red October or Crimson Tide. For U-571, wait for cable or just skip it altogher. Not worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fill that distorts completly history","review":"This one of those films that distorts completly history. A US crew gets an Enigma machine and break the German World War II codes. This is false, the British with some help from the Poles broke the Enigma and the German codes. Hollywood must not produce this type of movies that have nothing to do with reality and are clearly a lie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to select choices on menu","review":"It's impossible to select choices on menu : letters appear but not the cursor to select choices. How is that possible ? (European Zone 2 version)"},{"rating":"1","title":"See Das Boot instead","review":"It's a submarine movie. It's wet, horrible,and they get depth charged. The plot is pretty farcical, the much discussed Enigma is dispensed with in 30 seconds flat, but the cardboard-cutout characterisation is pitiful; That bridegroom isn't going to get home to his new wife, gritty captains talking of the need to gain command experience are clearly planning an early retirement, and any keen youngsters called \\"Trigger\\" are guaranteed a place showing up The Futility Of War. Matthew McConaughey was less wooden as his previous role in a submarine movie; playing Troy Tempest in Stingray. As a Brit crypto-geek, I expected to be horrified by the disrespect shown to Bletchley Park. It's pure fiction though, and so far from any credibility that I didn't care. The use of a US Navy seaplane in the closing scene over the Western Approaches though, rather than a Coastal Command Sunderland from Pembroke Dock, did strike me as a little disrespectful though, and for no valid plot reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"o brother... hollywood needs a history lesson","review":"This film, U-571, will attempt to fool you into believing that American sailors were the ones who captured the Enigma machine, when in fact it was really the British who accomplished that feat. This just goes to show that Hollywood doesn't treat history with respect. Why couldn't they just have used British actors in the film? Why does everything Hollywood produce have to be americanized? And this is increasingly devestating when a lot of people today regard films like this as history. I once read a customer review of THE PATRIOT where the film was hailed as an historic lesson. Please! Read a book! Hollywood has got to start treating history with respect. If you want to see a fantastic submarine film, see Wolfgang Petersen's DAS BOOT. U-571 is just another Hollywood blunder, that's all about getting the numbers up at the box office."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining!","review":"After reading some of the reviews, I have to tell my opinion on this movie.I watched Das Boot after I saw this movie because of all of the people saying it was not that good, you should see Das Boot, It's more realistic and historically correct. Well, Das Boot was more realistic, which made it boring at some points. Historically correct, yes, but who cares. If I wanted to watch something about history I would watch Das Boot or the history channel, and U-571 never claimed to based on a true story. Das Boot did have its moments, but far fewer then the boring parts.U-571 was all action, non stop. Very entertaining to watch, I even watched it three more times within one week. The fx are spectacular, and it always kept you wondering how they would get out of their situation. I recommend this to be part of anyone's DVD or VHS collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Das Boot 2? Not quite","review":"If you've seen Wolfgang Petersen's harrowing tale of the brutal reality of submarine combat in World War Two, you probably either loved it for its spot-on realism or wished it had been a little more entertaining and less intent on having the same phsychological effect on the audience as on the crew. U-571 is for those of you in that second group. It is an intense, perfectly-paced thriller whose only real \\"flaw\\" is that it is somewhat unrealistic in terms of historical effects. You could cut the air (water?) with a knife during the action sequences, regardless of whether or not you take into account the unlikelyhood of the whole thing. Good acting and casting all around, to boot. I'm also sure that the movie will benefit from the crisp DVD format. A tad cliched, but sure to appeal to thrill-seekers (if not to you nit-picking realism buffs)."},{"rating":"2","title":"U-571","review":"A really good action thriller that will keep you entertained throughout. I would have given it a little higher rating had the movie not relied so heavely on hollywood \\"this guy pulls something off at the last minute to save the day\\" action. Many of the bonus features are entertaining as well, especially if you've served any time as a submariner Sailor (I've been one for 23 years). If there are any other submarine Sailors or just action/adventure movie fans out there, go ahead and put this one in your shopping cart."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best of its kind.","review":"I am anxiously awaiting the DVD release of the relentlessly suspenseful WWII Submarine Adventure, U-571. I saw this film in theaters, and have since decided that it is one of the greatest adventure films of recent years. The performances are exeptional and loyal to their era. The charcters are multi-dimensional, and the suspense is nearly unbearable.Sound plays an unusually key role in the full enjoyment of this movie, and the DVD release of this film should prove a worthy addition to the collection of Dolby Digital enthusiaists. The scenes involving the depth-charges in particular rely heavily on the use of rear speakers for full dramatic effect, and with the a good sound system, should improve the intensity of these nail-biting moments tenfold."},{"rating":"1","title":"hear me out a quick sec","review":"I mean it really is, there's nothing else you can say. Am I right? I mean, am I right on this one? Is this movie a joke or what?

Can you please forget about all that other stuff and just explain that to me for a quick sec?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Film, Some Inaccuracies, But Good","review":"This film follows a team of WW-II American submariners who are attempting to capture a German U-Boat and secure it's enigma machine.As some reviewers have pointed out, this film has some inaccuracies. True, the first of several enigma machines to be captured during the war was capture by the british in 1941. It was also true that the depth charge scenes in the film weren't exactly accurate of a depth charge attack, but necessary to the film's gritty feel. These things make for a good Hollywood film, not really a documentary.I enjoyed the film overall, but because of the inaccuracies, couldn't give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messing with History","review":"Sorry, I just can't enjoy a film that messes with history to the extent that this title does. The mission in the film was nothing to do with the US - those were BRITISH sailors risking their lives to capture the coding machine, some years before America even joined WW2!As a Brit myself, I find this re-writing of history to be in extreme bad taste!

To even draw comparisons between these two movies is absolutely ridiculous. Where Das Boot is a gripping human tale of the tragedy of war, U-571 is just more Hollywood tripe.If you just want 'splosions and escapism, I guess U-571 does the trick.If you want a realistic sub movie that will haunt you for many nights to come, go with Das Boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Nearly As Bad As Reviews Suggest","review":"For a person who is not crazy about Matt McConaughey's acting ability, I actually thought this was a pretty good movie. The English reviewers are correct that the Brits/Polish actually found the \\"enigma\\" machine first, but the end credits show that on a third mission, Americans also came up with a piece of the puzzle. So yes the film took some liberalities when devising the mission and its importance for America's wartime efforts. They probably should have portrayed a British sub, but marketing concerns most likely nixed this approach. Historical inaccuracies aside, the film was suspenseful, intelligent and entertaining. The special effects made everything seem pretty realistic and didn't detract from the film. Maybe Kietel seemed miscast for his part, but younger people often have higher ranking than their elders, especially if they went to Annapolis. Overall a good film."},{"rating":"2","title":"U571","review":"This is a thrilling rendition of how we cracked the German U boat codes! This is a very interesting movie!

Definitely a great addition to my movie collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Certainly NOT Embarrassing!!","review":"Great special effects, and great acting. Matthew McConaughey gave a very moving performance, and his best since 'A Time To Kill'. His character went from an officer with a chip on his shoulder because he didn't get a promotion, to proving himself most capable to command a sub during a crisis. Every detail might not be exactly as it was in the real war, but it was very entertaining and I recommend it. So what, if Britian captured the coding machine more times than Americans. I believe they were on our side!! All that mattered was that it was captured for the allies. GREAT MOVIE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm very, very angry.","review":"It is typically American to sacrifice historical truth on the altar of financial gain, and that is exactly what this film does. Ignoring the fact that the single action that saved an estimated one million lives in WWII was perpetrated by the British Navy, it is of course the US navy that has to save the day. It is not enough that the DVD states the historical truth after the film has finished. This is hugely disrespectful to servicemen, and an embarassing display of crass ignorance. Once again, Hollywood has presented a bastardised version of history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just to run this through with you","review":"Im thinking about making a movie called '9-11', featuring prominent British actors, where canary wharf tower and MI6 HQ are destroyed by hijacked airliners.

Appaling as it is, one reviewer pointed out that the true story was less than interesting which is an interesting point. A far more interesting side to the Enigma story on the other hand, was that of the work done at Bletchley Park in England to crack the Enigma code. Where contary to US opinion the first Computer was developed I beleive it was named Collosus 1. I bring this to your attention as I recently watched a facinating TV documentary on the subject. I would suggest that a film about this story would not require historical inaccuracies to entertain a film audience. If such a film exists then I would be pleased to know. I doubt however that Hollywood would stoop so low as to tell a story where the victory is not American. PS I also watched Heavan & Earth recently and this film begins to fulfill that brief. I recommend it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disrespectful","review":"In my opinion, the film disrespects the REAL man and women involved.

Do you think you would like it? enough said!I am American and love History but find it upsetting when hollywood makes films but dosent give the credit to anyone other that the Americans.

As with all American blockbusters the Americans were depicted as the clean-cut, good looking 'nice guys' and the Germans were shown as the scruffy in-breeds. I am sick of these movies, therefore U-571 did not go down very well. There is also a few historically incorrect pieces of information displayed in this movie.1. The Americans were not involved in war during this time. 2. The British were the ones that captured the enigma machine.Overall. i did not really enjoy this movie as it was hard to follow, boring, historically incorrect and American.PS. Do not see tomb raider........big waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"U-571; History or Mystery","review":"The film U-571 is as entertaining and captivating as any other product of hollywood. But when look at from a historical point of view, its inaccuracies and misrepresentations are sky high. Not two minutes of the film can pass without sign of hollywoods ignorance of the events that took place in the race to capture the enigma code machine. Even someone with little historical knowledge can identify innacurracies through nothing more than common sense. It is shocking that the writer and director of the film can portray the events with such imprecise detail and show such disrespect to the men who lost their lives in these events of WWI.

I rate it 4 out of ten."},{"rating":"1","title":"spitting on the graves of the RNs war dead","review":"This travesty of a film really takes the biscuit.Despite what many US reviewers say, films like this form attitudes and opinions in their viewers.Thanks to U-571 many people now believe that the USN secured an enigma machine and saved the free world from Nazism. What rubbish!!!!!The RN captured the machines, and we had to tell the USN how to run its anti u-boat campaign.Make a film about that.When you take your history and distort it, like in the patriot you just make yourselves look stupid.When you steal someone elses glory you just look like you are desperate for the world to look up to you.The Yanks CAN make really good war films- The Thin Red Line, Saving Private Ryan and Black Hawk Down were all superb, this disgusting rubbish should be scrapped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Garbage","review":"This movie was based on the capture of a U - boat during WWII by the Royal Navy who recovered its Enigma machine and prevented the crew informing the Kriegsmarine (Nazi navy) HQ.As well as historical inaccuracy the acting is hopeless and the sub - plots totally unbelievable.

I think some of the other reviewers of this movie have forgotten that this was fiction based on reality. This paticular event never did occur but it very well could've.

I'll just add a few observations as well.* Submarines of the time did not have the capability to conduct sub to sub combat while submerged. I think they got this confused with Hunt for Red October.* You wouldn't see a German Destroyer alone that far from the coast.* If we needed to break the code - I'd assume they didn't know the code - yet they knew that a German Sub was in trouble.* The enigma machine was a good catch (which the British actually accomplished) but it was the code books that were the real key.* German plane would have been incapable of reaching that scene.* Etc....For a real underwater classic, Das Boot is the only choice you need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remember that it is only FICTION","review":"Treat this movie as the fiction it is, and enjoy it.

The film combined significant historical inaccuracy with a series of very clumsy rip offs of the dramatic high points of the film Das Boot.

Everything in this movie explodes in a blinding flash of gasoline. The sinking of the German destroyer is arguably the greatest departure from realism.The plot is weak and far too predictable, what passes for foreshadowing is so simplistic, a six-year-old recognizes it. In addition, there are far too many unexplained incidents, the worst of which occurs early in the movie when the U-571 is disabled by depth charges from the British Navy, and the sub has no choice but to surface. And guess what? Suddenly, the British Navy is nowhere to be seen! Of course, if realism were a concern, the sub would surface and be blown out of the water by the destroyer and the movie would be over.Don't buy this movie.

I guess the director decided that real war would not sell tickets. The movie is complete fantasy. The choice was made to use a few facts, which serves to confuse the audience.

Two days later, I found myself watching U-571 again. This time with the additional background information enjoyed it even more, observering more details missed in my initial viewing. What a high.

The movie looks authentic, excellent costume design. My only problems with the movie is the plot... Normally, when a movie has the enemy captain captured, there is a reason... not in this one. also, the ending was exciting enough, but WHY did it end where it did...? It seems to run out of steam at the end. 4 stars out of five for the authentic feel (even the actors maintain the same speach patterns and inflections of the old '40's movies) but minus one star for the 'why-did-it-end-there' type ending, and the non-use of the captured U-boat captain by whoever wrote the screenplay."},{"rating":"2","title":"U-571 the nazi killer submarine","review":"the movie was very good all it needed was more germens and much longer like as long as saving private ryan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"definitely worth a try","review":"There are a lot of critics who rightly point out the historical inaccuracies of this story, but let us not lose perspective...this was good entertainment. I liked the story, I liked the photography, and yes I liked the explosions and the effects. It kept me and my family entertained and that's a key element. Obvious comparisons to Das Boot by many reviewers missed the point that this is essentially a very different film. Das Boot was made in the same genre as \\"all quiet on the western front\\": an unglamorous and somber warning of the misery of war.

Yes, historically it is inaccurate but the themes of patriotism, courage and valor trascend that fact. The DVD version has interviews with actual participants of the engagement (British navy, not American)which brings the historical aspect into proper perspectiveFilms are ALWAYS adaptations and never truly historical, always being focused through the eyes of the director, and anyone who doesn't enjoy this film just because of the historical inaccuracies fails to understand the complexities of historical perspectives, as well as the adaptability of film making.

It is a bias film that would have had potential but it didnt. I didnt like it because it was boring and there was no suspense. An example of this is when there all dancing, about to go on the submarines. It lacked a the true storyline, and this is the main reason of the movies weakness. The that were bertrayed were very realistic, such as the germans and how they looked not as heroic as the americans. they looked like dogs, with smely underarms and they hadnt shaved for a few days. This was the main positive thought of the film. Overall it wasnt a great success, it was a fizzer meaning everyone thought it would be good and it turned out to be bad. i would give it a two out of five. I dont recommend seeing it.

Another historical fact, The real U571 was sunk off Ireland, by good old Aussies. Now to get onto the actual Movie. The movie was actually very boring, people in other reviews are talking about good \\"special effects\\", when it is all just good pyrotechnics. Not a good movie, don't see it, it should get a 1, but it bumped to 2 because of lots of explosions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't","review":"I really like the main plot of this movie, that us North Americans are unexpectedly pulled into a developing war. Despite the fact that there were subtitles, I ran into a few problems since I only speak English and Russian, and not German. The camera goes back and forth between the Americans and Germans so that the viewer has the entire point of view, which I don't like because it adds to predictability. Then, when the Americans take over the German sub, everything is said so technically and is confusing as all out. They could have made the sub engine gears more subtle, and focused on the battle, but they didn't.In conclusion, the first half was fairly good, but the rest is REALLY REALLY hard to sit through. Try \\"Crimson Tide\\". This is a no go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceitful plotline and full of submarine movie cliches.","review":"I was very disappointed in this film. The enigma codes were in reality recovered by the British sailors in surface ships and I am not aware of any heroic American mission to recover them. For a start the construction of American heroes on this theme seemed wrong. Then the plot began to drag as all the old submarine war movie cliches were rerun - the tension between CO and XO, the destroyer-submarine combat, the depth charges, the leaking pipes and the frightened faces of cocooned men hundreds of feet below the surface. The representation of the technology also wrankled me. The rate at which charges are dropped by destroyers would make the close succession of explosions near the sub impossible. Moreover, the closeness of those explosions at 200m depth would definitely have imploded the hull. Generally, a load of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless.....","review":"I was expecting a good old-fashioned action/war movie when I saw U-571, unfortunately the results weren't very good. It quickly falls short with a terrible script, awful acting, bad direction and an overly-long running time. The great cast which includes superstars Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton and Harvey Keitel even fail to make the film better.

Not that i am saying the the Germans where all well cut but there was not that bigger difference between the to opposing countries. For example the americans are all well shaven, well dressed and well stuck up themselves saying quotes like \\"this enigma machine will make or break the war\\" and \\"we are doing this for America\\" as they sail off into the sunset. but in comparresment not one German is shaven they all have scrappy cloths and are hidding at the depths of the sea. to end don't see it it messes with your mind"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to watch...","review":"Another product of Hollywood's \\"Karaoke Culture\\".

The lighting, camera angles and claustrophobic set are obviously inspired by DB. But the bigoted innacuracies (German submariners machine gunning helpless sailors) and absurd scenarios (an incredibly lucky stern shot sinks a destroyer in hot pursuit) put this ridiculous movie in its own category.

Since I saw Das Boot before, I was not as impressed with the part where the depth charges exploded around the sub. However, the movie still works for me. Conaughey did a good job here portraying an officer who was suddenly thrust into a job that he wanted so much, but was not well prepared for.

The Poles work was one of the most important, if not the most important victories of the war and it deserves recognition, obviously it won't get any recognition from this film.As for the film itself, well it's no Das Boot that's for sure, on a purely entertainment level it's not bad, but if you know you history you may be grinding your teeth through it.

And German losses in destroyers were so heavy in 1940 that they needed every last one they had for duties closer to home. Having the \\"milch cow\\" u-boat arrive to pick up the crew was not an unreasonable idea, but everything after that is just silly. WW2 submarine captains only wished enemy destroyers disintegrated like that after a single torpedo hit. Don't waste your time with this pulp fiction, go check out Das Boot or Run Silent, Run Deep instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad. Watch \\"Das Boot\\" instead.","review":"Historically laughable: Americans never did this. The British did in some ways. Why not tell the real story? Merely OK in the suspense department. In many ways plagiarizes Das Boot (e.g., depth charge scenes). Technically absurd: one single sub torpedo completely and instantly blowing up a destroyer (this is a crucial scene in the film)? Come on. Psychologically unrewarding. The human side of the main characters is underdeveloped. You have a German captain captured and then he plays almost no role in the entire plot? A lost opportunity. And so on. Only redeeming item: five-star actor Harvey Keitel, unfortunately in one of his weakest performances (not his fault: it's the script, stupid!) In short, if you are going to spend money on a submarine film, buy \\"Das Boot\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST","review":"This movie attempts to present itself as an historically based submarine adventure. Unfortunately, it is grossly inaccurate historically, to the point of being insulting;especially to the Brits. They seized an enigma device before we even entered the war. The submarine warfare is so over the top it's absurd. If you want to see crazy stunts and over the top action I'd recommend a good Bond film. If you want to see a great WW2 submarine flick, see Das Boot. Forget about this turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"The acting in this movie was alright at best. The special effects, well, most of them anyway, were passable. During the sinking of the allied sub, you could tell the actors were in a tank on some studio lot. In fact, the tank didn't even look like it was deep enough. Some of the characters were literraly squatting on the bottom of the tank so it would look like they were drowning.The story alomost made sense. It was, in fact, the British who originally captured Enigma, not the Americans. And the Brits didn't get the machine off a captured sub, either.The part that really, really, bugged me about the movie was the ending. (I won't give it away, but for those of you who have seen this movie) it seemed rather lazy to me. I wanted the dierctor to spend a few extra bucks and expand on the ending.This movie is entertaining enough if you don't have anything better to watch.For sub movies, however, I still prefer The Hunt For Red October and Crimson Tide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, solid movie despite the historical inaccuracies","review":"Although the Brits deserve the credit in this true story, they weren't around for test screenings. And, as we know, Americans like to see American heroes, regardless of the circumstances. Which is fine with me, I just don't understand why Brits always have to be the villians in movies. I don't find them particularly evil, or intimidating. I guess that accent thing invokes some sort of \\"creepy\\" feeling. Anyway I digress, the movie does a good job of depicting a feeling of the actual events - it doesn't feel like an exaggeration."},{"rating":"1","title":"disrespectful rubbish","review":"Hang on. The Americans hadn't entered the war by the time the Enigma Machines were recovered. I'm sure the British families of the Royal Navy sailors who did recover the machines might find this film a bit upsetting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great, fictional war story","review":"Another superb title for the short-lived run of HD DVD.

The trouble is, it's hard to find that shade in stores, and impossible since I moved here to Bulgaria from the UK, so ordering online is the only option. It can work out a bit pricey, what with the shipping costs added, but at least I get 4 applications per box. I've not personally had any problems as far as allergy goes, though it can stain the skin a little at the time, but going around after with a flannel/cloth and some soap soon removes it with a gentle rub.

The description boasts \\"maximum compression\\" & I think that even if I were to order an extra small (I am 5'10\\", about 145 lbs & wear a Medium), there would really be no compression at all.

The problem isn't with the subject matter, but with what's actually on the DVD. As an earler reviewer mentioned, scenes were cut in which characters were seen smoking. I have to ask why? (Espcially when they leave in a scene which shows a \\"young\\" airplane drinking gasoline). What else was removed from the movie that we don't know about? In the bonus material they mention two other characters, an armadillo and a burro, which weren't part of the feature. Were they originally? I recall seeing the burro character as a child while watching the Wonderful World of Disney on NBC. Maybe an expert on Disney movies could enlighten us.Disney, let parents decide what their children should watch. Remain true to the original films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Exactly What I Ordered... :(","review":"I've been collecting Disney's 50 animated feature films on DVD for the past 12 YEARS...The last one I needed to complete my collection was Saludos Amigos.I ordered this DVD that was listed as the \\"Saludos Amigos Gold Classic Collection\\" DVD, which would have just contained the movie, Saludos Amigos, on it's own. Instead I received the \\"Classic Caballeros Collection DVD with Saludos Amigos AND The Three Caballeros\\". This is NOT what I ordered at all. I already own The Three Caballeros. Why would I need two copies of this movie? Very upset, very disappointed. I just want what I ordered...Be wary of emerald_city_collectibles--their listing was false and I did not get exactly what I wanted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little of Walt","review":"I bought this for the bonus-feature, real-life, travelogue of Walt and his artists in South America. It was about a 30-minute travelogue. It is OK, but I was disappointed, because Walt is shown only a few times, and does not talk, and his artists do not talk. If money is no object; South America of that era-gone-by is beautiful. It is too bad South America is not that way anymore. There are some interesting things; and you get a little humor at the end with a candid shot of Walt and the Disney smile.Skimming the cartoon, the main feature did not look so great. For a cartoon; I would choose \\"Chip N' Dale\\", or Mickey Mouse in \\"Mickey's Trailer\\" within \\"Classic Cartoon Favorites, Vol. 7 - Extreme Adventure Fun\\".Walt's real-life trip took place during the strike at the Studio back home. Walt was hurt by the strike, and was on vacation to recover; not to make a great film; but the bonus-feature is OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, short, and dull...","review":"This is bottom of the barrel Disney. A 42-minute puff piece for Latin America, it contains only four animated sequences, only two of which (\\"Lake Titicaca\\" & \\"El Gaucho Goofy\\") are moderately entertaining. The rest is dreadful, live-action travelogue fodder, the kind of thing you sat through in elementary school assemblies back in the 1950s. There's another endless live-action short about Disney's crew gathering local color (which has to be added to the so called \\"feature\\" to get the 75 minute running time on the box info). Both of these films should have been added as bonuses to THE THREE CABALLEROS disc. Though the Disney completists may drool over this long-lost film finally being released, kids and most adults will find most of it painful to sit through. A snore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Politically correct = Insanity","review":"Just to (maybe) give the last reviewers some hint about Disney's motive: I think they don't want to be sued alongside with Marlboro & al. 45 years from now when the present viewers will look for some entertainment (and some more money for their lawyers) during their old days, by making somebody else responsible for their choices. By the way, G. Orwell (1984) thought only the communists were prone to alter history so it suits what they wanted you to know/believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drawing in the map of the world","review":"Besides giving you a lot of information this book is also very well written. It feels like in the beginning of the book we have one big white sheet of paper and we have to get our pencils out and start drawing. The first chapters give us some sense about how Europe looked but with the chapters on the Travels of Discovery (Cook for example) we can draw more lines of the coastal areas. When in the 18th century entire countries are mapped the map becomes clearer and clearer. With the coming of computers the pencil lines could now be drawn with black ink.Even for those not really interested in the History of Maps this book is amazing. It is also a book on mathmetics, history and astronomy.Maps are my hobby and I've read a lot about them, but this book is definitely the best so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Game I've Played","review":"There's not much I can say for a game as perfect as Final Fantasy 8. The story line is outstanding and as you play you get to know how each character thinks and feels. The graphics are better than any of the other Final Fantasy games and the music fits perfectly. Theres tons of \\"side quests\\" that you can get into along the way and there's also a card game that you can play. The story is based on a theme of love which makes it perfect for people 10-20 years old. You get to know the main character soooooo well you might even know what he'll say before he does! It's VERY hard not to fall in love with this game...no...this masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh...My...Gawd...","review":"I have just finished this game, and am still winding down. This game is the best RPG I have ever played, and probably the best game I have ever played... ever. The charaters are so cool they could freeze heck. The graphics are phenominal, unlike FF7, where it looks like they made Dragon Ballz 3-D and changed some characer appearance. And last, but no least, the story is one of the best so far! By the time I had finished, I found myself quite literally going through some sort of emotional crisis.(I WANT THE STORY TO CONTINUE!!!!)Anyway, I'd say that if you haven't played this one, do it. It's worth the money. And It's WAY better that FF7."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game but has bugs","review":"Overall I think this game is an improvement over FF7. The characters are more realistic and the story is better. Just so you know though the software version has bugs such as starting with 81 million in money, a ridiculous amount of items, and reaching a point where the program keeps crashing. Squaresoft/Electronic Arts is aware of the problem but they told me that it may be two or three weeks before the problem is resolved. I think the game is well worth waiting for but thought you might want to be aware of this problem before you purchase FF8."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINAL FANTASY VIII Rules!","review":"Welldone once again squaresoft for this great game.The graphics are so amazing and the CG videos are so hot you think its real.

I'm also sorry to say that it was the biggest let down i'v ever had. The game graphicly is astounding, the fmvs and charactor designe is spectacular. The mini pocketstation game was a nice touch, but thats where it stops. The game itself is losely strug together with no real central plot. The music is below par (except for the chocobo song)and often gets anoying durring play. The battles draw on and on litteraly. the draw magic system is horrible! most boss battles are spent drawing the magic from the enimies taking usually over 30 minutes. I never beat the game because i was too board by the final disk. If you really want a great RPG then buy Grandia, Lunar SSS or the sims. So in ten words or less: Square you could have done a lot better. *sorry for the typos*"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best RPG ever made for PC","review":"This is the best RPG that has ever hit the PC!

The game takes you from a civilized palace to an enslaved city to an underground desert dungeon into space and back. 10 times better than ff7 which was also my 2nd favorite game(p.s. the game is so good I own it for computer and playstation and i'm only 14 with an unsteady source of income). in turn do yourself a favor and buy FF8 you won't regret I promise"},{"rating":"2","title":"ummm....consistency would be nice","review":"I have just one thing to say.

If the demo is a small part of the whole game wouldn't it have the same hardware requirements? As it is I can't risk buying this game.

Squaresoft now seems to rely on 'pretty boy' villian such as Sephiroth and What's-his-name from this game. The plot of the last two games was just plain bad.

My advice is to avoid this game like the plague and save your money for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Series goes Swirling Down the Can","review":"After the genius of FF6 (FF3 in America) and the brilliance and intrigue of FF7, this is EASILY the series' biggest letdown. Final Fantasy6 and 7 were succesful for many reasons, one of which was intriguing storyline and likeable characters, both of which the game fails at. After playing it for only a few minutes, you'll probably think or wish (as I did) the following: \\"The characters will all HAVE to become more likeable by the end\\". HA! They don't, and eventually I started hoping they'd all get in a fiery plane crash (or airship crash, whatever). Plus, there is virtually no need for money seeing as you armor etc. never goes beyond the clothes on your back. These factors and an ending that was apparantly slapped together by some programmers who were and just wanted to end this crap make this game the worst FF to date, though FF9 seems quite competitive in that category."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"this game spans 4 cd's. it stats off good but is vary deceaving. it has a poor system for battle. the system entails a GF-Gardian force system. much like that of a elemental calling. although it takes nothing from you hp or mp. infact you dont have magic points. any magic you heve is baught or drawm in battle from enemies.i made it about the third cd and found myself draging through it. it lost all its intrest at this point. i took out the cd and put the game away.the only good thing this game does now is collect dust so my baulders gate cd case stays nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for the Playstation, bad for the PC","review":"The Playstation has a 33mhz proccersor, 2 megs of ram, no hard drive space, and runs a game that requires a pentiumII 266mhz.

After playing FF7 I went on to purchase FF5,6,8,and 9. A great disappointment was my purchase of FF8. The game was lacking in its fantasy like elements. The opening to the game was very impressive and caught my attention immediately. The games graffics were mediocore and the battle system was missing great features from the first game.

The story is too linear and The summons take too long. You may spend 30 minues fighting and 25 of that is watching summons! The interface is also very SNESy. The best part of this game for me was the cut scenes as these are the best EVER on the PC. I spent a good deal of time pkaying this game and was not rewarded enough.

The game has excellent graphics and movies and support for all video cards, but I liked the gameplay in FF7 better. What I got most hooked on in the game was the mini-card game. Its very fun and you can get items for obtaining certain cards.Like in FF7, FF8 has an excellent storyline in which Squaresoft does best anyways. The Junction Battle System didn't appeal to me as much though. There are Guardian Forces you must collect in the game and you must junction to one to get even the most basic commands. Furthermore, you must find rare items and magazines to get upgrades on your weapons.It is also the wierdest FF game i've played. Usually in RPGs you get a whole bunch of experience for defeating a boss. In this game, you get no exp for bosses or certain enemies. Also, money is salary based in this game.

Showtime, ever mindful of the self-promotion and whoring themselves out, fills the first minute of this DVD with an ad reminding you how great they are. You canNOT - on any of the 3 players I tried - skip past or speed up this process. Every time the DVD starts. Unacceptable, Showtime. Let me choose what to watch on what I own. The kicker - it's an ad for a showtime subscription rebate - expiring in February 2009. So a minute of my life is wasted every time I fire up these discs to watch a commercial for an expired offer.Then, the lead in to the actual DVD menu makes you sit through another 15 second delay of text message banter.

Instead, Showtime employed closed captioning (cheapskates!). Yet not all DVDs and/or TV sets can display CC, and, if either device you own won't display them, you're out of luck. And setting up the feature for DVDs, in any case, is far from easy or intuitive. After all of this, the displayed info doesn't tell you if the CC type is \\"Line 21,\\" \\"SDH,\\" or what. So, given that this isn't Gone With The Wind, the DVD gets one star from me, as the CC BS requires more fuss than the series is worth. By the way, at the start of the DVD, you're forced to watch Showtime advertising with options to skip or fast forward blocked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing wrong with it","review":"The show is great, VERY raunchy so not for the faint of heart or youngesters.

This is a brilliantly if outrageously scripted vehicle for Duchovny's unique delivery and a delight to watch.I have seen all three seasons and they are all exceptionally well written, acted, directed etc. The casting was a stroke of genius and the heavy integration of street language seemingly adds to the flow as it did in the Jeff Bridges masterpiece The Big Lebowski.Yes, there is a great deal of swearing, nudity and adult situations, but as an adult show it is utterly hilarious. It is important to see the show as a caricature or parody of the very sex/drugs/rock and roll lifestyle that it depicts, yet writer Tom Kapinos always manages to balance the futile, one-dimensional sex addiction with sensitive insights and life lessons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Show","review":"I watched this show with some friends and thought it was a bit like some of the shows on mainstream tv, but with the twist of adult humor in it.

Why is that so? Shouldn't there be editors to check for these sorts of simple mistakes? Within the first few chapters, some of the problems and examples given in the chapter have data that don't match up and can cause confusion for those who are using it. Other than that, this book seems like a good backup reference, but all the math errors really make this book seem very unprofessional."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK but very technical","review":"Overall, the book covers relevant M&A material but it's difficult to read.

There were 2 one star reviews from the same period - actually a 1 star review started the series.How likely is it that this was a random set of events?

What my wife and I like best is that there are back to back stories that focus on the same topic, from different circumstances or angles.

It was extremely basic and utterly useless to anyone who has some knowledge of the sport. I hoped to gain information about training methods and routines, but the book did not deliver.

At one point, it claims working the calf muscle will not increase power, yet later it gives information on calf exercies to supplement the squat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this.

I've been powerlifting for a year (I'm a 145 lb woman who can bench more than I weigh), and I would not recommend this book to anyone new to lifting. Go look for Starting Strength by Mark Rippetoe. It's almost mind-boggling how simple his approach and explanations are, yet frustrating how more people can't explain it at all. My lift numbers were already respectable, but after applying his techniques, such as grip changes, my numbers began climbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very very basic and uninsparing","review":"This book is perhaps only interesting if you are a absolute beginner and want to learn a bit about powerlifting. The exercises are in my opinion very poorly displayed.

His interview was fascinating discussing what I felt was a subject that could use a freash approach. I picked up the book soon thereafter and tried to get into it. The subject interests me very much but mr Mishra never engaged me. His personal stories and his dry historical accounts were forced. It almost seemed like this was writen as one would a pre-graduate college paper on an assighned subject with mounds of reference books close by. the book has but little continueity or flow.

Yes the Ewww Factor possiblities are quite high, yet Carole Mortimer manages to disable them (Thank goodness!!!).

Most of the sources are short - no more than 6 pages in length, which lends itself well to \\"reading on the go.\\" As a reviewer has earlier pointed out, women of all social strata are represented here, which is also a strength. However, I was dismayed by the fact that the vast majority of the selections are by whites - African - Americans, Asian - Americans, Native Americans and other groups are not well represented at all, which detracted from the book's merit as \\"the Female Experience.\\" In spite of this minor point, it is fascinating reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY OVERRATED, a big disappointment","review":"After high hopes and much anticipation I found this much lauded book to be virtually useless. For example, in the English section the word \\"know\\" wasn't covered in the biblical sense (to copulate with or to sleep with). I suppose I could have found this archaic meaning in Merriam-Webster, but then why have Strong's? I am not a divinity student and I don't read God's word in Greek, Hebrew, Aramaic, or Latin, and I doubt if many lay people do, so I will likely donate this book to the local library where it will collect dust.I would give this book zero stars if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent context helper for serious student of Bible","review":"My heartfelt approval goes to this review of marvelous work done by James Strong. I saw somebody's review of this excellent book and it got a single star. I have been studying the bible daily with this book. There are actually no problems for me, I give it five stars. Because if this book is used in the proper way, in fact it will contribute greatly to your understanding of the bible. It would be unwise to depreciate this excellent work. However, you have to be patient at first, it requires some of your patience to understand the working of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just The Facts Mam","review":"This book is not for everyone that's for sure. It seems to have an exhaustive list of words that it covers but it doesn't give you any details of their meanings. Although it very briefly, and I do mean breifly, defines a few words it seems to be more of a thesaurus than anything else. Also there are no graphics at all. Not so much as a drawing.

Knock yourself out."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"The original works of James Strong are excellent, however in the case of some of these newer books where Dr. Strong's work has been \\"corrected\\" are not so good. Corrected means shot full of errors. For example, I understand that many believe in the rapture, however the word rapture does not exist in the Bible, it is a work of man. I was so disappointed to see references to rapture in a bible dictionary because belief in the rapture alters the entire understanding of the New Testament. If I were given the option I would have given it a 0."},{"rating":"1","title":"More aptly titled \\"Strong's Incomplete Dictionary\\"","review":"The contents of this book is based on the KJV Bible.

This is only a theological treatise about Christ's work of salvation. If we look at the Bible (both in the Old Testament and the New Testament), historical context is important. Prof. Morris should talk a little bit more about the Jewish guilt in killing Christ and what consequences that has. Prof. Morris denies the whole prophetic tradition in ignoring this important element. Thus, this book is neither wholly biblically-centered or beneficial to the long-term goals of the Christian church in light of the Word of God."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most beautiful songs around.","review":"I love 'You Came Along' by Beverly.

That's what you think when the over priced item shows up squeezed into a small box & wrapped in a plastic bag.

Anderson essentially provides 9 use cases of programming MS Office 2003; one per chapter and written in Visual Basic. These cases can be valuable to you on several levels.Firstly, if you are new to Visual Basic, then the book gives extended examples to improve your understanding.Secondly, and obviously, to see how you can program the various and myriad components of Office 2003, from the UI to accessing a database and using XML. Very nontrivial, as you might appreciate from the level of detail in the chapters.Thirdly, it is to find that one of the chapters actually fills a current need, and so you can just copy its code, perhaps with only some simple changes.

Very useful stuff if you need to push information from your office out to the web.

Anything in between will fall flat on its face and Lady & the Vampire proves it. Here's a title that in spite of providing great art lacks greatly in delivery. Most of the comic is just an excuse to show naked sexy bodies (male and female) with the potential for sex (which is never REALLY executed). There's way too much posing in this comic. This is a teaser that never goes off and leaves you hanging. So unless you're into nudist colonies, don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless and Classic Disney","review":"My 6 year old daughter heard the music for Peter and the Wolf and wanted to know what it was about. I immediately recalled the Disney cartoon version and looked for it. It is one of several musical pieces on this video. Needless to say, when we first watched the disc we went straight for Peter and the Wolf. Afterwards, we watched the remaining and it just took me back to my childhood watching the Wonderful World of Disney. The music and artistry of the animation are just timeless. Although it is a transfer of old film, the video is just as clear as any new animation on the market. As they say, the proof is in the pudding and frankly my daughter's interest in the video is proof. This is an awesome collection of Disney shorts that I would recommend to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Peter and the wolf was done wrong","review":"Ok there are some points I love. This was my first introduction to the poem Casey at the bat for example. the whale who wanted to sing at the met always made me smile.However I must say while I loved the vivid coloration of it and seeing Peter and the wolf Disney sensored there too and took an enormous liberty. In the orriginal story the duck was swallowed whole. Leaving it a sort of bittersweet victory and proving that this wolf was a dangerous animal. I guess it was to keep from tramatizing kids but Sasha the duck comes out of a hollow tree at the end. Making it both lighthearted and goofy. Plus the duck and the bird were not friends and while Grandfather deep down was probubly proud of Peter he had his more adult and practical view in the original writiting of it of what if Peter had not been sucessful what then? I really wish they'd left Peter and the wolf as originally written. Kids won't understand that version if they're fed the sugar coated one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick and violent part","review":"Watch out for \\"The Whale Who Wanted to Sing at the Met\\". It starts out as a sweet story about a whale who can sing opera and dreams of performing on stage. He swims up to a boat to sing for a famous conductor, who brings him to the Metropolitan Opera, where he's a big hit. That was when I left the room for a minute -- only to come running back when my kids started screaming. It turns out that the performance part was only a fantasy, and what happens in the next scene is that the guy on the boat harpoons Willie, and he's killed under a blood-red stormy sky with scary sound effects. Then the narrator says \\"Don't be sad, surely he went to whale heaven to sing with the angels\\" and that's the end. My six-year-old couldn't stop crying. What a dirty trick to play on little kids.

It paves the way down a slippery slope of censorship.

Admittedly, \\"Music\\" is a mixed bag with some very good features and some pretty lame ones. It was nice that they included \\"Band Concert\\" on the tape too. However, my biggest disappointment was the censoring of \\"The Martins and the Coys\\" sequence! Why take that out? In reading other viewers' comments, I see that this wasn't the only aspect of the film revised. I can accept that this was one of Disney's compilation films and I wasn't expecting a \\"Snow White\\". If Disney was going to release the film on video, they should have released the entire thing in its original uncut form!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reviews cause for rejection","review":"Because of these reviews I have decided to NOT purchase this video.

Very frequent change of settings/characters to the point where I find myself having to stop and back up often to try to re-establish the setting and try to figure out who the character is that I am reading about. I think the last straw came last night when in one chapter the settings/characters changed at least 6 times and I do not mean going back and forth between 2 settings .... I mean 6+ different settings with different characters, with only a paragraph or 2 dedicated to a couple of them.I understand these books are very popular but I, myself, prefer smoother prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"scardy cat not my cup of tea","review":"i guess this book i do not enjoy, maybe if i read more of this authors books it will be better"},{"rating":"2","title":"an intense mystery","review":"This is my first book by author Billingham and I am quite impressed. The plot twists around a pair of serial killers, intertwining the lives of DI Thorne and his crew of investigators. The final unveiling of the killer was quite a surprise, as I had guessed a different character to be the villain. The second half of the book really picks up speed and is hard to put down.

Pocahontas' journey to England was a terrific idea, and from that the creators were able to mine endless possibilites. All the songs are catchy, and come close to matching those of the original (surpassing some). The ending might be disappointing to some, becuase it does an injustice to the original film.

Disney had to bastardize history just to make it. Then they went and gave it unlistenable songs, cheap jokes and Don Bluth-like animation. Gross! This is true not only of Pocahontas II, but ALL the direct to viedo sequals! Disney has to stop making these cheap knock off's of their features! If there's really a story to tell after the feature then they should take the time to develop it and make it as grand as the first. Like PIXAR did with Toy Story 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"This [stunk] for me, but others might like it.","review":"Ok, Pocahontus 2 is basically about Pocahontus \\"moving on\\". She goes to England to protect her tribe from an Armada. (If you hate historically inaccurate movies DON'T watch this) She ends up falling in love with John Rolfe, but is reunited with John Smith. Decisions, Decisions....Well ok, i didn't like this movie because I thought the romance between Rolfe and Pocahontus was totally botched. They hardly even talked and second, Disney in the first movie made Pocahontus and John Smith out to be soul mates and in this movie they throw away that romance like it was a fleeting thing. What about the whole \\"I will always be with u\\" thing? The animation was far worse than the originals. The songs less catchy, only a few were decent. The whole movie was sort of thrown together. If you liked the first Pocahontus movie I don't think you will like the second. It totally derates the first and ruins the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Disney Movie","review":"I've never shut off a Disney movie before. I was half way through and I couldn't take it anymore. The original is one of my favorite Disney movies, it's visually stunning and so full of emotion. This second rate rip off evokes no emotion except frustration and anger that I actually paid money for this piece of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"This movie was an absolute waste of my time. Being extremely bored I watched it on tv, praying that it wouldn't be all that bad. I didn't like the original Pocahontas all that much but it was by no means bad. This sequel and all Disney sequels ruins, absolutely trashes the original films! Besides the bad animation horrible plots, and endings,it completely ruins your imagination. After all Disney movies it leaves you content to imagine your own (pretty obvious) ending. The characters are immortalized in your brain. Particularly for this movie they ruined it! The ending made me so mad! I haven't the faintest idea why I care so much but it seems like it ruined a perfectly good (though historically inaccurate) movie. If you like Disney movies DO NOT WATCH the sequels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shattered dreams","review":"This ruined everything about the first film for me. For one, they turned John Smith into a total airhead. I mean, what happened to the brave explorer?? I wouldn't have minded about John Rolfe { In turth, she does marry him.]if he was not such a boring...sorry, I can't swear on this site. Pochontas had a total character change and she had NO IDEA what she was talking about. The histoical methods really needed to be rethought. It lacked PASSOIN and ADVENTURE and was one of the worst films I have ever seen. Pochontas lacked her free spirit and John Smith his noble heart. Trust me, I am only 13 and I saw this a few years ago and it shattered my dream and my heroine. I cried at the end, for petes sake. So, if you don't want shattered dreams, DON'T WATCH THIS FILM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so bad but not so good either","review":"Basically the movie wasn't so good as I espected it to be .I mean the first movie was way much better I could say the Pocahontas 2 discussed me .The hole thing of the movie was that she stays with John Smith and finally she ends up running with another guy that was much more uglier than John Smith .The cartoon is pretty well realizes the characters looked somehow the same as the ones in the first movie but the context is very poor .So if you really want to enjoy you're Fridays don't choose Pocahontas 2 because it will leave you with a sour taste in you're mouth ."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLOUTELY CRAP!!!!","review":"The first movie was lovely but this one spoils it! The story is awful, the songs are unbearable and the new characters are okay. But John Rolfe ruined it. I thought Pocky [Pocahontas] loved Smith. Quotes: Pocky \\"No matter what happens, I'll always be with you forever\\" NUH!!!! She goes and runs off with this gay guy Rolfe, even after she finds out John Smith was alive she takes Rolfe home with her. Not at all the magic of the 1st! I also prefered the places in the 1st, not England town!!!LATT2 was a wonderful sequel, and TLK2!!!This film was ABSOLOUTELY CRAP!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A light-weight cozy...enjoy it for what it is","review":"This is not great literature. If that's what you are looking for, don't read the Chocoholic mysteries. But if you are just looking for a light-weight cozy, that's fun to read and part of a series in which you really get to know the characters, the town, and everything about them, you might enjoy this book and the series it belongs to. Lee McKinney is a 30-something woman living in a small tourist town in Michigan. It's a small town where everyone is in each other's business. Lee's love interest, Joe, is suspected of murdering a local man who had always been a bit of a trouble maker and considered \\"not quite right\\". But soon after his death someone threatens Joe and Lee's lives several times. It's obvious that the real murderer wants them dead, too. They need to find out who the real murderer is. As with all the other stories in this series, there is a chocolate theme that runs throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"much better read than the last title","review":"This title is third in the Chocoholic Mysteries series, and a great addition to the series. The author's description of a frog-like character was interesting. I read this book in one sitting and was happy to find that the fourth title in the series was available.I will continue with this series in spite of the heroine's annoying habit of substituting words with other words when she is nervous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"Each installment of this series is getting better, and it's turning into a really enjoyable one to read.Lee's \\"tongue-tangling\\" is still very annoying and seems more and more forced and not the least bit funny. It's time to do away with it completely. And I find the parenthetical descriptions of each chocolate every time one is mentioned annoying as well -- give us a recipe or let the name speak for itself.I look forward to the next installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth buying","review":"VERY disappointing.

If you've read the original,\\"How To Win Friends & Influence People\\" then this is nothing more than a brief review of part of that book.

Dale Carnegie's organization has gutted his classicHow to Win Friends & Influence Peopleand replaced it with a fluffy and useless \\"The Leader in You\\".

I'm really surprised the Disney Channel does not show it? The Headless Horseman story that Cartoon Network shows is horrible. I was happy to find this DVD available.I'm not overly impressed with the Mr. Toad story, it is fun, but not great.The Ichabod/Headless Horseman story is great fun.

Everything in Disney's \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" works: the animation, the presentation of the characters and storyline, Bing Crosby's narration, and the songs with Brom Bone's \\"You Can't Reason with a Headless Man!\\" being the showstopper. A truly wonderful piece of entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD SKIPS AND STOPS ON OWN","review":"My little ones LOVE this movie.

I had to try it on my eyebrows five times to get four hairs to come off. It somewhat worked on the bikini area, but it was more painful to me than waxing because it tugged more, and it didn't CLEAN the area up like waxing, there were still hairs in the spots I used the Nads. Messy, and unreliable.

I was so WRONG. I tried it on my eyebrows first and it didn't even remove the barely there hair let alone the thicker hair. This product is not worth the money at all.

My roomie at the times informs me that Nads does truly taste good (as is mentioned in the Aussie girl info-mercial), but that it did not remove hair for her either.

The process was somewhat easy, yet it is not something that can be done quickly. Also, I wasn't able to reuse the strips like the commercials had boasted. I was not able to get any hair off of my legs and it only took off apx. 1/4 of the hair from my bikini area (which was definately painful and left my skin red and irritated). I even tried it a second time with high hopes and saw nothing but a repeat from my previous try.

The WW2 was a powerful compendium of inspiration that eventually would lead him to make this prodigious masterpiece around the penuries of two women crossing over no one' s land where the wasted territory worked out as sublime metaphor of the inner and outer feelings of the distorted and defeated human soul in many people.A breathtaking picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"two women","review":"I know this is an older type movie, and of war torn Italy,but it has such poor story content.

My daughter likes it, but like The Little Mermaid and Cinderella she prefers.The story is good and about following your heart, peace, and nature, but it's entirely inaccurate. The Algonquian Indians that were native to Virginia during that time placed women as the chiefs. This means that Pocahontas would have been the Queen (she was). Her father would have just been a hunter/soldier (he was). Pocahontas was the Queen of her tribe during John Smith's visit. I was very disappointed that Disney did a poor job of using sustainable historical details. I think the story would have been better if Pocahontas was the Priestess.Also, the land that John Smith landed on was not mountainous.

All songs are centered on a loving appeal. Sound quality is level. I gave it two stars because of the strength of the singer, but, to tell you the truth, I was disappointed with this CD.

Though 'Dreams' remains one of her bests, there's more here to make one question why she couldn't muster much attention beyond that track here in the states. 'Give Me Just A Little More Time'finds her mining Motown territory, while both 'Sunshine' and 'When A Woman' suggests she had more than a passing affinity for sixties girl group pop. Among the many other standouts:new track 'Don't Need The Sun To Shine'and the sterling'Out Of Reach', quite possibly her finest moment. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music to do the following things to :lounge, dance, party...","review":"A lot of people in the US do not know about Gabrielle, which is a shame since she is a very talented singer. Hopefully this review will enlighten people a bit. I liked her from the start with her debut single in 1993, but it was only 1999 when I actually bought her prior to most recent album 'Sunshine' which is almost as good as this one. Gabrielle had a very tough time with relationships, after her baby father got put in prison in 1996 and put her off men to this day. This is where most of her insparation comes from. With songs like 'Dreams', 'Give Me A Little Time','Rise' and 'Out Of Reach' its no wonder that she's such a big hit in England. She has a great voice, so over this year if you have any spare cash buy this album, and chill out to it, after all it is versatile :you can read to it, dance to it, party to it, drive to it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont waste your $","review":"I have two versions of this program, and boy did it mess up my computer.

Perhaps not the greatest of operas, but some of the greatest singing on disc. Buy it before Decca drops it from the catalog."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd!","review":"This is a great cd to get a flavor of Celia's great performances with different bands, different times in her career and styles of Latin music.

Two major thumbs down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cigarette and cologne smell","review":"These pillows arrived unwrapped, stuffed bare naked into a box. They smelled like some guys cologne and cigarettes.The stuffing is 95% feathers and 5% down. I did not find the stuffing anemic, like another reviewer said, but the cotton case is loud when you touch it, which makes me wonder if it is indeed 100% cotton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anemic","review":"These pillows are very poorly stuffed. They go super flat with the least bit of pressure, so they constantly look saggy. Quite disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"They're PAPER thin","review":"I don't know how anyone has said they are happy with these. I didn't know I needed to watch out for 22 inch pillows stuffed with half of the feathers. I was so excited by the good deal but they're worthless to me. I have 19 inch pillow covers that I wanted stuffed nice and full. I thought 22 inch inserts should do the trick! But these come as a huge flat square. I fluffed and fluffed hoping eventually they'd turn out normal. I can make the pillow look decent sitting on the couch until someone leans on it a teenie bit and then it looks like a limp, mis-shapen mess. I've never take the time to review an item on here. But this was a big bummer to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, low quality! Read before purchasing!","review":"These pillows are extremely low quality. They look nothing like the pillows pictured. They are completely flat and under filled... Think the amount of down for a 15x15 pillow inside of a i30x30 pillow. Not cool. I read the other reviews before I purchased them but thought \\"nah, I'm probably not as picky as these people that have complained\\" but I should have taken their word for it. They were right on the money. The worst part is that it would cost me 45$ to send them back for a refund (to which the seller happily agreed) so it's not really even worth it. The seller was nice but this is a horrible product. I suggest u look elsewhere. And if for some reason you must get these pillows, ill get off of mine for 30$! Brand new and in the bag.

Better still, go to Scotland if you want the real thing.If this was your first experience of what can be an incredibly delicious dish, with neeps and tatties, then I'd suggest you erase it from memory and keep an open mind - if you get the chance to eat the real thing you may actually decide you like it.This one however, just horrendous."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sea of Endless Quaking Light","review":"I have never, ever read a book that left me trembling when I was finished. Until I read Sea of Light. This book is the most incredible piece of writing that I have ever read in my entire life. I found the characters to be believable, and I found the analogies of swimming with love to be unshakeable. All I can say is wow. I feel madly in love with every character in this book. I can honestly say that I have just about memorized, the whole thing, from having read it so much. The tender sex scenes left me with a flickering in my gut, and the emotions that ellie goes through are so much like mine, that I feel as if I have been transposed, piece by shattering piece, into the book's core. I ache for a sequel, Miss Levin! Please, Please, Please, share more about Ellie and Babe! This is a must-read for anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous, sexy, can't miss.","review":"Jennifer Levin's \\"The Sea of Light\\" hits the heart of desire and loss in a true and engaging way.

Back to Basics is one of my all-time favorite albums and the show exceeded my expectations!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor editing and camera work","review":"I enjoyed the concert and Christina's performance, but I though much of the concert was very poorly filmed and the spazmatic editing was very hard to take.

All she does is screaming, yelling, screeching, straining her fcukin' voice. ALL THE TIME. So annoying. How is that \\"VOICE of the generation\\". She can't even control and runs her own voice. Her vocal runs technique is horrible and Xtina falsetto control are laughable compared with Beyonce. LMAO. And tell Xtina don't ever try to move or dancing cause she look retarded doing it. Thanks.Go buy the new Beyonce Experience and Justin's concert DVD instead. They both the best entertainers right now and will entertain you in every possible way. If you buy this, don't get mad at me, cause I've warn you, it will disappoint you. Unless you a REALLY obsessed fans of Xtina who don't care if she sucks at live or anything, then buy this.

If you are interested in UFO's this DVD may be interesting, but if you are looking for an athority source, look elsewhere"},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So","review":"This book was a definite \\"so-so.\\"First, the book has a lot of references to the Eberron setting. While this is a good thing if you've played and are familiar with the setting, it can be a huge turn off if you are not.Second, the amount of typos and grammatical errors is unacceptable and very distracting. Is WotC releasing books w/o proofreading/editing first?Third, the characters are a bit shallow (or at least the description thereof). They have no depth.Fourth, the plot is predictable and very linear.Fifth and lastly it overuses tired and shameless cliches.It's not a bad book, to be sure, but it's not nearly as good as I was expecting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome World Building","review":"I read this book without any prior knowledge of this author's world. And though I agree with previous reviews about the characters not being fleshed out very well, I was impressed with the imagination behind the setting.And the story moved along well enough and was involving enough, that I wasn't as bothered by the lack of character development that I otherwise would have been. I don't think I'd read another book in this series though, as good as the world building was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hung up on the typos","review":"Good intro to the world of Eberron, but a so-so story, and simply awful editing. This book is replete with typos, which was a constant distraction that really took away from my enjoyment of the novel and which made it really difficult to immerse myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Presto-Crapo!","review":"It's official! Wizards of the Coast opened a fresh page, squatted over it, and squeezed out the first book set in the gameworld called Eberron. I bought this book just to see if my world (which I didn't have the stones to submit) would have competed. Indeed, it would not have--it was a full five grade levels above it! But please, don't take my word for it--don't EVER take ANYONE'S word for it. If Jesus Christ himself said, \\"thou shalt not read this book, it sucketh greatly\\" read it anyway, just so you know for a fact how bad it is. I'm only writing this review to vent over my lost $7. Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great introduction to Eberron","review":"This is an adventure novel that pulls you in to the fantasy world of eberron. The book is highly readible and is great for those who are interested in the eberron campaign setting.Altough the author of this book clearly didn't intend to write literature it's detective style makes it an interesting read. You can finish it within a day and that plus the extremely good appendix makes it perfect for RPG players wanting inspiration for a true in-depth adventure game.Within this genre is clearly deserves a good rating:4 stars!now i'm looking for book II, ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Tour of the Setting","review":"Keith Baker gives us a mediocre story but a fabulous \\"open house\\" for the city of Sharn. I was not intrigued by the intended-to-be-tantalizing peeks into the characters backgrounds. However, I was extremely happy with the first-class tour of the city at the hands of the person most qualified to lead it.If you'd like to know more about the Eberron setting and what makes it different, but you can't make it through a campaign setting reference book without dozing off, this is the book for you. The loving hand of the creator shows and tells much of what Sharn and Eberron have to offer, and you don't have to wade through a single stat block!If you're interested in Eberron fiction, Matt Forbeck's \\"Marked For Death\\" is probably the better read. But if you're at all interested in Eberron as a setting for your game play, pick up this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"rare treat","review":"A rare treat, there isn't much I can say that other reviewers haven't already...Save read it.(And buy a copy; she says the royalties help immensely.) Jane Juska's an inspiring find. Her courage, wit and warmth will stay with you long after the book's finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wrong classification: this book should go under \\"Travel\\"","review":"This is one more book in the renaissance in \\"older women\\" tales. I am much reminded of Rita Golden Gelman's wonderful book, \\"Tales of a Female Nomad, Living at Large in the World.\\" Juska's engaging book is an addition to the travelogue of growing old. Its exploration is confined to the geography of sexual adventure, but who is to say that such is any less wholesome or useful.But the reader must surely be surprised at Juska's low standards, for such a fluid writer, in applauding the banal grammar and sentence structure of some of the respondants to her ad. And on page 246 of the hardbound edition, a proof-reader's goof: John's steady consort is referred to both as \\"Sharon\\" and \\"Sheila\\" in the same paragraph. For shame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe this woman was an English teacher","review":"I was very excited about reading this book based on the review and when I finally got it, I was just so disappointed. It is terribly written (i.e. \\"The Zuni Cafe is cool\\"). The meanderings bore me to tears and after three chapters, she still hasn't had a date. Her descriptions are cliched and there is nary a complete sentence in the book. I can hardly believe people are raving. I just don't get it. I give her credit for placing the ad and pursuing her dreams (or fantasies as the case may be), but that's about the only positive thing I can say about Round Heeled Woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh","review":"The idea is good, my problem is with the narrator. Juska is SO pretentious I can't stand it. She only goes out with the most erudite of men, then is disapointed when they turn out to be cads. How about opening yourself up to all types of men Jane? She thinks she's being young and hip by using words like \\"cool,\\" but you can see through the attempt. The writing often meanders on topics that HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH the personal ad. She is very naive trusting complete strangers when they tell her they have no std's. I don't know...I just found her annoying, naive and pretentious. Yeah, so she's over 60 and has sex. Woo-hoo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even finish it","review":"I heard about this book on the radio and thought I might enjoy it. I was wrong, I couldn't relate to the author at all, and I didn't care about her or the story enough to finish the book. The author seemed to be going after what she wanted, but she ended up letting disgusting men walk all over her and take advantage of her. It was just boring and gross to me. I wish I could get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and unpleasant","review":"Spare yourself this grindingly tawdry recounting of Ms. Juska's tedious, unpleasant encounters with tedious, unpleasant men. Far from being what her ad claims she wanted -- \\"a lot of sex with a man I like,\\" which sounds frisky and appealing -- it's actually a dreary tome primarily detailing two things: her unbelievable neediness and her nauseating tendencies to sweat, drip, ooze and otherwise leak under her politically correct drab Berkeley costumes. These absolutely endless descriptions are intercut with pompous philosophizing about Trollope and Bach and self-congratulatory droning about her work with prisoners.I feel sorry for the editor assigned to work with this tripe, oddly sympathetic to the poor men she hounded, and angry with myself for being stupid enough to buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun with Jane and dicks?","review":"So older women are sexy too? Thank goodness! What a great read from and of a fabulous dame. I guess others would call her a lady (yes, she is certainly that), but she is a lot more than a prim grandma type. And she writes beautifully. Thanks, Jane, for letting us come along for the ride. Great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Jane Contradiction: Great Sex With Young Lovers Only","review":"The premise of Jane Juska's book is that the elderly can enjoy sex too. Then she writes about her disappointing rendezvous with men her age. Her only enthuisiastic encounter was with a man substantially younger than she. The real message from Juska is that old people may engage in sexual activity, but if you are elderly and want great sex, get a young lover. What a disappointing book.... especially if you are elderly and can't find a young lover !!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Trollope and Trollops","review":"\\"A Round-Heeled Woman\\" by Jane Juska is the best book I've read since \\"'Tis\\" by Frank Mccourt. Maybe being an English teacher has more cachet than you might think. Juska's tale is extremely witty, poignant, and absolutely heart-warming. .... hard to put it down. Juska's passion for the writing of Trollope makes her late-life adventures more than just coincidental. Yes, Virginia, there is sex after sixty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Sad","review":"Despite her feminist/liberal bleatings, Juska ends up sounding like a 14 year old girl pining away for true love. I ultimately found this book very sad. Her journey starts out interesting and beguiling, but midway through I found her pretentious, shallow, and horribly co-dependant. That she hadn't changed a bit by the end left me feeling cheated and irritated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay.","review":"I bought this book after reading the article about the author in Vogue Magazine. I didn't expect the author to be so slutty; I was embarrassed for her and hope other women don't act that stupid around men."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb as a Box of Rocks","review":"This author just never got over her father. Because she lives her life exactly in opposition to what he expected of her, does not mean she won the game. At the ripe age of 67 she decides that sex will cure her past problems; i.e., bad decisions re lovers and husband, inability to raise her son and frightened of living by herself. Only an old hippie would pop into bed with men she really knows nothing about. She rants on about \\"talk\\" but thinks mainly about getting it on. Silly book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible not even worth the 89 cents that you can now buy it for","review":"The author thinks, acts and writes like it is 1970. I would think that the five star reviews were from her friends and family but no one in the book liked her. Do not waste your time or money on this self centered idiot."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"Jane Juska decided to have a lot of sex with strange men before she turned 67. Luckily, she didn't run into a Ted Bundy or a Mr. Goodbar type. That's it. That's the book. One sexual romp after another. This book has been highly praised as being bold and empowering but it just struck me as being rather sad. It's better written thant the Sexual Life of Catherine M. but that's the best that be said for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fact, Fantasy, or Fiction","review":"I am not at all sure where this book should go. If it is true the main problem she seems to be left with is cutting love out of the situation. It is also interesting that she attempts to transfer the reason for her mental situation on a handyman and her father."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reason to Hope...","review":"A refreshing look at sex later in life, written with honesty and wit. It's never too late to take control of your life, and the author is an inspiring example..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Courage","review":"Jane Juska's courage comes through in her beautifully written book. When she describes sitting in a movie theater, watching a romantic movie, and deciding that her romantic life isn't over yet, I knew I'd be cheering for her the whole way! She's a gutsy sixty-six year old lady. I kept thinking of it as a female counterpart to Philip Roth's The Dying Animal which is an insightful book about a senior man's perspective on lust.And yes, she finds the proverbial Prince after she kisses a few frogs. Ahhh"},{"rating":"1","title":"So self indulgent, arrogant and boring","review":"I was anxious to read this book based on what I'd heard. After about twenty pages, I was just not interested in this woman's story; it was rather dull and pathetic and full of self indulgence. I did read it all though, hoping it would get better.As someone who married in my mid forties for the first time and has had a lot of experience, I thought Jane was not too perceptive in letting men take advantage of her. Most didn't sound attractive at all.Mainly I just didn't care about her and thought she was an insult to being an independent woman, exactly what she thought she was."},{"rating":"2","title":"A+ for my high school teacher!","review":"Mrs.(Jane) Juska was my teacher 25 years ago. She was an inspiration then, and she continues to be an inspiration now. I laughed out loud and cried several times as I read this book. She is an excellent writer and her words reach out and tug at your heartstrings. You go girl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for book club!","review":"I found this book fascinating and thought it would be great for book club as all my friends I discussed it with had different opinions about woman's roles in relation to this book. I thought the book jumped back and forth a bit between sections about the different men and sections regarding the authors marriage, a long trip home and her son. I still think it paints an interesting portrait of her quest and the happenings in relation to that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book you'll want to share","review":"I have given about 6 copies of this book to women friends of my age -women in their 60's. Juska writes with humor and candor. She is obviously adventuresome, brave and more than a little foolhardy. The book is poignant in an understated way. Juska has missed out on love as well as sex for 30 years. Her journey of self-discovery is fascinating and its focus -- sex between elderly partners -- is unusual. If you live in Berkeley, Ca. you will enjoy the local references."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't deliver","review":"The writer of this book placed an ad in her sixties, searching for a lot of sex with a man she liked. She got many responses and travelled across the country to meet these men and have sex with some of them. However, only a small portion of the book was devoted to the actual premise of the book. Most of it was flashbacks to her teaching years, her students, her love of Bach, etc., most of which I found quite boring. I love to read but found myself skimming through all of this to get to the actual heart of the book, the journey, the men. And even here she skimped. She didn't develop the men well enough, didn't develop her time with them well enough. I felt she missed her goal and this book was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOLO Liquid Sprayer","review":"Missing parts, nut and bolt to keep cup in place at bottom of sprayer, Where is QA?The rest of it is OK except that one of the most important things in a backpac sprayeris the sholder slings and these are very poor.You corporate fools need to produce QUALITY PRODUCTS to sell your products!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Solo Sprayer","review":"As I wrote before the item was poorly packaged and arrive with hooks broken.

I replaced it with this 'manual' Solo sprayer and it works great. The ergonomics are great and the pump handle, which is adjustable, can be put in a convenient location. I like the adjustable spray nozzle and also the fact that the maximum pump pressure can be changed on the unit I bought. I also confirmed it will handle Roundup, although I can't imagine why anyone would sell a sprayer that doesn't since it's so popular. Very good design at a good price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eddie Kantar is the best!","review":"Folks,I think this book is the best all -over defense book I have ever read.

It is also an entertianing read. I have recommended it to the bridge players I mentor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kantar on defense","review":"Every intermediate bridge playeer must read (study) this book if they want to become a really goood player.

The story itself is predictable, uninspiring, and ends too abruptly. The dance numbers are ok, nothing extraordinary, although the girls do have beautiful legs. To be honest I found the movie boring. Jennifer Beals's interracial beauty was about the only thing that allowed me to finish watching the movie.The DVD is enhanced for 16:9 widescreen and preserves the film quality pretty well. The audio is too loud on music and too soft on dialogs. It doesn't have any extra features. But then, for $12, you get to watch some 80s dancing and some strip club scenes and relive the go-go days, so what more can you ask for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"very heartfelt!","review":"this is a heartfelt movie about a young girl like myself who wants to become a ballerina. watch it if you are crazy about ford trucks! no, just kiddin',crazy about ballerinas. oh yeah! don't forget to watch my movie can't hardly wait!"},{"rating":"1","title":"average","review":"not much of a film now.very slick&shallow.very much a 80's film.the music was catchy.but the film is very dated now.it was average at the time.and hasn't changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the music, Hated the movie!!","review":"It's been a while since I had the chance to see this movie again as my wife ordered the DVD. I didn't like the movie when it first came out and I didn't like it now. It's mostly because of the lowsy script by Joe Esterhaus. Jennifer Beals was a so-so actress. But I thought they would have done better if they had a dancer who could act (i.e. Leslie Caron). The only thing going for it is the music. If you like dancing, this is for you. If you want a spectacular movie, look elsewhere!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hasn't aged well","review":"I watched this movie in the 80s in the theatre and loved it. Maybe it was partially because I was a teenager and had stars in my eyes. Until recently, thinking about the movie gave me happy thoughts of being young and imagining that I was a dancer. Then I watched the movie again and it struck me as being terrible! It may mostly be that it hasn't aged very well. But, I also think that it's just not a very good movie. It strikes me as the kind that was perhaps made for the interest of teenaged boys! I found it to be a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"The dog sells out.","review":"Flash -- yes. Dance -- well, only if it's still the 80's. It's all about selling yourself -- on the job; in the audition. The only character with any integrity is the dog.

You can't go wrong with this 80's flashback. It's really good fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film","review":"The film's portrayal of a young woman persuing her dream is excellent.

I'm into b-boying (breakdancing) and that's why I got this DVD. The 5.1 Dolby Digital Soundtrack is top-notch for a movie from 1983. The movie had an extremely weak plot. Like others have said, what is Hannah's relationship to Alex? Why did she go to confessional all the time and then have sex with her bf 2 minutes later?My biggest gripe is what happened to the break-dancing scene? I've seen that part of the movie in numerous break-dancing tapes and the scene in the DVD was much shorter. I mean they showed Crazy Legs 3 times, Frosty once, and the 2 poppers, but where was Prince Ken Swift? This movie is supposedly what brought break-dancing into the mainstream back in the early 80s, but yet the DVD which has no features at all, shortens it a lot.This DVD gets a generous 2-stars from me and only because of the good audio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, Flashdance on DVD!

Then \\"Flashdance\\" should do the trick.

While the illustrations do have some charm, they are outweighed by irritations such as the presence of penguins en route to the North Pole (coyly but unsatisfactorily justified in an author's note at the start of the book). There can be a fine line between whimsical and silly, and this story is often pointlessly silly. The ship's captain gives Roo a tin of macaroni cheese. Later on, the explorers are caught in a blizzard and all their equipment is blown away; Roo then 'brought out the tin of macaroni' (from where?) which they then manage to open, heat up and eat (with what?). The subplot about the last of the world's ice cream is equally silly and pointless, as is the author's anthropomorphising of Roo (\\"I wish she wouldn't waste her money\\").However, I will have to admit that my five-year old likes the story! There's no accounting for taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pasha de Cartier","review":"Amazon enabled me to connect with a merchant for a great deal on this wonderful fragrance.

The price was better than on ebay and by shipping directly to her, I saved postage as well. Highly recommended - the finish lasts and the faucet has worked reliably for almost 5 years. I think it actually looks better than the stock picture indicates. It is easy to turn off and on and never leaks. I've not had to replace any washers or valves and we have very hard water. More importantly, the chrome drain stopper and trim that comes with the faucet is showing no signs of wear in 5 years. Kohler makes a quality product. Can't say the same for other 'brand name' faucets.In my experience, the plumber costs more than this faucet does.... installing one like this will save you money in the long run because it will not need to be replaced or repaired as often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black marks all over faucet","review":"Currently, we're remodeling our bathroom and my uncle recommended this brand.

Some critics may say that the book is biased towards Space 1999, since Muir is a sincere fan. However is has some points that show that the show, mainly in its first season was a groundbreaker and visionary one.

A-HA's music is mix of synth pop, new wave and pop rock. My favorite tracks are \\"I've been losing you\\", \\"Crying in the rain\\" and \\"The sun always shines on tv\\". The booklet has no lyrics which is quite usual for a compilation.

It covers everything, from birth, childhood, teen years, stardom and the mental decline and everything after. The book keeps pace very well and there are no spots that lag or become boring; I read it in one day I was so entrigued. It tells you things about Syd that you couldnt find out otherwise, intricate details that are often ommited. It also features many interviews with people that knew Syd. There are several rare pictures of him in the book. This is a great picture of the madcap and his unique genius.

It's a pamphlet. My husband put the set together for me without even looking at the instructions. The clamps for mine are NOT weak or cheap, they hold the set perfectly. The bulbs are bright. I used one of them in my great room and from upstairs walking into the room it looks like it's the middle of summer in the room when it was 10pm at night! I have no clue why they say it's not bright enough.. if anything I might have issues diffusing the light.The set does heat up pretty fast so watch your hands!The set is also light so it's easy to transport as well. I really don't have any complaints. I think it makes for a perfect beginners set and is a recommended brand by my college teacher for our lighting class."},{"rating":"1","title":"No instructions; \\"thrifty\\" = \\"cheap & poor quality\\"","review":"This was a very disappointing set to receive. The box came with absolutely NO instructions and a defective clamp for one of the lights. The strange thing is that the set has decent stands, but everything else is extremely cheap and low-quality. When I was finally able to correctly assemble (I think) one of the lamps with it's umbrella reflector, the whole lamp and umbrella fell over as if the flimsy ball-clamp couldn't hold the weight.I understand value and that you can't get a Mercedes for a Yugo price. But the clamps for these lamps are terrible and the lack of instructions is inexcusable. You can get decent reflector clamp/workshop lights at Lowes and Home Depot for $9 a piece. This would probably be a better investment.As this set sits now, it's unusuable. I'll need to return it and waste more money on shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"significantly underpowered","review":"Besides the stands, the rest of this kit is pretty shoddy.

This kit is difficult to figure out how to put together, difficult to put together, and doesn't fit well or work well when it is put together. The single nut that both adjusts the clamp that holds the reflector to the stand and the umbrella is poorly designed and barely functions. I could not tighten it enough to get the reflector to stay pointed above the horizontal even without the umbrella.Maybe some salvagable parts, and maybe useful for some tabletop photos destined for eBay.

It was inexpensive so I didn't think too much about it and ordered it. I should've checked the size first! It is only about 4-5 inches wide/tall and the buttons are very small. If you need a larger calculator for vision or just because you like a larger desk calculator, there is nothing large about this thing! It's downright petite! It's fine if you wanted a tiny compact purse calculator or something, but it's crummy for what I need it for, I'll have to buy something else. I gave it two stars because the display is nice and clear, and the solar/battery backup is good and quick... it's just not what I thought I was getting, which is why I rated it lower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy Little Calculator","review":"I know there is a calculator on my computer, but I still love regular calculators and this one is a convenient, compact size. Since this is dual powered, it will last longer and you can recharge it with solar power.The size of this calculator is nice because it fits in your hand while you calculate away. I find I make less mistakes, although I do sort of miss my calculator with the larger key pad.~The Rebecca Review"},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing Change Sign button","review":"One other reviewer said the change sign button is on the % sign. Well, it isn't actually. There is no change sign button. What the + - on the percent button means is you can add or subtract percent easily. For example, you can key in 100 + 6 % to add 6% to 100... It is a small calculator, but perfect for balancing a checkbook. Perfect size for what I was looking for. I do wish it had a change sign button, however. That would get it 5 stars then."},{"rating":"1","title":"It didn't work","review":"Perhaps I am an exception or victim to a manufacturing mistake but this calculator will not turn on.

This scene was not funny and not necessary. I realize that they wanted to show his disappointment with the theme park, but Disney could have got the point across another way. There was another scene earlier in the movie when Goofy's son is on his way to school, and a girl punches his shoulder because he is acting not so cool. Also, the very beginning of the movie starts off with a nightmare, from which Goofy's son wakes up to punch the alarm clock. There is no need for any of this violence. I had to explain to my son too many times that this behavior is not acceptable in reality and this is only a cartoon. I wish Amazon would provide a refund. It is not what I expected from a movie that is rated G. It is definitely more like PG."},{"rating":"1","title":"American please","review":"Something went terribly wrong.

Goofy takes Max to weird places, but Max needs to get to the Powerline concert in L.A. to impress Roxanne again.

Unfortunately neither can the director as he left two scenes in where the players clearly make push shot fouls on the cue ball. Seems the movie is more about the rules of pool and how they apply to your life, that is if your life is about beers, bars, and shagging.

I did have to take my pasport out a couple times when I traveled to Mexico. The customs personnel needed it out of the binding to scan. I'm a little bothered by the embossed gold lettering. I feel it already has a worn look, which I wasn't expecting. I'm assuming that it may not last the life of my passport. But for the price I could afford to get another one in several years. Overall, I loved the pale pink color which gives it a little identity when you're traveling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Designed","review":"I got the black version.

I told me stuff I didn't know about him also. It has a lot of facts and tons of quotes. It's the first BSB book I've read and I've already read 3 times. I just got it yesterday.

I am not really a fan of them anymore, but here's what I have to say about this book. This book is so old and outdated! It has so much untrue junk in it!! Like for example: \\"Howie sleeps in his underwear\\" yeah, right!!!I think it's pretty mean to the fans that they said who they would all like to go on a date with. That's rude! And also, they had pretty nasty pictures of them! They all look so ugly in all of them! It also didn't have enough info and pix. Oh sure, saying their fav candy bar is really eye-catching info.

I mean, like they say Howie sleeps in his underwear! Yeah right! Where'd they get that from?! And the pix were REALLY ugly! Also, it said stuff like Nick had a crush on Christina Ricci. I don't think so! And it said that like all of them had crushes on Cindy Crawford! Nope! Don't waste your money on it!!! Get the OFFICIAL BOOK.P.S.

Though Americans frequently vacation in the Islands, and though West Indians have long populated the United States, the history, culture and daily lives of the people in that part of the world are basically unknown to most Americans. That will no longer be true after reading this book.So compellingly capsulated is the history that I found it at times even more engrossing than Oba's personal trajectory.

It's a sweet little book that suffers for the journalist's attempt to write using more adjectives and longer sentences and for its meandering narrative. Having said this it does make for a pleasant read on the way to a visit of Laos, for example, and as mentioned in one of the other reviews, it is often the side comments that offer the most interesting colour to one's view of Laos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monet Fan","review":"The poster is a good size (11x14) so framing is not a problem.

As a collector of music, it is a kick to find Silverstein work combined with the talents of some of Nashville's greatest players and personalities. I'm not inclined to run out and buy truckin' CD's, but I'm glad I found this one. Joe Sun's \\"Lovin' you is like fryin' bacon buck naked\\" and Sheb Wooly's \\"I don't look good naked anymore\\" are a hoot. Combine this with some really good Bobby Bare and Del Reeves selections makes for a thoroughly enjoyable assembly of songs.

Truckers and non truckers will enjoy this. It's great music with comedy mixed in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even useful as Toilet Paper.","review":"Just... plain... suck. The opening scene mistakeningly promised a much better book, but once the prologue was over, so was my interest.It seemed that the Author decided to write ~200 Pages of Story, and added a filler statement relating to how the main character thinks she is fat between every sentance of dialogue.Speaking of the Fat thing, if the Main Character had such insecurity problems about her weight as the Author insinuates, shouldn't Freddy have played on that? If she hates being Fat, that opens up some great (and completely unused) Nightmare ideas.Freddy also \\"forsakes\\" the glove towards the end of the book, stating \\"I don't need it anymore\\". The hints at School killings being more than they were to end the book was not only cliche, but boring.All-in-all, I am a Nightmare fan, I would have read it anyway, but this novel will just collect dust. In closing, I URGE you not to read this book unless you absolutely must."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculously goofy!!","review":"This book was nothing like the films... so juvenile and poorly written, I had to laugh when Freddy would make a kill. There were no scary things about this book just a goofy, comically stupid Freddy Kreuger, who wrestles a boy to death in tights,and turns into a zombie and eats the brains of another girl.Also, this novel took an eternity to go anywhere. The characterization was so painful to get through, I almost gave up on the book 3/4 way through. Then the book gets so far-fetched as Freddy slaughters the whole high school on a crazed rampage.I would skip this one. It doesnt have any relevance to the movies and is so comically stupid, I cant see how anyone can enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh...","review":"This book didn't do much for me. Suffer The Children and Protege had me hooked instantly. This book seemed like it took forever to get things going. Some parts were so down-right boring I actually skimmed thru just to see if anything interesting was going to happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning about Mehmed was educational","review":"I liked the way the author told the story of Mehmed. Mehmed was not a great person, but at least he was tolerant of other religions. What amazed me is,as a muslim, he did try to learn the Christian faith. But, then again, this is how people know their enemy. They try to learn all they can. They learn what fears they have and what they value most. He was a greedy conqueror, killed millions, and was a sick man who liked young boys. I would have liked to have more information on his whereabouts during his life, but it was an informative book that did not stray from many facts.

I'm a sci-fi buff, I love angels especially the Archangel St. Michael who is the leader in this series, and I'm always looking for something that will help my children embrace divine messages. I had hoped this would be a sort of sci-fi, teenage Veggie Tales. But that was not to be the case. I first watched this without my children. I thought it was awfully dark both visually and story wise, and I had trouble paying attention. Given that, I still decided to I let my children watch it. Granted, they are only 7 and 4 years old, but they didn't like it. When I tried to put it on a second time, they said \\"No, not angels!\\" Wow, that's not something I wanted to hear come out of their mouths."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poorly acted version of a pretty good book","review":"I've watched this movie three times. The latter two were an attempt to see who thought the casting in this was anywhere close to appropriate. George Segal seems to be enjoying some private joke the entire way through the picture. The lack of gravity and connectivity between the actors sinks the entire thing. The 'americanization' of Quiller just seems like some poor attempt to draw a North American audience.A very disappointing adaptation."},{"rating":"1","title":"very poor","review":"I bought this based on the actors. This is early in their careers and they do a poor performance. The audio commentary is equally poor. I am an amateur historian of this period and found the commentators very ill informed. I agree with the commentators that this should have been in black and white.As far as the quality of the script, it is no where near that of The Third Man or The Spy Who Came in From the Cold.It is one of many poor me toos cashing in on the success of early spy movies. Many professional critics also think that this is a poor movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth seeing.","review":"George Segal is a good actor, but he is out of his element in this type of movie. He is much better in light-hearted movies like \\"Fun With Dick and Jane.\\"The biggest disappointment is the dialog by Harold Pinter. The characters exchange meaningless small talk at cross purposes while nothing happens, and we all get bored.This spy movie is not even in the same league with \\"Day of the Jackel\\" and \\"The Odessa File.\\"I threw away my copy of \\"The Quiller Memorandum\\" after watching it once. I can't imagine ever wanting to see it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Spy thriller","review":"Interesting and different role for George Segal.

The enhanced 2.35:1 picture is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Period and Character Piece","review":"I was 16 years old when I first saw this film. It introduced me to Max von Sydow and George Segal not to mention the lovely Senta Berger. I was stunned by the film. I have since seen it many times incidentally on various TV channels. Now I want my own copy. The film had all the requisite suspense that I expected as a kid who had a WW II Dad and went through the whole of the Cold War and all the stuff we were fed then. But this film was so different; it showed a distinct image that contrasted with the 2-dimensional James Bond portrayal of the spy (which I also liked); Segal's wasa more European, more nuanced and, as usual, more subtly sardonic/humorous. Max von Sydow, as always is a brilliant actor. He plays both \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" characters with complete credibility. He is an awesome actor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I went to see Man Man play live at McCarren Park in Brooklyn after hearing great things about their live performances, but honestly, I wasn't impressed. Their sound was distorted and while the costumes were interesting they offered nothing new in terms of sound. Think of a Junior Varsity version of Mr. Bungle. Way overrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile","review":"I agree completely with the reviewer above in that using this book alone almost guarantees a 3. I used it without the courses and got 4's on both the macro and micro exams. Write those note cards for small concepts and study past AP extended response questions! They are all basically the same, so study the graphs and you'll do well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not that perfect","review":"This book is sure to fill a gap in that it gives a comprehensive overview of the theory of corporate finance. It is rich in examples and the interested reader can find numerous references at the end of each chapter.However, the book is sometimes awkwardly written: sentences are unnecessarily long and the logic of French grammar pops up here and there. A further concern is that models are never presented in a concise way (e.g. as in Mas-Colell, Whinston and Greene: Microeconomic Theory). Why would anyone discuss examples between presenting the objective function and the constraints? Sometimes it takes to read 3 pages to cover a model of 3 equations. This makes reading tiring as the reader might lose track of the actual model as they go through the examples.In my opinion, the text is aimed at graduate students and in general is good, but the flow of the text should be much-much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to throw away your money.","review":"Utterly, gloriously, preposterously illiterate.

These are very uncomfortable because the shoulder straps are not stretchy at all, so they dig into my shoulders, and they do not move with you at all. They just plain hurt!

I think its the nylon...but I will never be certain. I agree with the person who wrote a review that lace should be gone. It's nice enough bra without the lace.

The straps do not slip (a big complaint of mine of most bras), and since they are adjustable elastic, they are super comfortable and aid in the support the bra gives.When I found this style on Amazon, I was estatic! Now I can purchase 2 of these for what I would have paid for 1 in the department store.

If you are into photography, biology, botany or, last, but most certainly not least,fishing, you must buy this DVD.I own many outdoor related, hunting and fishing videos and DVD's and this is the best film of it's kind I have ever seen.

I'm sure that there must be loads of great tracks missing from this, as Dolly has had such a long career. And true, there is some schmalz from the early 80's, but overall, I think it will satisfy the casual Dolly Parton Fan.The first eight tracks are flawless, and that includes the fantastic melodrama of \\"Here You Come Again.\\" This is a departure from her earlier style, for sure, but she sings the heck out of it--it was a big pop hit for a reason. The rest of the collection is hit-and-miss, but includes the essential \\"9 to 5\\" and the single from \\"Trio\\"--the sublime \\"To Know Him is to Love Him.\\"A must have for anyone even remotely interested in Dolly Parton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another mix of the same old songs!","review":"In a career which has spanned four decades, why must BMG keep releasing the same songs over and over again?

So redundant is this latest \\"hits\\" package that Amazon does not even bother to list the songs on it. I've seen a track listing and trust me there is absolutely NOTHING new here. If you prefer Parton before she went pop in 1977 there is little here to satisfy you and if you prefer Parton after she went pop you no doubt already have all these songs on one of the previous four billion compilations RCA has released on what has pretty much become an annual basis. Either way there is NOTHING \\"ultimate\\" about this product and either way you don't need it.

If you haven't read the other books in the series, I have no idea how you'll catch on to what is happening in this one. What's more, why would you care? None of these people are appealing, as they were in earlier books. The first few chapters are maudlin and the mystery is boring. I get the impression the author is treading water with the book's plot in order to keep the series' plot alive. At this point they both look half-drowned to me. Add to that the incessant similes and metaphors that are becoming extremely annoying and you have a book that is hard to pick up and easy to put down.

Well, possibly. Is it about surviving the siege? Possibly.But I bought this believing that I'd have a unique approach to a woman's struggle during the long, devastating siege of Leningrad by the Germans. It does in that it touches on people starving, people dying, but the general focus is on her tenure as a guide (and packer) at the Hermitage and what her speeches were to this and that group. It attempts to be mystical and misses the mark. This book didn't hold together well for me.Chapters shifted back and forth between Marina's Russian life and her old age as her memory is receding...and the problems her husband has with her...and her daughter's lonely and complicated life...and you probably get the idea.The madonnas of the story are paintings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow","review":"It took a long time to get there.

Was it about the ravages of Alzheimer's disease? The saving of the precious artwork at Hermitage during the Siege of Leningrad? Marina's escape to America?It was none of the above for me and I was expecting so much more based on the great reviews here. The author has left more gaping holes in this story which pretty much ruined it for me. There was way too much time spent on describing paintings and not enough about the birth of Marina's son, how and when did the artwork get returned to the Hermitage, what happened to Marina's aunt and uncles children who were sent away?The author did too much analyzing of the painting and completely missed the mark on this one.

Living in the basement with little to no food rations she hears the bombing outside and sees the devastation from her watch on the rooftop.In present day, we find an elderly Marina and her husband travelling to a family wedding. Battling Alzheimer's Marina scarcely remembers her own daughter, but she is gripped by these memories of 60+ years ago.The author does a wonderful job of blending these two times together with seamless transitions from one era to the next and back again. In addition to the main story we are treated to some wonderful information about the treasures that were housed at the Hermatige museum."},{"rating":"2","title":"well written","review":"The novel is interesting for its historical aspect, but the most touching part was how the children had no idea of the privation and bravery of their mother in the past.

Vertually everything she expressed I experienced while reading the book. I am also left with the desire to research the Madonnas so beautifully described.

Dean has stripped the story down to the very basics, weaving a fascinating story about a Russian woman who survived the siege of Leningrad while bunkered down in a large museum with family, friends and other museum employees. The writing is smooth and polished, the story is entertaining, and the book flies by so fast that the reader almost experiences it as a dream, not unlike the whistful remembrances of the narrator."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lyrical Passage Between Lives","review":"The Madonnas of Leningrad is the poignant story of Marina, who survived the Siege of Leningrad during the Second World War. The novel tells the story of how Marina memorized all the works of art in The Hermitage Art Gallery after they had been evacuated from the museum; she would walk the halls as a mission to not forget the beauty in the hopes that one day they would return. Set during the deprivation and devastation of the times, Dean brings to life the artwork amid Marina's personal story of survival.Dean weaves the aforementioned story into Marina's present-day life which is tragically affected by Alzheimer's. The irony of having memorized great works of art only to come to the sad loss of her daily memories later in life is heart wrenching. Dean has brought her characters to life and has made the analogies between the two lives of Marina seamless. This is a story that will haunt me for a very long time. Highly, highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big gaps in plot","review":"The author is very perceptive and accurate in her depiction of the ravages of Alzheimer's disease. The description of the art works in the Hermitage museum in pre-war Leningrad is awesome but carried to an extreme in seemingly endless descriptions of art that needs to be seen to be fully appreciated. But the weakest element is the parts of the story that defy credibility. The birth of a perfect child after months of a starvation diet that results from the German siege of Leningrad after other babies had been stillborn or deformed. The timing of the birth had no significance to the plot as it unfolded and the reunion of mother and child with the father needed some explanation to make it credible. The premise of the story was interesting but the execution was disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars doesn't mean perfect.....","review":"I've thought about this book repeatedly since I finished it last week, a testament to how deeply it affected me. There is much to ponder, particularly the power of memory and the profundity of its loss. Marina is in her 80s, struggling with the early stages of Alzheimers disease. As her short term memory begins to falter, she drifts back to the dramatic years of her youth during the siege of Leningrad in WWII. Beautifully written, with nice transitions from the present to the past and back again without disruption.So what didn't I like? I found it unlikely (but not impossible) that her children would know so little of their mother's past, and I felt the story would be richer had there been more exploration of Marina's present circumstances. That having been said, I highly recommend this novel for its originality and its loving depiction of the waning years of a life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alzheimers and the FAll of Leningrad","review":"A compassionate picture of an old lady, who's sense of present reality is fading.

Picking up where \\"Blue Bell\\" left off, Burke is now a depressed recluse due to loss of his love. To make matters worse, an old flame named Candy reappears in his life. Candy had broken his heart and she now wants him to reclaim her daughter. Also reappearing in Burke's life is the psychotic assassin Wesley and the red-haired witch Strega. The book begins strong and then seems to become undone. However, Vachss masterfully pulls the strings together for an explosive (literally) ending to a satisfying piece of literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great noir literature, but do read the first three in the series before tackling this one.","review":"HARD CANDY is so much of a continuation of BLUE BELLE one truly needs to read the earlier novel first. Even better, just start with FLOOD and STREGA. This way, you have the full impact of how Burke is affected by the four title women. This fourth novel emphasizes the individuality of each title character and explains the change in Burke who is in some ways a broken man after the events in BLUE BELLE. However, the series is a big no no for those of weak heart and/or stomach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gritty but great","review":"Hard Candy is gritty but great like the rest of Andrew Vachss' novels.

The time to get there with maximum warp would be measured in decades.This was, if I recall correctly, the very same error that made Gene Roddenberry declare the fifth movie non-canon.

However, I just ordered this edition (Dodo Press), and the printing is terrible. The illustrations look like they are 3rd or 4th generation: very blurry. I appreciate that Dodo is trying to make books available that would not otherwise be available, but it really looks no better than if I typed the book, copied the PDF files of the illustrations, and slapped a cover on it.

I believe the player should have been capable of playing at least a thousand DVD's before a failure. I kept the player in a case in my closet so it wasn't setting out in direct sunlight or anything.

Her husband was Amenhotep IV, the very interesting Pharaoh who tried to change Egypt from a nation that worshipped many Gods into a nation worshipping only one, Aton, the god of the sun. Nefertiti was also the mother-in-law of King Tut.This is an interesting story. Interspersed are some photographs (mostly black-and-white) of Egyptian artifacts, locations, etc. If you can get ahold of this book without to much time or money expended, then great.

I give points for effort, mostly on Ice Cube's part! but this film is awful. it has nothing that stands out, the message could've been delivered better, though I do like the fact that it did have one! so it wasn't completely pointless, I just felt it could've been done in so many better ways.

He actually has a flare for being the underdog, the everyman who you root for even when he gets kicked around.This movie, however, didn't make the most of his talents. The story had potential for a madcap adventure. The kids, unfortunately, were the biggest problem. They were just plain annoying.

If you're looking for an enjoyable novel that will keep you turning pages, then forget Ahab, buy SUNRISE, and save yourself money in the deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"oni-licious","review":"a stellar release from this amazing instrumental UK-based band! taking the template of Zeuhl music and adding their own little creepy touches, the results are like a meeting between Goblin and Magma. the relentless rhythms state the purpose with repetition that just seems to build and build as layers are heaped on and pulled away. the drumming is fantastic and keeps the songs grounded in a propulsive style similiar to finnish drone rockers Circle. and the other instruments are great as well...the guitars, mellotron (can't have a proper prog album without a mellotron, now can we?), harmonium, the keyboards! actually, this band got alot better when they added the keyboard player and their albums seem to just get better an better. what's next, then?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle, Melodic Celtic Harp","review":"Myrdhin is a Breton harpist in the tradition of Alan Stivell. He mixes traditional Celtic melodies with modern arrangements and instrumentation. This CD contains music that he recorded back in the early 80's (and a few tunes from the late 70s). Mostly, it's just Myrdhin playing steel-strung harp and singing, backed by a bit of percussion, flute, and a few other instruments from the two other musicians who make up the \\"An Delen Dir\\" trio. Very pretty, very melodic, and quite folksy. I'm reminded a bit of Stivell's \\"Journee a la Maison\\". If you liked that (or other mellow stuff by Stivell), you'll probably like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the average reader","review":"This is a book you cannot read like a novel; even as a diary, it is hard to understand, because entries are short and there are many unintelligible initials and half-words.

Not a classic like Imagine or Plastic Ono Band but essential nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"But there is one great song....","review":"I love John, but this is one of his worst albums. If you're sampling his work for the first time, obviously \\"Imagine\\" or \\"Plastic Ono Band\\" are the two albums that are essential. This album is dominated by sub-par music with the exception of the hit single, \\"Mind Games.\\"But there is one outstanding and almost unknown track on this album and is one of John's better ballads, \\"You Are Here.\\" In this love song to Yoko, John sings it in an understated and simple way, right from the heart. The lyrics and melody are beautiful, reminiscent of \\"Jealous Guy\\" and \\"Love.\\"It's worth buying for this track alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The problem is the mix","review":"This IS Lennon's craftmanship album, no doubt. And the songs themselves are highly listenable; however, the production is not. The Mind Games songs on Anthology, like the Rock n Roll songs on Anthology, when stripped of the \\"wall of sound\\" that was added in post-production, shine like rough diamonds. Unfortunately, on this album, Lennon shows an inability to produce his own work. If this album were totally remixed, it would astound. Out the Blue, Intuition, Mind Games, You are Here, I Know, and even Tight A$, are great songs; they're just buried in a muddy mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Lennon Mind Games","review":"You know, I just got my hands on a copy of this CD, and it sounds great.I forgot how much I loved and listened to this album (an old friend has returned). There really is a lot of great stuff on here. I'll be tearing apart the songs to teach my students how to put songs together. The vocals are absolutely phemonmenal on this album. The balance between rockers, ballads and mid-tempo songs is terrific. \\"I Know\\" and \\"Aisumasen\\" are just beautiful songs, \\"Tight A$\\" is a really really good bluesy rocker,Meat City rocks with reckless abandon, and last but not least, there's the title track! This album never ever got it's just due which is a shame. Capitol should have a re-release party for this baby!!!!!(Why Not!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"5-star album, atrocious 'remix'","review":"This is probably my favourite Lennon album, the only rival being POB. It is a terrible shame that John's legacy seems to be in the hands of people who do not understand, value or respect his work. Everything else aside, WHY HAVE THE LAST FEW SECONDS OF THE ALBUM BEEN CUT? Do you think you know better than John Lennon who chose to release Meat City with its spoken tag?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good pop Lennon","review":"I think this album actually departs from the sound and mood of albums like Plastic Ono band and Imagine. This is Lennon trying to conjure that 'feel good' positive spirit of the early Beatles albums like 'A hard's days night'. You wont find any songs that match 'Imagine' or 'Working Class hero' here, but still, some nice songs to cheer you up. I have always thought of it as a 'light' Lennon album, but a good one. I agree, it is underrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"John's most consistent LP","review":"I'm astounded that the merit of this record is sometimes debated among hardcore JL fans. Even though fairly slick, it is perhaps John's most listenable and consistent LP, thanks in part to the top-flight studio musicians. \\"Mind Games\\" and \\"Bring on the Lucie\\" show his idealistic side and remain great favorites. The rest of the tracks are an engaging mix of light love songs (some contented and relaxed, others slightly melancholy), and a few odd and fun tunes. Never a bore. Lennon was nowhere near the melodicist of McCartney -- consider how many of his Beatles tunes, excellent though they were, featured hovering around a single note or two -- but he does an excellent job of stretching on the hummability factor with this collection. If you're new to the Lennon canon, \\"Mind Games,\\" albeit on the mainstream side, is an excellent album to begin with and to prepare you for his less consistent efforts, most of which also contain great gems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated Lennon","review":"I've always felt \\"Mind Games\\" was Lennon's most underrated album. While the title song itself is a bit cloying, many of the songs on the album are full of interesting guitar chords and a variety of song styles. Uptempo rockers like \\"Meat City\\" and \\"Freeda Peeple\\" sit comfortably next to gentle love songs like \\"One Day at a Time\\" and \\"You Are Here\\". In the middle are songs like \\"Intuition\\" and \\"Only People\\". Lyrically, this is not Lennon's best album, but it's highly \\"listenable\\", especially following the bombast of \\"Sometime in New York City\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Great!","review":"From the downright weird cover, to the unusual collection of songs, one gets the feeling that if Lennon would only have spent a bit more time and effort on this album that it would have been spectacular.\\"Intuition\\" & \\"One Day at a Time\\" have aged well.If only he had tried a little harder............But well worth a few listens, much about this was good. The use of subtle harmony, and razor sharp wit, is typically Lennonesque."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Sorry","review":"After the resounding flop of \\"Some Time in New York City,\\" one of the most hated and reviled albums of the rock era, John Lennon beat a hasty retreat with \\"Mind Games.\\" On this record, gone are \\"Some Time's\\" naive agitprop lyrics and radical left cliches; gone is any trace of Yoko Ono as co-writer or duet partner (?!!); and also gone, sadly, are the great musicianship and exhilirating production. This is the worst set of songs Lennon ever recorded -- one limp, whining apology to Yoko after another. And the production, as my friend Sean MacFalls used to say, sounds like glue. If you're getting into solo Lennon, then stick with \\"Plastic Ono Band,\\" \\"Imagine,\\" and yes, even the notorious \\"Some Time in NYC.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Cult hits","review":"I would recommend MIND GAMES as much as I would any John Lennon album. Lennon's IMAGINE, DOUBLE FANTASY and WALLS AND BRIDGES contain most of his smash hits. But MIND GAMES has what I call John's cult hits, radio-ignored songs that people mention as favorites when I tell them I'm a Lennon fan: \\"Meat City,\\" \\"One Day At A Time,\\" \\"Tight A$,\\" and \\"Bring On The Lucie.\\" Try it, you'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!","review":"The \\"Nutopian National Anthem\\" is truly a radical track in which Lennon makes it clear that silence is the most beautiful music of all. It is the best 3 seconds ever committed to tape by anyone anywhere at any time in the history of the world. The rest of the album is pretty good, too, but nothing can compete with the gut-wrenching honesty of those 3 seconds of true peace and quiet."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 1/2 stars, actually-- this one is far from essential","review":"the title track is good, \\"out the blue\\" is good as well. but overall, this is a poorly produced album (it sounds cluttered and messy) of mediocre filler material from one of popular music's greatest. Lennon's singing isn't even particularly engaging on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"It,s not great","review":"Probably the worst vocal wise i ever heard by Lennon Maccartny and harrison just helped him better. Don,t get me wrong Lennons voice and gutar playing is great I think here though he just did not care. GodBless"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Ain't Real...","review":"John Lennon wrote some of the most affecting music in pop history. To say he was capable of transcendant, brilliant work would in no way be an overstatement. Just listen to any one of his Beatles tracks, or any from his first two solo discs. And then listen to this...This is Lennon craftsmanship (as opposed to artistry...) Cliches abound (\\"Freeda Peeple\\", \\"Out The Blue\\", \\"Intuition\\")...and Lennon the craftsman does not equal McCartney. John can't turn a tune like Paul, and never could...The title cut is as close as he gets to anything of real merit, but the production is shrill and tinny. Too bad McCartney and Martin weren't around. No, it had to be real with John. and if it ain't, don't bother. And it ain't."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was my first John Lennon tape in 1976.","review":"And this is still my favourite of every thing I've heard that he or his estate has put out. Walls and Bridges is still the only album of his that I haven't had a chance to hear yet, so maybe my opinion will change one day. :)Until then, I like the overall texture of this album. From the softer songs like One Day At A Time (I had Elton's version first on 45) and Aisumasen to the harder-edged songs like Meat City and Freeda People, there's a great balance of tempo and emotion. A great look into where Lennon appeared to be in his life at the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing...","review":"Lennon creates a masterpiece without knowing it on this album. At first it seems overwhelming to most, but after repeated listenings it gets better and better.The Title track is eaisly the best song on the album. \\"Meat City\\" goes for second. \\"Out of the Blue\\" and \\"Intuition\\" are also great.The CD insert is also intresting. The drawings by Lennon are very entertaining.This Album falls short of 5 Stars because of the lack of worthwhile bonus tracks. The bonus tracks here are home versions of three of the songs and aren't worth the listen.An excellent album by a very talented musicain. Requried listening for all rock fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-par album from one of rock's greats","review":"Mind Games is far from Lennon's best. Plastic Ono Band and Imagine tower above Mind Games like the Empire State Building. By 1973, Lennon, like much of his generation, was burning out, and Beatles fans know he was not in the best frame of mind at this point. The title track is good but it sounds like the little brother of \\"Imagine,\\" one of Lennon's best songs. Another song, \\"You are here\\" is an undiscovered gem, but the album as a whole is poorly-produced and the rockers sound tired. Buy this CD if you can find it used for a few bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very worthwhile","review":"If not a masterwork like \\"Plastic Ono Band\\" or as heartfelt as \\"Imagine,\\" John Lennon's \\"Mind Games\\" is nonetheless a thoroughly enjoyable album that does not deserve its inferior reputation. The title track is as memorable as anything he's done, and even such featherweight songs as \\"Intuition\\" and \\"One Day at a Time\\" are almost as catchy and still a little deeper than most of what Mr. McCartney was doing in the same period. The ballads like \\"Out the Blue\\" and \\"I Know (I Know)\\" are touching, and the main rocker, \\"Meat City,\\" rocks as only Lennon could. A very worthwhile album to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good, But Quite A Departure From Cowboy Songs 3","review":"This album has a very different sound from his other Cowboy Songs Series. Not that it is bad but be prepared for a more \\"pop\\" sound on some of the songs, especially \\"Born To Buck Bad Luck\\" which is not really a true MMM cowboy song. I really think this album is good never the less. \\"Born To Be A Cowboy\\" is a classic while \\"Utah Carroll\\" is true to the traditional sound. \\"The Bunkhouse Orchestra\\" is a \\"square dance\\" type song that reminises \\"The Cowboy Christmas Ball\\" from his \\"Cowboy Christmas Album\\". I highly recommend this along with his even better album, \\"Cowboy Songs 3\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"marginal cowboy music; ok commercial country","review":"This cd is a departure from the true cowboy music in MMM's prior cowboy cd's.

Maybe a lot of the people hating on this movie are dang Atheists, and they were offended by that. Either way, Jack And Jill isn't near as bad as the dang critics said it was. And it actually ain't bad at all. And if ya'll got a problem with me liking, ya'll can kiss my dang grits!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful, pure torture","review":"Looking for a funny, light film to take a friend to who was having major surgery next day. She was so down after this so called \\"comedy\\" she vowed never to let me pick our film again. And, man, did I agree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jack and Jill","review":"By now, enough has been written about Jack and Jill that there's really no reason to beat up on it any more; that horse has been dead for a while. The most recent condemnation came when the Adam Sandler vehicle racked up a whopping 12 Razzie nominations, a feat made even more impressive by the fact that there are only 10 categories. Directed by Dennis Dugan, who has inexplicably cobbled together a career out of several terrible films, Jack and Jill is a screwball comedy about an advertising exec who receives an annual visit from his twin sister, who happens to drive him crazy. Despite an amusing extended cameo by Al Pacino -- playing himself -- Jack and Jill failed to impress me. If you're a big fan of Sandler's other films, you may get somewhat of a kick out of it, but if not, it's probably best to steer clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking???","review":"I sure wish I had read these comments before I spent the money on the horrible, horrible movie. Now I'm trying to think of who I dislike enough to give this dvd to. The funniest part was the very beginning and very end with the real twins. They should have stopped there. Al Pacino should buy up all these dvd's so they never get seen by the public. I can't believe he was even a part of this. Just wish I could have back that hour and some minutes of my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time and Money","review":"The whole time I kept thinking \\"what a waste of my time\\". I kept waiting for funny moments, they never came. Adam Sandler just needs to stop making movies, he used to be good, not anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to Watch","review":"I really thought I would like this, as I am a fan of Adam Sandler, but this movie is just awful. Not because of the potty humor - Sandler is famous (infamous?) for that, it is what we expect. But watching the character of Jill is absolutely painful! It is simply way too over the top. I couldn't believe that someone attached to the movie (like the producer or director) would let this get through. I was also shocked that Al Pacino agreed to be in it. Part of the storyline is that Jack is trying to get Al Pacino to appear in a Dunkin Donuts commercial, which they figure he would never do. I'm not sure why, because this movie is far worse than any commercial I have ever seen. Sometimes I think they start out with the best of intentions but the movie never comes together. This is one of those cases."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my $3.99 back.","review":"Wow,Adam Sandler went to a new low. Worst movie I have seen in a long time.

Please ban Adam Sandler from making another movie. EVER. Every predictable cliche ever was there. Mexican jokes? Yup. Jewish jokes? Yup.

HORRIFYING!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie as I am a big Adam Sandler fan. The previews were funny, but the rest of the movie was really lame and irritating. I do NOT recommend this one. Pass this up."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give NEGATIVE stars if I could..BORING!","review":"Possibly the most boring movie I have ever sat thru. Thank goodness it was only an hour and a half. Right at the 30 minute mark, I was thinking..how in the world can they draw this terrible movie out another hour?!Yes, it really is THAT BAD. It isn't even funny..nothing stupid, or typical \\"Adam Sandler\\" about it. Save yourself the time and money and SKIP THIS ONE!The only reason we kept this one in and didn't turn it off is b/c my husband and I kept thinking it would improve. We were wrong. It got worse. It is like one of those bad SNL skits...the kind that are more stupid than funny and they don't know how or when to end it so they drag it out WAY longer than it should be.We just did not find any humor at all in this one. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused","review":"I'm sorry for any one who has to endure this, even Sandler himself. I'm sure he will redeem himself.

The rest was a let down in my opinion. I love Adam Sandler but this movie sucked. There were so many talented people in it and it still sucked.On a side note, Al Pacino is a hack and couldn't act if he tried. He is the same character in every movie, how is that acting?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun movie for the family","review":"My family and I watched this funny picture from Adam Sandler about a twin's relationship. A creative concept that shows that even twins can be at odds sometimes. There are one liners and gags that will make you laugh out loud!I don't know why there are so many negative reviews, but the cuteness factor is off the scale!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't read negative reviews!!!","review":"If you love Adam Sandler's movies, you will love this one just as much. It is hilarious and cute. A typical Sandler movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"I know this film received a lot of bad reviews but I thought it was funny. I watched it with my family and they enjoyed it too. It isn't one of Adam Sandler's best movies but it was still fun to watch. There are worst movies by Adam Sandler, try watching Going Overboard. I also didn't see why Al Pacino would do this movie as the part wasn't right for him. I still recommend this movie for your family when you are in a silly mood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack and Jill Movie","review":"Pretty great movie, if you like Adam Sandlers other movies. Kind of reminds me of Billy Madison, but all his buddies from his other movies make cameos, David Spade, Dante from Grandma's Boy, etc. Worth a watch if you ask me."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's an Adam Sandler movie. What did you expect?","review":"If you watched this movie knowing it starred Adam Sandler, then you must have known it would be his typical humor. I had preconceived notions on what to expect from this movie and it surely lived up to my expectations. If I wanted to watch an intelligent, complex and emotionally driven movie I would have chosen something else.This IS Adam Sandler and all of his movies smell the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not a good film, a one time watcher","review":"I have been a big fan of Adam Sandler over the years, and seeing the concept of the movie and the previews for it, it looked like it could have been another one of his classic style of comedies (Like Billy Madison, Mr. Deeds, Happy Gilmour), but after watching it, it just didn't come together. They have a good cast, great material for the twin thing to work, but huge story gaps at times that make the film jumpy, and script wise, it just didn't deliver on the laughs for me. The character development was set up enough, but it just wasn't there. I would highly recommend renting this, or catch it on a premium cable channel so you don't have to have this collecting dust on your shelf. A one time watch, then discard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack and Jill","review":"i loved it. Adam Sandler is one of the world's greatest actors of all time. You should watch this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goofy harmless entertainment","review":"Our kids (10 - 16 yrs old) LOVE this goofy flick. A few slightly inappropriate jokes flew over the younger one's heads. Some more obvious (man dressed as woman and adjusting fake boobs), but overall pretty harmless. Silly, cute, and entertaining for the whole family (10 and up). Moral of the story: family (no matter how annoying) comes first and treat others well (even the ones you don't like that much)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Couldn't finishing watching it, I barely laughed except for when Jill got knocked out on the Price is Right.

C'mon Sandler you can do better than this :/"},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty lame","review":"Adam Sandler is another one who's movies just keep getting worse (like Sasha Baron Cohen). I don't know why producers think more crass = more funny. A couple of humorous moments but I don't recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny. Funny.","review":"I am a Adam Sandler fan. This is a great family movie. My 11 and 12 year old girls think it is hilarious! This was a huge hit for a Christmas gift!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish","review":"Oh man, I expected that all the negative reviews might have been people looking for something that wasn't there... which was true in a way I didn't expect. So glad I rented this and didn't buy it, it was painful from the minute I met Jill, Adam Sandler is a good actor, but this was overdoing it.Just to be clear, I can't think of a single movie I haven't just at least willed myself through, I mean, I paid for it, might as well watch it and hopefully it will get better. There was no way I was going to survive this whole movie, and I skipped around just to see if anything caught my attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"I ain't gonna lie...","review":"The movie had it funny parts but it all revolved around potty and/or body humor. I have to say that Adam Sandlers girl character seemed to be funnier than his boy character in this movie, it almost seemed like Adam Sandler himself did not want to be in this movie as a guy. There are numerous cameos from a lot of movie and sports people. I also have to admit to falling asleep during the last 15 minutes or so (we rented the DVD) so the movie isn't engaging enough to keep you awake (strike 1). Not much else to say about this one, I am pretty sure there is no sequel in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I am a Happy Gilmore, Billy Maddison, Big Daddy fan and this doesn't even come close.

Were they worth 90 minutes of \\"not very creative; nothing new; been done before slapstick\\"? The only part of the movie that was engaging was how far CGI and editing have advanced to enable the same person to appear to be in two roles within the same scene. I was going to say frame but it occurred to me that in our digital world frames may not exist anymore.Plot: Identical and annoying and not particularly Vogue cover material (what do you expect when it's a guy) sister comes to visit brother trying to avoid her as much as possible.

I may be biased, as I have a twin brother, but I really did like the film. Maybe you just have to be a twin to admire some of the humor, but Adam Sandler fans should enjoy this film.

I can not believe that Mr. Sandler had the guts to actuallyput this out for the public to view.Adam plays Jack and his twin Sister. He should have found a female to be his sister. It might havemade this flop a slightly bit less terrible. I found nothing funny with his portrayal of a female / sister.Sandler just doesn't do women well or funny.We all know that Adam Sandler can be very funny and very believable.

Al Pacino is also here, but he was horrible as well. Katie Holmes is also here as well as Johnny Depp. They are okay, but they alone can't save this movie.

I was hopeful that the movie would be funny yet mentally mature enough to give an educational viewpoint of the relationship of twins.WRONG! It's an ADAM SANDLER movie and one of his worse ones yet. As a viewer I was highly disappointed and actually stopped watching 25 minutes in because of all the horribly lame jokes. If I were a twin, I'd be offended by such a horrific portrayal of it.

He must have been down to his last 500 billion,and needed some more cash.The only positive thing,that I would have to say about this movie,is enjoying the eye candy,Katie Holmes.More wasted talent on such a god-awful nightmare.Overall,I DO NOT recommend this movie.It should NEVER be seen by ANYBODY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad","review":"This was a pretty bad movie.

Its typical Adam Sandler humor and I will be purchasing the film. Unlike movies that really shouldn't exist like Date Movie, Meet the Spartans, Dance Flick, Epic Movie, Disaster Movie, and Monty Python and the Holy Grail (all of which I feel made me dumber for having watched) Jack and Jill has a plot and puts humor to a situation that many people could relate to."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best Adam Sandler movies ive seen!","review":"i wasnt sure what to expect from this move.

This movie was so bad on so many levels. I found it also disheartening that so many people like diarrhea and fart jokes. What in the world is so incredibly funny about those things? The movie is also openly racist in addition to thinking it is funny to knock over old people? Where is the joke and why is that funny? What does that say about the American psyche that thinks that?This movie cost $79 million to make, lots of apperances by Sandler's buddies. Lots of money from advertisers, so where did the money go?

Jill walked like a man (to put it mildly) and didnt really look feminine in any way. She was over the top in acting (or should I say adam sandler was). Such a shame because there were so many famous people in the movie that it had the opportunity to be hilarious and fun.....but Jill was just overly annoying. Maybe if it was a man with more slender legs, thinner hands and one that was capable of walking without his legs so far apart, like how a dude walks, and not so much yell talking by Jill, this maybe maybe could have been really funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"When I seen the previews for this movie... I was very excited to see a new Adam Sandler movie coming to theatres. Adam Sandler's brand of comedy is definitely unique, so I was very eager to see his spin on playing his \\"twin\\".There are funny scenes in the movie, but it seemed stale to me.

It is a nice, fast chipset and it runs more stable with Windows XP than any other motherboard I have used (and I have used many). Also, you can't beat the price! The one drawback (if it matters to you) is that the K7S5A motherboards have NO overclocking options, only a 200/266MHz bus speed switch.

The sound on the video is perfectly awful. The level is absurdly low and turning up the volume only amplifies the hiss, behind which there is a muddy, indistinct shadow of the music. I only bought the video, in a moment of maudlin nostalgia, because I happen to be in it, playing my trumpet as a bright-eyed kid.

Ms Gabriel's book makes a strong case for resurfacing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design - very difficult to use","review":"We bought two of these, installed one, tried it for ten minutes, then uninstalled it and sent it back. Because:- If you mount it on a wall, the swivel design causes the roll to rest against the wall, and every towel you use will have wiped the wall first.- If you mount it under a cabinet it swings freely with no friction, so you need one hand to hold the roll steady and another to tear off a towel.- As others have noted, the open part of the arm must be on the right, because only one side of the holder is finished.Obviously we're in a minority, but for us this design is inferior to the tried-and-true approach in which the roll is gripped from both sides, with just enough friction to allow you to tear off a towel with one hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paper Towel Holder","review":"This is my favorite towel holder, ever.

Good thing it was a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smell aweful.","review":"I've bought a few philosophy cleansers & they were good.But this hope in a jar has unbearable smell. I put it on and the smell stays all day long.It makes me feel nauseous. I'm not exaggerating. My husband said the smell is not that bad so I think its not bad for everyone.I tried for 2 days & I have blemishes all around my mouth. I'm done with it.It was the one of the worst cream I have bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"smell too strong","review":"The eucalyptus smell is so strong & if you apply it near your eyes, it stings! Didn't do anything for my face despite the rave reviews. In fact, I've been getting red spots on my cheeks & an occassional breakout. I never experience these using Estee Lauder. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad reaction","review":"I was very excited when I received a sample of this from sephora after hearing and reading about it for years. However, after two uses I had to toss this....I developed some sort of reaction that made my face and neck itchy and red. Never have had a reaction like this to skin cream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Allergic Reaction & Rosacea","review":"So I purchased the small trial jar first..it worked out great...although it did give me some slight tingling feeling every time I put it on.Soon after, I bought the large jar for a big price! When I went in to see my Skin specialist a week after my small trial size was done...he told me I had rosacea!! I can't really use the product now coz it makes my rosacea so so bad! My face is all itchy and has tiny red patches again...! Have a bottle full and Don't know what to do with it...switching to Biotherm for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Allergic Reaction","review":"I used this product for one day, and woke up this morning with my face hot and red, swelling and little bumps all over. My doctor advised me to go to an urgent care center -- they gave me prednisone to take. I wish I had read reviews before buying this. My face is so swollen and itchy I had to take a day out of work. I don't have extremely sensitive skin, and I don't know which ingredient caused the allergic reaction. If you are thinking about buying this product, get a sample first and do a test. My face feels like I rubbed poison ivy leaves all over it. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Rosy glow, but not in a good way","review":"My daughter gave me her hope in a jar original formula moisturizer because she said it made her face break out. I didn't think much of it because we have different skin types and I have never had a problem with any other product. At least not until now. After using this product for 2 days, my face looks like it has a bad diaper rash. The prouct label claims it will help give your skin a \\"healthy rosy glow\\". I don't think they were referring to the red, inflamed, bumpy skin I now have. I am using hydrocortisone cream to try to calm my skin, but so far it isn't effective. I have read good things about other philosophy products, but would be very hesitant to try any of them after this experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fail","review":"I really do not like this moisturizer. It's a bit too greasy for my taste, although it does make my skin very soft and smooth. The worst thing about it is the scent, which is really bad. I don't understand why Philosophy can't make this stuff smell better. I do not recommend it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"I'm no stranger to Philosophy products - I like most of what I've purchased so decided to try this product as I was looking for another day cream. I thought it worked great. It gives you an almost airbrushed appearance. Make up goes on smoother and I find after using this, I don't need a primer. There are days when I'm in a hurry and forget to put this on and you can tell the difference immediately. (It's that feeling of looking in your rear view mirror in the morning and seeing the difference up close and personal - o m g - ugh). It diminishes the look of fine lines and wrinkles and gives my skin a much more supple look. Five stars - for SURE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best moisturizer ever! I finally have a glow to my skin!","review":"I LOVE this moisturizer. I have tried everything from drugstore products to department store products to pricey creams like Dr. Perricone...but hope in a jar is the best! It is light and absorbs quickly. My skin is clear, smooth, and finally has the healthy glow I've always wanted. I LOVE the scent. It smells fresh, clean, and natural, with a base of Lavender....which is one of my favorite scents. I guess some people either just don't like the scent of lavender, don't appreciate NATURAL fragrances or have never smelled lavender before, by reading the reviews. I love the scent, so for me, it's the icing on the cake. This moisturizer is perfect! (And I consider myself to have sensitive skin) Love, love, love!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy hell.. this stuff smells","review":"\`I am with a lot of other reviewers on here.. love the product but the smell reminds me of hair dye when you first put it on.

So I decided on this mousterizer and the cleanser. I wasn't too excited to pay so much. After I received my order I'd have to say its worth it. I love that its not a thick heavy cream. Its slides on nice and thin and I don't have to put more on after 10 mins. My skin is no longer flaky dry. Its awesome! My face looks younger. I LOVE IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible smell!","review":"I wasn't even able to give this product a chance. After just one use, I could not believe the smell. It smelled like burned plastic after applying it to my face. It made me sick to my stomach. The smell was even on my baby when I laid him down to sleep and I took a baby wipe to get it off of his head. It just smells so bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressedI","review":"I really wanted hope in a jar but that is not what I got. My opinion of a moisturizer is a cream with some texture. This was very runny. I did not try it for a long time so it could work I guess. I just did not like the texture. In the picture it looks like the cream is standing up. Maybe I got a bad jar....."},{"rating":"1","title":"My acne prone skin did not like it","review":"I heard so much about this product and was excited to try it. I have acne prone skin with mild scarring. I did not like this moisturizer. It broke me out and I did not see any improvement in my skin texture, tone or hyperpigmentation. I will not repurchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Sensitive Skins-- Perfume is Unnecessary","review":"Not for Sensitive Skins-- Perfume is UnnecessaryWhy would a company put such a heavy perfume in a facial moisturizer? It seems that the majority of the negative reviews are because of the odor.I usually use Clinique, or Bare Minerals which is completely fragrance-free. Even then, I sometimes get reactions (usually to chemical sunscreens that are in a lot of day creams).This product is not a good choice for women who have sensitive skin. It didn't make me break out, because it actually burned and I had to take it off immediately. This product contains Diazolidinyl Urea which is irritating to a lot of people (including me).Conclusion: Lots of good reviews, so I guess it's worth a try, but skip it if you don't like perfumed moisturizers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A window into the world of cancer","review":"This book slows down and allows the stories of these women to unfold. As each story is told and as each woman goes through their individual journey with illness, the reader is brought into each life and bears witness to the gravity of daily decisions - of preparations for life and for death. Linda Blachman deftly guides the stories, providing insight and context, but allows these real, three dimensional, flesh and blood women to tell their own stories in their separate and unique voices. This book was obviously a labor of love and the time and care taken by the author with each of the featured women is evident from the the first word to the last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read for Health Care Professionals","review":"Another Morning is a very powerful, moving and inspiring book. As a retired manager of a radiation oncology center, I believe that this should be required reading for all health care professionals who work with mothers dealing with cancer while raising their children. I admire these mothers for their courage and the volunteers and Linda Blachman for their compassion."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Meaning of Courage and Love","review":"With dignity and eloquence, Linda Blachman tells the stories of mothers challenged by serious illness. What they reveal is a gift for everyone: sick and well, male and female, parents and non-parents. The mothers' passion, grief and wisdom elucidates the true meaning of courage and selfless love. I laughed and cried and, in the end, regretted leaving them."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Life!","review":"Linda Blachman's finely crafted storytelling -- and the lives of the mothers whose stories she shares -- taught me more about my own life than I had dreamed would be possible. I found myself moved to tears, again and again -- tearsof joy and gratitude as often as tears of sympathy and compassion. This is not a book about death, but a book about the challenges we all face, and will face, as we make our way through this thing called life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Morning Goes Beyond the Expected","review":"First, I must tell you to consider the source: I tend to be more than a little cynical of collected personal histories. Too many times the personal stories are twisted by the writer into a plea for some specific cause or belief. Linda Blachman's \\"Another Morning: Stories of Truth and Hope from Mothers with Cancer\\" is a remarkable exception. Maintaining a compassionate distance, Blachman allows each mother to tell her story not only with her own words but with her open heart. The result is a series of characters who take the book far beyond the limits of its subtitle. This is also about hurt, anger, acceptance, love, and the overwhelming human necessity of storytelling. Blachman's voice and ideas are always clear but never overshadow these extraordinary women. This book is not only for the mothers and their children, it is also for the ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"T/C kit","review":"Every piece in this fabulous kit is vitally important to shooting and cleaning a muzzleloader.

The most absurd shot is at the end of the fifth movement (presto) of Quartet No. 14. I would have liked to have seen this part of the performance.

I think if funimation would have put the pioneer actors voices back in and left the music alone it would have been worthy of 5 stars but my main objection is the voice acting.

Though I recently purchased a second generation, lithium-ion (M18) hammer drill, I still have some old ni-cad tools for which my old batteries have died. I bought these first generation lithium-ion batteries and charger for my old cordless tools (among them one of my favorite Sawzalls-the Hatchet) so that I can put these older tools back into service, since they are compatible with ni-cad battery tools. I am satisfied as usual with my Milwaukee purchase-at an outstanding price from Amazon- and would definitely recommend this product"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised.","review":"After buying and trying the new Milwaukee Lithium-Ion batteries and charger, I must say they worked flawlessly.

Instead, it was a great disappointment. Besides being POORLY written, I shudder to think of any other man or woman using Margo as a role model of recovery or mountaineering. After reading her book, I was actually disuaded for sometime from climbing as I saw her complete failure to find any balance in life. I saw no success or victory in her story - only confusion, isolation and self-centeredness.I have NO idea why Margo wants to climb - she sounds utterly miserable on every voyage. Sounds more like her journey is to feed her ego, not her soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor little rich girl trading addictions","review":"This book clearly reveals the self-narcissism of the author as she uses her trust fund to subsidize her great \\"adventure.\\" It would be more interesting if she focused on climbing and the journey into health instead of her journey in trading addictions--climbing for eating disorders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tale of personal struggle that happens to contain mountains.","review":"Your enjoyment of this book depends on your expectation. I read it expecting a story about mountain climbs and backcountry experiences with a backdrop of a woman's struggle to overcome drugs and eating disorders. What I read was a book about a woman's struggle to overcome drugs and eating disorders that happened to have some mountain climbing info in it. This book is not for the serious climber looking for an inspirational book about mountains. The author spends so much time in self-diagnosis and criticism that the mountaineering pieces fade into the background."},{"rating":"1","title":"whiney rich girl trades addictions","review":"as a substance abuse counselor I shudder to think of readers believing that this woman is moving into health through her self absorbed journey into \\"accomplishment.\\" It is clear that she had traded addictions and needs to look seriously about parading her narcissistic 'adventures' as growth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Bible Study","review":"We are using this book in our women's Sunday morning Sunday school class.

At around 200 pages, the $40 price is hardly justified. Over 35 out of 200 pages are \\"applicable regulations\\" where the author copies and pastes pieces of applicable U.S. Code or other regulation. Instead of summarizing the codes for the reader, the author lazily puts it there for us to figure out for ourselves. The case studies are uninspiring and don't always cover ethical dilemmas very well (the Y2K chapter is simply a summary of what happened, and never goes deeper into the topic and who should have paid for the billions of dollars needed to prepare for the event). Overall, I would recommend finding another ethics book. While this one is an easy read, it is severely lacking in quality for the high price it sells for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never mind the bollocks","review":"This is quite simply the coolest record you'll ever own. Not to describe the character of the music, which is rather hotter than cool, but for the hipness cred that this album dishes up in spades, from a cover portrait that makes the band look cooler than any rock stars, to the sly album title (lifted later by the nifty Galaxie 500, in the ultimate hipster tribute). Then there's the music, too, which features great, tightly wound improvisations by Ornette Coleman and Don Cherry at their melodic and inventive best, against the suprisingly swinging beatnik beat of bassist Charlie Haden (who's walkin' it into the stratosphere) and drummer Ed Blackwell (who really rocks and rolls This Music).

To make matters worse, the advertisement on Amazon and from the store where it came from has the picture of the old product but when I ordered it, the new product came.

If you want to save a few dollars now, buy flimsier ones today, but you'll probably throw them out in a few years because they'll be bent out of shape and you'll have long forgotton what you did with those extra dollars you supposedly \\"saved.\\" These ones are worth the extra price and you'll have them for life. These also fit my wooden dowel closet rod (I guess more and more people have expensive custom closets with thin rods).

I purchased these hangars because it allows my work clothes to hang individually of each other. My previous hangars would always cause the outer pants to cover the inner ones and cause creases in them. They would also sometimes shed on the inner pants due to the design of the hangars.My only complaint with these hangars is that when placing the pants on the bar the hangar tries to run away every time. It a minor nuisance but overall I am very satisfied with this product and if you don't already have something similar, GET IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy looking","review":"I bought these together with Whitmor Chrome hangers.

Ok, here is the entire unconcluding movie plot: Ok, Ataru at a festival meets a princess that carries a bazooka gun. Lum as you would expect, tries to stop him from going in the princess' UFO. Now she used Ataru to get a love potion for her, because she was in love with a tofu boy. But Lum wanted it to give to Ataru. So the way that the drinker of the potion falls in love is that the drinker falls in love with the first person they see. (A spoof of cupid's arrow huh?)

Worse still is Frank Deford, the most prissy, irritating east-coaster who fits in that category; every over-mannered word that comes out of his mouth is excruciating.

This is what I paid hardcover price for?In her first books, Torey Hayden showed a certain passion that is simply absent from her current release. I felt she was simply stuck in a rut, churning out another book for a well-established fan base, and not really challenging her own artistic aptitudes (which, in One Child, were so prevalent).I still think Torey Hayden is an exceptional person, as many special educators and those in the humanities are, but I felt really let down this time.

They tend to not slide very well on our older, metal rods (they are also thicker than most newer rods) but I'm positive this would not be a problem on a plastic tension rod or something of the sort--just gets stuck on the metal I think!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for organizing all those baby clothes!","review":"These are great for an OCD person! haha.

I've only read The Yellow Wallpaper, but purchasing the whole book is worth this one story (even if you can find the story for free online). The story is disturbing on many levels and is great for discussing psychology as well as feminism. Awesome. I've read this story twice and will likely read it again, as well as the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Describes The Life of a 19th Century Woman: BORING","review":"While I appreciate that the author is likening the life of a 19th century woman to that of horrendous wallpaper I just found the story to be monotonous. Like wallpaper, a woman of her time was expected to be seen and not heard. Expected to look and act a certain way and if she didn't then there must have been something wrong with her. (So it was assumed... just like she imagines something is not quite right with the wallpaper.) But the tone of the story is definitely one of a woman off her rocker; a monotonous, frantic pace. I can't say that I thought it was a fantastic read and I probably would not tell anyone I know that they should read it. Two stars for just ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok short story","review":"I was angry that the woman allowed her husband treat her like an invalid. Speak up woman and be strong.

Its cast of shadow figures draw us into the narrator's shifting perspective with enticing descriptions and intrigue. An original simulation ride through cabin fever and derangement, the story can stand up to today's pacing. It may be low on gore and shock value, but still worth the trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"feminist horror","review":"The author drew largely on her own experience to write this gripping and harrowing tale of a woman sinking into madness despite (and in the author's opinion, partly because of) the efforts of her husband and doctor to help her get better. There's no violence or gore: the whole action is in the woman's mind as we witness the deterioration of her condition. Beautifully written and eerily scary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"Not only is this a prolific work of feminist literature, its an effective piece of weird fiction as well. id highly recommend to fans of either genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a little gem!!","review":"I really liked this little gem of a short story by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. It came to my attention as a film currently shown on Netflix, but the contemporary horror film has little to do with the gothic-feminist story. However, both the novella and movie are equally creepy in their own way. I couldn't sleep after watching the movie and the book gave me much food for thought. I now want to read more of the author's work. I highly recommend Charlotte Perkins Gilman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark and Gothic","review":"This was a dark short story with a spooky gothic edge to it. The work is both a warning and a political statement. It seems Charlotte Perkins Gilman was prescribed a similar regimen as the protagonist of The Yellow Wallpaper - strict rest for a nervous breakdown. By strict rest, the doctors recommend NO activity - not even reading or writing. Laying in bed all day is enough to make someone go insane, isn't it? Gilman depicts the narrators demise and she descends into madness.It is also a political statement in regard to the oppression of women and feminism. It's true that women would be instructed to rest in bed and do nothing else for weeks at a time if there were signs of anxiety. Unfortunately, they had little or no choice in the matter. Gilman is making a statement for women in this short story. It's well worth the read if you have about an hour to spare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"What a great and terrible story! A very short read but thoroughly entertaining. A glimpse into the past and the struggle women faced."},{"rating":"2","title":"it touched somewhere i didn;t know existed til i read yellow","review":"The yellow wallpaper struck a chord inside I never knew was there. I felt her peeling her personality through the layers in the paper. The other women talked about felt like she was trying to show you what a woman goes through after the birth of her child. She can change and people don't understand that you have to change your personality with your roles in life. It takes you through her role as wife, friend, mother and woman. It confirms to other women, yes, you can do all these roles, sometimes all at once, sometimes seperately, it is just extremely hard to change from one instant to the next. You can feel her life change through your soul with hers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic - Must Read","review":"This is not only one of my favorite classic pieces of literature, it inspired my first novel A White Room.

Buying it assures a loss of the purchase price, in addition to anything you are silly enough to invest using this 'method.'Statistically, there is no correlation between returns of a stock from one period to another. In simple terms, they are random. Mr. O'Neil is pretending that he can somehow predict a random event. Believers of this probably also think they can consistently predict roulette numbers and die rolls. There is a disingenuous population of commission seeking, transaction-fee collecting charletans telling everyone they can 'beat the market'. At least the casinos offer discounts on buffet dinners to their victims."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"It has no fundamentals, nothing that can help you, only a so called method that's garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is for kids","review":"This book is garbage.

O'Neil begins his book \\"How to Make Money in Stocks\\" by describing the characteristic a company should have to be considered a growth stock. These characteristics include such things as current quarterly earnings per share, annual earnings increases, new products, new management, new highs, leader or laggard, institutional sponsorship, and market direction.

However, advanced or even mid-level subjects are not covered at all. Trading is not that simple. Don't let anybody fool you. So you need to study and learn from traders like Ed Seykota, Linda Raschke, Toby Crabel. These are professional traders. Check on EBAY if there is anything for sale from them. Buy it. Study them.

That's why it's very important to know how to choose them especially if you plan to take advantage of them on a daily or weekly basis.One site that I recommend is MomentumStockPick com.

I recommend starting with his CANSLIM method and then adding your own personal touches (finacial statement analysis, technical analysis, etc.) This way you save valuable time in your stock selection and have an even greater chance of success. No wasting time evaluating the \\"DOGS\\" of the market. Use CANSLIM to easily zero-in on the stock market WINNERS! Chock full of \\"O'neil-isms\\", such as, \\"All stocks are bad, they're only good if they go up\\", this book is not only enlightening, it's also entertaining. It's too bad that Mr. O'Neil has not garnered more media attention for being the genius that I think he is.

Turns out, it's an entire ad for IBD and CANSLIM (more like CANSCAM). This book was probably the most useless book I've ever read. Why? Because he constantly talks about EPS and why it's the king of the stock market. Reality is, just because a company has a good EPS, or even a good percent increase in EPS, DOES NOT make it a good stock to buy!! And he drills the opposite into our heads with this book.

It is very good at explaining the KEY items to look for in selecting stocks. The areas of weakness are in defining the sections of a stocks graphical profile, i.e. base, correction and consolidation. For a novice investor, which I am, I don't know how to see a \\"base\\" and the book doesn't describe what one is. I also don't know how to pick out \\"price consolidation\\".

I agree with a previous reader that the charts are way out-dated. O'Neil needs to better explain some of his theories regarding the stock market. As an investor who likes to read investing books, \\"big disappointment\\" would best describe this book.

I do not believe that a person following the strategies in this book will attain satisfactory long-term returns in the stock market. The charts presented in the chapter on technical analysis do not represent the cup-and-handle patterns which he claims represent superior buying opportunities. They are very vague. The practice of concentrating a portfolio in small-cap stocks, and using a -7% stop loss is a good way to generate a 7% loss in your investments on an ongoing basis. On the positive side: his discussion of evaluating earnings reports is useful. Every investor should know how to read an earnings release, and evaluate a comany's balance and income statements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blatantly Self-serving","review":"I bought this book alongside The 4 Pillars of Investing by William Bernstein. These two books were polar-opposites in their ideology of investing. Bernstein examined the contrary views typified in O'Neil's book and gave concrete evidence as to why the ideas are nonsense.

The use of chart patterns that O'neil loves is closer to astrology than finance.The book talks about fundamentals (earnings, growth, etc), but in a very limited way. Using fundamentals according to O'neils way can easily make you lose your money!A much better book on growth investing is \\"The Little Book That Makes You Rich\\".

There's no high-flying investing lingo, and you don't need years of experience to follow these principles to start PROFITING in the market.

I've tried many different hiking socks, including some of the more expensive Wigwam styles such as Ultimax, but a few years ago I found the Wigwam Coolmax hiker sock and have bought nothing else since.Wigwam Coolmax socks have good cushion to prevent blisters, they wick away perspiration to keep your feet cool & dry even on hot summer days, but the socks are also thick and warm enough to wear in winter down to about 20 degrees F. The socks last an average of 2-3 years of very heavy use, usually wearing out on the sole. I've only had one sock that lost elastic on top, and that was likely due to a cut in the fabric from a sharp rock.

There have been a couple of VHS tapes, but no CD.The performance here is very strong, and the sound is very clean, but I'm unhappy with the way Fripp has mixed his own guitar way back. What's up with that? Even on \\"Sartori in Tangiers\\" and \\"LTIA III,\\" which are Fripp showcase tunes, he's not out front enough. Adrian Belew is a darn fine guitarist, but what primarily makes this band unique and interesting is the presence of TWO very different world class guitarists.My only other quibble is the absence of \\"Sheltering Sky,\\" which was dropped from the set list for that tour. Nothing can be done about that now, of course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spotless performance from KC's finest live line-up","review":"Pop Kulcher Review: Crimson continue to reissue concert discs from various points in their career -- and I simply cannot understand why it is that only the Dead and Crimson are doing this, when it seems like a cheap way of appeasing fans' desire for live music. Oh, well. This time around it's a show from 1984, at the end of the band's highly successful Fripp/Belew/Levin/Bruford combo from the early 80's. All the hits from that incarnation are here (\\"Elephant Talk,\\" \\"Thela Hun Ginjeet,\\" \\"Sleepless\\"), and are far more exciting live than on the original studio albums.

That said, one or two songs in the live set (the LP) wavered a little so I'm guessing this was mastered from a vinyl source.

The band themselves expressed their dissatisfaction with it in the CD liner notes.

It is actually three books in one: the disintegration of the world, the establishment of a new collective culture, and the moral weights of leadership. I initially read it as a post-apocalyptic novel and was rewarded with a philosophical treatise on the loss of a way of life and the dangers of man oversimplifying himself. The development of the tiny band's subsequent generations is more terrifying than a plague wiping out the planet. It is a story of 'what man wrought' but not in the way one anticipates. Originally classified a \\"science fiction\\" novel, now, with time, it must be categorized as literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"An oldie but goodie","review":"I read this book aeons ago when I was in high school - of course back then it was a lot heavier (chisled in stone). It's a great book - though a bit antiquated and an interesting twist on the post-apocalyptic genre. The symbol of the single jack hammer has stuck with me through the years to the point that I never pick up my one handed sledge in the garage without thinking of the story. If you've never read it, you are missing a real treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating, and dated","review":"I would have given this book fewer stars if I had been able to put it down. In spite of the stilted prose, odd inaccuracies, and generally bleak view of human nature, Earth Abides' end of the world scenario is completely gripping. There's none of the pseudo-mysticism of The Stand, just pure mid 20th century sci-fi goodness. Some of the scenarios Stewart presents aren't very subtle, and his views of women and blacks are what you might expect from 1949, but if you're at all interested in the \\"what happens after a mysterious virus wipes out most of humanity\\" scenario, Earth Abides is worth a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing.","review":"I read this for a geography class in college. Boy, what a downer. Think Little House on the Prairie meets Mad Max, it's that skewed and contorted. Moments of trying to rebuild are perpetually dashed. In truth, what we have here is the story of a man trying to recreate the past, and how a world gone wrong prevents him from achieving his dream. He is in essence, powerless to do anything about it for the forces against him are nature itself.I do not recommend this book unless you like to read about characters who have no hope whatsoever. I think the one plus is that it's set in the San Francisco Bay Area, so there's a kind of tangibleness to it from this reader.Beyond that, I should've trashed or donated this thing ages ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Great, Kindle Edition Sloppy","review":"This is one of the great books of the 20th Century. Unfortunately, a poor job was done producing it for Kindle. It seems to me that the print edition was scanned using Optical Character Recognition software and not proofed. It is full of misspellings and incorrect words due to the software limitations. If Amazon expects us to pay for this, they should make some effort to be sure that their product is correct!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Characters","review":"This was one of the early end of the world novels where the survivors try to restart society. Though there is a lot of scientific inaccuracies, what makes this book great are the characters. If you liked Stephen King's The Stand which also had great characters, then you should like this one.The main character is Ish. Ish seems to be someone that we all strive to be. Caring and smart. Ish also, has the son that we all wish our children would be like. Ish's son is the smartest of all the children and he simply idolizes Ish.Ish uses a hammer (a basic, I guess Stanely model) as his symbol of power (or his sceptre) over the survivors. Undoubtedly, the hammer is to pass to Ish's son when Ish dies.The big project for the survivors is to get an old automobilie repaired enough to explore other lands and try to find other bands of survivors and get civilization back on its feet. I don't want to give the rest of the plot away only to say that this project turns out to be a big mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"My 12 year old daughter is reading Alas, Babylon right now and was discussing the plot with me.

What a compelling story about the potential future of mankind. Should be required reading in school"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant","review":"I first read this book about 20 years ago, it caught my eye because the opening date used in the book is my birthdate 12/22/47. Have read it many times since and it never fails to make me re evaluate my current situation and really look at what is important and what is not. This is a must read book for me at least once evey 18 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandfather to all the post-apocolyptic literature of today.","review":"Read this book when you're really depressed. You will realize that things are not all that bad. Earth Abides provides hope. Even if everything we hold dear, everything we assume to be permanent, everything human disappears, the dream will survive.This is not the metaphysical good v. evil crap of Stephen King, nor the bang-bang rootin' shootin' end of the world of the pulps, but a quiet look at what the world would be like if mankind silently slipped away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious, tedious, tedious","review":"The book held great promise in the first few dozen pages... a believable plague and a believable reason for the protagonist to have survived. It goes rapidly downhill from there. The lead character, Ish, is pompous, self-absorbed, grating, and oh so very tedious. Even giving credit to the fact that the book was written in 1949, there are some very basic errors. Canned goods don't remain safe after 20 years, nor does gasoline remain usable. I kept reading hoping that the book would go somewhere, but it really never did. If you must download this book to your Kindle, do yourself a favor and pull down the sample. Read it, enjoy it, and move on. There's NOTHING more there. If you persist, don't say that I didn't warn you."},{"rating":"1","title":"I \\"Ish\\" I hadn't bothered to read this book","review":"2 stars for the \\"human\\" emotional experience but the book lacked excitement and was mostly dull and depressing. The year of the rats, grasshoppers, etc. How original - not. The only thing the people did was marry more than one wife and breed. No one learned from \\"George\\" on how to keep the plumbing and houses in good order. No formal schools were set up so everyone learned to read so civilization could rebuild itself. They talked and made plans but never followed though.Ironic their small group refused to breed with a pretty but dim witted female because they didn't want dim witted children yet in terms of learning, each successive generation became dumber anyway. The author must like caveman because his little \\"tribe\\" is rapidly devolving into that era."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"I know this is considered a classic, but, in my opinion, it does not pass the test of time. None of the characters, including the narrator, Ish, is engaging, and the passivity of the survivors is hard to accept. I don't need zombies to make PA fiction exciting, but reading about survivors who basically just live as if nothing has changed, happy to eat canned food is dull and depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is insulting","review":"It's been awhile since I read this book, but what I remember about this book is that it insults you and basically says that if you haven't gone to college and grad school that you cannot be intelligent or sire intelligent children. The author writes this book about the one truly intellegent person left alive. He portrays the rest of the survivors, who are average non-college educated, blue collar types, as little more than simpletons. The main character and the author doesn't even try to have the survivors learn to use the left over technology to help better their situation because they are too dumb. When they reproduce only Ish sires an intellegent child. The rest of the chilren are all dumb like their parents. Bah, that's it. My hatred for this book is off my chest. I don't reccommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Flat Earth","review":"Having loved this story 20 years ago as a teenager, it pains me now to find that it is surely the most badly written book on my bookshelves. All the characters are two-dimensional. The dialogue is uniformly stiff and amateurish. Worse, there's a faintly fascist tone running throughout the entire story that I failed to notice as a callow youth, but that now reveals itself on almost every page. Perhaps the saddest aspect of \\"Earth Abides\\" is that the story is clearly and shockingly the fantasy of an author who was very probably an insecure misfit who dreamed of existing in a world without people, or at least with just a handful of simple folks over whom he could rule as their intellectual master. If Stewart had spent some time in analysis, \\"Earth Abides\\" might never have been written. It is a truly awful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boredom Abides","review":"I love post-apocalypse fiction, but I can't figure out why everyone likes this one. The first 1/3rd of the book is great, as the main character experiences what becomes of his world after everyone else dies. Then it's as if the last half of the book was written by a female. It's mostly introspective, about how the character feels, and nothing really happens. If you want a page turner from front to back, read 'Alas Babylon','One Second After', or 'Without Warning'. I would donate this book to my local library, but I would feel guilty knowing some poor guy might pick this up and waste as much time on it as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jingle Bells Abides","review":"Great story of what would happen if a lazy / self proclaimed intellect survived the human apocalypse.

If the thought of the human race dying out and mother earth thriving gives you the warm fuzzies, then this book is for you. After the major opening disease-kill tragedy there's *some* hope for man... then less hope for man... then a little more hope for man... then a *lot* less hope, and on, and on. It's an emotional roller coaster that, on average, only looses altitude. In the end, earth wins, man looses. I had 100 pages remaining to read and finally had to flip to the last page so. I. could. just. \\"end it\\". Yuk. Two weeks later I still have a bitter taste in my mind. If you like sci-fi's such as \\"ender's game\\" I predict you'll hate this book too. My hope here is that I've saved somebody else the pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and poorly written","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. It was slow, boring, filled with uninteresting characters, and the writing was extremely stilted. And I couldn't suspend my disbelief enough to accept that automobiles would still operate after sitting around with gasoline in their tanks for thirty years.

Cars don't run on 20 year old gas, canned goods go bad after time, You should probably learn how to grow your own food and get your own water before 20 years has passed... This book is not only dated, but just plain stupid in it's aspects of survivalism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and drawn out - this may be a classic, but it was extremely boring to me","review":"First, let me start off stating that I know this is suppose to be a classic; however, I found little to like in this book. It is a very, very long story where nothing happens...really. After a couple hundred pages I started to skip forward, looking for something to peak my interest. Nothing ever happens in this book...let me sum it up for you. 1) Plague, 2) a few people find one another, 3) they plant plants, 4) they plant more plants, 5) they watch the ants and rats die out, 6) they have kids and scribble on a rock for 20 years, the end.If you want to read a great post-apocalypse book, get One Second After or The Road. Either of these books blows this dull piece out of the water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting, entertaining and amazing","review":"I read this book based on other reviews - having searched for good post-apocalypse novels. After reading Cormac McCarthy's \\"The Road\\", I was preparing myself for a depressing, yet thought-provoking read. \\"Earth Abides\\" was a thrill to read, and I kept turning back to remind myself that it was originally published in 1949! I thought the complete absence of any \\"modern\\" references to today's highly computerized world would make the story instantly outdated, but in fact, the opposite was true, for if we lost power, we would have to revert to very basic skills, just like Ish and his tribe did. This truly is a book that will stay with me for a very long time. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dated but still very good book","review":"This is the granddaddy of post apocalyptic novels.

Becausewe grew too prosperous we had to die, according to the author, that is just the way things work. So the few survivors get by never trying to improvetheir lives, having no ambition the human race lapses into hunter gatherers with only superstition as a guide. Thisbook is a waste of a good oportunity.

It hooked me on PA fiction and ever since then I have been trying to find as many novels or movies that I could get my hands on.I had read good things about Earth Abides online and was looking forward to reading it. Can I say how disappointed I was? Perhaps it was the era in which it was written, but all I could think of throughout the book is that the new civilization would have been much better off without the pompous a$$ of the main character Ish. \\"They thought of me as a God.\\" Good grief!If I could have rated this movie a zero I would have. Take this one out of the library if you must, you'll be glad that you didn't waste your money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stilted and Clunky Writing","review":"Even if Stephen King did base THE STAND on this book, he takes the idea of a world-wide plague and develops it much better than Stewart. I understand that EARTH ABIDES was written in the forties, but the stilted style of writing used and the attitudes and world view of Stewart's main characters are so jarringly anchronistic that I could never forget I was reading a book --- it never transported me into the world that the writer was trying to create. The italized asides within the chapter explaining what was happening elsewhere (i.e., lice, cats, ants, etc.) were interesting but not enough to save the book as a whole. LUCIFER'S HAMMER, WAR DAY, or THE STAND are all much better \\"end of the world\\" type books"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best EOC book I've ever read","review":"I read this book in '75. Since then I've been pretty much obsessed by it and other eoc novels (End Of Civilisation). I've looked for a book that had similar 'feel' to it. Unfortuntaly 'The Stand', 'Alas, Babylon' or 'Swan Song' don't capture the same magic. The closest I've come to simulate the read experience that was 'Earth Abides' is Alfred Coppel's 'Dark December' or Brian Hodge' 'Dark Advent'.Out of all 300+ eoc novels I've picked up over the last 25 years, 'Earth Abides' STILL ranks as the best.

At the time I didn't care much for reading, but I read Earth Abides cover to cover. The book changed me, turned me into a reader and then a writer. That was over 30 years ago, and still I so often think about various sections in the book. Now, here I am, ready to purchase another copy and reread the incredible novel, just to see again how it still so deeply affects me. Earth Abides is powerful, memorable, and deeply moving--it is everything a book should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"What A Great Read!","review":"I remember first reading this book in High School almost 30 years ago - the story of Isherwood Williams and his struggle to survive in a world where 99% of the people have perished in a biological holocaust. Well written, it keeps the readers attention pretty much throughout. While the book suffers a tiny bit of \\"out-dated-ness\\" (no mention of cell phones, or the internet) it is still an excellent and well-thought-out read about the demise of our techno-centric civilization.

Normally, I love exploring the delicious idea of an end of the world scenario, then having the opportunity to start over. But, I was amazed at how much I hated this book. The characters simply showed little redeeming value and did little but live off the works of the last surviving generation. God, how I slogged through the entire book, hoping that it would get better, that I was going to learn some valuable life lesson or something. It never came. When I finished the book this morning, after reading it in spurts over a period of a month, I really was depressed!The writing is workman like, which is sad, because there's not a poetic line in the whole book, with the exception of the title itself.

Now, I'm 68 and purchased it thru Amazon and re-re-read every word in detail. It is still a tremendously powerful novel and challenges the readers to place themselves in the past and future.

I love the line \\"between the plan and the fulfillment lies the frailty of human life\\". so many quotable and thoughtful quotes. this is not for sci-fi readers who like action-packed plots - this book has depth, it satisfied me as a realistic portrait of life after an apocalypse. in fact, if there really is an apocalypse, i believe those who had read Earth Abides will be more than prepared to deal with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts off decent, then gets painfully boring","review":"I love the apocalyptic genre. I had high hopes for this book and it started off good as the main character travels across the country during the aftermath of the disease (which he did not witness first hand while it was happening). After he meets up with a group of fellow survivors, they form a small community and from then on the whole book just seems to be pointless and boring. I got excited when the main character's two sons decided to take a trip across country, but the story line did not follow them on their trip and we found out little of what they saw and experienced when they returned. That infuriated me. Overall, this book was disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Earth Abides review","review":"I've read many of the \\"apocalyptic\\" books. This was a quiet one. Since it was written in 1949, that might explain that. It was a pleasure not to see the F-word at all, and so many of the other obligatory modern slang phrases. It did avoid any positive reference to religion, so it is \\"modern\\" in that respect. Not exciting at all, and somewhat sad. Probably would appeal to women and those who consider themselves as intellectual or literary critics.

I quit, and honestly I almost never do that. Ish is maybe the most detestable figure I have ever had the displeasure of meeting on the page. He's a passive aggressive psycho, a terrible father and leader, and the last man you would want to rebuild civilization. In this type of scenario, anyone with any intelligence that came into contact with him would disengage quickly. I simply might have shot him for being a drain of precious resources. If the whole point centers on the fact that most or any man would fail in this situation, I would have preferred that Stewart kill off Ish in a 20 page short story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, I just didn't get it.","review":"I see many people loved this book, but having just finished it, I just don't get the appeal it has for so many people. I found it incredibly boring and tedious. I do not exaggerate when I say I spent an afternoon struggling with it, nodding off to sleep every two or three paragraphs. To his credit, Stewart raises a number of issues about science and human nature, but it is done in the context of an uneventful story.

Worst main character in a book ever. Annoying, Lazy, sexist, racist, boring and anti-religionist. Maybe it was the slow story line. Maybe it was the fact that NOTHING happens to the characters after the first 100 pages. I don't know. But I hate this book. I felt like yelling \\"Get up and do something!!\\" The power goes out and he sits. The streets start to flood and he sits. The water stops running and he sits!!

Since I approached the book fresh, the flaws are glaring.The main character, Ish, is pretty dull. There isn't much dialogue in the book, so most speech is communicated through his hearing others and describing what they meant. Since he's not particularly insightful, reading is slow and the pages creep by.Civilization seems completely lost despite the fact that books, machines, etc. remain intact. Ish rules The Tribe, who are a step or so above a Neanderthal group. They even walk from place to place like hunter-gathers.

But then it descends into the comfortable and the suburban. Is this the fate of all human communities? More disappointing was the ugliness of some decisions made by the community - and for me these were far from inevitable or even justifiable. These were presaged on p132 of the SF Masterworks edition - '... except for Evie, the half-witted one, who should never be allowed to have children.' How attitudes have changed since 1949 when this book was written!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If this is who's left after then I hope I don't make it","review":"This book is about what is wrong with us as humans. The beginning of the book is very interesting as the main character, drives around the country to see what is left in the aftermath of the disease that has wiped out most of the population. After that the book goes downhill. The characters are not that likable. The children are brats, and the adults lack the conviction to make them better people. The items which are in the story aren't realistic (it is very unlikely that gas would not be usable after 20+ years even if stored well), and overall the story just wasn't very interesting to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Earth Abides","review":"Was disappointed in this book. Expected there to be more action and survivors to be more aggressive in making a better life for themselves. In my opinion people would not act this way in a disaster. They would try to make things better."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time and one of the few books that I can re-read. Oddly enough I almost find at times I want to live in the horrible world that is created in the story. Maybe that says more about me than it does about the book though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Earth Abides","review":"A must read for fans of apocalyptic fiction. Even though it was published in 1949 nothing about the book seems dated. It deserves its ranking (by David Pringle) as one of the 100 best Sci Fi novels of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Earth Abides: The Drinking Game","review":"Every time the protagonist passes judgement on other characters, have a drink.Every time the protagonist compares himself to a god or demi god, have a drinkEvery time the protagonist says \\"Oh! Mother of Nations\\" or \\"Oh Joey!\\" have a drink.Every time the protagonist refers to himself as the last American despite there being evidence that other communities of survivors have formed, likely with their own elders, take a drink.Every time you find an editing error, have a drink.You may want to take it one chapter at a time so you are not utterly intoxicated. The book was most interesting for the interpretation of what post pandemic America could be like. However, the story moves slowly and the dialogue is stilted and awkward. Not as good as I had hoped for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Naive","review":"I know this is the grandfather of post-apocalyptic fiction but some of the attitudes expressed in this book are so dated and unrealistic that they pulled me out of the story. There are lots of poetic passages and lyrical writing but the hero is surprisingly unsympathetic and uncharismatic for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"a beginning that sizzles, an ending that fizzles.","review":"An aging story. I liked the book on a whole, but the middle and end dragged into tedium.The first half of the book was very interesting to me, and I enjoyed the writing immensely. The last half of the book, on the other had was very, very slow.By the time the end came I was ready for it to be over, and did not much care what happened to everybody after that. good riddance."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Earth Abides by George Stewart","review":"I first read this book in the 60's as my husband and I were in university. I carried it for about 20 years and lost it and life took over and I never replaced it. But my mind has continued to reflect on passages, in fact, I will tell someone how racial prejudice starts and I got it from this book. It covers a frightening time but the ingenuity, focus, and just \\"I will not die\\" leaves in the reader ideas that will live with you forever.This morning, I couldn't stand it and went to look for it and found it here at Amazon. Thank you, thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable in it's depth, timeless in it's story, a classic","review":"I haven't read this book in at least 35 years yet I feel like I read it only last week. This story was unique in it's treatment of humanity and it's approach to the end of the world. This is not a Man conquers over all obstacles story. The future is bleak but the characters are real humans faced with the end of their civilization. They abide, after a fashion, but not near the same as the humanity we know. I wonder how this might have been done with man's dependence on technology even greater today. This is a classic and deserves more attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book, great buy","review":"This book is great and I found it on Amazon at a great price. it shipped promptly and arrive in great shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This book is less about an apocalyptic event that kills most humans and more about the reemergence of society and the influences that geography, history, and personal beliefs have on it. Ishi, the main character, strives to bring back the scholarly lifestyle he values, but is faced with convincing the new generation of its value in a world where his children are free from the society he knew."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read, Suspenseful and thought provoking!","review":"I have read all of Stephenn King's books, so when he wrote that this book was his inspiration for writing The Stand, I knew it would be good. I purchased Earth Abides in a London bookstore a few years ago, but somehow it has gone missing. So I was very surprised and exited when I saw that it was being offered as a kindle book. I have now re-read Earth Abides and it is truly a great work of fiction. It really gets my imagination working, and makes real just how fragile the human race is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum....Yawn","review":"I bought this book based on the overall good ratings.I speed read through most of it, hoping it would pick up. I can't stand the idea that these people weren't a little more intelligent and chose to preserve what they had and plan for the future without technology. They had a whole freakin' University Libary for pete's sake!Out of the whole book I got that Ish was the only inteliigent one but didn't have the teaching skills to subsequently teach the next generations.If you like post-apolcolytipic books, then I highly recommend \\"One Second Later\\" by Fortschen. The spelling may be off slighly....I don't have the book here. There is a line-up at work to read it. This book scared the hell out of me. And as a professional health care worker I could see the devastating domino effect happening like this book portrayed. Like the book \\"One Second Later\\" says, \\"Its not IF, but WHEN.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"speaking from the past","review":"Even at 60 years old this book still resonates as to the plight of man and his insignificance in the universe. Told as a simple story of survival of the species it gives the reader pause for thought about many issues. Well written without much superflous wording. Great detail on the impact of man and what his loss would mean to the planet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad at all, for describing the end of life as we know it","review":"I really enjoyed this book, George Stewart uses an interesting writing devise to describe time passing without you as the reader feeling as if he is grasping for ideas.Right from when people start dieing and the world changes the whole pace of life changes and this is captured really well and I feel is conveyed very effectively.I also loved the insights into what happens over time to various things that we are accosted to, cats, dogs, corn and cars. I know, I know I sound a little weird but it works !At only 337 pages this is not a taxing read, its definitely worth throwing at your younger readers in the home wanting something that is a little more challenging"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the all time best","review":"I could not put this book down. It challenged me, it entertained me, it made me cry.When I run across a copy, I buy it and give it to friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry, but i found it boring","review":"Perhaps because I've read several recently published books that deal with life after \\"the end of the world as we know it,\\" I found this book to be slow moving and even boring at times. However, I enjoyed moments of nostalgia when presented with phrases like \\"tourist court\\" and \\"I pressed the starter button on the car.\\" Brought back memories. Sadly, the world as we knew it then has already ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful book - tough to read","review":"This book was hard for me to read simply because the pain of the main character became my pain while I read. In the aftermath of the end of the world You experience fear, loneliness, pitty, love, hope and finally resolution through the narrator Ish's observations.This is no adventure novel but it is a hard hitting look at just how much we truly rely on the trappings of the industrialized world to get by and how naked we would be without them. Although the book ends on a bit of a hopeful note you can't help but mourn for all that's been lost as well as watching the rest of the world's knowledge die slowly over the generations.This book made me ask what if it were me? A mark of a good thought provoking book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long-cherished book.","review":"I have been searching for this book for the past 35 years. It was a story I have never forgotten since reading it in my teens. I applaude the publisher who has reissued it. Can't wait to read it again and share it with my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Any book I don't care to finish gets 1 star","review":"I love to read, so there are very few books I don't finish. I usually slog through even the bad ones. Here's my take on this book. I was looking for a novel about how people came up with creative ideas about how to survive in a world after civilization is wiped out. This book dealt with that facet somewhat in the first hundred pages. After that most of the book deals with moral issues. \\"What are the moral or ethical responsibilities of survivors\\" is the main theme of the rest of the book. After an ok start, the whole rest of the book seemed preachy and a little like the author was trying to coerce me into agreeing with his point of view. Three-quarters of the way through the book I quit reading, because there were no characters I was interested in enough to care what happened to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"Written by a self-righteous professor of English Lit from Berkeley. The authors preconceived notions about the ignorance of rest of us comes across pretty clearly, as his protagonist constantly judges everyone based on his perception of their intelligence. Book was very poorly researched....the protagonist and his children live mostly off of 20-30 year old canned food for most of the book (something that would probably kill you). He fixes up a jeep and then fills it with 20 year old gasoline (which is unusable a year or two after its refined). He raises his offspring in total ignorance...his greatest achievement being to teach them how to make a bow and start a fire (teaching them to read was apparently not important). Worse end of the world book I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Flat Earth","review":"Having loved this story 20 years ago as a teenager, it pains me now to find that it is surely the worst novel on my bookshelves. All the characters are two-dimensional. The dialogue is uniformly stiff and amateurish. The story's hero is arrogant, aloof and dismissive of anyone he perceives as inferior. Since he actually perceives *everyone* as inferior, the book quickly becomes very tiresome. Perhaps the saddest aspect of \\"Earth Abides\\" is that the story is clearly and shockingly the fantasy of someone who dreamed of existing in a world without people, or at most with just a thin sprinkling of simple folks over whom he could rule as their intellectual master. \\"Earth Abides\\" is a truly awful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelming","review":"I love a good post-apoc book, but this one just wasn't that great. Other than the narrator, the male characters aren't very well developed and the female characters were even worse. The jumps in time threw me off and the overall plot just didn't grab me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, lengthy, overly expository.","review":"I'm surprised so many people rated this book so highly. It's hideously dated, both in language, and in writing style. Not even in the same ballpark as something like The Stand. It was interesting to think about what path civilization would take without a unifying threat after an apocalypse, but the writing just ruined it for me. No great character development at any point, a lot of cliches and brushed over details. It kept me reading, barely, mostly to see if it went anywhere. Pretty disappointing though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated and Mysoginistic","review":"I am a fan of similar themed books. But this one just does nothing for me. The only interesting aspect is the (almost consuming) focus on how other animals in the biosphere react to the human population crashing down.But that doesn't make up for these huge flaws:1) The interpersonal aspects are awful.People just don't relate to each other the way the author describes.2) Dominated bi sudo-Christian bible verse that gets added in to say something meaningful is happening3) The storyline takes place so long ago that it is hard to see it as anything but a time-piece.4) Racist, sexist views embedded very deep in the assumptions5) Overall a very boring story line. No emotional growth in the characters and no growth in the community or plot. Just terrible, really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would like my money back","review":"My hobby is reading . I enjoy reading stories. all kinds of stories by bestselling authors or never heard of authors. always looking for a good story. In my search I have read some great stories, some not so great and just plain awful. but only three times have I ever disliked a story where I could not finish it. This story was so bad not only could I not finish it I would like a refund. the story line could of been interesting. The writing was horrible. I hope it is a long time before I come across a book this bad again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun","review":"I saw the original version in Hungarian when I was a teenager and loved the movie very much. THe review above says it's a bad james bond movie from the 70's and 80's. Well, don't forget that the cartoon was made in the 80's. If all the fun is lost in the English version, maybe the English script writers should be blamed. I am looking forward to seeing it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cat City Rocks!!!","review":"CAT CITY is a rip-roarin' good time, full of thrills, chills, spills and lotsa hip action!The animation rivals other mega animation companys, and it's a perfect film for viewing either alone or with that special someone. Yow baby!, this kittens' got claws! Grrr!The characters are thoughtful, well written, and at times satarical.These animals rival spy flicks of the 60's and 70's. Cat city is touching, heart warming and action paced. Keeps you guessing until the shocking and suprising finish.A non-stop roller coaster ride!Heart pounding and breathtaking with a good deal of romance too!So if you like urban living or felines or both, this movie is a reel winner! MEOW!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad remaster -- a complete waste of money","review":"Basically they increased the volume and called it a remaster.

Previously unheard of instruments coming through without being drowned out by \\"volume\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.....","review":"This is early RHCP work and you can tell that. To me this album is pretty much indescibable rap and funk fused into someone that sounds like choking. I will not be listening to this album anymore and I gave it two stars (and lucky I did) because of two good songs in Backwoods and Behind The Sun. Everything else is a miss. Even the Bonus tracks all demos and studio scrubs are a waste of time to listen. This is the RHCP's young and not mature enough through experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best RHCP album","review":"This album is at the core of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. They were four long-time friends then (Hillel was still alive, and Jack Irons, later with Pearl Jam, was on drums). They were at their drug limit, which is why Hillel did not make it to the next album. Basically they were shredding themselves and their music to pieces, in the best and worst ways. Catch the \\"Fight Like a Brave\\" video, in which Anthony is singing on the hood of a car driving down Hollywood Boulevard, to see what I'm talking about. And of course, the \\"Special Secret Song Inside\\" is immortal for the way it encapsulates that special RHCP brand of lust. This is THE album that seamlessly fused funk and rock. Sorry to be so bigoted, but I think anyone who does not dig this album cannot claim to be a true RHCP fan. John Frusciante's great, but Hillel's the one John wanted to be before he was ever in any band at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's like one ongoing orgasm!","review":"Being the true, 100% funky sea monkey that i am, I could jump around to these tunes all day long. Not only are the lyrics intricatly structured, but the rhythm makes me want to get down on my knees, throw my head back and howl like a coyote. While \\"Skinny Sweaty Man \\" brings back memories of my last boyfriend, \\"Funky Crime\\" reminds me of youthful days filled with misdemeanors. (i.e. sombrero incident- South of the Border- 1990) I truly think this is one of the chili pepper's finest pieces because of the uplifting beats mixed with Anthony (swan)'s soothing voice. I must add that i enjoy the various sound effects(Funky Crime) and voice changes (think Skinny, Sweaty Man)found in this album. That just adds to the creativity of the band."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Party Plan Will Uplift Your Mofo","review":"This cd is possibly the best album ever put out by RHCP, which as i presume you know, is saying a hell of a lot. In this cd they keep their original funk, before they refined their music. Although californication is good, its too perfect, too acoustically sound, this album is just madness, they dont care if it isnt acoustically perfect, they had far too much fun playing all of hte songs on the cd to care about those things, so enjoy this cd as much as they did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"absolute whiteboyfunk","review":"i love every minute of it if music sets an attitude and a mood this truly is the uplift mofo party plan a sense of humor a sense of soul a sense to be freaky and love it sweet vibrations with a fluid wave of higher intelligence will beckon to those who choose to listen with thier funny ears"},{"rating":"2","title":"The potential of a dead medium","review":"Moore, like Gore vidal and Greg Palast, thrives as an angry voice of dissent.

Read the man pages... for they give a better understanding of it.Take a subject, like Public Key Encryption. Search Google on how it works, read wikipedia, and all that fun reads to get a good understanding of the subject. Now read the chapter of how Nutt describes it... You will question yourself if you really understand it. Worst of all, he knows that it is confusing and tries to explain it another way, but only loses you more.One of many examples..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wordy, convoluted, boring","review":"Nutt spends an amazing number of pages covering simple topics, yet his writing is so convoluted, learning from this book is very difficult. He attempts to take a mathematical approach to such simple topics as first-come-first-served scheduling algorithm where the math simply confuses the matter.
