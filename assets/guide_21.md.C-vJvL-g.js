A lot of work obviously went into the creation of this. They have an interesting sound at first that quickly gets predictable.I thought the first song was decent enough, but after that the CD spirals downward fast. The main problem, as many reviewers have noted, is the singers voice, which is often hard to hear. But if I had a voice like his, I'd probably want it towards the back of the sound mix.The most original thing about this CD was the liner notes/lyrics, which are presented in the form of a funeral program. Get it? Cool, huh?"},{"rating":"1","title":"unoriginal","review":"i am glad that i didn't spend my money on this cd. instead a friend made a copy for me.the problem with the arcade fire is they are not original. i don't understand what all the hype was about their album. i guess they just have good management. nothing about their music is unique. all of the songs are repetitive and sound the same.please do yourself a favor and save your money. don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this really to be considered alternative rock?","review":"Browsing through the alternative rock pages of amazon, I came upon this record.As it was highly-rated (4 stars and a half on average), I listened to all the samples.

At first I didnt like its somewhat jagged sound. However after a while, it really grew on me. The songs do not come right out and grab you, rather I find they evolve and surprise you with great additions or endings that make the whole track shine. I think that if a genre could be applied to this band, it would be shared by no current band of the time. The sound can be referenced to bands like the Kinks or the Talking Heads, which IMHO arent very smooth, or dont really follow the rules, but just come up with cool ways to make you say \\"wow, that was a cool song\\".

Yet without the sly anger of sugarcubes music! Man, this record this music is everything you can ever enjoy in life. . . music.... in a state that you can taste each and every sound put together so well into one package*not to dramatic.

They, the Shins, and all the rest of their sorry bunch make up the new category of \\"Not-Rock\\". --Anyhow, for some reason it never occured to me that Butler's voice is in the same camp of the whiny/girly/limpwrist vocal style so sadly prevalent on the radio nowadays.Therefore I write this simply to announce that Arcade Fire is the best band in the world right now and that's really all that needs to be said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Help them sing on pitch","review":"Wow... talk about where the state of music is going. Just saw them on Saturday Night Live and checked out some of their tracks. How did they ever land that gig? Oh yeah, SNL has been tanking for some 20 years now and the only thing more amazing is how Lorne Michaels has kept his job. But I digress. At the end of a bizarre, boring, overly self-justifying song the lead singer smashes his guitar into small pieces on stage. Ho-hum. Already been done and if your 6 chord endlessly repeated melody can be modified ever so slightly by adding yet another absurd texture from your big band, then it's beyond me to say how. The opening church organ sounded interesting but the only funeral going on here is for this band. Backing vocals all off pitch, music going nowhere. Check it out before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bury This","review":"Very dissonant music, the lead vocalist can't carry a tune, totally overhyped.

Fear any band that people call \\"post-anything.\\" It probably means the band is a bunch of pretentious clowns who have lost all sense of reality. This music has no innovation, no passion, nothing.

It would be okay if it were only a few bands but now it seams that ALL of rock n roll is following that format. except for a few orignal sounds here and there most of it is just echoing the 70s and 80s. After listening to this cd i did not feel exicted or inspired, i found parts of it pretty boring. There is nothing special about the band or its music nothing special at all it just follows all the rock n roll hipster \\"indie\\" trends and follows them real well..which probably explains all the praise and attention this forgetable album has been recieving."},{"rating":"2","title":"All the passion of cold war pop without the war--and more!","review":"This album has great lyrics.

And you can really dance to it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Energy, melody, emotion..","review":"This is one of the most exciting and emotional rock albums to come around in quite a while.Comparisons to other bands based on specific sounds (including the singer's voice), are superficial. There is rock-solid pop songwriting at work here. And the songs have an exciting and urgent emotional tone. This arresting combination of strong songwriting and powerful emotion is what distinguishes Arcade Fire from their peers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waiting for the 5 star record","review":"I hope this band is not out of material or destined to fail because the 2 most prolific members are betrothed. I saw them live in Chicago this summer and they were very good and quite energetic. They did exactly what I had hoped they would; made me want more. The record is unique in its instrumentation and subject matter and the performance holds true to the content. Buy the record and get tickets early the next time they come through. There is a reason this band was hyped by independent record store owners."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums of 2004","review":"Pitchforkmedia gave it the #1 slot in their 2004 countdown. While I do not, it is certainly up there.The album is hard to describe without making it sound stupid. They manage to walk that fine line of being emotionally sincere, without sounding (too) pretentious or overwrought. A healthy dose of alienation and loneliness is present. An indie rock album that doesn't rock very hard (with maybe the exception of \\"Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)\\"), but it works its way into your brain. If you are unmoved by the opening track, \\"Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels)\\", I'd suggest looking elsewhere.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album Of 2004","review":"Genious abstract lyrics akin to perhps the Dog Faced Hermans of old, with sounds are piced together beautifully and rhythmically. The pure energy is like the output of 80 billion hampster wheels, and that is a lot of energy. Funeral has songs that hit on a variety of subjects and all are clever and powerful.

I was not disappointed. It's not very often that a person can find an album and enjoy every song on it. I personally enjoy Rebellion(Lies), Neighborhood #3 (Power Outage), and Crown of Love. Not to disclaim any of the other songs, they're all great. I can see how some may compare this band to Modest Mouse and the like, but I feel the they differentiate themselves from the rest. Go and buy this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Promising","review":"The Arcade Fire is a very promising act. To they sound like if you mix very old Talking Heads with classic british Wave band Sad Lovers And Giants. Then you add a little canadian flavour from the likes of Stellastarr or even the Spoons as well as some more poppy elements. Then shake it all well and enjoy. That's the best Funeral you can get.

This sounds like a really cool new direction for Modest Mouse!\\" Yes, some of the vocals on FUNERAL are similar to MM, but not enough to whine about. Yes, some of The Arcade Fire's influences are apparent, but so what? They obviously have great taste in music, and they take these styles to a new level of sophistication, making a record that stands out as something only they could have made.

I've tried. Over and over. And it keeps pissing me off, because even when I don't like a band I can at least see why other people like them. This band has nothing. The singers voice is so irritating it renders it unlistenable. There is no song structure and no discernible song writing ability. I want to see what you see, but alas The Arcade Fire just don't cut it. If you are reminded of Brian Eno, Talking Heads, David Bowie then go to the source.

If all you listen to is ClearChannel radio, then I guess this album might sound like a breath of fresh air. But if you're at all familiar with any decent indie, garage, or post-rock music, you'll immediately recognize many far more talented bands whose sound The Arcade Fire is desperately ripping off. A lame attempt to sound like a cross of The Talking Heads, Modest Mouse, and pretty much every indie band of the 90's, this album falls absolutely flat. I've given this album multiple listens in the hope of figuring out what the big deal is, and am giving up. There just isn't anything there. If you think Gwen Stefani is \\"cutting edge\\", or if you still think that \\"alternative\\" music can be played on MTV then maybe you'll enjoy listening to this music just because your 15 year old cousin doesn't listen to them yet.

But in the end this connection seems superfluous and counter-reality. Money in this film is not influent in relations. Money must be spent but you must care to your finances, is what the film says.

Of course, he sometimes hits the \\"accept word\\" (after spell-checker flags it) when he spells words wrong just to get high points (e.g., \\"XJQVY\\"), but he usually spells them right and this helps in his vocabulary and spelling.Monopoly is just as easy and has helped my game playing tremendously.

Only the minimum of political and diplomatic overview is given, this book is primarily about generals, tanks and airplanes, and unit combat. If you are interested in the nuts and bolts of how the wars were fought, this is the book for you.

Some of the battle accounts are filled with hair-raising acts of courage and determination in the face of great odds.The only downside - the book is more focused on the military facts than the politics and personalities involved - it left me wanting more information regarding the lives & history of the people involved. Also, the book stops in 1982, so if you are curious on what's been happening in the last 20 years, you won't get it here.Overall, very good book and you will gain a thorough insight intothe Arab-Israeli wars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizzare Orwellian tract","review":"In what is an astonishing example of Orwellian double-speak, this book for some reason refers to the Zionist colonisation of Palestine as a \\"war of national liberation\\".

You know that space that you can never get to? This brush was one of those items, and this brush reaches that spot. Works great to clean out the hard to reach spaces on thermos bottles, reusable straws, or any other item where you have thought, 'Man I cannot clean that out, guess I will have to get a new one.' It is also great as one of those items you can buy on Amazon and get your wife to shake her head at you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Brush, Does the Job, A Little Long Though","review":"I bought this not for for my sports bottle, but for my stainless steel straws that I previous purchased on Amazon. Look at my review history for a review on that.Like any utensil, it requires cleaning and by using my stainless steel straws frequently, they need more cleaning than just rinsing in the sink. Knowing you need a pipe brush to clean my straws, most of them are too short because they are aimed at baby straws. I ended up buying this one because it looked long and could fit the bill.Like the title says, it does the job very well for my stainless steel straws BUT the item is a little long. The problem is I don't have any place to store it easily. Even my kitchen drawers are too shallow to store this cleaner and I had to mount it on the inside of my storage pantry because of the length."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with previous critique about bristles","review":"I just received this straw washing brush in the mail, and I'm a bit disappointed. I should have listened to the other review that complained about the stiff bristles because they really are too stiff to clean plastic straws without severely scratching them. I was planning on using this brush for my reusable Starbucks straws, but I'm worried that this thing will destroy them. However, I think I might find other uses for this brush, such as cleaning the nooks and crannies in my cats' drinking fountain, which is made of a much harder plastic than Starbucks straws. Overall, great idea and perfect size and length, but the bristles are just too scratchy for softer plastics. Still looking for a similar product...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bristles are too stiff","review":"The bristles on this brush are so stiff that they scratched the inside of my straw. This basically just creates new places for bacteria and debris to hide. Kind of defeats the purpose!The straw I used it on is a hard plastic...maybe polycarbonate or acrylic. It seems like wetting down the bristles and twisting the brush as you pull it through the straw may help reduce the scratching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works, but be careful","review":"Brush works as described, but be careful of tip.

The bristles are abrasive enough to cut into the plastic leaving indentations for bacteria and molds to establish and grow. My guess is that the need for a brush was recognized and someone in marketing or product development sourced a good deal on an industrial grade (inappropriate) brush. Please let me know (through comments) if you find a better brush. I haven't found one yet on Amazon (or elsewhere for that matter). Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straw Saver","review":"It works great. I got it to clean an acrylic tumbler straw that had \\"yucky\\" spots clearly visible inside the straw.

It works perfectly. I've been tempted to use the brush for other purposes but have decided to clean only straws with it to make sure it stays food grade clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works!!!","review":"If you have sports bottles, you know how hard it is to keep the straws clean. I'd actually started using cheap straws from fast food restaurants because the original straws of my tumblers could not stay clean and started making my drinks taste bad. But this brush gets inside all the way down. It even works on a twisty straw. From there, I sanitize them and they're like new. Great product, if you use sports bottle straws as much as I do, this is worth every dime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective and Affordable","review":"This brush is perfect for cleaning out the ~9.5\\" hard straw on my daily water cup, and if inserted from both ends, could easily clean a much longer straw.

Sadly, this mournful and \\"put upon\\" CD simply isn't interesting or challenging to listen to. And even when Steve covers Keith's \\"Pledge My Head\\" he deadens the impact.It sounds like Steve was simply depressed on this CD.Skip it and look for the two \\"classic\\" Steve Camp CDs -- \\"Fire and Ice\\" and \\"Shake Me To Wake Me\\" -- both power pop/rock from the 80s that have great riffs and lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Timeless Guide to Life","review":"This is a popular lecture from 1914 put into book form.

The two tribes (Tagi and Pagong) battle it out. Spoiler Alert!!!! One of the things I noticed is that after one of the tribes wins immunity, they lose immunity the next time. The season is a good season but after watching some of the newer seasons this season looks a little more boring. This season had a lot of funny moments, like The Super Pole 2000 (here's a little quote from Sean, who built it: It's got the mans grip.) After the tribes merge you can figure out who is going home. The whole season comes down to, in my opinion, THE MOST EPIC FINAL CHALLENGE EVER!!!!!!!!!! and Sue's snake and rat speech. It is a season you will come back to every once in a while. A Must Have Season.P.S.

Even after you know what happens, it's still interesting to watch over and over. Included are commentary by Jeff Propst and some survivors as well as a highlights DVD with extra footage. I must say some interesting facts were revealed through both features. Unfortunately they fell short when it came to making this entire set uncensored, as the highlights DVD was. Instead you're only left with commentary for the first and last episodes to give you anything more revealing about what happened on the island. Giving more in depth information on the survivors would have also been a very nice feature, but it was left out.

The one thing I did like a lot about this game was the fact that you can control any living thing, from Hogwarts students to birds in the sky.

My GMAT is tomorrow so I feel like I will do terrible to miserable.The other comments make me feel a little bit better but since I did not do as tarrific as the other reviewers I feel panicked.I would like to score above 550+ and best outcome would be around the 620 areas.I hope that the other reviewers are right saying that the Kaplan is more difficult than the real deal.I had only a ten days time to study for the test."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good idea that fell short","review":"I was really hoping for lots of great info when I ordered this book, but it wasn't there. LLL really needs to update this and include the specifics that moms need to nurse a preemie. This is not a book but a pamphlet. When it came in I devoured it in a short amount of time and couldn't believe that that was \\"all there was\\". I really expected more of a LLL publication and was very disappointed, however, the info it did have was good and accurate, there just wasn't enough of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking in Specifics","review":"I'm the mom of a 29 weeker who weighed 1lb 10oz at birth. She barely tipped the scale at 4lbs on coming home two months later. I pumped breast milk while she was in the hospital and wanted to be able to breast feed when she came home. It was very difficult and I needed information on getting a preemie who's been bottle fed in the hospital to latch on. This book had general information but was no help with the specifics. It was a waste of money for me. It might be helpful for someone with a brand new preemie who is considering whether to try breastfeeding or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor product reliability and customer service","review":"This is my 3rd palm pda. I had this one for less than 3 months before it completely died one day. This was 6 weeks ago and I have not yet received a replacement. The customer service is poor. They seem to have unmanageable manufacturing delays. The ship date continues to be quoted and moved out a week or two at a time. If you rely on the portability of your data, do not get this product. By the way, purchasing the additional warranty coverage from Palm has not helped my situation at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems from the beginning","review":"I bought this device because I loved that I could use it for both work and personal fun. I bought it in September 2004, and by January 2005, I'd returned it because the blue paint was peeling off. PALM was pretty awful to deal with. It was returned to me in April or May. When they did return the device, it would not sync properly. I called PALM and they gave me the run around, telling me it was my PCs problem, my company's problem, etc. They wouldn't take it back. Then the warranty expired and they wouldn't take it back, and quite frankly I was exhausted by the whole thing and stopped using it for a couple of months. Finally, in January 2006 I decided just to use it for its organizational tasks and forget the syncking. Now, June 7, that just broke and I am throwing it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice.... if it worked!","review":"Me and my brother got each one Z72 in xmas and we basically have the same problems.At first I was very excited about this little thing and got my life around it quite fast using it as organizer, as a book reader with Palm/Acrobat reader, and as a messenger used in conjunction with my phone.Then, problems started and it got slow, continously crashed and needed a complete reset. As mentioned in other reviews changing for a new one did not solve the problem and if you thing the technical services in the US are slow with 8-10 weeks, try it in other countries.The screen of this device is very very delicate. I say too much for stylus input. My Palm got its screen shattered with no reason and my brother's seems to be ok but no input with the stylus is posible. Meaning other 4 full months in not covered by warranty service awaiting for both palms.I asked to the people in service about the delay and they said there was a line of 200+ palms waiting to be fixedNot cool"},{"rating":"1","title":"Palm72 Camera doesnt work?","review":"My palm 72 arrived, I went to use the camera and the notes appeared instead of the camera display.

The camera is pretty neat, the mp3 player is totally awesome, and the video recorder is beyond cool. I only had a few complaints.To connect to the internet you have to buy a $40 bluetooth thingy to attach to your computer, you need to buy a extra memory cards for the videos and mp3 feature.But other than that, the calender is nice, I like having an easy-to-manage address book, and the camera is awesome. The combination of the features add up to an IPOD plus more, so it's a better value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware Zire 72 Customer Service and Repair","review":"The Unit (Zire 72) itself is fine and meets my needs. Within 15 Days of purchase I noted the paint started flaking off. I sent the unit in for repair/replacement. The Repair Statement of service posted on their site (PalmOne) says all units will be returned repaired/replaced within 7 days. It is now going on \\"NINE\\" weeks and I still have not received the repaired or replacement unit. Countless calls to customer service and repair service have had no effect. Every call or email is answered with a \\"Canned Response\\". I was first told the unit would be returned repaired on 13 Oct 04. No Unit arrived. I called for status, I was told it would ship on 27 Oct 04. Still no unit arrived. Another call for status and this time the rep could not tell me when it would ship!!!

Brigette Fonda plays her younger sister. Hugh Laurie plays one of thedoctors she works with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"I have great respect for playwright David Hare, and I'm a big fan of Blair Brown (and Bridget Fonda too, for that matter), but despite the engaging performances of these two actresses, this movie goes nowhere, slowly. Bruno Ganz's character is too cryptic, and his performance too expressionless, to ever provide any suggestion of real love between the two leading characters. Ms. Brown plays a doctor who is smart enough to run from the altar once; but she later goes through with it just because her shiftless sister calls her a coward. Later, when he disappears and she starts paying off his gambling debts, she seems foolish, not loyal. Reviews of this film talk a lot about the political significance of the story and its commentary on Thatcherism and single women, but those writers must have gotten that mumbo-jumbo from a press release, 'cause it ain't on the screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"brainless","review":"if watching paint dry is your idea of entertainment,this dog of a movie is for you.BORING,BORING,BORING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Filthy, absolutely filthy.","review":"Arcadi Volodos has a very impressive technique, and that's about all I can say in his favour. He plays the concerto with a naive, cliched and vapid expressive vocabulary, complimented by James Levine's dull and affected orchestral accompanent. Tender passages are played with predictably conventional phrasing, the louder ones with vacuous, dry aggression. For this piece, try Ashkenazy/Haitink or Horowitz/Reiner - their depths of feeling are coupled with extraordinary musicianship and a broad, highly lucid vision."},{"rating":"1","title":"No bad, but not the quality it once was","review":"I brought them as a wedding gift, and they are beautiful, i have some John Rocha waterford flutes myself so thought they would be a great gift, they are stunning to look at, but they are not crystal, there is no weight in them at all, and felt dissapointed that were not to the usual waterford quality, mext time i will spend the extra and get some john rocha ones"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kuan Yin","review":"I am very pleased with this.

A recent issue featured lots of black walls (ugh!), and the latest issue (Feb 2013) features a real stuffed peacock perched on a branch in the living room! Who on earth would want to look at that every day?! It totally creeps me out, and is beyond weird in my opinion.

I would read the other cookbooks, most of whome had you throwng a bunch of raw items into your pot and at the end of the day that's exactly what they tasted like, in other words BLAH !. Not so withe Mike Roy's recipes, there might be an extra step at the begining, like browning the meat before placing in the pot, but by doing this and following his instrctions and adding the proper spices etc., the dinner always turned out to be superb.

Six of the nine stories originally appeared in magazines and have never been collected before. I would say Dame Agatha made a wise decision to let these little critters languish between magazine covers.Most of the stories were written very early in her career and have a girlishly romantic flavor with almost no mystery. The one Hercule Poirot tale \\"The Mystery of the Spanish Chest\\" is a fair puzzle, but she enlarged on the theme more successfully in the full-length \\"Baghdad Chest.\\" The will-o'-the wisp, Mr. Harley Quin, one of my least favorite Christie characters, appears in the title piece with a very elderly Mr. Satterhwaite.To savor Dame Agatha's really fine abilities as a short story writer, may I suggest the excellent \\"The Thirteen Problems.\\" Give this one a pass.-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for an adhesive lock set","review":"My husband refused to drill holes in the cabinets of our new house to install child proofing.

So, I suppose we will use the rest we have a total of 10 locks for other cabinet doors in our home.Not sure what to do about our drawers in kitchen.

But the actual process -- for a drawer -- is a complicated mess. Installing this on a drawer required lying upside down, looking up into the darkness of the drawer slot, and trying to make a pencil mark through the tiny mark of the non-permeable paper you are asked to adhere in place on the underside of the drawer slot, and being sure not to be so much as 1/8 of an inch off or (a) the wouldn't fit in place and (b) I would risk drilling a hole back out through the front of the drawer I was trying to secure. It was so complicated, we gave up and are going to use the self-locking drawer locks. By the accounts of other reviews here, they work well on cabinets. We wouldn't know, because we gave up with the frustration of trying to install it properly on a drawer."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love these","review":"These locks are the best.

They worked well but...the area where you stick the base in the cabinet is not as deep as the lock would like it to be. This makes the anchor shift over use and it eventually (after a few days of opening and closing) will get pushed to an angle where it won't actually catch and lock until you readjust it. So as long as you are always present in the room when the child is, it's fine...but if you are not, I am not sure it's fully trust-able if you have a narrow cabinet depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"These locks are the best","review":"The Kidco magnetic locks are the best. Really, any of the babyproofing products by Kidco are far superior to other brands. These locks are incredibly easy to install, I did our whole kitchen (about 12 cabinets) in about 30 minutes. They don't require you to drill into the cabinet, and they also don't show on the outside. They also have a deactivation mechanism if you are working in the kitchen and going in and out of the cabinets a lot.We ended up purchasing some extra magnetic keys (you can find them in stores, not always available on Amazon.com) because we often misplace them, but you can put them on the fridge which seems to work well."},{"rating":"1","title":"a total waste of money","review":"I got these locks because I didn't want my son pulling all the stuff out of the kitchen cabinets all the time. But they wouldn't work with the way our cabinets are built and when I put them in drawers, they were pretty easy to pull off with just the adhesive. And two broke when unsuspecting relatives gave them a tug thinking something was stuck in the drawer/cabinet.I am impressed by the mechanics of how they work, but in the end it was just easier to put the non-child-friendly items out of reach. HOWEVER, if you have a drill and the time to put them with screws - and your cabinets have the right size lip inside and the drawers are snug, it might really be what you're looking for. My advice - get a couple and see if they work before buying into the whole system, which is what I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and NO SCREWS!!!!","review":"I have bought multiple types to secure the cabinets and these are by far superior. I bought the Safety 1st, which were going to be challenging to install and required a lot of time; which I did not have, so I never installed the silly things. I am impressed at the strength of staying power without being mounted/secured by screws! Now I tend to forget they are installed, so I end of giving them a sudden strong pull and then remember to grab the magnetic key. I would recommend ensuring you have either 1- purchase several keys, or 2-buy some easy to grip magnets to keep several in the kitchen just to keep it quick and easy to get into the cabinets. Luckily for me, I have the two magnetic keys from the Safety 1st products."},{"rating":"1","title":"false advertising","review":"Having read the reviews, I see the problem.

I have never in my life been sold a lock withuot a key. So the titling of this is misleading and unfair. It's their right to sell things however they like, but not in a way that is misleading.

After ruining one piece by putting it in the wrong position, we put masking tape on the back of it to line it up with the second piece. That worked as a trial (and something we should have done first) but when both latch and catch were properly lined up, the door would not unlock, as the cabinet door was evidently too thick, although the writeups said the locks would work on doors up to one inch.....We gave up, thought about screwing them on, but decided it wasn't worth the trouble. IF you want to use the magnetic locks, be sure your cabinet doors are less than one inch thick.

So here I am, holding these things trying to figure out how to install them with the vague directions. Also as another reviewer stated, they dont work on all cabinets. My cabinets dont have enough wood to moount the locking side on.Basically I think this is a crappy item and they are nickel and diming us by not including at least one key in all their packages.I think this is the first 1 star review Ive ever given, and its well deserved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnetic Locks","review":"This product installed fairly easily, and though it is annoying to have to grab a magnet every time I want to open a cabinet, they work really well. The problem to be aware of: if your cabinets have pieces of metal in them, that will interfere with the mechanism. Our cabinet has tiny metal staples? or something holding the decorative edging of each door to the main body of the door, and the magnetized metal (that is nearly impossible to see in the door) holds some of the locks open. Once we realized what was going on, we were able to buy double-stick tape, and re-position the locks to sit away from the metal. Once we did this, they worked just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable and Effective","review":"I have had these installed for over a year now, and I am still happy with the purchase. The installation is a tad tricky to get the piece inside the door to line up with the corresponding latch on the door -- take your time. Also if you install them too close to your cabinet door hardware, the lock may not disengage when you hold the magnet up to the door. Over the long term, installing them with screws was much more effective than the adhesive, but the adhesive can be helpful initially to make sure you have it installed properly.I tried a number of cabinet locks before finding these. I thought most were plastic junk. These are more expensive, but they have done the job nicely and they don't alter the appearance of the cabinets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible product","review":"I bought the four pack of locks, which I was amused and annoyed that a pack of locks would be sold without the key.

They have not been subjected to any major pulling or stress, but the part inside the cabinet has shifted slightly and now half of our locks (4 out of 8) do not lock at all. And if they do happen to lock about 1% of the time, it is when I need to get in the cabinet, but not when my 1 year old is pulling on the door. I have had to rearrange my cabinets to allow him to get in and play with the plasticware or empty cabinet space and remove everything I was trying to protect from him.

Our first attempt with swinging doors required them to be closed with enough force (but not too much) for the latch to catch. This would require way too loud bangs than what we are used to and wish. Most of the times the door would remain unlocked.We then tried using this on drawers and the same thing happened. The tolerances are too small for it to be easily installed. The latch moves on gravity and so it is too weak to catch and stay put.

On the front cover, and with the directions on the back, there is a photo of a key that locks and unlocks the magnetic lock. However, after opening the packaging, there was no key. There were four locks, alright. And, lots of little screws in case you felt like screwing the lock in, despite the product's claim to be the only child lock that doesn't require tools. With how the packaging is designed, I don't even think there's room for the key. Which makes me wonder...do you have to buy the key separately?

The story of Laena, a young woman guided by visions in a turbulent era of pre-history crosses a perilous, mountainous wilderness to an amazing new land. The book is a fictionalized account of the first people who trekked from the vanished subcontinent of Beringia into North America via a land bridge that existed at the time.Believe it or not, I've been reading this book once or twice a year for over fifteen years (this review has been written in 2010)!

And it also precisely describes their heavenly retreats - how they look like and even where they are! Most of them are in the heaven right over special places on earth like Tibet or the Teton Range in Wyoming. There are so many of these retreats - there is a good chance that one of these powerful places is just a few miles away from your own home, what makes the book even more exciting to read. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Toddlers and Parents","review":"This might be titled, How to Raise your Toddlers and still keep your Sanity!

The size 10-11 men's insole fit true to my size eleven Asic running shoes. There was no shifting/sliding at the heel or toe.Cushioning - Despite being slightly thinner than the aforementioned heavy-duty insoles, they are as comfortable while running.

I have found that it actually wears down the cotton in my socks, especially at theball of the foot. On several occasions, I removed them thinking there was a small pebble in my shoe but it always turns out to be small tight pieces of cottonfrom the socks.SIZING:I only had to trim the tips of these slightly to fit in a size 11.Overall:I do quite a bit of walking during the day (14k on the pedometer) and had problems with foot and leg pain at the end of the day.

And then literally the week after the warranty was up the audio stopped working. Usually the price is better than Amazon is selling it for so it looks like a good buy, but it isn't.

I mean instead of releasing 3 different versions of the album, make a 2 disc set with unreleased material, no, they have to release this and say it's outtakes and stuff they didn't want on the CD at that time. It's just frustrating. Anyway, the songs on this CD though are very good. The disc is good, but I just wish the songs were better and more put together. They just seem awfully rushed. But still if you're a hardcore SOAD fan, then pick this up but if you aren't one of the few who already \\"stole this album\\" on the Internet, don't waste your time, because it's only worth it for hardcore fans.

Highly Reccomended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must own for SOAD fans...","review":"'Steal this Album' isn't much different then their previous two offerings, but it's solid regardless. If your an SOAD fan, go buy this cd, nuff said. Best songs: 'A.D.D', 'I-E-A-I-A-I-O', 'Mr. Jack', 'Innervision', 'Ego Brain' and 'Highway Song'."},{"rating":"2","title":"B-Sides?","review":"When I got this CD, I thought it would be pretty weird, considering it was the B-sides of an already strange band. It is strange, but in a super-good way. It knocked me out to think that they put Bounce on Toxicity and not Innervision,ADD, or I-E-I-A-I-A-O. The CD doesn't feel like a compiliation of songs that didn't make the cut, but a well thought out, highly selective CD.Good tracks: all of them.Bad tracks: ha! just kidding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost the best yet","review":"What can I say? SoaD just keep getting better and better.This album is a must have to add to your collection.Good strong lyrics,very good guitar solos and the best drummer out of any band I've ever listened too.All these songs are great and with Serj's voice,how can you go wrong?Life,so unnecessary..."},{"rating":"2","title":"grunge-punk-metal with a political conscience","review":"This is an energetic metal CD informed by punk and grunge. Songs criticize the system, advertising, gun laws and warmongers. There's probably an anti-pollution/pro-baby seals cut, but I missed it; nevertheless, System of a Down comes off less dogmatic and preachy than brother-politicos Rage Against the Machine. Machine gun drums, bass far forward and lots of tempo changes invite comparisons to Thinking Fellers, Tool or Slint and, as with any good metal album, there are a couple of pleasant ballads too. Very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!","review":"I think this album is one of the best.

All song titles related well to the topics, but many songs lacked a good consistent beat, and had some incomprehensible and not thoughtful lyrics. These faults contributed to the reason I rated it as a four star instead of a five star album. This CD overall had an excellent flowing beat and good related titles for each song. The new album for the band System of a Down, \\"Steal this Album\\" is an upgrade from their last album, \\"Toxicity\\" because it had a more understandable tone, and clearer lyrics. On a personal note, I really enjoyed this new release, and I think it is an above average CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"36","review":"Okay, besides this cd being my favorite at the moment (along with Toxicity and System of a Down), the reason the song 36 has its name is because if you line up every track from Suite-pea to Streamline (going through all 3 cds including the hidden track, Arto, on Toxicity) 36 is the 36th song they have done. Also, Serj is turning 36 this year. The lyrics make sense. Oh, don't steal this album...BUY IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT STUFF, BUT NOT FOR EVERYONE!!!","review":"aight, this is quite possibly my favorite rock cd, along with system's first cd.

The other songs are mostly horrible..N.B I am not hating on SOAD i am actually a fan of theirs.. (JUST BEING HONEST)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An impressive third album","review":"System of a Down's third album Steal This Album! is an amazing collection of unique and meaningful songs. The band combines hard rock with Armenian folk rhythms to create a sound that is different than any other band. The tracks are pulled together by the outstanding vocal range of Serj Tankian. With the music, Serj transitions from tranquil to screaming full of anger within seconds.The best part of this CD is the stylistic transitions and the song lyrics. System of a Down has the best transitions that I have ever heard. Going from one style to another is simple for these guys and they do it quite smoothly. Not only can they play great music but they have meaningful lyrics. This CD talks about real life issues- mostly politically motivated- that include nuclear bombs, war, and power hungry politicians. This is a CD for anyone who loves great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Band is totally sick!!!","review":"OKAY, I'll try to make this as short as I can. I know there is a few other bands out there that preach about war, but this one ROCKS!!!I'm totally agains't war. I think that it is stupid ... but that's besides the point right?!?!

The songs are, let me put this in a way for understanding.. Retarted. The lyrics for -most- not all songs are just plain stupid and make no sense. Lyrics from Chick 'N' Stu ... \\"This ballgames in the refrigerator. The door closed. The lights are out. And the butters getting hard\\" What the hell is that about? Can someone explain? The is obviously the WORST System of a Down album ever made so far. If your sick of this crap nu-metal has turned into, check out System of a Down's first self-titled album.

I couldn't deal with the singer's histrionic screaming then, and I still can't deal with it now.It's bad enough that the lyrics make no sense that Serj has to go on political tirades in virtually every single song. I'm not bashing on the Democratic party by any means, but this is not the way to draw people to the left wing of politics.Why? Because I can't take them seriously enough when they insist on singing about a pizza (\\"Chick 'n' Stu\\") or screaming about the politics of war with phrases like \\"death showers\\" (\\"Boom!\\"). That's why all of their albums, this one in particular, are unlistenable in my opinion.The masters of politics in music are still U2, people who can draw fans of all walks of life without having to rant and rave and pontificate pointlessly about liberalism. System of a Down just doesn't do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Again..the same boring stuff.","review":"Only thing that really stinks about SOAD is that they have had 3 or 4 cds and they still sound the same. Having one CD pretty much means you have them all.Song 1 - Little drum beat into the same heavy guitar riff. Afterwards, lower the tone into a snare 400 times, play a bass riff and sing very annoying like.Play a heavy chorus and repeat.Song 2 - See song 1.Song 3 - See song 1.Then they will have a song they tried to make sound different, but usually dosent make up for all the other songs on the cd.System of a Down is a overrated, medium talented band.

If any body tries to copy these guys, u wont succeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Systems B sides album","review":"This album is a composition of B sides, from 1995-2001. This album is everything you expect from the LA based Armeinan metal group, but is missing quite a few B side songs including:1: Metro (a Berlin cover)2: Snowblind (a Black Sabbath cover)3: Blue4: Dam5: Johnny (Really weird great song)6: Shame (a compilation cover with Wu Tang)7: Legend of Zelda (Yes, a nintendo game cover)Innervision was the first single on this album. Produced by Rick Rubin, who is one of the best producers ever, and Daron Malakin, (lead guitarist). These songs were revamped from originals after Daron was mad that B sides were being shared online, and sounding terrible. Remixed and produced, this album of 16 tracks proves to be a little hint where System is going musically. There are at least four different \\"covers\\" for this album...It's worth every cent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album... but COMPLEMENTARY to Toxicity","review":"\\"Steal this Album\\", is not a 'new' album by System of a Down.Obviously, when a band writes music, they don't just write 10 songs and place it on a CD (thank god). \\"Steal this Album\\" are the songs that didn't make it onto Toxicity and their self-titled album, but are as equally good.The best way to describe this album is schizophrenic. This is not necessarily a bad thing. From the bouncy entrance song \\"Chic 'N Stu\\", to the acustic \\"Roulette\\", there are many different System of a Down(s).The album is very good, and shows that Toxicity wasn't the only good music the band can put out.The singles (or projected singles) I believe off this album are: Roulette, Mr. Jack and Intervision.If you buy this album, buy Toxicity with it -the album is a complement to Toxicity, like I said before. Hard core System of a Down fans will love this album, Newbees will like Toxicity more.I guess that is all I can say about this, just buy the album and decide yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"System Continues To Crush........","review":"System continues to crush every other band out there. It's refreshing to have a consistently good group out there again. I'd give this 4 and a half stars if I could. All but a few of the tracks are stellar. If its been a long time since you heard an album that was so good it gave you goose bumps, pick this one up. Of course, you'd have to of already been a fan of System to appreciate this............If you get a chance to see them, go. It's straight adrenaline."},{"rating":"2","title":"im a huge soad fan","review":"and being a huge soad fan i have to tell it like it is many people say that this is there best album i would beg to differ the only songs that really caught my attention on this album were ADD and inner vission this was a good album but i prefer toxicity over this one"},{"rating":"2","title":"System of a down - Steal this album","review":"Well.... I would say that this album is their best.

One more thing, this album is still in my CD player along with other albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"S.O.A.D. is the BEST","review":"As with any S.O.A.D. album, these songs are absolutely wonderful. This CD may not be as *perfect* as Toxicity was, but how they took these songs off the cutting-room floor and re-did them as beautifully as they did is amazing. System has changed their sound in some of the songs (\\"Ego Brains\\", \\"Roulette\\") but it shows how their music is changing and growing for the better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!","review":"It seems like we've been waiting forever in anticipation for the new SOAD album, and what we got is not a disappointment. Although \\"Steal this Album\\" is not their official new album, it is a collection of B-sides and outtakes from \\"Toxicity\\". It seems that a number of these songs somehow made it to the internet but were not cleaned up yet, so System decided to release better quality versions of those songs on one CD. \\"Innervision\\" is already one of my favorite SOAD songs, and a few songs have appeared before on soundtracks such as \\"The Scorpion King\\".

I am a huge System of a Down fan from their self-titled and Toxicity stayed in my stereo for months, so I know what I am saying here. No effort was put into this album. Horrible cover-art and repetitive songs are just some things to expect when you buy this very expensive frisbee. Decent tracks include: F The System, Innervision and Boom. I was hoping that they would include \\"Johnny\\", one of the unreleased tracks that leaked to the Internet. All in all, this album doesnt include impressive vocal range and excellent musicianship like Toxicity did. I would say \\"Toxicity\\" is to Metallica's \\"Black Album\\" or \\"Master of Puppets\\" as \\"Steal This Album\\" is to Metallica's \\"Load\\" or \\"Reload\\". Yes, its that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Click back, then look for the one without (clean).","review":"No!! Do not buy this CD.

Buy the real version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Compilation","review":"This third album from System of A Down consists of tracks that go back to 1995 and have not yet been released officially. The songs are not second rate, but merely did not fit the style of Toxicity or the self titled album. It is a good mix of great songs, but lacks an over-all flow. This is to be expected from a compilation though. The various styles used generally lie between those of the other two albums as well as some very new sounds, such as the mellow but powerful \\"Roulette,\\" an acoustic change of pace. By no means can this album compare with Toxicity, but it is not meant to. The official site notes it as a bridge between Toxicity and the next album, a role which is well filled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Awesome, a must have for System fans","review":"The only reason that I didn't give it a 5 is because of the fact that it just doesn't meet the same standard that Toxicity set. Granted, I love every song on Toxicity, but every song on this album is at least decent, with a lot of excellent ones, as in better than ones that are on Toxicity: InnerVision, A.D.D., Mr. Jack (If you think Spiders is awesome, listen to this), I-E-A-I-A-I-O, Highway Songs, Ego Brain, and Roulette (Was anyone else amazed with Daron's acoustic skills?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"damn good","review":"incredible cd, really political... lots of cool anti-capitalist stuff, the title being a prime example! most of the songs are about the level of most of the songs on toxicity, but there are some (like thetawaves and roulette) that kick...!!! a must have... but u don't need to buy it it has no burn protection!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There's A Reason Most Of These Songs Didn't Make It On An Al","review":"System of a Down is probably the best rock band out right now. Their self-titled debut was a weird yet amazing glimpse of rock excellence. The follow-up 'Toxicity' was the best album released last year. This \\"new\\" album that features tracks that were left on the cutting room floor, but released because of internet leaks and downloading. This album is the worst they have realesed by far. There are a few songs that keep this album from getting zero stars such as \\"A.D.D.\\", \\"Mr. Jack\\", \\"Pictures\\", \\"Roulette\\", and \\"Streamline\\". Although those 5 standout tracks are excellent songs, the other songs are just so horrible that it practically ruins this album. \\"Mr. Jack\\" and \\"Roulette\\" (an acoustic song) are masterpieces, and even though I gave this album a bad rating, are reasons alone to get this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-tracks for a reason.....I wouldnt steal this CD","review":"I have bought all of SOAD's cds, and this just doesnt do it for me.

And Birdman, anin't that a comic book hero or somethin? Well Baby, u sure as hell ain't any kind of hero to hip-hop, ur a discrace with this garbage. Cash Money has been strugling so much, they reliy solo projects from a fool who think he can acualluy diss someone, Lil Wayne, and someone who thinks he's so big, baby. Well sooner or later, cash money is gonna collapse, and the Big Tymers will be the old-timers, and Baby aka the #1 stunna will be back to hustling the street; and son't think manny Fresh is gonna come thru 4 them.

Its bad enough you have to suffer through his boring coke rhymes but his deadpan voice gets under your skin after a while. There are only two tracks that stand out and they are Say It Aint So and What Happened To That Boy(stop saying this is a Nas diss! you people dont know how silly you sound) but even those tracks wear out their welcome. Songs like Fly In The Weather, Looks Like A Job 4, Baby You Can Do It(godawful duet with Toni Braxton) show that Birdman should not be allowed within a 100 mile radius of a microphone. Bottom Line: Birdman's album sucks llama nuts. The beats are horrible, the lyrics are pitiful and the skits are twice as bad as the tracks.

It seems some of the songs are great, some have potential, and some I don't know what their motive is. Where is the Lost in Germany, Dogman, and other classics that grab you from beginning to the end? All their songs used to be great, now some are.

Based on a good review in \\"The Phantom Tollbooth\\", I went ahead and got the CD and was glad I did. Probably the band's best original effort since \\"Tape Head\\". 'Alone' is a great tune, as is 'Honesty'. Although another reviewer stated that 'Freedom' was a re-release, I was unaware of it (and I have virtually their whole original catalog). GREAT TUNE. The only disappointment was Doug crossing the line and using profanity in one of the tunes. Sad to see one of my favorite bands have to jump into the gutter with the no-talents who do this kid of thing because they have no vocabulary.If you've been scared away by the recent experiments into mediocity with King's X - don't be afraid to buy this one.

It was released in 2005, marking 25 years of Doug (dUg) Pinnick, Jerry Gaskill, and Ty Tabor making music together. It features a crop of fantastic songs that showcase the band's musical skills as well as anything they've ever done. And it brings things full-circle, in a way, both by blending the adventurous, metallic prog-rock of their early albums with the funky, psychedelic riff-rock of their more recent albums, and by including re-recorded versions of two originals from their past, the crowd-favorite \`Goldilox' and the almost-mythical B-side \`Freedom'. This is one of the most electrifying, exciting, and inventive albums of the early 21st century (tracks like \`Alone' and \`Bebop' and \`Mudd' shine especially bright). The overwhelming theme here, as on most King's X albums, is one of finding hope when surrounded by despair, and when I'm lost in the music of this band I can actually feel it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment...","review":"King's X has released several fantastic albums; this one, however, would be their worst. Their earlier stuff was by far better than this CD. The guitar on this album isn't as impressive, the vocals are mediocre, and the songs are stupid. It puts this picture in my mind like they just said, \\"Well, we tried to be different and creative, now let's just be like everyone else.\\" This band was once creative and interesting, now (this album being the perfect exapmle) they are just trying to be like the average rock band -nothing special or interesting- just boring.So, don't waste your money on this album when you can buy something like \\"Dogman\\", \\"Faith, Hope, Love\\", \\"Tape Head\\", or anything they wrote in the late 80s or 90s."},{"rating":"2","title":"The King's of Prog Rock are Back!","review":"King's X are back with a fantastic new release, Ogre Tones.

I hope this is the album that get's them more recognition in the states because they deserve it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Energy with no creativity","review":"This is far and away King's X's worst album. There is a ton of energy on it, but the band used absolutely no brains on any of these songs... if this was my first time hearing these guys, I'd think they had the IQ of your typical thrash band. And what in the world were they doing rehashing several songs whose original versions were FANTASTIC?! How can any King's X fan who heard the original \\"Freedom\\" not find this album to be an insult? What makes King's X albums so great is their ability to combine smarts with rock, but this album sounds more like a beginners' rock exercise. Nothing special going on here whatsoever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible album by a criminally underrated band...","review":"\\"Ogre Tones\\" is an incredible album, yet I noticed the CD I have does not match the track listing Amazon has provided. Opposed to having 13 songs and the two promotional videos for \\"Alone\\" & \\"If\\", my CD only has the video for \\"Alone\\" but has an extra track entitled \\"Goldilox (Reprise)\\", which is essentially a re-recording of the song off their debut CD \\"Out Of The Silent Planet\\", with their more modern, crunchy guitar sounds.

The stories in this book are set in rural eastern Ontario during the 1870s and are supposedly fictionalized accounts of true events. As one can gather from the title of the book, the stories revolve aroung school-life and (male) school children, in particular a boy named Hughie Murray. Overall, the book is interesting, especially if one has an interest in Ontario or Scotish-Canadian history. But the sometimes overly sentimental and narrative is somewhat taxing, as is the religious moralization (which was no doubt common at the time). This does not detract from the fact that this book is an important work of Canadiana."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thinking about Terror","review":"This is a comprehensive study of the Internet, how it is used by terrorist group--not just Islamic terrorists or al-Qaeda, but also the IRA, and South American terrorist groups as well--and what measures are being taken to combat the growing use of the Internet by terrorists. Perhaps the most valuable portion of the book is the discussion of civil liberties and tracking/surveillance of the Internet. Mr. Weimann does an excellent job of pointing out the problems inherent on both sides of the issue, but does more than that--he offers solutions to the questions he raises. A bit outdated, the Patriot Act update was not yet passed by Congress when this book went to press. Many of the concerns of Internet surveillance were addressed in the Patriot Act update of 2006. Still, a great resource for the average thinking person who wants to be reasonably informed on the dangers facing our country.

It is very interesting, well documented, well-written (easy for people like me who are not sophisticated Internet users) and very alarming. The author knows well the dark sides of the Net and guides the readers to the darkest virtual streets modern terrorists take when using the cyberspace. The book is loaded with examples from various terrorist groups (all are now on the Net) and relates the findings to the framework of communication studies and psychological warfare.

It got a little boring after a while. One thing I didn't like about NBA Live 2003 was it didn't have some of the really cool featrues of NBA 2000. One good thing about this game is that it is very realitstic. As a huge NBA fan and a basketball player, I think would have a pretty good idea. The moves in this game a fantastic. That is one thing that I love about this game. I can make myself(in the create a player screen) and emulate my own crossovers and spins.

I enjoy the fun aspect of the game, but not to where FG% is over 80% constantly. The AI is so awful and you can't adjust it like in Madden 2003 (can't the developers share some secrets?).

The story was good enough, but it would have been much more enjoyable if I were reading it myself. It sounded like the person was reading it for the first time, his sense of when to pause was terrible (continuing like there was going to be another sentence at the end of each chapter!), and he sounded distracted at best during the entire book. I feel like he had more fun just doing the voices of the characters, which were enthusiastic, but also very annoying at certain parts.

The movie is really space junk(food) as it has obvious endorsements running through the course of the film. E.T. might have used \\"one\\" certain candy as part of the storyline and at least it was subtle and somewhat integral to the plot. However, it is rampant and blatant in this film. MAC AND ME has characters that we really don't care about and the aliens are annoying and hilariously bad looking.

The skittles bag is poured with a near perfect looking bag. The coke cans are turned toward the camera so the logo shows, the girl is mostly always wearing her McDonalds uniform during the movie, etc.The part I remember most is near the end when wheelchair boy goes boom. His friends bring him over, and one shouts \\"He's breathing, he's going to be ok\\". Then another guy comes over, looks at him for literally 2 seconds, and says \\"There's nothing I can do for him\\", and hurries off. Everyone starts crying. HELLO? CPR Anyone? This scene was totally not believable, some movies you get teary eyed when the main character dies off, but in this one, I could really care less.What makes it hilarious is right at the end where you see \\"We'll be back\\", thankfully that has yet to happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mac And Me","review":"This is one of the worst movies that I ever seen.

I would give this movie only a half a star but Amazom.com will only let me give it at least one star. It was a waste putting it on tape. I am glad that it was not put on dvd.

I liked it a lot when I was younger, though. I liked it more than E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial. This is like E.T. but it has a different story to it. A kid struggles to find his alien friend's family in the desert. When they do find it. A lot of danger occurs between the two friends. But there is a happy ending, of course. I think this one is more of a family favourite than E.T.If you are really serious about renting it. Then do so. It ain't quite that bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mac and me A reminder of the 80s","review":"This movie obviosly tried to cash in on the success of ET. This movie is more for kids than ET was and it is a completly different movie.

I could watch this film over and over again! That's gotta say something about it. It's definitely cute, fun and somewhat of a tearjerker. Great family movie! The bond that the little boy(Jade Calegory) and Mac(creature) come to share is beyond the true meaning of friendship. I went to high school with Jade and he's as every bit sweet as his character!

In my opinion, its superior to \\"E.T.\\" It has a heartwarming storyline and a good plot. I will admit that the whole \\"McDonalds dance sequence\\" halfway through the movie was kinda lame though, but at the time the movie was filmed that probably seemed like a hip thing to do.

Oh my God, is this bad. Beyond description awful. This Coke and McDonald's commercial, I mean, \\"movie\\", rips off E.T., has atrocious acting, panders to an audience's sympathy for the handicapped, assuming you have the emotional depth of a Lilliputian puddle, and, most importantly, will make you laugh beyond belief. The dance scene in McDonald's has to be seen to be believed. Buy it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even The Title Is a Product Placement!","review":"If you want your kids to watch an inferior version of E.T. filled with poor acting and loaded with product placements for Coke and McDonalds you have found your movie! Oh and with an added bonus not included in E.T. Mac and Me offers a disturbing scene in which a disabled wheelchair bound boy falls off a cliff and nearly drowns. Don't worry he is saved by the title alien Mac (get it like a Big Mac sandwich) who apparently needs to drink Coca Cola to stay alive. I was chilled when Mac tells us he'll be back implying he'll be appearing in a followup film but since the movie is now almost twenty years old and no sequel has appeared on the horizon perhaps we can rest easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this movie as a kid","review":"Have not watched yet.

Watch it if you like train wrecks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are they serious!","review":"I actually saw this as a youngster and was rather more bored/disgusted than enchanted. This film, which no matter what they say IS just a bad ET clone, wins the all-time product placement award (edging out Wayne's World for a tinge of insincere plugging) for the McDonald scene and the \\"Coca-Cola as panacea\\" overtone.

She is a classically trained drummer and draws heavily upon that in her mixing. The only dj I can think of to compare her to is Carl Cox and as much as she doesn't like to admit or even talk about, the fact that she is female definetely shows on this mix.

Shindell is one of my favourite singers, and this is a brilliant CD. My only criticisms are that his otherwise wonderful voice does verge on the nasal sometimes, and a couple of songs seem to lack the texture they possessed on previous albums, but this is a great CD, and it doesn't seem to matter at all that he's done nearly all the songs before - his singing still hits you like a physical blow (and I mean that as a compliment). The best on this album? The fabulous Arrowhead, the sarky and cutting Are You Happy Now? the brilliant folk rendition of Lowell George's Willin', and the vastly underrated On A Sea Of Fleur-de-Lis. Get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Regular Listen","review":"I'm new to Richard Shindell's music, and \\"Courier\\" is a great place to start. There's not a clinker on the CD and this disk is going into my regularly listened to stack. Tops on the list for me from the tracks is the haunting \\"Arrowhead,\\" both for its imagery and the beat. Honestly, it's pretty darned close to a perfect song in my opinion. The title track is another great one, albeit with one tiny anachronism (perhaps intended), as is \\"Kenworth of My Dreams\\". \\"Are You Happy Now\\" has got to be one of the all-time greatest break up songs, and the Halloween imagery is some of the most clever I've seen in a long time. All in all, this is one heck of an album, one that's perfect to pop into the car's CD player for those long trips; it's imminently enjoyable and downright singable. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a very enjoyable listen","review":"I first discovered this artist on the Cry, Cry, Cry album. I wanted more so I downloaded this album.

Dr. Rosemond's suggestion to the mother was to overlook this one \\"annoying habit\\" and do everything she can to keep him around. After all, he states, \\" The likelihood of her finding another boy her age who has a coherent plan for the future ... is slim.\\"So, if you want insecure daughters and macho sons in traditional roles from many generations back, his advice probably works well for you.

The only positive thing I can say is that the product had the decency to fail utterly both times so I didn't spend hours troubleshooting.

I recommend that you not buy anything from this company either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent and fragile","review":"I actually get fairly good throughput when the units work, about 25 Mbps (and I am running them across circuits). The main issue I have is that throughput regularly drops to less than 400 kbps, and on occasion does not work at all. I initially assumed this was because something in my house was causing interference, but I haven't found anything consistently running when I have issues. I have had sudden connection problems in the middle of the night when I'm the only one awake and I know that nothing was suddenly turned on.Additionally, I had one of my units fail within 6 months.

Then it died. D-Link replaced it, but it takes awhile to go through their RMA process, so I bought a replacement set from Amazon and installed that, thinking that it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have a spare set anyway, especially after reading the reviews. Sure enough, after 6 weeks, the new set died as well. After an hour on the phone and getting cut off a few times, D-Link is now replacing my second set. Good thing I have a spare on hand. Unfortunately, I have to pay every time I send one of these things back. I'm starting to think that it may have been worthwhile to invest in the Amazon extended warranty on these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great until it stops working","review":"Like some of the other reviews here, my powerline HD units died within a few weeks of setting them up.

I will not even buy any product from D-link."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clearly defective product - BEWARE!","review":"Yes, the unit works as advertised, but as many reviewers have outlined here, the units are short-lived. I have had my second set stop working and have asked D-Link for my money back instead of a third defective set. They seem to last 1-2 months before they stop working, and if you search the web you will find that most people that purchase this kit have the same experience. The main problem is that D-Link's customer service is terrible - it is difficult explaining the problem to their call centre staff and getting the first replacement kit was a miserable ordeal. They also deny that anyone else has had this problem and seem to be oblivious to these Amazon reviews.Do yourself a favour and stay away from this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"time and money waster","review":"I've purchased 2 pairs to replace the wireless network connection for my ReplayTVs.

Given reviews I've read from others who have purchased this product, it would appear I'm not alone.3 RMAs and 1 store return later, I'm extremely disappointed in D-Link that they would continue to manufacture and sell such an inferior product, especially given the high price. I generally love them and their products, but this one is the pits. To be clear, when the units work, I get phenomenal speed. However, that's fairly meaningless given all the downtime the network has had while my RMAs are processed."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star for working great for 1 month","review":"Stay away from this product.

This CD really is quite uninspiring. All the tracks pretty much sound alike, and his musical talents are definately not put to the test.If you're interested in french music, pick up one of his best CD's, Pour nos vies Martiennes, which has tons of beautiful songs, and exceptional lyrics (for those of you know french, the track Des Ir will definately appeal to your more poetic side).Eden lacks in character... but Etienne is definately a good source for french pop... His latest release is just... uninspired."},{"rating":"2","title":"PAWFECT!","review":"My beloved dog of 12 years old passed away and I thought this cute box was perfect to put, keep and protect his items to remember him by.

Very awkward writing, combined with the voice of your annoying kid sister, I really cannot comprehend why they chose to ruin the 3D footage. It really felt like this movie was created for the purpose of educating inner city 3rd/4th graders...(no offense.)

Also, I have a 3D TV and glasses. There was nothing 3D about the video - period. We made it 2/3 of the way through before we cut our losses and will probably never finish the entire viewing.

We've watched many other 3D movies on our setup and liked it very much (mostly kids movies like How To Train Your Dragon, and live concerts). This particular disc has no 3D effect at all. My Active 3D glasses (that automatically darken when they detect a 3D signal) didn't even darken. The screen looked exactly the same with or without the glasses on; normally the 3D screen looks terrible if you are not wearing the glasses. It's like the disc is labeled 3D but is actually just a regular Blu-Ray disc. Very disappointing. We watched about 20 minutes of it - it's an okay show if you want a 2D aquarium tour with some soothing music, but it is certainly not a stunning 3D under sea adventure.

This is a 3D ONLY disc.The reader is exceptionally poor as is the sub par plot line. Have to say that there are better undersea videos like the very well done, 2D only, Reefscapes: Nature's Aquarium DVD.

If you've got real pain, then I humbly suggest you see a surgeon not a snake oil salesman. However, the best medicine for what ails you is laughter; and for that I heartily recommend Dan Wagner's FANtastic book: Getting To Howard: The Odyssey of an Obsessed Howard Stern Fan -- it's definitely a pain-free read."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"I have suffered from back pain and siatica for 10 months. A friend bought me this book for Christmas. As I read it, my pain literally vanished (and on a bus ride, sitting in a seat that should have put me in a wheelchair according to my PT). It sounds too good to be true, but it is true.

It gives a whole new perspective to the cause....and CURE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!","review":"I am 29 years and I had Back pain for more than two years. It got really bad some days and mostly it stayed as a dull but weakening pain most of the day. I read the book and first I had a hard time believing I was angry or frustated or upset in some way and its suppression was leading my body to experience back pain. I thought I lead a very normal life which seemed to be quite happy. Slowly I realized as I read the book for the second time that my beleiving this itself was the problem! I was agitated about a number of small problems which could be associated with anyone's day to day life. The book really made me learn more about myself. Now I am doing so well that its amazing! The pain comes very rarely and it is much mild. Also it goes away very quickly as I know the root of the problem. I would suggest anyone with a back pain to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After reading many of the other reader reviews, I had high hopes for this book. I read Dr. Sarno's theory and accepted it quickly, then I read about it some more and some more and some more. When I finally arrived at the treatment portion (the last 12 pages or so of the book) I was very disappointed in it. I found that the cure for my constant back pain seems to require my moving to New York to become Dr. Sarno's patient, attend his lectures, and take his referral to a physical therapist...all quite impractical--not to mention expensive. Then I read even more about Dr. Sarno's theory of TMS and the book finally ended."},{"rating":"1","title":"It can't be this easy","review":"I'm a Physical Therapist and I think Dr. Sarno's statement that a herniated disc or spondylolysthesis can't cause back pain seems a little far fetched. I've also had back pain for 8 years and I want to believe. I truly do.P.S. It's been three days and my back still hurts. If that changes I'll write a new review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be a library rental only","review":"This is absolutely the worst book I have ever read, and it gives plenty of false hope. Those that say they were healed by the end of reading this book were either suffering from the placebo affect, or didn't have pain to begin with. The doctors theory is sound, however, he offers no advice on how to get better at home. He actually states that his treatment is inpatient for 4-8 weeks and recommends seeing him in NY, or getting in with another doctor that treats TMS. If you think you will be healed by reading this book, you are wasting your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"After hearing and reading so much hype on Dr. Sarno's techniques, I was very excited to find the book. However, after reading it, I find very little help on how to deal with what he calls TMS. Also, he doesn't really write on how you can tell whether your pain is caused by TMS or some other physical problem.All in all, quite disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but no cure","review":"This is Sarno's first book that describes TMS (tension mylitis syndrome) - his name for back pain caused by stresses in your life. It thoroughly explains his thesis and offers examples of proof, but there are no recommendations on HOW to do solve the problem. His next book, \\"The Mind-Body Connection\\" is better as it covers all of this material as well as HOW to talk your body out of manifesting your stress and anxiety into back pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mind Over Back Pain","review":"The format and style of this book make it a slow read for me. Topically it may be fine but it is not otherwise appealing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plenty about the problem, but little about solutions.","review":"This may hav been an early book by Dr. Sarno; if you're looking for relief from back pain,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK--read one of his later books. Both I and a friend, both back pain sufferers, had the same reaction to \\"Mind Over Back-Pain\\": What a frustrating book! No answers! The print is tiny and rather light to the eye. More important, Dr. Sarno gives his theory about back (and other) pain as caused by Tension but gives very little idea of how he helps his patients overcome back pain. All in all, I WOULD SUGGEST THAT DR.SARNO REMOVE THIS BOOK FROM THE PUBLICATON LISTS, in favor of his more recent and allegedly more helpful, complete books.

This book adds to the remembrance of that great Council. Fr. Saba has provided to the world a great source for what the Melkites gave to the Church at the Council. They kept the Church from forgetting the Eastern part of the Catholic Church. Fr. Saba gives the history of the Melkites in summary form and then provides the history of their theology. He then provides the history of the participation of the Melkite prelates in Vatican II. They spoke up for the Eastern Church. They were also hoping to be a bridge between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church. If you are interested in the Eastern Catholic Churchs here is a good one to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"When I was 11 y/o I found a copy of Burn Witch Burn and it captivated me. I couldn't put it down. BWB was the first book that I had ever encountered that would let me alone. I didn't want to eat dinner or go outside and play, I just wanted to read the book. Now many thousands of books later, I was curious it I would have a similar effect on me and it has. No BWB is not Tolstoy but that being said it doesn't try to be. It is however an exceptionally wonderful plunge into the macabre. The characters are interesting and the plot is outstanding. Merritt was one of the first writers to integrate the new science of psychoanalysis into his work. He, like many writers of his day, mistakenly uses the word 'subconscious' rather than 'unconscious' when describing hidden motives and trying to understanding a characters deeper pathologies. But he does it so well that it is a mere bump in the road. I recommend BWB highly. Now I want to find a dime store copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"An awful skipping program","review":"I was very disappointed in this dvd.

Spoilers>> Malkovich claimed he could not say when exactly someone will die but he knew they were going to die (we all can predict this). But when the guy on the tube shot himself he said he was going to die within 2 hours (did it mean that when they glowed white they had 2 more hours?). So how soon was Clair going to die after she glowed. It was all pointless as the Messengers had no power to stop death only to predict that someone was going to die at sometime."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best electric Clapton on video.","review":"For those who found \\"Unplugged\\" too unplugged, \\"Nothing But the Blues\\" is the answer to a prayer. Extended solos, great archival footage, and Clapton having an awfully good time. I taped it off PBS and, when it was never released, called Warner, finally getting through to a Clapton representative. She said Clapton intended the video to be a tribute to his blues heroes and felt the final effort was too Clapton-centered; he decided not to release it. Begging and pleading don't work when the artist says no. So I find my PBS copy (which is thirty minutes shorter than the released video was going to be) a treasured item. Eric: why not release the concert with the complete archival performance clips? That would make it a greater tribute and please the fanatics (like me) who buy Eric-centered products."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you've ever wondered about Autism, check this out.","review":"This is an amazing DVD and I thank Sue Rubin for being willing to share what it is like to live with Autism.

I thought it would (finally) be an expository piece about various people w/autism. This documentary was well-made, but very narrowly focuses on this one individual's weaknesses/strengths and the one method of increasing communication for this individual. Many (most?) ASD kids/adults are not mentally retarded, are not non-verbal, are not living in half-way houses, do not have a team of personal aides, etc. Where are their stories? I realize the title of the documentary came from Sue Rubin's speech, but it would have been more \\"fair\\" to those of us tuning in to CNN to give it a less general-sounding name."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful not worth the money","review":"I bought this movie and it was the most awful movie for information about Autism.

The other major issue I had with how much she was shown playing with water, I think it was overdone. I barely got through it, I only watched it out of morbid curiousity with the knowledge that it would probably irritate me and I was right. I think perhaps that I was quite lucky not to have been diagnosed until my twenty-second year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Educational","review":"After viewing this program I was very impressed. People often times think that autistic people are mentally retarded. This film proves that theory is a myth and that there is hope for autistic children. From what I understand autism is a neurological disorder and I think that is why they make the strange facial expressions and sounds. Sometimes they do that just to soothe themselves because they can't deal with certain feelings the way \\"normal\\" people do. I thought this film was excellent and will give people insight on autism. We need more documentaries like this one that will demystify this disorder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading","review":"We have read about three or four of the books in this series. This one is by far the best. Drew Bledsoe does a great job teaching kids about integrity. My son, who is a Patriots fan and student of the game of football, really enjoyed this book.

The songs are offered here in somewhat crappy sound, with tape dropouts, rechanneled sound, and other things to distract the listener from enjoying the music. Instead of this cd, I would recommend the Sentimental Me: The Best of the Ames Brothers cd on Varese Sarabande, which covers many of their Coral chart hits and other classics for the label, and also the Very Best of the Ames Brothers on Taragon, which takes care of their RCA career, except for the fact that they put Destination Moon on the cd instead of the classic, Stay, which they had to flip a coin to decide which track to put on. They went with the wrong song, honestly...but avoid this crap, get BOTH of the 2 cds ive mentioned here on Varese and Taragon, they CARE about sound quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mandela Towers!","review":"Funny that two reviewers note the disparity between Haysbert's size and Mandela's--Mandela is also 6'4\\", the same height as Haysbert, and has never been \\"diminutive\\" in size or in spirit.

Magic storm shows back up and sucks them away. You get teased with the epic battle almost from the very beginning of the film. I don't care about potential problems with the time line! It's like Rocky with no title fight. It's like the Chronicles of Narnia where Aslan doesn't show up. It's like Star Wars where Luke decides to skip out on the assault on the Death Star.

They find theirselves in the pacific, the dateis Dec. 6th 1941. The day before the Pearle Harbour attack. Now the plot gets interesting. What do they do? With the modernweapons on the Nimitz and exact knowlage of what is about to happen they could decimate the Japanese fleet. But what will happenif they change history? Should they change history?

Same thing happened with the horrible original, and the same is happening to this supposed re-release. Don't worry, though, because if you already own their awful first version, then you shouldn't waste any time on this second one - it's the EXACT SAME as the first one but with new packaging and (possibly) chapter markers.

I was a kid with no money and I hooked on this movie from the Get-Go.The very idea of something like that actually happening is mind blowing.I think the chemistry between Martin Sheen and Kirk Douglas was fantastic. There are some areas which I thnk should have been researched better. A task force is usually commanded a an admiral. In the big ending scene when the Nimitz moves to stop the japanese, What are those bombers doing there?

Some of the effects may be a little eightyish (way before Dreamworks and Pixar) but who cares? It's the idea and your imagination that counts. Put all that together with Blu-ray, HD, and a big screen, and it's great.

Most notably in the hanger deck scenes near the end where it shows Laskey walking to the helicopter when Senator Chapman and Ms. Scott are being taken to Pearl Harbor and again when the bombs are being loaded (same camera angle). In addition, the interior shots during the ship's medical department scenes show a poor quality. The center of the screen is HD but the outer edges (a good portion not just a tiny section) is totally out of focus for the entire scenes of the Japanese prisoner taking a hostage and killing crew members. It is very apparent the scene was either poorly shot or the HD conversion was not completed.The movie itself is fantastic!

I liked everything about it. It's extremely easy to set up and record. I've never used another type of product like this so I can't really compare. That being said, all the other versions that work with macs seemed to be more expensive.The only thing that I had a problem with is the editing aspect of the software. It's very awkward and hard to use. However, you can export the video files to be used in various editing programs so it doesn't really matter that the EyeTV editing sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I am using the TV Hybrid on a Dual processor Power Mac with 4 gB of RAM and an Apple 17\\" LCD Studio display. The picture is somewhat blurred and/or stutters during action sequences such as basketball games. The sound is just slightly out of synch with the picture , as well, which is a bit annoying. I downloaded the latest EyeTV 3 software and now can no longer receive the over-the-air digital ASTC stations. Reverting to EyeTV 2.5.2 allows the stations to be received again.

If you have the unit ON and the Mac is set to sleep, the Eyetv will wake it back up even if all you are doing is watching a TV show. Also, if you use fast user switching the Eyetv will not respond upon return to your screen. You have to remove it and restart the program. A future update may fix this issue.

This little device is great and works very well. I like the fact that you can see both analog and ATSC broadcast with a single antenna transparently, just switch the channel. Image quality is great, although it eats quite a bit of CPU to decode and show HDTV, but with the Intel Macs it's not really a problem. The software needs a bit of refinement, especially on the program guide. They have really cool features, like you can set up a recording over the web using Titan TV if you're at work, for example, and forgot about that soccer game at 3 PM today. On the other hand, if you're in the guide and click on a program that's running now, it doesn't automatically retune to that channel, you have to go and change it yourself.

It is easy to convert shows to multiple formats. The online guide is fantastic. It will wake my iMac from sleep to record. The remote (which is also onscreen) is very intuitive. BUT, for some reason, Elgato chose to add something called Clear QAM to the new models, and does not have it on the old models. If you decide Clear QAM is for you, be sure the product description at Amazon includes it. It did not when I purchased. I don't think my model has it, and so far, watching from Time Warner cable without a box, I don't need it. I don't even understand it, but I think it is digital as opposed to analog.

Pass over this mag and get \\"Guitar One.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the perfect guitar magazine, but better than Guitar One","review":"I think that this is a much superior magazine to Guitar One because wheras Guitar One almost exclusively writes about the latest nu-metal band or whatever other crap that happens to be on the top of the charts, Guitar Player will have at least two or three out of, say, five articles on bands that the average guitar player hasn't heard of or at least isn't totally sick of hearing of. The reasonI gave it 4 stars is that they do have too much on reviewing equipment which can be kind of boring as none of their \\"reviews\\" are what I'd call reviews. For example, in their last issue I don't think they gave one bad review. They're almost as bad as Ebert & Roeper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Still waiting","review":"I'd love to say how great this magazine is, but I still have not received the first copy.

By the time I reached page 90 of this one I was asking myself \\"So what's the conflict?\\" I found no major conflict in this story. How can you have a story without conflict? Perhaps something will come up later on, but I'm just too bored with it to read on and find out.

So, I let my rats just play in it for a while while looking for tips and tricks and I heard a loud BANG. I look over and the thing has popped off the holders and dropped down to the bottom.

I recieved for my birthday only ever hearing \\"Angel Eyes\\" and \\"Anger Rising\\", but when I heard the rest of the material, I was amazed. Cantrell knows how to carry a listening audience out of their seats. Their music is dark, mysterious, powerful. Each song carries a special message. \\"Angel Eyes\\" is one of the best love songs ever created. This is definitely an underrated CD, for sure, but it definitely the best I've heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jerry's Best Work","review":"Sure, Alice In Chains was a marvelous group, perfectly positioned in the zeitgeist of the early 90's. But this is Jerry Cantrell's best and most consistently satisfying work. The full edition of \\"Degradation Trip\\" is more diverse musically and takes on a darkness even more intense than on the one-CD version. It's full of powerful playing, clever songwriting, and some of Jerry's best lyrics - an area of his work where he is still developing. Cantrell's voice is outstanding here, which addresses one of the few weaknesses from \\"Boggy Depot.\\" And with more sinister vocal harmonies, one will easily recall the glory of \\"Dirt.\\" \\"31/32\\" is perhaps the most affecting of the new songs, but frankly, this album works extremely well as a cohesive whole. Now for the next trick: can Jerry leave behind the utter despair inherent in these lyrics and write new songs reflecting a fuller range of life's emotions?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I listen to the same CD's other reviewers did?","review":"I did not like this set at all. It's even worse when compared to what Alice In Chains released. These songs, as previously mentioned, are plodding. Jerry's vocals don't sound good, either. Boggy Depot was MUCH better than this.

Here, Jerry Cantrell tells us: \\"This is what I've done, what I am, why I'm the worse because of it.\\" Yet through the darkness of the album the listener is paradoxically elevated. In short, we share in his pain and simultaneously rise above it.Bottom line: I would give this eight stars if I could..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jerry Cantrell is Brilliant!","review":"Finally we actually get the masterpiece as Jerry himself intended. This is a remarkable 2 CD set, if you liked the first release, this is a must have. I have been a AIC fan for a long time, and absolutely love their music. I believe Jerry is one of the most gifted musician/songwriters in the industry today. Like many others out there, I was inspired to pick up the guitar 9 years ago after hearing AIC, and there is no better honor to a musician than learning and playing the songs they have written, which I love to do. Degradation Trip is full-on honest music by an honest man. It doesn't get any better than this, from the chunky riffs to the haunting melodies this is the most complete package a musician can offer. Keep em coming Jerry, you're the man."},{"rating":"2","title":"An honest work of art","review":"An absolutely brilliant 2 hour and 20 minute Degradation Trip. Cantrell throws it all down here, creating a true work of art with brilliant harmonies and vocals, within a concept album that we haven't seen in the same form ever before. The guitars are heavy and biting, and then light and mystical. His lyrics are honest and artistic with a lucid vision of his Degradation Trip.Cantrell's vocals have never been more piercing and beautiful. His trademark use of humming and chanting over his harmonies and as melody is ever present in its purest form. He adds a spiritual dimension to his music that no one will ever touch.Starting with the superb verses of a Psychotic Break, to the honest, friendly party of Pig Charmer, Cantrell depicts a vision that is not dark and desolate, but simply the true reality of experience.Honest, inspirational and creative, this album will be remembered most not as a Degradation Trip, but as Jerry Cantrell's Progressive Trip through true artistry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing","review":"It's a real shame Road Runner Records refuses to promote one of the greatest guitarists of our time. Jerry Cantrell has come back with a vengence to put all of the Alice-in-Chains clones in their place, and he succeeds briliiantly with this masterful collection of heartfelt songs, breathing new life into rock. I bought this immediately after having previously purchased the first volume that came out earlier in the year, and I can say that the new set of songs is well worth the two-disc price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boggy Depot was never this deep...","review":"I was glad to have waited to pick up this double CD set, as it first was released as a 14 track single CD. Some of the songs reminded me of Alice-in-Chains, but that's to be expected. Some were purely Cantrell however, but I couldn't help but wonder if many of the songs were written about his old AIC partner, Layne Staley. There seemed to be a re-occuring theme running through the tracks, although songs didn't sound the same; faded glory, stardom can destroy, etc. This is an excellent piece of work, and I'm glad it was released as intended. There's a lot of dispair and tortured feelings going on in Degradation Trip, but it's all worth the musical value."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Double Album Rules","review":"Being a cheapskate and already owning the Degradation Trip single album, I hesitated to shell out again for the double album, but I am so glad I did. All I can say is that Jerry Cantrell is a freakin' genius and this album is excellent. The songs I hadn't heard already are fantastic. Well worth buying even if you have the single album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album Ever","review":"Jerry Cantrell may have been with on of the best bands ever but his talent is endless, just check out \\"Boggy Depot\\" this ablum explores a different side to Jerry its kind of softer stuff with a country twist but it still kicks.With Degradation Trip you get the best of what Jerry has to offer, its a real trip from the first to last song, it explores many different emotions and can go from kick A__ to mellow and back. I have been a long time fan and try to promote Jerry when ever I get the chance. He is the Best! If you like Alice In Chains you'll love Jerry, If you don't know Alice then listen to Jerry first and form a fresh opinion. I can take him either way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jerry's Back On Track","review":"Jerry Cantrell is not a happy man and wants you to know it. The hypnotic \\"Psychotic Break,\\" and the gloom of \\"Castaway\\" portray that right away. The good thing though is that Jerry is once again on AIC ground. Such radio ready songs Like \\"Angel Eyes\\" and \\"Locked On,\\" not to mention \\"Anger Rising\\" make you wish his former band were still active. There is a wide variety of songs here. From the moody \\"What It Takes,\\" to the stomping \\"Hellbound.\\" Throw in a couple of sad acoustic numbers, like \\"Gone\\" and \\"31/32\\"(which could easily be mistaken for a Layne Stayley tribute) and Jerry shows he's come to terms with the 'Chains legacy, but is not content to just to feed off it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"Bought this to remove a stripped screw from a television circuit board.

The extractor tool didn't work for me, so I tried the little #00 Philips screwdriver included in the set in a last ditch before drilling out the screw. And it worked! I had tried other screwdrivers but this was just the right size and the steel on these is hard enough to bite into the screw. Saved me a big headache. These are well made and useful.

However, one of the small screwdrivers included in the set did work to get the stripped screw off. So the set was helpful, but not in the way that I expected. So yay!

Unfortunately after significant effort the Moody tool set did not work. Your mileage may vary. These will not work for every stripped screw. I had bad luck I guess.The screw bits are well manufactured and seem like they will last for as long as you need them. However, the blue handles are extremely bad. First of all they are too thin to get any grip. Second of all they leave a nasty blue paint stain on your skin. At least they were made in the USA, so it's hopefully not Chinese lead paint, but who knows. Also the metal clips are super annoying and get in the way so I took them off.Overall, I am pretty disappointed in this toolset. For me, this was a waste of twenty bucks. For you, it might not be. Who knows. Best of luck.PS.

The extractors are just 4 triangular tips, which are sharp, initially, but become dull, or deform right away when you try to get the stubborn screw out, and need to apply some force on the tool to bite.Those, for whom this worked, likely did not have right screw drivers in the first place.If you got a screw which is already stripped, and you have no idea as to why, well, maybe then this will work. But I would try a proper screw drver first, as it will bite in better than this.On the positive, screw drivers in the set are good, and their sizes for some reasons are slightly different than the ones in my main microscrewdriver set. So they might come in handy one day for another tough case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good extractor in my case","review":"I bought this tool set to extract a broken Jesus bolt in my 250 helicopter.

The set is nice and light weight and works well for mini screw drivers that you would use once in a while.

The clips also get in the way, but these can be removed.As for the screw extractor, when I first saw it I thought there was no way it would work. But with little effort I was able to extract a screw from my laptop (that came factory striped by Foxconn) that had no thread left to grip too. In addition, that screw was in there tight, but the extractor had no problem griping the gnarled screw head.I would recommend this for anyone looking for a compact screw extractor for small electronics."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not work for me","review":"bought this tool to extract the stripped screw of my Honda remote entry FOB.

The business end of the extractor is a hollow tube machined with tiny teeth, they go dull almost immediately when you use them, they won't bite in enough to get a grip on the metal to back the screw out, the tool material is just not hard enough. All in all a very disappointing tool. I read the other review from someone with a similar guitar screw problem, still thought it was worth giving it a try, but as the other review said, these don't work for that. If your problem is a broken tuner screw, find another solution, maybe a left handed 1.5 or 2mm drill bit is the ticket, but this isn't, I'm still looking for a solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screw Extractor","review":"I like the different miniature screw drivers.

It provides many helpful insights you won't find in the Internet, at least I can say I couldn't. I've seen some of those online Russian romance discussions, they are full of all kinds of examples and stories, often very controversial, and usually you will hear only one of the two sides involved - either an American man or a Russian woman sharing his/her experience and asking questions. You can probably learn something from reading those endless posts, but I think that this thoughtful analysis done by a Russian-American couple is much better, and it will save you a lot of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars","review":"My recommendation is not to waiste time on this book, especially if you are considering meeting a Russian woman.

That was the beauty of the old Glamour: The sex was there, but so were the terrific book reviews and stories on health.

I don't dislike Cosmo, but if I wanted to read Cosmo, I'd read Cosmo - I no longer have that choice.

The fiction is simply mediocre, and the entire magazine seems to be infected with editor Lewis Lapham's shrill and ever-growing Notebook (does the man ever have anything interesting or original to say?).

And HARPER'S is a perfect symbol for all that ails the Left. To call this magazine \\"Left leaning\\" is a farce. It doesn't lean...it completely, totally, enthusiastically, and blindly tumbles and falls into the \\"Far Left\\" swamp. The tone is often hysterically and shrilly partisan, reflecting the ongoing deafness and disconnection that the leftist media elites have towards the mainstream of America.The quality of the writing and feature selection has declined precipitously through recent years.

There are few magazines left that include material of such depth, and the broad scope of its content is both suitable and satisfying.One important benefit Harper's provides to its subscribers is access to the full content of all arhived issues back to 1850. This alone is worth the price of a subscription.One more note: I hope it is appropriate to suggest subscribing directly, as this will knock off quite a few weeks of nail-biting anxiety as you impatiently and obsessively check your mailbox, waiting for the first copy of your subscription to arrive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Magazine...if you receive it","review":"I ordered this magazine for a class I was taking last semester at college.

Wallowing in that grimness isn't in anyone's interest. Additionally, Harper's doesn't give voice to alternative political viewpoints--if they had their way, the editors would pack the courts, congress, and White House with liberals no matter the cost. This is a pluralist society and a magazine with the intellectual firepower of Harper's at its disposal should be strong enough to admit a range of views.

The author read a selection from Proust. It took forever and when she finally got to the 'point' the crowd all murmured and nodded in approval at its profundity. I thought I was going to go out of my mind.......what's so profound about taking 1000 words to make a point that could have been made in ten words or less? And therein lies my problem with Harper's.People here compare it with other \\"thoughtful\\" magazines like the Atlantic and the New Yorker. No....it's not like those magazines at all; every paragraph in those magazines is packed with information that is critical to understanding the entire story. They don't take the rambling \\"blue highways\\" approach like Harper's does. If you really want a magazine that is balanced and in depth without the wandering prose of Harper's try my two favorites: the New Yorker and the Economist. I also recommend the Atlantic."},{"rating":"1","title":"subscription foul-up","review":"I've read many positive reviews of this magazine and I did receive, several months ago, a trial issue.

This is the most recent of my magazine (re)-discoveries, and one that I am quickly discovering it difficult to be without. It provides wit, thought-provoking material, and the odd bizaare classified advertisement (nothing like an offer for free material on forthcoming alien invasions to brighten my day).

During the late 90s and the early part of this century, an effort was made to recreate the old Harpers.Gone now are the annoying fragments and pointless tables, but the quality of the writing is still variable. At its best, Harpers still trails far behind The Atlantic, and at its worst it's pitifully sophmoric. I'll try it again in a few more years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great magazine good price","review":"It is not available in full text in any of the library databases to which I have access, so I had to buy it in print.

Although the book flags a little towards the end--or perhaps it was author's journey that was flagging--McHugh possesses a very engaging writing style and has a wonderful wit that had me laughing with him most of the way.If you have already been to Ireland and would just like to reminisce, McHugh's book will take you back to a lot of scenarios where you will probably find yourself going, \\"I remember that.\\" \\"Pint-Sized Ireland\\" is also a quick, fun read for anyone who enjoys travel essays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touring Ireland looking for the perfect guinness","review":"This book would appeal to the young person who has the time and a little money to tour Ireland staying at hostels and trying out pubs.

I cannot remember a book so beautifully organized and concise that conveys the very essence of The Blessed Mother. The four mystics in this book, who had the amazing privilege to learn from Mary's life, the meaning underlying so many mysteries concerning both Her life and passing; as well as Our Lord's life and Crucifixion provides us today with a foundation from which one would be hard-pressed to flee.

This film came late in the Duke's career, and is not a classic, but definitely entertaining. The plot is pretty simple to follow, the action moves along at a nice pace, and the surprise ending is actually pretty funny. Overall, it contains a lot of the right ingredients for a solid Western movie. Several other reviewers have covered the details, so I will not here. Just two quick thoughts:First, Ann Margaret does a nice job in her role. Completely believable as the widow, she matches up well with the Duke in his role. Second, there is actually some good humor in this movie. I watched it with my boys and they loved the line \\"something to do\\".If you enjoy John Wayne Westerns, then you will enjoy this movie.

For example when she was learning to become a harlot there were small portions of text where I felt like it was too descriptive and could have been better served to let the reader imagine or 'read between the lines'.

They once had videos on MTV that I saw during daylight hours even! Now, they hardly draw a crowd at their concerts. I almost feel bad for Scott, being that talented and getting no recognition.

It's a simple and amusing way to play the game.The problem is that the double and triple word score tiles thus get reexposed after every usage... with the person that had previously used them getting to use them again and again and again. The only realistic way to avoid giving your opponent the triple word score repeatedly is to forfeit your turn.As it stands, the game is broken (as is also discussed in the reviews for Scrabble Express). I love Scrabble, but I am baffled as to how this made it through any kind of substantive gameplay testing.Either make up house rules or don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Fashion?","review":"Most of it was ads, and not very compelling ads either.

Not full of soft-porn like Cosmo, or teeny-bopper oriented fashion like Lucky, Glamour, etc., and not patronizing and politicized like Elle! Also not ALL about celebrities like In Style, although the non-trashy celebs are of course there. No stupid tips on how to manage life in your early 20's!This is for the women who love the Style Channel, Vogue, and even Allure (a wonderful beauty/cosmetics mag). I've been a devoted reader since I was about 30; I wish I had found this sooner because I couldn't stand the magazines aimed at the 20- somethings even when I was that age!AND...by the way, Amazon is the best source for subscriptions, in my humble opinion.

The magazine should play to its strengths. Its graphics and photo layouts are terrific. However, the articles are insipid and superficial; not worth a read. \\"Bazaar\\" unfortunately went downhill when Liz Tilberis took over the top spot; in the 60s and 70s the look was all about elegance and glamour. Ms. Tilberis stated in an editorial in the 90's that fashion was all about \\"youth and ectomorphism\\" and featured human Barbie dolls in grunge outfits. Okay, it looked funny, but what woman over 25 would spend good money to look like that? The impression one gets from reading \\"Bazaar\\" now is that it's still trying to find its target audience. When \\"Bazaar\\" stops acting as if it were afraid to compete with Vogue and emphasizes its strengths, it will be a much better magazine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me back my old Bazaar...","review":"I started reading HB 6 years ago, when the incredible Liz Tilberis was editor. Back then my eyes lit up everytime I opened an issue; the layouts and photography were awesome - way better than it is now. These days the beauty and fashion images are mostly dull and tedious. Some of them are really 60's, and not in the good way. I think it has a lot to do with who's in charge. They need to bring in somebody who will actually make the contents of the magazine attractive to the reader.

Unless of course, her Mummy and Daddy have Money to giver her to keep her Happy with such things. Nothing featured in here is under $150, and that's for underwear. UNDERWEAR! (...) No one I know in this mag's intended age range (well, except for one, but that's a long story and she doesn't dress in such things) has the kind of money to drop on $8000 designer dresses that will be out of style in three weeks.

I also ordered a third, that I have seen issues of, so its obviously the seller I used. And, this is not an address mix up. Both times I called, I had them verify my address. They had to correct one.

Some years ago a portfolio of Woodman photographs was reprinted. This small handfull of images was reproduced again and again. The group of \\"known\\" images grew somewhat as various small books or catalogs were published. The real strength of Woodman as an artist is evidenced by the fact that as every heretofore unseen image gets published, such as in this sizable book, the delicacy, richness, and complexity of Woodman's moltenly beautiful yet hauntingly tragic body of work grows exponentially. The original group of oft-reproduced images is revealed as random sampling of many images of the same captivating quality. There is so much that is not known about this work that each expanded treatment becomes a startling revelation.

No other game, whether it is board, video, or online, will take its place as an enjoyable pastime.I consider myself fortunate to have memories of competing against relatives and friends with this game. The thing about Monopoly was that you could play it with most anyone who could at least count money and make fictitious purchases.

When they lose, it's pretty tough on them too, as they put so much time in on the game and it can be a long while before the other players are out of the game - leaving the very young children bored or annoyed until the game is over. I guess that sounds like a sorry sport of a kid, but I'm really talking 4 and 5 year old kids... and this game is too long and too much for them.For adults, it's a fun and classic game... but it is almost always a very long game! There are lots of little pieces and lots of cards and money... so careful not to lose them all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to play, and gives a small view on money","review":"Monopoly is a game that almost all ages will like.

They range from easy to, in his words, fiendish. Each puzzle has a solution printed in the back. While there are two puzzles per page, they are nevertheless bigger than those in newspapers, and certainly bigger than those in most if not all electronic Sudoku kits. There are some unconventional Sudoku puzzles, including those which form an X-shape of five nested Sudoku sub-puzzles.Some tips are given in the beginning of the book for the solving of Sudoku puzzles. These include the use of clues provided by numbers that are remote from each other on the puzzle. For very difficult situations, Mepham recommends that the puzzle-solver narrow a spot to two possibilities, then take a guess at one of the two numbers and see if it creates a self-consistent solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"rgw5944","review":"I bought this raspberry tea on the previous recommendation however after brewing a pitcher of it, I find there is ZERO raspberry flavor in it.

Many of his songs with the Birthday Party were some of the best. He is the only original member of The Bad Seeds along with Nick Cave. Harvey was also in the band Crime & City Solution. He worked on movie soundtracks and kept busy. Over 25 years of music, it wouldn't surprise me if Mick Harvey has contributed to over fifty albums. His previous solo albums were English versions of the work of Serge Gainsbough. This is the first record of original and covers songs. Harvey calls it \\"very personal.\\" He ends up putting his personal touch on songs by The Gun Club, Tim Buckley, Lee Hazelwood, Johnny Cash, and others. It is a pretty interesting cool record. Mick Harvey plans on touring with this album with a real band. That should be interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mick Harvey the True Talent behind Nick Caves Bands","review":"This album shows that there is nothing Mick can do wrong when it comes to playing every instrument and shuns the stupid rock star fame.

Also a very humble and kind Bad Seed to all his fans. without Harvey there would have never been a Nick Cave, Crime and City Solution, Birthday Party.

Cain, then it must be Elmore Leonard. After reading the ten or twelve most recent Leonard novels and short story collections as they were published and thoroughly enjoying them, it became time to try some of his earlier work. LaBrava was the first, published more than twenty years ago. I was floored by the atmosphere of South Beach in the early eighties, so reminiscent of James M. Cain's noir novels like The Postman Always Rings Twice, Butterfly, and Serenade, published in the 1940s, with their elaborate, devious plot twists, photographic detail, and brilliant flawed characters. To those qualities Leonard adds his ear for dialogue. The plot revolves around ex secret service agent turned photographer Joe LaBrava, his fairly elderly former bookie friend turned hotel operator, and a slightly faded starlet. 'Nuff said. It's perhaps Leonard's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elmore Leonard rules!","review":"I would rank LaBRAVA among Leonard's best.

The characters are all uninteresting with the exception of the villain's sidekick and he doesn't feature enough in the story.To be fair the book does deliver a nice surprise in the middle but then the book meanders along and finishes with a ridiculous tie up that leaves one shaking one's head wondering if Leonard was as bored of the book as I was."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS NOVEL SHOULD BE THROWN DIRECTLY INTO RECYCLE BIN","review":"what's going on? page after page, nada. i think e.l. should abandon his cool-wannabe long time ago. he's writing a lota junk lately. it's about time to hang up his pen, typewriter, or microsoft office word program and go fishing. if you think you could get something meaningful or worthy out of this book, you should go to the beach with a metal detector and become a beach comber, maybe you could get some nickles and dimes, but definitely no paper money. one star is too much. and, my god, 'the best novel of the year'? did it mean during the whole year this 'book of nothing' published, not one other book ever printed and published?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read before renting or buying....","review":"If you are reading this review to sort out if you might want to rent this or buy it - this may help: DON'T!!!

Armies can sprout up anywhere, at any time. This means that a surrounded territory with a lone soldier can suddenly grow to a vast army in a single turn.

Writing is nowhere near where it is used to be. Most of the interviews are lame. A third of each edition is filled with meaningless ads you typically see in media that targets women.

They have some cool stories, even if some of them do get continued in the back, but that just means (depending on how far along you are), that you have the rest of the mag to look forward to. I dont really like any of the style tips and the clothes, and depending on how big the issue is, you'll have to trudge through about 30 pages of ads, before u get to the first page of the TOC. It's nice to see an Editor's column (or page) now, even though this EIC seems to be just a little too arrogant. Like every mature men's mag, they review CD's and books. I'd say 8 out of 12 issues are usually thick, and I'm not sure if the September issue (their last monstrously huge issue) will be like that this year or not, Overall, it's still very interesting.

However, Amazon, or the subscription service that it uses, engages in what I believe to be an unfair and dishonest practice.

But this issue was over six weeks old and I had already purchased it. Then, a week later, I received another past issue that I had also already purchased off the newstand. In my opinion, this practice is meant to move old \\"dead\\" issues and is a dishonest method of attempting to fulfill Amazon's obligation to new subcribers. And, as I said, when the purchase of a subscription is made, new sbuscribers are told that new issues will not be sent for two months.

The reasons I particularly like it are its very useful and well diagrammed golf tips, some of which have improved my play quite a bit in the last couple of years. I also like their feature articles which highlight a particular pro and analyze their swings and then illustrate how you can apply them to your game. Generally a magazine less interested in selling you new clubs than in teaching you how to play golf, GOLF is a solid read. They do at times stray into \\"my how awesome all these new clubs, balls, gloves, etc. are\\" (honestly when was the last time you saw a NEGATIVE review in any trade magazine???), but their recommendations based on your style of game are useful. Overall it is an excellent publication for any golfer from casual to obsessed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice illustrations for lessons","review":"I really enjoy how they illustrate and break down their lessons into different playing abilities. Even though they break down the lessons into breaking 80, 90, 100, straight hitter looking for power or power hitter looking for accuracy, they are all very helpful. No matter what your playing ability, I think any golfer can take away a little bit of advice from the playing lessons. Unfortunately, Golf Magazine seems to be a little weak on their travel side lately though; not really focusing on that perhaps due to the downturn in travel in recent months. I wish they would focus on that a little more like some other magazines such as T&L golf or The Golfer."},{"rating":"1","title":"golf magazine","review":"this was a gift to my brother. i have no idea if he's started receiving it yet. can someone let me know?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's my magazine?","review":"I have not received an issue as yet.

But being a diabetic I don't need the sugar and this product just suits me perfectly. It is all natural and if it has any sugar at all in it it must be very little.

On the other hand, I find I can't stand to read articles in Family Fun even when the subject matter interests me. I find the layout extremely busy, almost like I'm looking at a bunch of advertisements crammed together on the pages, when really it's the articles. It has some okay ideas, but also some pretty stupid ones (one that comes to mind is a suggestion for how to handle kids' frustration at the supermarket...one suggestion was to divide up in two groups and give each group one half of the list then race throught the supermarket and see who finishes first...

I don't understand why, since all of this is electronically done, it takes so long to received your first issue.

The other tracks are eclectic, some I don't like, the album arguably lacks cohesion, but it certainly gives plenty of variety, and almost everyone is likely to find a lot of good stuff there.

I use them not only to collect the poo, but also so that I can use serious diaper creams like Desitin on my daughter's diaper-rash-prone bumbum. I bought these instead of my regular brand because they were (slightly) cheaper. What a disappointment! Yes, they will probably be just as effective at keeping poo and medicine off of the diapers, but they are so rough and rigid that I truly worried that putting them against my daughter's skin might rub her diaper-rash raw again. Yuck! I tried them a couple of times, and she actually didn't seem to mind (I will admit), but I just didn't feel good about using them. There are much softer, nicer brands out there for nearly the same price. Don't settle for these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes cloth diapering much easier","review":"I love these liners!

He only voids once a day but it is very messy. We thought these liners would help keep the diaper somewhat cleaner and easier to rinse, but the liner just created a shoot for the poop to come out of the leg holes! Yuck!Since we know when he is going to do it, (he takes medicine for it and we have it timed out) we either put a paper (decomposable) diaper on him and toss it, or watch him closely so that we catch it right after it happens so there is less mess.I would only recommend this product for kids who have very solid stool. Our child's is very loose and the product does not work for him.

Not even a little bit.I think I'm going to soak my purchase in liquid fabric softner and use them in the dryer.I don't know if all liners are like this as this is the first one I tried.

I gave them two stars for a few different reasons.My daughter has very sensitive skin and I need to use diaper cream on her every time I change her. Even using two sheets, folded, the paste still leaks through to the diaper sometimes. A big bummer when using cloth diapers as you have to spend extra time scrubbing to get the paste out.The price seems cheaper than the others - 200 sheets for the same price as 100 sheets - but I end up using two at a time. So it really evens out in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I was expecting a lot more from these. When they came I laughed.

I put a few on the changing table so my husband would used them. When I asked him why he hadn't been using them, he said, \\"Oh, I thought those were dryer sheets.\\" Thats what they feel like, stiff, ichy dryer sheets. The Bummis and Bumkins brand are soooooo soft. All three serve their purpose, but I wouldn't want the Imse's on my butt!

They eliminate the need to soak/dunk diapers in the potty many times. (It's not the liner's fault if they rumple or fold up sometimes once the baby starts to crawl and walk.) Most of the time you can lift and flush the poopie, and maybe use a wipe to clean off the little extra mess left of the diaper. These are a generous size. If they are only urine, they wash fairly well with the diapers with some shrinking for a 2nd use. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't recommend them.","review":"They are stiff. They do the job but I have used other ones I like much better.

I tried switching to these as they were a little cheaper. Sometimes you get what you pay for. These bunched up and did not do a good job of catching all of the waste. They are much thinner and flimsier than the Grovia liners. We didn't even use them all up before we ended up buying some more Grovia liners. We are pretty much done with diapering, so I have not done anymore research to find an alternative. I would definitely not recommend these, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not practical with Bumgenious cloth diapers","review":"The individual sheets are too big and we need to cut them in half in order to use them with the Bumgenious cloth diapers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent buy","review":"These are perfect for cloth diapers. I almost never have to use the diaper sprayer for cleaning messes. They are sturdy in the wash - I haven't had any issues with tearing. The two rolls have lasted a very long time; much longer than I expected. The only issue that I see is that they're a little wide for the bum genius diapers I use, but my husband and I just fold them over and make them fit. Not even remotely a big deal for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Rough","review":"I really didn't like these liners.

While monopoly is a great way to while away the hours, it is also a game with tremendous educational potential that is especially relevant in today's highly-charged stock oriented investment climate. Children and young adults can benefit from the experience in earning, investing and risking that the game provides. Youngsters of all ages can have great fun experiencing investment ups and downs as they practice and sharpen their own skills before moving to the real game of monopoly on the Dow or the Nasdaq."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic, Always Fun To Play.","review":"Everyone recognizes Monopoly as the \\"classic\\" board game. Everyone loves it. Monopoly is a hit with all ages, young and old. It is educational for the young ones, teaching money budgeting tactics and some real-world buying and selling scenarios. The idea of real estate conquest sometimes goes to a player's head, so games can be rather competitive. However, Monopoly will always be fun for all players, and is worth the initial invest for hours of fun in the future. With this edition, Parker Brothers adds some nice new creature comforts like an organizational deed carousel, redesigned money, gold-finished tokens and a new train playing piece. These new features are defenitely worth the extra 7 dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of many early Santana recordings","review":"This is one of a bazillion CD's featuring early Santana work.There are no liner notes on the CD, so it is difficult to know the origin. It is probably recorded before the first Santana album was released.It is 54 minutes long, and has a note on the covers that it is 2 LP's in one (two very short LP's).The sound quality is poor, like it was taped on home equipment. There is not audience noise, so it was probably recorded in a studio, or more likely someone's home studio or garage. It has a wierd quality, like something is missing.Like most of the early Santana music, it is not that great. It is long, drawn out performances of some of the oldest Santana numbers, like Jingo.There are a ton of these type of Santana CD's out there. I still haven't heard one that is great. There are some that are passable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Im being generous with this rating","review":"As a die hard HLN fan, I was eagerly awaiting the Fore follow up Small World back in 88'.

Only songs like \\"Perfect World\\" \\"Gimme the Keys\\" and \\"World to Me\\" saved this cd from being turned into a drink coaster or clock.

Gary Ritchison is also the author of another volume in the series on the Downy Woodpecker. As with that book, the text is somewhat more substantial than in other books in the series, most notably that on the Black-capped Chickadee. Overall, an excellent book, and I look forward to reading others in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth buying","review":"Cardinals are extremely poplular owing to their bright plumage; unusualk in our northern climes.

A real delight to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast, Funny and full of style","review":"For any Regency Romance lover, Georgette Heyer's books are in a class all their own. This book is one of her warmest, filled with believable, quirky characters and a masterful use of our language. The story of feisty, practical Frederica, this book details her efforts to provide good futures for her younger siblings . . . and the efforts of a charming, rakish Peer of the Realm to change Frederica's future. Ms. Heyer's dazzling style, historical polish and delicious wit are beautifully evident in this fast and funny romance. There is something for the heart and for the mind . . . and for the funny bone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You Can't Help But Truly Enjoy This Book","review":"Frederica is one of my all-time favorite Georgette Heyer books. I love the interaction between the characters. Each character is unique and you have to keep reading to see what happens. One of the funniest scenes in the book mentions Dr. Ratcliff's Restorative Pork Jelly! You'll have to read it to see what that scene is about. Georgette Heyer is absolutely one of my favorite authors and I find myself reading and rereading her books all the time. I can't even speed read through them when I reread them because I would miss great dialogue between the characters. Everything she has written needs to be put back in print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had expected a large print version, not just a hard-bound version of a book I already have in paperback."},{"rating":"2","title":"not to cover I wanted","review":"I know it's a silly complaint, but if someone is going to sell their book used, they need to communicate all the details of the book.

Fans have been waiting for this day. Frederica is a great start to this series. It satisfies on many different levels; from the thawing of a cold aristrocrat, the addition of eccentric characters, and wonderful dialog. I stayed up all night to finish the book and ended up bursting out in laughter more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended to anyone and everyone","review":"I loved this book - definitely worth a read. Romantic, funny and in keeping with Georgette Heyer's very classy representation of the Regency period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to be Read & Discarded","review":"This is a quality-oversized paperback for the reader who loves to save and re-read her favorites.

Those shoes were comfortable and lasted me a very long time. Ten years later, I think I have worn my last pair of Rockports. Sadly, the quality is not there any longer though the comfort is. Rockport (a Reebok company now) has replaced the Vibram outsoles with a foam outsole that wears out in weeks and squeaks like those toddler squeaky shoes that are so cute . . . on a toddler. The squeak is embarassing and I can't spend $75 every month. I have now moved on to a Rockport imitator. Thankfully there are several in the department stores. Brands to consider: Croft & Barrow, Deer Stag, and Dexter."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT SHOES","review":"Can't beat the Rockports. My dad found these and wanted to buy them at a high-end shop. I told him to wait I could beat their price probably. Sure enough I checked out Amazon and not only did I get the black he wanted instead of brown, they were $35 cheaper. He then purchased a pair of brown he liked these so well. They are great for casual or dress. Real flexibility and the sole can't be beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inside a Dr.'s Training","review":"This little book takes me back to the way REAL doctors were trained and what they had to endure in the 60's.

He doesn't want to play as frequently as I do, though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best of the popular family games ever made!","review":"Play is reasonable with 3 people but much better with 4 to 6. The board and cards add to a fanciful atmosphere, but underneath the window dressing this is a thinking person's game.This is a game of *logic*, and it's pretty sophisticated. I cannot believe that people are rating this game below 5 stars on educational value! There are many levels of inference possible; I have been playing for almost 30 years and I'm not convinced that I play perfectly, much less bored with it. You can often deduce the most on other people's turns, sometimes more than the player whose turn it is, which is a very nice contrast to some strategy games in which only one person at a time has any real involvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best. Game. Ever.","review":"Best game ever. I am always having trouble finding someone to play it with. Bored? Play Clue. Need a fun event? Play Clue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whee!!","review":"My brother and I were always trying to find a third person to play with us... it's kind of boring unless you have 4 or more, though. The fun part for us kids was that you didn't have to be the oldest, biggest, or fastest to win. All you needed were some logical reasoning skills and a little bit of luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clue","review":"I have played this game many times before, and I have had great fun playing it. This game is a little complicated at first, but as you learn how to play, it gets easier. The pieces are easy to loose and some require extra care, but it is all for a good cause. The characters are all perfect for the game: On the outside they are all normal looking rich people, but by looking at their faces a little bit closer, they appear to be hiding somthing important. Over all, this is a really good game, but it has it has its downsides."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE! Not as pictured.","review":"I purchased this version of Clue specifically because of the picture depicting the actual characters in the game.

That is until I played it at my friends house! Now I'm a Clue fanatic trying to collect all the versions! This game can never get old because it's a different outcome every time! I strongly reccomend it to anyone 8 and older!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was HIM!! Really!","review":"This is another of the classic games that have enjoyed enduring fame and popularity for good reason. \\"Clue\\" must surely be to detective games what \\"Monopoly\\" is to money games.The concept is pretty simple, really: you use cards with various weapons, rooms and people on them and try to work out who the murderer is, where they did the terrible deed and what with. These items are randomly inserted into an envelope that is in the middle of the board. You move around each room, and try to find out what is going on. Who knows: it might be you.While simple, the game is loads of fun and there are certain strategies to it. After the first few times of getting whipped, you will figure them out soon enough. But basically, \\"Clue\\" is just plain fun and it requires very little to set up and enjoy.Happy hunting! Oh, and by the way, the Butler didn't do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A family favorite","review":"The Clue game is one of our most played games, and has been for years!!!!!

There was a lot of hype surrounding this but, unlike Quake 3, it lives up to the hype. It succedes in all the places Quake 3 fails - fun weapons, interesting boards and a very intelligent AI system on the bots (just try beating the Godlike setting). And I think it even blows away Quake 3 graphics-wise, too. My only pet peeve with the game is the load time!! I have a 733 MHZ computer and it takes FOREVER. But it's still worth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best game I have ever played","review":"This game is the best. My friend had it and I played it at his house.

Yes, I do play it straight. I wish I didn't have to eat or go to the bathroom because it takes away from time I could be fragging. I just bought the Nostromo n50 because I must be the best. When I am not playing UT, I am waiting impatiently to get back. All I need now is to be hooked up to an IV and a piss bag so I never have to leave the computer.

I thought, ok, but there is no way that it can compete with Half-Life (the game we played constantly). When I got over the first thing that stunned me where the incredibly good graphics! There were no little blocks, it was all smooth! The background also stunned me because it is 3D not just a wall like in Half-Life. My friend and I played for 4 hours switching off every two deaths, both single and multiplayer.If you love first person shooter games, I would recommend it, and even more if you like Half-Life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great on Windows Me","review":"This is the one and only game I have ever written a review about.

The many game modes and weapons(with an alternate firing mode as well as main) combine to create a perfect gaming experience. In the game of the year edition there are OVER 70 NEW maps to play in. Added to the original maps the game comes with that totals to about 100-something maps. There are also a lot of new \\"player skins\\" to choose from. Maybe the best thing about this game is the tremedous replay value it has. You can play in the 1 player tourney or do practice sessions (which is just a normal battle not a tutorial) with the Bots that you created. In my opinion this game is more enjoyable than watching a kid wrestle an imaginary bear. Simply put, the best game EVER.

No offense to anyone, but the person that said that these questions are for five-year-olds is definetely wrong, unless that person is a genious. Most of the questions are NOT very easy.

It's a very different style of cookery book obviously written by a chef who has (and expects of others) a very good knowledge of food. The ideas in some of the recipes ,even the bread section, are quite complex. I don't know many home cooks who would be attempting to make almond pithiviers and puff pastry at home. However there is an obvious dedication to good food that is conveyed well with lots of tips on purchasing and produce. Written in a informal tone it is a better read than useful book to the untrained gourmand. For the serious enthusisast, myself included, this is a breath of fresh air mixing greek, french and british cooking with more than seafood on the menu. The layout is superb and the photos are exquisite. Sometimes the food seems too complicated but is certainly inspirational.

It what was a live recital performed in Guanajuato for a Cerventino Literature Fair and I was very happy with his renditions of Italian baroque arias and turn of the century Mexican danzas. However, he is simply not made for ranchereas. His voice is montonous - like Placido Domingo, he only knows how to sing \\"open\\" with lots of vibrato - and lacks any rhythym or pizzaz whatsover. Further, with the proliferation of quality Mexican tenors (Fernando de la Mora, Alberto Angel, Humberto Craviotto, Valente Pastor ...) he is going to have to do a lot better than this to earn my dollar. In fact, I am not exaggerating when I say that even the boys from Mariachi Vargas, Mariachi Cobre or Los Camperos sing these songs better than Ramon.

Unfortunaltely some of us with teens and preteens have still not figured out how best to shepard our children into the healthest possible lifestyles, given our modern culture.I read the book anyway, and was struck with the thought that very few of the suggestions presented by the author were new or original. Many of the main stream suggestions have been in parents' magazine articles for decades. The title and cover of the book were the most creative and original part of the package.The author is a pediatrician, yet little or no science graced the pages.Of course I was not been able to bring myself to toss the book in the recycle bin.

Our eleven-year-old is a voracious reader and a decent writer, but, in a techno-age when he can count on WordPerfect, Grammatik, and Spellcheck for help polishing his final drafts, his handwritten drafts can be an atrociously penned garble of spelling errors and less-than-perfect syntax. Playing Boggle has changed that. To compete, he has had to (1) develop a system for scanning the cubes, (2) apply spelling rules to ensure that he's actually got a legitimate word, and (3) improve his penmanship. Over the past six months, these skills have been parlayed into first drafts that don't require nearly as much work as before. He has admitted, too, that writing more clearly from a mechanics standpoint has freed him to work out more challenging ideas and more creative ways of expressing those ideas.How's that for a noisy, fun, portable game that everyone in the family can enjoy?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unmistakably the finest word game ever!","review":"This is unmistakably the finest word and thinking game made.

It's one of my favorites of all time, but not in the traditional 4x4 grid. 4x4 is too darn boring and repetitious. The only game worth playing is Big Boggle with the 5x5 grid. Luckily we have one of these from many years ago, and I live in terror that it might get lost, or the cubes might vanish. If so I'll have to give up Boggle forever I guess, as Big Boggle is no longer available anywhere at a reasonable price, and regular 4x4 Boggle is not worth playing.But I can't understand why Big Boggle is no longer marketed.

No, boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a rental game!","review":"I'll give this game a star for it's production values, but everything else comes up very short.First it plays like double dragon, but with less interaction, you can't really pick up new weapons (besides the long range ones) and your selection of attacks is very small.The A.I. of your enemies and comrades is pitiful, soldiers often stand around with very little agressive behavior, and bosses can be cheap. Think Luigi in Mario Kart (kudos to those that get it)And if you want replay value, look elsewhere, this game has five stages, and though the difficulty shoots up quickly, that's simply a cheap tactic to stretch the game out.This is a game to rent when you want to impress non serious gameplayers with graphics, or when you're home sick with a cold and need a brainless diversion. Because put simply, the fun lasts for maybe an hour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dynasty Warriors","review":"Good fun button mashing entertainment. I enjoyed it because it's a great, relatively mindless way to wind down at the end of a tough day. Good graphics, fun, and well worth it if lots of of hacking and slashing is your cup of tea. I always get a bit queasy with Doom-style games because of the movement and blood and gore but this is fairly sanitised, smooth and very playable. I'd suggest renting it first to see what it's like but otherwise a pretty good start to the PS2.It will last a while and increasing levels of difficulty will be a little too easy for hard-core gamers who will finish this off in a month or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"So when does Koei make Die-nasty Warriors 3??","review":"This game rocks, I have put alot of time on it and the replay is still OK, Koei did a great job of meshing fighting game with strategy game kind of like Golden Axe meets Myth.The characters are all different enough to be noticable on screen and they each play differently (at least the ones I have thus far unlocked). The game is challenging and with certain characters down-right hard, but the game is not too long to make one not want to play with each character.The soundtrack actually gets to stay on as well which for me is pretty unusual I play with no volume on most games after a couple of days. But psuedo heavy metal goes well with pseudo violence I guess. Here is the part where I say something bad about the game.............sorry I can't think of anything.This is easily the best console game I have played this year, and falls right below diablo 2 for best video game of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This is a great game. I can't seem to play it enough.I played the demo in the store and that was what convinced me to get it and now I can't get enough of it. You definitely have to play it on novice first, so you can get use to blocking and using the bow and arrows.I always recommend renting the game before buying (since you can't return them). I rented a few others before buying and that was a wise choice on my part. For example, Summoner was not what I expected but the reviews were good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely fabulous","review":"This will be an extremely short review.

Anxious to try a game compared to the likes of \\"Kessen\\" by the same company, I have to say that I am pretty disappointed.But this game seems like it was cloned from the PS1 version in a big hurry to get to market. The graphics look very super-imposed on their background, and the fighting is very unrealistic, in the sense that you can just jump into a crowd of people and start swinging away --- including not even harming your own teammates. (Can we have a tiny bit of realism here?) The character auto-animation is odd...characters just take random lobs at each other instead of actually fighting. Finally, there are very limited moves to choose from.If you must have this game, please rent it first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning, just stunning!","review":"Wow... this is wonderful.

Basicly you just run around and kill everyone in sight,what more could you ask for. Don't get cocky though, this game gets harder as you play, but only in the sence that it takes more hits to kill the enemy, and there are alot more of them, oh, and arches, those ... arches. The downside is that there are not alot of moves per character, which makes it repetitious, other than that its good accept there is alittle slowdown when things get crowded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read This! This game is awesome","review":"After reading some of the reviews on this site, I was hesitant before buying this game because some reviews say it is just a button masher. At first when I played it I thought it was great. Wonderful graphics, challenging, and my favorite part is taking on worthy opponents which are the other army's leading generals. After playing it for a few hours and not being able to complete the second level, I got a little bored and stuck. Whenever you get into a rut on a game you don't feel like playing it. But after getting through that I discovered that the further you go, the more involved you get. Those who say its a button masher didn't give the game a fair chance. I feel that this game is very challenging and it more than just hitting buttons.

Their sound got slower, watered down, and the lyrics are some of the stupidist I've ever heard. Subcultural Girl is probably the worst song on the CD. I tried to give this CD a chance but it hasn't grown on me. The only decent song on it is \\"Nice day for a ressurection\\", but the live version of it on the \\"UNDEAD'N'LIVE\\" CD is much better. If you want to hear some good Nekromantix I would suggest their first release \\"Hellbound\\"(if you can find it), or their second release \\"Curse of the Coffin.\\" This release shows that the Nekromantix are in it for the money and will change their style to get it.

But without the information preceding, one wouldn't have the full understanding of why the Higgs is so important. It's NOT just about giving mass to all other particles, it has to do with the Standard Model equations, supersymmetry, and an inflationary universe as well.I found Lederman to be very humorous and found myself laughing out loud at times. My only fault with the book is that is does need updating. As has been mentioned, the top quark was found and the book does not mention that. While it still talks about the SSC, no mention is made of the LHC, which is another addition that should be made.All in all, I learned I TON from this book. Five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Pace, Ineffective Humor","review":"The book was not effective for me, for a handful of reasons.1. To begin with, I found the book slow-paced (it takes more than a third of the book to get to the discovery of the electron).2. The authors' attempt at humor doesn't work for me. Example: \\"Nature uses these combinations, called molecules, to build planets, suns, viruses, mountations, paychecks, Valium, literary agents...\\" It's just not funny for me.3. The authors labor under the impression that the reader will both hate any math and not be able to understand it. Their attempt to explain a formula such as F=ma is to spell it out in words: \\"Eff equals em ay.\\"4. The amount of material actually devoted to the God Particle (Higgs boson) is extremely small.5. There are many topics that would be improved with artwork at the level of a Scientific American article, but the only pieces of artwork in the whole book are a diagram of an American football play and a childish map that leads us from Democritus to Burger King."},{"rating":"2","title":"9.479352 stars for LEON LEDERMAN!!","review":"This is the book that got me interested in physics, and encouraged me to study hard enough to be able to pursue a career in physics! Now I have changed to a different field in science (meteorology), but if it hadn't been for Lederman's book, I probably wouldn't be in science at all. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is considering pursuing a career in a physics-related field."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is physics, but not as we know it Jim...","review":"Lederman spends the first third of this book reviewing physics, from Greek times to the early part of this century; the second third focuses on the more recent history of particle accelerators - in which Lederman himself plays a part. All this is a necessary and fascinating preface to the final third - an exploration of the frontiers of knowledge in the exploration of the fundamental building blocks of nature, in which Lederman quietly pokes fun at physicists' attempts to find the answer to life, the universe, and everything - which they suspect might be very simple and beautiful, and at least partly to do with the God Particle - the Higgs Boson - a (so far) theoretical particle/force (I am not a physicist, so I can get away with this description) which gives mass to everything in the universe.If reading this does not get you excited about physics, nothing will. I look forward to an update, Mr. Lederman - have you found Higgs yet?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Learnig Of another World","review":"After having read this really great book I realized I had opened a door to another world, of which I had never known existed. I found the book not only fascinating but easy to read and - - miracle of miracles, I actually bagan to understand something of physics. The author, Professor Lederman writes with humor, clarity and kindness - - kindness to a reader who is just being introduced to this world..... I would recommend this book to anyone, whether your interest is physics or just an inquiry into the world around you - - the unseen world around you.l"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not Great","review":"This is billed as the \\"funniest book about physics ever written.\\" But that's not saying much, the humor is mostly one-liners tossed in here and there, which starts to get old after about 400 pages.It has a pretty good, comprehensive history of physics. It was interesting to learn that \\"theorists\\" and \\"experimenters\\" are two discrete groups within the field of physics. It was also interesting to read about the stories of who/how the discoveries were made, although it seems as though they were often having inspiration on Friday afternoons and having to work day and night all through the weekend - did they never have inspirations on Monday?Some of the math gets a bit dense, even though Lederman promised that it wouldn't be. But overall, this was an interesting book, even if I had to glaze over some of the dense math."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good book","review":"It is indeed a very good book. It's too bad that the super collider was not built in Texas, but progress continues nonetheless. This book gives a history of the exploration into particle physics, with much wit and humor. For anyone interested in science, this is a good book to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"my personal review","review":"What I am about to write only reflects my personal thoughts on this book:1- I find the title of the book misleading, as VERY little is dedicated to the Higgs boson in the book... very disappointing, as I bought the book to learn more about it.2- I didn't really like the sense of humour used in the book, but I guess that's subjective.3- I didn't appreciate the lack of humility of the author either, and his unsubtle bragging about Nobel Prize and his work at Fermilab.4- Finally, the book needs updating, as although it was \\"recently\\" published, the content is from 1993.It's probably a good book for those who want to read about the history of physics discoveries, but certainly not for those - like me - who wanted to know more about the Higgs boson..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book!","review":"A great book! Excellent overview of problems, solutions and discoveries from the experimentalist's point of view. Lederman and Teresi took their time and did a great job covering the basics, describing the history and showing the modern development in physics. \\"The God Paricle\\" also provides a lot of interesting information about great physisits of the past. The book is never a bore, the style is great, read it, you will have a blast."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't believe this book","review":"It is written well and Lederman's approach is better than others. I bought this book surprisingly a few days before the supposed discovery of the god particle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good pen","review":"We bought a few boxes of the Bic Atlantis 1.2 pens for our office. They put small globs of ink on the page that smear frequently. It's especially bad for those of us who print. The more strokes you make picking up and putting it back down on the paper, the worse the globbing gets. I don't like the way the cap fits on the end of the pen when you're writing, either. (Small thing, I know.) They have a rubberized grip that is comfortable to write with, and they write fairly smoothly. But, the globbing is a deal-breaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly disappointed","review":"As a major fan of trivial pursuit, I was very much looking forward to the millennium edition. We played it the first night we received it and it was very disappointing. We have Genus IV edition, and there were many questions that were copied word for word from that edition. The questions were much easier than past editions and certainly did not cover the whole millennium. That's just the questions. The card box is entirely too small, not to mention ugly. Also, when you have to pass it from person to person, you can glimpse the answers on the picture cards. I would not recommend this game to any trivia buffs, as the earlier editions offer the same questions in a better package."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is DIFFICULT?","review":"To the reviewers who claim that nobody will know more than 5% of the answers, or that people won't know 90% of the questions, I have to ask, what game were you playing? If I had one complaint with this game, it's that it seems dumbed down. (I finished the game on my first turn during a recent go-round. Really. It's that simple.) In fact, the questions seem to be getting easier with each new edition. Compare this one with the orginal Genus or Genus II Editions (back when you got 1000 cards) and you'll see what I mean. And as far as being a \\"Millennium\\" edition, too many of the questions are from the past 100-150 years. I was expecting a good deal more about the early part of the millennium--stuff on the Crusades, the Middle Ages, etc. I'll still give it a decent rating, because it CAN be fun, it's just not all that challenging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst game I ever played","review":"No need to be smart to play. All you got to do is be a couch potato. Needs more questions that make u think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy unless you are a tv and news fanatic","review":"The questions were way too hard. The history and science questions were the only ones even half interesting. The other questions were next to impossible unless you are a television fanatic and can remember everything that happened in teh last millenium"},{"rating":"2","title":"A teen's perspective","review":"I think this is a really fun game to play with friends, especially with teams. I agree that many of the questions are easier than the earlier editions, but this can make it more enjoyable to play as well. I think it can be very educational, however how educational depends on how seriously you play. I have personally learned a lot of useless but fun information playing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Trivial Pursuit Ripoff","review":"Nifty packaging, but disappointing. Questions from the past 1000 years? Forget it. Mostly dumbed down media questions -- do you really care about Pamela Anderson's biography? Looks like those of us who loved the original and played it until we knew the questions by heart will have to give up TP. Would be nice if somebody came up with another edition that requires 1/2 a brain. Don't waste your $$$ on this turkey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trivial Pursuit Millenium Edition","review":"Sure - the questions are hard! ...But isn't that the idea? This version of Trivial Pursuit is lots of fun because it challenges the mind! As a fab of trivia in general, I highly recommend this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype!! It's not at all what it promies!","review":"The average intellect will not know the answers to 90% of these absurd questions. There is more t.v. and music trivia than educational trivia. Don't waste your hard earned money on this box of trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inappropriate for kids/teens, and very difficult!","review":"Unfortunately, this is my first edition of trivial pursuit. I'm a 20-something honors college student...and I found this very difficult. Not only were the questions incredibly difficult, but it is absolutely inappropriate for children or teenagers! There are numerous questions and answers you would cover your children's ears for... I think the age range should start at 18. Or 50, because without a degree or life experience in world history back to at least the 1800s, any normal person wouldn't be able to answer more than 5% of these questions!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not a trivial buff at all, but I was able to win pies.","review":"I got this as a gift too, so I'm glad I didn't spend money for this. This game's questions are for those that are NOT trivial buffs. Most of these questions were more like general knowledge, for those who don't normally play trivial pursuit. Those geniuses would probably get bored with this version. The pie colors are hard to distinguish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Scares Son","review":"My 4 year old son is afraid of this book. His preschool class is reading it and he doesn't like it at all. I can see why. The faces in the book are so mean looking.

Then, you have a bunch of people fighting and hitting each other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"We love the paper bag princess.

Back to the runners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adequate but serious design flaws","review":"I have a German Shepherd that drags his hind toes [to the point of \\"quicking\\" his nails] and planned to use these on his back feet while on our pool deck. On first use, when I apply them as tight as possible, they do stay on; however they immediately spun so he was walking on the fabric side, not the \\"bottom\\". I then sewed the Velcro strap across more of the boot, thinking that would help it stay on properly. It didn't - they still spin around. He has now worn through the fabric side. I'll have to see what other modifications can be made to try and keep them right side up. I expected them to wear out but not within 3 uses of about 30 minutes each.On the positive side, he is not bothered by them at all and they do stay on, even during/after swimming. If I were to order again, I would go a size smaller. I used the suggested measurement procedure and ordered the large, but think a medium would definitely go on and maybe eliminate some of the other issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"good patch, so-so band","review":"when i was searching for an alternative to flent eyepatches, i tried this one. i loved the patch. it wore well for over a week, but the band is too weak and stretched out within a few days. overall it beats flent, hands down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Songwriter!","review":"I ordered this cd after hearing another artist recommend Dayna Kurtz, and what a great surprise! Her songwriting skills far surpass any of those chart-topping ladies (Alanis Morrisette, Sheryl Crow, etc.), and her voice is beautiful, unusual and skilled. The only thing that holds her back slightly are some of the musical arrangements-at times they bury her in the mix, and seem to plod along at an unnaturally slow pace. She's credited with guitar playing, but on several songs the guitar is lost behind muddy percussion and overt electric guitar. Standout tracks include \\"Somebody Leave A Light On\\", and \\"Postcards From Downtown\\". Though I long to hear this artist record a solo album, this one is still well worth the purchase. I predict great things ahead for this worthy talent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"The song \\"Fred Astaire\\" dug itself deep into my head. I listened to it over and over during a long car ride. The good news is the rest of the album is really great as well. The songs are strong, her voice is hauntingly beautiful and the arrangements are simple but complement her voice perfectly. I won't reduce Dayna's unique gift with comparisons. If music means more to you than something that drones in the background I would strongly recommend that you buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this CD","review":"The best singer/songwriter album I heard this year. Dayna Kurtz's got incredible timing and an absolutely beautiful voice wether she wispers or screams. Jazzy and rough, the songs show a mature emotional range. A nice balanced cd. Only downside, it;s a little short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Magazine","review":"I thoroughly enjoy reading this magazine cover to cover.

For example, every women's magazine recommends beauty products, but GH actually gets testers as well as doctors, dermatologists, etc. to test their products for an extended period of time.

Despite the awesome prices, it still rings to me as a housewife type of magazine which is fine if you enjoy working in the home. It has useful tips but I was overwhelmed by all the ads. The content is a little weak for me and does not expand beyond the kitchen and the dish washing and the cooking really- in my opinion. I wish the content was more gender equal- the magazine is for sure geared toward the older married perhaps with children woman. Or single lady working in the home. I will not be subscribing to this magazine again due to personal taste. I bought it because it was so cheap but all my issues have only been laying around unread after reading the first two I received. The content needs to be more rich.

There are many good ideas in this magazine and one of the only magazines besides my favorite (All You) that offers normal clothes and normal stores. The past months articles on saving money were well thought out and were easy things to try. The idea of putting a filled bottle water in the back of your toilet to decrease how much water needed per flush was a great idea! The one reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the constant need to have celebrities on the front cover while the articles about them aren't direct interviews - just some statements made to other people here and there.

With other similar magazines I can flip through the whole thing in one sitting; with GH I need alot more time to go through it since there is alot of info in there that I find useful. I also find myself bookmarking various pages to go back to. I like the different tips they have and its focus on living budget-conscious. The recipes are great too; I was going to buy a cookbook until I tried a few recipes from GH and realized that they ALWAYS come out tasty, and I am not an experienced or particularly good cook!

OK, as for the magazine itself, this is another one my mom likes to read and which I find myself checking out from time to time. Good Housekeeping has existed for many years and is ranked 5th in the USA for sales! It has a circulation of over 4,000,000. It covers an array of topics including: food, fitness, beauty, child care, money management, health news, travel, and human interest stories. This is a magazine that would be great for any homemaker (is that one word or two?) If you are a parent or someone who has their own place, this magazine could be a big benefit to you.

That's right, ALL THEY DO IS TALK. Oh, wait, something else does happen: they eat. My God, this thing'll have you on the edge of your seat to see if the restaurant isn't out of pie... that was a joke. But there aren't any of those in this movie. in short, do not see it.P.S.

The luminance levels shift throughout the film as well.Malle, Gregory and Shawn should be better represented than this level of transfer gives us.If you absolutely have to see this DVD: play it on a 12\\" Black and White TV and enjoy the outstanding performances... then write and complain to the slackers that put this awful transfer on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"A remarkable gem!","review":"Dinner with Andre is a clever device employed by this smart director to exposse his multiple and deep concerns about the actual world .

This type of film may not be for everybody because the setting takes place entirely inside a posh NYC restaurant with two friends discussing everyday life. The film is all dialogue, as I said before it may not be everybodys cup of tea.I purchased the DVD several months ago and promptly returned it because the video quality was horrendous. I do not remember if the movie was filmed poorly or the transfer from video to DVD was flawed but, none the less the DVD version was very grainy. It looked as if somebody taped the movie inside a theater with a Super 8 camera.I do not recommend the DVD version unless you don't mind inferior video quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Restaurant.","review":"It really is just that - two guys having dinner at a New York restaurant engaged in a conversation.

This film just comes off to me as dated, self-righteous New York BS. Andre Gregory comes across as a humorless, paranoid freak with Wally for the most part just swallowing his inanities whole. I suppose I can appreciate this as a period film of New York in the early 80's when it was cesspool and everyone was a neurotic walking around trapped in their own head. Other things about the movie I appreciated: Wally's \\"inconceivable\\" comment (Princess Bride!); beginning scene in the New York subway with all the graffiti; the old waiter guy, who seemed to be the only one in the film who wasn't lost in space.

I have an MA in Philosophy and I detest car chases and gratuitous violence and the various Hollywood formulae. I'm not complaining about the lack of explosions and blond bimbos:This film was just plain shallow drivel.No action, and no meaningful dialogue, and dull characters who seem to think they're interesting.

It'd improve both films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bourgeois Bohemian drivel","review":"Poor Andre. Travels the world in search of depth and meaning, but where does he end up? Why, back in New York City, of course. Back to his comfy upper middle class life replete with a doorman, summers on Long Island, posh restaurants, children he no doubt sends to private schools (children who incidentally would now be of age and probably trying to amass large dot.com fortunes and think of the old man as a nutty gas bag). Andre himself admits he misses the sixties, thereby revealing everything you need to know about this film. In his younger days he felt alive and connected. Now he's old and disenchanted, the typically insufferable baby-boomer. And to compare such a life to that of a concentration camp victim is the height of immaturity and self-absorption."},{"rating":"1","title":"June 09 DVD...still awful","review":"Strange that as I write, Amazon is not yet shipping the new DVD release, which came out yesterday, according to Netflix.

They're right...it's horrible. The movie is, however, wonderful. It's a polar movie in that people either seem to love this or hate it. My ex-girlfriend left after 15 minutes because it was so boring. I was watching and listening with the horrible feeling that the main characters could stop talking at any moment. It is riveting stuff. This kind of thing should be like the James Bond movies - each year a new conversation comes out. That would make me so happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Penetrating...provocative","review":"So many wonderful reviewers have offered their appreciation for this transformative film that I can only add that when I think of this film, I rarely see two men sitting at a dinner table in a restaurant. Instead I have vivid images of the experiences that Andre describes. His mesmerizing story-telling has me so absorbed in his journey, particularly the theater camp in Poland, that I follow him there in my mind's eye and have sometimes felt a bit like a participant. It is the kind of things that happens often to me when reading a gripping memoir, I forget where I am while I am reading the book. As for the power of this simple, low budget, thoughtful film, I know my mind & imagination were well-stimulated, (not my adrenaline glands) and for this I thank everyone involved in bringing to life.To more free-spirited living and deep all night long conversations about the mystery and magic of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great film with a very original premise","review":"This review is for the Criteiron Collection DVD edition of the film.My Dinner with Andre is a film written by Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory, and directed by Louis Malle.The film stars Shawn and Gregory, as \\"themselves\\" more or less. In the film Shawn, meets Gregrory for dinner and a high end restaurant having not seen each other for years. They discuss what they have been doing since they last saw each other and about their furure plans.Many of what the characters talk about is based on real life experiences of the actors/writers. I found the film to be very interesting and with much of the film being dialogue based, it can easily be adapted into an audio drama.The DVD comes with two supplements. \\"My Dinner with Louis\\" is a BBC production where Wallace Shawn interviews Louis Malle. Also included are two new interviews with Shawn, and Gregory.The price of the DVD may be a bit steep, but it is really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those who seek transformative spaces","review":"This is a movie I watch when I don't know HOW to think anymore. It puts me right back on the stool; sits me up;sends me back into \\"observation\\". Sit as if you're right there with them; they're friends. Never mind if you can't understand what they're talking about, that's only being used to lead them to a transformative experience that's being created between the two of them--and you too, if you follow. And, if you're legal, a little marijuana will help to open up to the experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great film and a great book","review":"This book is as great as the film and then some. Like most all screenplays, it includes the parts that were left out of the film. Another plus about reading this screenplay is that you can absorb what they are talking about more deeply, and then when you watch the film again it all comes together and makes more sense. The film and this book are really two halves of one whole, and any fan of the film will enjoy it even more after filling in the gaps with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Expensive","review":"For this price I could almost buy two whole monopoly games at my local walmart.

However don't even think about this book if you're new, or just finished C++ for Dummies and think you're the Man. Schildt's style is neither fun nor funny, and unless you already know c++ fairly well this book is unreadable.Schildt has no penchant for making even the easier topics understandable to first year people; Herb seems out of touch to anyone but accomplished code jockeys.For a better beginner-advanced beginner book try Stephen Prata's very helpful C++ tome."},{"rating":"2","title":"A BOOK THAT YOU GOT TO HAVE","review":"This book is best book I ever read for C++. I have read tons of book and nothing is compaired to this one. Herber Schildt puts a great amout of time to explain everything in the chapters.

In one example class he uses a copy assignment without a copy constructor. He also uses exit() which no good C++ programmer uses.Schildt did NOT help create the ANSI C++ standard and his code most definately proves it. This book assumes a knowledge of C since it goes right into classes in CH 2 so it wouldn't be very helpful for those with no experience in C.This book is fine for those only wanting a superficial knowledge of C++, but I can't really recommend it for those wanting to know more of the language. Especially because of the glaring errors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Presentation: Good, Accuracy: Fair","review":"The author presents the subject matter clearly. However, while referencing some of the topics he discusses with other books I currently use, he does seem to recommend programming methods that can lead to difficult debugging.

It tracks different platoons through companies, battalions and regiments. I found this very distracting and unless you're doing specific research on a very small group, not at all helpful.

It makes a great gift for the hard-to-buy type, and it is a magazine that comes across as open and honest, without being \\"preachy.\\" I say it's an interfaith magazine, however it's rare to see articles about Muslims, who certainly must have uplifting stories of their own to tell. Nevertheless, it's a great little magagzine to read when you want to read a little something while in bed, when you have a little break from the kids, or when you need something a little more positive in your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Regardless of your religious, or nonreligious, persuasion...","review":"My wife got we started on this one during our nightly bedtime reading. She'd say \\"here's a good one\\" and read it to me. The nice thing about this publication is that it doesn't cram religion down your throat. Every piece is concise and spiritually uplifting without being preachy. I give it 4 stars only because it's a little too sappy for me sometimes, kind of like watching 7th Heaven, but if you want something that for a few minutes of time can leave you in a much more spiritual frame of mind, this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guideposts","review":"I have subscribed to Guideposts for quite a few years and really love this inspiring magazine.

The Cars and Candy-O also received the same quality HDCD remaster and sound great as well. Unfortunately the Elektra $6.99 Shake It Up and Heartbeat City releases did not receive this remastering and the difference shows, especially on SIU."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ric Ocasek writes some trippy stuff","review":"Not the greatest Cars album, but lyrically it is one of their most interesting. Several songs from this album do make the \\"greatest hits\\" list, but it is some of the non-singles like \\"Down Boys\\" that will draw most of your attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's A Reason Others Say This is Under-rated","review":"First and foremost, I'm a huge Cars fan. I have all of their albums and all of their solo efforts as well (Ric's, Elliot's, Ben's and Greg's). However, I have to say that for the group, this is their weakest release. Why else would all of those who love this call it under-rated? They may love it, but you probably won't unless you love the Cars. If you do love them get this CD because there are some good tracks. If you've only sampled their Door-to-Door CD, you might like this too because it does have that harder edge. However, if you're looking to get classic Cars which made them great get \\"The Cars\\" (self-titled first release), \\"Candy-O\\" or \\"Shake It Up\\". If you want their release with the biggest chart-toppers go for \\"Heartbeat City\\". Get this one and \\"Door-to-Door\\" last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great band, weak effort!","review":"Panorama is the Cars third album, in three years. While it looks like many fans do enjoy Panorama, the album doesn't really do anything for me. \\"Touch and Go\\" was a minor hit, and I didn't even really care for that song, most of Panorama sounds bland to me. For the hardcore fans only!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Colossal Disappointment","review":"Let's be honest -- the songs on this album are just simply not in the same league as the debut LP or the brilliant follow-up Candy-O.Whether or not this album was better than other stuff on the radio at the time is barely the point.The album was a colossal letdown from the first two albums.PERIOD!!It's good to be a fan of the Cars and another thing to steer listeners to their best albums -- this ain't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"DARK","review":"The first two Cars cds, were well produced, tight on the playing, and the songs were well written. This cd is just the opposite. The songs, are not great, most are average, and their are no stand outs. The production is muddled, and the playing this time out is not as tight as before. The songs aren't all bad. \\"Panorama\\", Touch and Go\\", both rock, and have a great bass line running thru them. \\"Down Boys\\", and Don't tell Me No\\", have potenial, and \\"you Wear Thoses Eyes\\", could really have been a hit, but the production almost kills them. Rest of the songs are not much, just filling space. The singing this time out is more raw, like the playing, it's not the polished sound, that they had before. Buy one the greatest hits, and skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally weird and totally cool!","review":"Are you thinking of buying your first CARS album? Well, this probably isn't the best choice. I would recommend the debut, Candy-O or Heartbeat City for your first CARS album. Panorama, on the other hand, is for those of us who want to go all the way with the Cars. It's weird, even by Ric O's standards, but it is so groovy. You will be surprised how catchy some of these tracks really are - they stick like glue and they're pretty darned deep. It is \\"arty\\" for new wave, but I think they pulled it off brilliantly. It is my favorite of all Cars albums simply because it is exactly what the Cars were: weird, but cool! And most of all, FUN - even if it is \\"dark\\" it has a silly side that proves these boys had a great sense of humor to go with their musical genius. Buy this is you already have an album or two of theirs and want to expand your library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find a Hole and Bury It!","review":"I never did get this one! Perhaps two decent songs on the whole album. A major mistake. I was in denial for so many years, but now I come clean! Why else would it be cheaper.

It is not nearly as good as the first two but the Cars made up for it with later excellent albums like Heartbeat City."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds & words without music & songwriting","review":"As a fan of the Cars' debut and Heartbeat City, I thought the reviews here might point to another solid through-and-through Cars' effort.Not so. I don't understand how anyone can positively rate this record. While there's one or two OK tracks, this disk is just a splash of sound effects, guitar rhythms, and weak lyrics that someone apparently hoped would equal music. They don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"3rd's a puke","review":"As a wee'un I was hoping the back-sass and cheek would continue. \\"don't cha stop\\" [sic] . . \\"just what i needed\\" . . \\"candy-o\\" . . and then I heard for what i had been waiting: the sound of andy devine on his horse - bushy, bagot and green - trying to hurry his goof'd rotundity from the efforts of some old pale thing. \\"touch and go\\" . . good god's grief and lee van cleef, this is not the sound that saved rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"very cool","review":"I love this cd it has all the stuff that is worth listening to for dinosaur my favorite was in a jar it sounded more grungy then the origanal so did get me and bulbs of passion.

However, given the quaility and depth of information throughout this book the cypher clue at the end of the book seemed really ambiguous and anti-climatic. Nevertheless, there may be method in this madness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mindblowing","review":"This was the first in a series of books that profoundly changed my understanding of religion and government. I found this book easy to understand and well supported by impressive bibliography. Perhaps I'm very impressionable and young, but I will never view religion, Christianity in particular in the same glowing light again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book!","review":"I highly recommend this book to everyone who has ever thought about where the BIBLE came from! This is a speculative book that give a lot of good documentation that is not widely known and definately not widely accepted. The Religious Communities of Christian, Muslim, and Jew will not like the premise OR the topic of the book because it put a whole new angle on WHAT WE KNOW IS TRUE! I've often wondered why we don't know more about the core of the Pyramid Mount!"},{"rating":"1","title":"its like i'm entering a musical hell","review":"I give this album 2 stars because of the fact that they have changed. A Guided Tour of Chicago was a 5 star album. it was depressing, it was dark, it was funny, and touching. Ghost Stories was still good, but it didn't have what made AGTOC great. the two splits they did were still great albums, but if your listen to the new stuff and the old stuff you can tell the diference. And, i don't want to seem jaded and mean, but switching from Asian Man to fat wreck just makes them dim in my mind. I know, I know, say waht you will, but they're never going to be the same to me. So lissin. if you want an album that will make you understand, love, and be ridiculusly depressed at the same time, get AGTOC. if you want more main-stream, poppy kinda stuff, get this. its your choice. but i still give it two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmm...just read the review","review":"I heard one song from this album(Navigating the Windward Passage) on the Fat website and loved it. Then I got the album.Half the songs on here are exactly the same as the aforementioned one, and the other half a different singer who sounds really whiny. The energy is only there on the one song that happened to be the one that fat uses to advertise the band(big surprise there), and the rest is either really repetitive and uncreative or is absolutely the lamest I have heard in years, next to Blink 182 or something even worse. If you want a good, harsh, melancholy album, don't be fooled into getting this album. Go get a dillinger four album instead. Actually, you might as well go hear \\"Navigating the Windward Passage,\\" cause it rocks the hell out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Deal","review":"I couldn't find these filters anywhere else for a better price.

Came out of washing machine with TWO cuts in bottom sheet making it useless. A waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY poor quality","review":"I was hoping the complainers were employees of another sheet company, but after opening a package of these sheets I must agree with them.Yes, they wrinkle badly, but then they are cotton, so I could live with that. More important, they are extremely short and feel flimsy. My mattress is not thick, so I could get the bottom sheet around, but the top sheet is probably close to a foot shorter than a normal sheet (measured it -- top sheet is 90\\" long, and normally should be 102-108\\"). I've looked around in the product description and can find no dimensions listed that might have clued us in.Giving this product a \\"list price\\" of $60, or even the Amazon price of $30, seems ridiculous. I bought them cheap, and still feel they were overpriced because they don't get used."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!","review":"The main problem for some of the previous reviews is that people expected too much of 260TC. If you sleep in 600TC , and then buy a 260 TC set, you wouldn't feel as good, would you. For the quality, and price, I'd recommend the product 100%. I washed it, it didn't stretch or wrinkle to a twin size ( i bought queen),it didn't fade, the sateen finish is still there, so I give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"scratchy and wrinkly","review":"I got these on a cheap deal and was pretty excited to find such inexpensive sheets in a King size, here in California where the stores only sell \\"California King\\" sized sheets. However, after laundering them as directed, they came out very wrinkled, but more importantly, they are very scratchy to the skin. We tried sleeping on them last night, but I'm not thrilled. Perhaps after repeated washing and the addition of some fabric softener this may improve."},{"rating":"1","title":"These sheets are seconds!","review":"Got my sheets yesterday, threw them in the washer last night (with Regular Tide), and this morning as I hung them out on the line, I saw several places where the bolt of fabric had not been dyed correctly, leaving large white spots in this ecru set. Still wondering whether it's worth the aggravation to send them back or not for the price, but they WERE NOT advertised as seconds. I've bought several sheets over the years that WERE advertised as seconds that were in better shape than these. They are soft, however, I'll give you that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed...","review":"These sheets are a great value but in this case, you get what you pay for. If what you need is the cheapest sheets available, these are fine. But if you like smooth, soft sheets you will probably not be happy with these. They almost feel like really cheap flannel. I would not buy these again and will hardly use them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set","review":"The previous reviewer should only comment on an item if they have the exact ones. Not all sheets regardless of who makes them are the same. This set is very soft and silky. You should always wash them a couple times before use, but once you do they are perfect. And at this low price, if you dont buy them you should sleep on a bed of nails. By the way my everyday sheets are 1200tc, these are for using when the others are dirty."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can see why he's been compared to Grant Morrison","review":"On the recommendation of a couple bloggers, I recently read this book. Very fun, and an inventive mash-up of classic Who. I do wish that they'd release a new edition of this novel (and the other 90's Doctor Who stories by Miles), because it's a bit pricey on the used market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something?","review":"This was the first of the BBC novels since \\"The Eight Doctors\\" which I didn't enjoy. Sam and the Doctor don't really seem to work well together in this story. And three quarters of the way through the book, it occurred to me that nothing had actually HAPPENED yet, and probably wouldn't before the end. There's a gratuitous chase, and lots of flashbacks. There's a new alien race which has potential, but it's a little confusing just what they can do or have done. The Shift is interesting. And in the end, it turned out that my prediction was correct and nothing actually did happen in the novel. There are a few Twin Peaks references (the soldier character keeps saying that things \\"aren't what they seem\\") if you're into that. This book is not a must-have for the casual Who reader (if there is such a thing)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another crappy new Dr. Who novel!","review":"I have bought six of the new Dr. Who novels and liked only the first one.

There are some good songs here like \\"My Beloved Movie Star\\" both versions, \\"Garage Band '69\\", \\"Bing Can't Walk\\" and \\"Whatever Happened To You?\\" But some of the other songs are not as memorable such as \\"Time Inside\\", \\"Act Of Faith\\" or \\"Amnesia\\". As always, Stan's trademark quirky humor is present in abundance here, and what would a Ridgway cd be without it? \\"Holiday In Dirt\\" is a nice appetizer while we wait for new material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Picture this...","review":"You're driving along a deserted desert highway in....oh, say...New Mexico, on a warm summer evening. Along your journey, you stop in a a few bars, gas staions, diners, and small towns. Somehow, you manage to climb inside the heads of a few of the local characters, and get a synopsis of their lives. None of these folks are probably heroes, or villans. Just average folk, trying to get by. Ridgway does an amazing job of bringing local color, and character development into songs only a few minutes long. Each one is a brief escape into someones world other than your own. I guess I have been hooked on this artist since Wall of Voodoo did \\"Mexican Radio\\". Good music, nicely recorded, unusual but strangely compelling stories. Kind of like an non-SciFi version of X-Files. Buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obscure songs that were obscure for a reason","review":"For people who must have everything Stan Ridgway recorded, this is another item for their collections. I only want the good stuff. Apart from Beloved Movie Star, this is material that never goes anywhere. Reviewer Lon Jones was objective about this album -- it is a mish-mash of inconsequential and incomplete work. I won't discourage people from buying the CD, however, this should be the last Stan Ridgway album on your list to purchase. First get Partyball, Anatomy, Mosquitos, then The Big Heat, Black Diamond, and Snakebite. If you're still hungry for more, then Holiday in Dirt is just the ticket for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's Cut the Holiday short","review":"I like Stan, but this one is just a mish-mash of leftovers that didn't make it onto previous albums, usually with good reason.

It prints a conglomeration of all the tips for the year or more in one magazine. I bought that issue, then I bought the regular subscription. I like the tips and hints they put in the magazine. The color pictures are great. As with every do-it-yourself publication, the directions are easier said than done. I like it as an idea mill and a way to see what's new in the home improvement world.

The ads for sexual enhancement drugs and devices are distracting from the content. I'm not against such advertising, but I would have like to see more ads aimed at HOME IMPROVEMENT, not sexual improvement. Clearly the demographic for this magazine is aimed a men more than women, which was a serious disappointment for me. I only received two issues, but I will say the ideas were good ones (although again, aimed more at men--organizing the garage for instance). If you are looking for practical ideas for around the house (installing a solar water heating system, fixing your garage door) then this magazine is for you. If you are looking more for home improvement ideas and easy to complete weekend projects, you may want to keep looking...especially if you are a woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"How many ways can you use a piece of plastic pipe?","review":"This is the worst magazine I have ever flipped/read through. Either you get a schematic for making a pen holder out of a spare piece of PVC pipe, or they show you how to build an out building complete with wiring, plumbing and solar panels. There is the occasional repair advice, but occasional is the key word. They wont stop sending this to me and I am more annoyed that I have to pay to throw it away every month than I was that I had to read about how to use Velcro for fastening a pencil to your toolbox so you can find it tomorrow.

Instead of explaining how to lay it out and do the math they say 'joists are X by y on Z inch centers.... really?

I've received 4 issues now and I rarely find anything interesting in them. The magazine is full of ads--I know, all magazines are, but this one is particularly bad. In every issue, there will be an article about some product and then just a page or two away there will be an advertisement for that product. It makes the magazine less credible to me because it appears that they are simple writing stories about their advertisers. Some of the DIY how-to's in the magazine are very advanced and require expensive specialized tools and knowledge. The editing is somewhat careless, too, as many of the projects will be missing a step that is mentioned in the summary or in a diagram. I was hoping for tips and how-to's I could actually use in real life, but that magazine just doesn't have them.

If someone had tried to destroy the music of this famous British composer they could not have done a better job. A couple of the tracks we OK, Paul McCartney and Sting tried to sing the songs as they were meant to be sung and are the only saving grace and the reason I will keep this CD, but otherwise the artists did a poor job. Mad Dogs and Englishmen was absolutely destroyed and the witty piece Don't Put Your Daughter on the Stage was sung as a Rap song, it was horrible. The beautiful wartime song London Pride, that could bring tears to the eyes of a Londoner, was unrecognizable. Do not buy this CD, if you long to hear the songs as they were intended to be sung."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it...Forget it...Forget it...","review":"The idea is not bad. Contemporary pop performers doing classic Noel Coward songs. Unfortunately, despite some talented individuals, the songs are almost without exception ruined by interpretations that destroy Cowards' sense of melody, tempo and lyric.The word abysmal comes to mind. Coward was understated, subtle, mischievous, sentimental and melodic in his music. These characteristics are undiscovered on these performances.Paul McCartney is one of the few who tries to do Coward justice and seems to at least have the musical sensibilty to understand what his song is about. Even Elton John, who has the ability and talent to do better, sadly disappoints on Twentieth Century Blues.If you want contemporary Noel Coward, look at the cast CD of All For Love, the 1999 show featuring Twiggy and Harry Groener.

First of all, the recording (live in 1984) is ladden with audible tape hiss. The tracks end and begin sharply with little fade away and thus the lack of continuity. The CD liner notes are very minimal, and lastly, it sounded as if that Mr. Redbone gave a very uninspired performance. His vocals were very muddy, and the amount of phlem that he had that night must of been overwhelming, the constant throat clearing and lost notes in songs were annoying.

He is not a real biographer and is simply not worthy of his brilliant subject; it's unfortunate that this is all we have for a Varèse biography in English. The book also scarcely seems to have been proofread or edited at all. However, I don't feel I totally wasted my time by reading the book; it's a useful overview of the important events in Varèse's long, unique career, even if it provides precious little useful insight into his character or musical innovations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Edgard Varese.","review":"Varese was a genius -- far ahead of his time.

Then the book arrived...and with it clear labels and strategies. I was thrilled with how the writers were able to identify my child, the different drummer, and how they did so much more than just give advice. They identified behaviors I was only generally aware of. And they gave real hands on strategies that will clearly demonstrate to my child her responses in the give and take of relationships. Relationship card games and role playing, just two of the many strategies parents can use to help their child.

The part where he (Steve MArtin's character) describes this paining in such a detail and then... (oh,I won't spoil the surprise) is just hillarious!!!!! I LOVED this movie! Wonderfully crazy it is! I can't believe I've never seen it before since it was made in '91!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A laugh at our Culture","review":"As a Californian, I have to say that I found this movie quite entertaining. I think in the matter of 2 hours you can see almost every stereotype for California played out on the big screen. Funny enough, as exaggerated as they might be, these stereotypes seem so true.Steve Martin did a great job with this movie. While this movie is a comedy, it really works as a social statement. Even the most unknowingly viewer will probably stand back and think about the movie and the statements it makes. I don't want to give those away, but it makes for a hilarious comedy with real depth. This is comedy like it should be. It isn't slapstick and it isn't stupid.This is the type of comedy that moves to the top of people's favorites list, and it is worth a watch, even if as a rental."},{"rating":"2","title":"L A Story - simply the best","review":"The other reviewers capture the true essence of this film.

Steve Martin was his absolute best in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Steve Martin","review":"If you enjoy Steve Martin's dry wit then this is the perfect movie for you. Martin pokes fun at the self-absorbed lifestyle of the LA elite. Nothing is safe from cell phones, commuting, name a Los Angeles stereo-type and Steve exploits it. It's also interesting how Steve reveals a bit of his own trepidations about aging and trying to keep up in a world that has \\"gone-crazy\\" for style over substance. Buy it, Rent it, watch it then show it to a friend. Then watch it again and you'll see something you missed. Sarah Jessica Parker is also fabulous as the young carefree fling for Steve's character, the way she bounces around is just so....LA. Hug a traffic sign today. Note: this is the first time I've seen anyone go on a date for an enema. ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pollo Del Mar","review":"I became entranced by this movie the first time I saw it. My wife and I both love this film on so many levels it's hard to describe. I also have a slight personal connection to this film and Steve Martin. In 1990, during the Gulf War I was stationed at a small airbase in Bahrain when Steve performed as part of the USO tour. He was ghastly ill but still managed to go see the \\"Tree of Life\\" in the desert. You'll recall he refers to that during the movie. As an aside it really is amazing, a tree growing in the middle of a desert and has been for several hundred years; but I digress.It's a cliché, but I think I notice something new every time I watch this movie. I have no idea how long it was before I noticed that the name of the hotel they stayed in was \\"Pollo Del Mar\\" or \\"Chicken of the Sea\\"!This is the ultimate love story that even guys will like. Please watch it. You'll thank me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Liking This Movie","review":"Quite frankly, I thought this movie really stunk. The story line was very weak and the so-called romance not believable - it was based on nothing. I'm glad Steve Martin did Father of the Bride. That is his saving grace. He was good and fun to watch in that. I did not enjoy his character in this film. Not his fault entirely. He wasn't given much to work with. Sarah Jessica Parker's character was childish and moronic. The English woman's role had promise at the beginning but came to nothing and fell flat. Enya's music did not belong in this movie. Who put it there? She should have watched the movie first and then said, \\"Hell, no! I'm not putting my music in that!\\" Like I said, I'm glad he did Father of the Bride and Father of the Bride 2. He was good in those. You've got to have a good story to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a laughing matter","review":"When I'm in the mood for a light, romantic comedy, \\"L.A. Story\\" isn't it! This movie starts out pretty funny, but once Steve Martin meets Victoria Tennant everything goes downhill. This is supposed to be a story about two people falling in love, but where's the chemistry between them? Their few funny moments are when they are apart. When they're together, what a downer! Sarah Jessica Parker is the best thing about this movie, and I'm not even a fan of hers. The talking freeway sign is just weird, like out-takes from another movie entirely. I give this movie 2 stars for trying, but it could have been so much better. What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No history in \\"L.A.

It takes on L.A., Shakespeare, true love, and signposts. Plus it reveals the meaning of life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It ain't Shakespeare","review":"The movie works for me and I am not sure why. The movie in the end is very silly. However, all these parts do work for me: the references to Shakespeare, the use of Enya music, the love story, the gentle poking of fun at L. A. culture, the sly look at pretentiousness, and the strange, silly mystical moments. The movie has some clunkers in the dialog, but some of the pithy quotes work very well. The movie is well written and ties the disparate parts together rather well. At its best, this move is a funny and touching meditation of true love in L. A. At its worse, it has some crude humor. Fortunately, the meditations far outweigh the crudeness. This ain't Shakespeare, but it is better than most of the romantic comedies out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for kids","review":"My kids can't stop singing the songs on this CD.

The new material is different music from a different band - even Will's still magestic guitar playing can't carve it out of its tomb.

I loved this show growing up, and watched it again when one of the cable networks started running the series.

I loved the show. But I have returned the discs because the form of packaging is totally unacceptable.The cardboard will be ruined in years to come and the tray set out is ridiculous.DVD's and CD's are not indestructible and must be handled with care.Very difficult to do when you have to get disc one out and juggle that to get disc two out.As much as I dislike plastic when it comes to DVD's and CD's they must be in plastic cases.This DVD is also unacceptable in that Previews automatically start and the main menu cannot be accessed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable first season","review":"It's not as sophisticated as Remington Steele but it was still enjoyable after so many years to again watch these two laid back brothers earn a living as private detectives. While stories for a few of the really early episodes were limited to around the Mexican border, thankfully they moved away from this as season one progressed. Universal did though make a lot of use of its backlot for many outdoor scenes, including in episode 8 where there is a fight scene in front of the same town hall square used for other Universal filming (i.e. Back to the Future).Only 13 episodes in this season one set but there is a bonus episode from season two and the good thing is that they are presented on single sided discs. I didn't realise that there was a different theme song during season one, which is fine as it's quite appropriate. Hopefully season two is released in the not too distant future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being a kid again!","review":"I loved this show as a kid and it's still as fun to watch as I remembered it!

I'm happy because it helps him build confidence and I'm sure it helps in other ways too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Family","review":"This game is great for introducing kids to more interesting board games after they've already learned how to take turns. I can play with my 4 and 6 year old and not get bored, though towards the end of the game sometimes they will. Reducing the number of pawns and letting one start helps shorten the game. The pieces, board, and box are well made. It is good to have the kids understand counting, the strategy of which pawns to move, and also that they shouldn't get upset when they are bumped back (because they'll be able to do it to someone else too)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sorry! board game","review":"Sorry! is a good game. However, there is not much to the game. In an age of internet games, X-Box, game cube, etc., this game does not have the same impact that it once did. The game is pretty durable. Keeping up with all the pieces is important since there are small pieces included. Also, keep out of reach of small children due to choking hazards."},{"rating":"2","title":"sorry is awesome","review":"I think that sorry is real educational for litttle kids to learn how to do strategy.

Sometimes the cards will say stuff in it. Actually usually. Actually I prefer Clue but this is still cooler than Monopoly. It usually depends what mood I'm in for. This doesn't really fade away ever, it's just kinda knowing the object of the game. Which I never really saw the main \\"object\\" but maybe that's just me. This is an essential for any board game collector. It's kinda boring after awhile though, that's why most of the board games are called board games. But it's not that boring and sometimes it's essential. It feels like a ride of expirience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry","review":"Two adults and 2 children played with this game.

Players are simply trying to get all of their pieces from their starting place to the end.

Forget the recommended ages; kids can learn this game at age 3 or 4. Just simplify it by playing with only one or two pawns each. You'll enjoy it for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Board Game","review":"Sorry is a classic game that's been around for a while. It's good for modeling patience, stategy, and frustration control! I have used it a lot when working with kids. It's not too complicated for kids. It's basically a simple race around the board. The strategy and frustration come in because you have opportunities to make other players go back to start, trade places with you, and things like that. What a lot of people don't seem to realize is, there are two sets of rules. The way most people play, you pick a card up on each turn and do whatever it says. There is strategy because you have a choice of which piece to move. In the more advanced play you deal out 5 cards to each player so you have a choice of which card to play as well as which piece to move! After playing a card you then pick the top card from the stack to replace it so you always have 5 cards. It's one of my favorites, even though I must have played it a hundred times, and all the kids have loved it too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCITEMENT ON A BOARD","review":"Our grandchildren love this game.

After school my son and the older children run and get a game to play instead of turning on the tv and 7 times out of 10 they pick Sorry. This game can be played by children as young as 3 or 4 yrs and children that are as young as 101.This is a game everyone should own!!! I think I am going to go now, get my son and have a game of Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game - For Sportive Kids","review":"This game has great potential to teach kids strategy, tactics and arithmetic combinations, if they can bear the disappointment of being sent back to the start by their opponent. That is why it scores low on fun.

After 2 or 3 weeks we had a few instances where it wouldn't turn on right away - we changed outlets and it still didn't come on. Then it came back to life, so we didn't think much of it. After 4 weeks, it would come on for a minute, and then power would shut off. It would not come back on for at least a few hours. Then it would cut right back off again. There is only a 30 day return policy from manufacturer (convenient, right!?). So, now they tell me I can send it to them in CA for repair. I have to pay shipping to CA, but they will repair and ship back for free. OK - by the time I package this thing up and ship it to CA it will come close to or exceed the purchase price.

It is almost a must to do so else there will be lot of water spilling outside because as I mentioned there is a LOT of water stored in the base!!!The other issue is the power indicator lights up with a delay!

The story of the company's founders and namesakes were well presented.Then, the video began to chronicle the development of M-B racing and high performance cars exclusively. There was little about passenger cars after the early years and I felt the video should have spent far more time on M-B's main area of auto design and manufacture. As significant as the \\"arrows\\" and \\"gull wings\\" were, other M-B autos were just as important to automotive history.I was disappointed by this DVD for the above reason.

These rings are heavy duty tools, not dainty, chintzy toys. With that in mind, you MUST grease your threads prior to installation.

However I put it on and, to my delight I was quickly drawn in to this wonderful tale. It was not all bleakness! The story is so dense and rich, like a good, old-fashioned meat and potatos meal---not the depressing ambiguous things that pass for art films these days. The acting is good, with Gerry Sundquist as the adult Pip, probably the weakest of the cast. Some of the supporting actors were magnificent.Some reviewers complained about the length.

The main character, Heidi Whitehill, tells the story with an energetic voice and an keen eye for what's happening around her. We come to know the routine of the boxing gym, the sacrifice and preparation for the fight, the aftermath of the win or loss (Heidi's record is about evenly split), and the hustle for the next purse (which is never large enough). None of this holds the athlete back; she sticks to her mission in spite of familial disapproval (her roots are in New England) and less-than-comfortable living conditions. At one point, her car is stolen, and instead of replacing it, she switches to a bicycle. Still, the book ends on a note of hope, and we realize we were right to cheer for the boxer all along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great invention","review":"I love this wall mount pet food holder.

I wish the game were a little more durable and easy for his fingers (the doors close too easily when touched, so he often closes 3 doors when he means to close one). The concepts that the game teaches are age-appropriate (characteristics, colours, simple reasoning by elimination), but the plastic construction might not stand up to his attentions.Here's how to play with a four year old: Instead of taking turns, decide who has the secret character identity, and the other player asks all the questions until the secret identity is guessed. If the parent or older player has the secret identity they can suggest hints. Start with the blatant hints that also explain how to use the board, like \\"My character is wearing a hat, so you can close all the doors where there is no hat!\\" If the child has the secret identity, then the parent or older player can simply ask questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls apart","review":"This game needs assembled nearly every time we play. All the cards fall out, the windows fall off...annoying.After playing 5 times or so...the questions are repeated, and the fun is gone. The images are somewhat naive and unbalanced. So you run out of interesting questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful game, poor quality","review":"This is a wonderful game that I recently introduced to my 5yo, and have fond memories of playing when I was younger. My only complaint is the poor quality of the boards. We have trouble with the plastic picture holders not opening or closing completely, and coming off when we *very gently* flip open pieces at the start of a new game. It's quite frustrating having to deal with the poor quality of this great game, especially when this problem *never* occurred with the older version(s). A wonderful teaching tool and fun game, but be prepared to deal with the poor quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool for deductive reasoning!","review":"My 5-yr old can do this amazingly well. Really requires use of your noggin. My 4-yr old can do it with a little oversight, lots of fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Game Poor Quality","review":"My 6yr old played an older version at a relative's house and was excited to use his allowance to buy one of his own. Sadly, it was a waste. The cards constantly fell out of place, making game play difficult. Also the plastic pieces broke because my children (who are in NO way destructive)continuously replaced the cards. After about 2 rounds they asked to put it in the donation box for the Salvation Army. If any good came of it, it was the discussion I had with them about only giving away nice things, not junk, to charity. The game went in the trash... where it belongs! And they wrote a long letter to the manufacturer. We were mailed coupons to buy more crappy games. Thanks guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New twist on an old game","review":"We have had this game for several years and now that my kids are older and should have outgrown the game (Jr. High), they have made it really interesting. Instead of offering guesses like \\"is your person wearing glasses?\\", they ask questions like \\"does your person teach Economics at Harvard?\\", or \\"did your person protest the Vietnam War?\\". Amazingly, we are still usually able to come up with the person's identity, only not as easily as asking the obvious about hair color, bushy eyebrows, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to this timeless game?...","review":"First of all let me say I love and have always loved playing Milton Bradley games (as an adult, and as a child), so with that said, here's the purpose of this review. As a mother of two children I'm always trying to find new and old ways to entertain them, and now that my oldest is at the age to play board games I went and bought the classic \\"Guess Who\\". I can't express how disgusted I am at how cheap and so very time consuming this new and cheaper to manufacture game is. It takes more time to \\"fix\\" the game pieces every time the box is opened then it does to play the actual game, and as a consumer I would rather pay a few dollars more to have a better quality product (the kind of product I grew up knowing). Not everything has to change over time, and it's sad that this fine company as done just that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"kids love this game, and it's fun for adults too","review":"My three boys all have played this game and loved it. It is one of the very few kids games that I don't dread as an adult. You can play a game within 10-20 minutes so it doesn't take a big time commitment. My kids never get bored playing.I only gave 4 stars because the game parts are not that sturdy, and the individual faces fall out sometimes. Overall, a great game."},{"rating":"2","title":"WE LOVE IT.............A true Classic","review":"A wonderful game that has my 4 year old wanting to play over and over again. My husband and I don't mind........We enjoy re-living our childhood!!!I do agree that it is not as durable as I remember it being (MANY years ago in England). But it is still strong enough to withstand LOTS of fun and play.I do think the age should be lowered to 4+. It really is not that complicated for this age group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, but poorly executed - CHEAPLY MADE","review":"This is a really great simple game idea ideal for the little ones - my 4 and 6 year old are great fans.Only problem is that the game is so terribly made that less than 3 weeks after getting it I'm ready to throw it at the wall from frustration. It took about half an hour to pop all the little plastic and cardboard bits into place, which wouldn't be a problem except that the darn things fall off and the cardboard bits fall out constantly - breathing on this thing wrong is enough to mess it up and require a parent to have to come in and fix it. Had it not been for how cheaply made this game is, I would be heartily recommending it. Shame really, because as a concept it's a really simple and very good idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every family should have this.","review":"My oldest daughter received this when she was about 5. That's a great age to get this.We love this game. It's a fun game, even for the adults who have to play along. We can play this for hours on end if the kids feel like it and not tear our hair out.Great game to help build a child's thinking skills.A wonderful gift for to have handy for ages 5-8, or so. They'll play it for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick, easy 2 player game","review":"I just bought this for my 6 year old nephew and it is made much better now than 6-8 yr ago. I still own the game and my kids and their friends like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as pictured","review":"Note the pictures below which show the doors lifting UP and the individual card for the mystery person --- then note the box cover shows doors opening sideways & a slide card above --- so what am I purchasing --- I chose the box that showed the old-fashioned product (doors opening up) and individual cards --- how do I know what is in the box????"},{"rating":"2","title":"The game is cute","review":"This game is fairly easy to set up but it seems to lose the wow within a day or two. The characters once in awhile slip out of their slots when we are trying to set up the game to play, when we try to put the characters from resting position to sitting up. It has taught my son however to reverse his thinking about what to look for in each character. It does cause children to think more. Its a simple enough game to be able to play it with a wide range of ages. It seems to travel well aswell since there is not allot of small detached pieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Different Version!","review":"My [...]daughter loves Guess Who and we play it every evening. I actually ordered another set because the picture shown has different people than the one we have. Thought it would be fun to have some new faces. Unfortunately, we did not receive the one pictured, just another of the one we have. Oh well, I will just give it as a gift to someone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whole family has fun!","review":"Who would have thought this would be the hit of Christmas. Lots of fun for all ages 6, 8, 10, 43. Tons of competition and lots of ways to make it more challenging. After two days of playing with it non-stop, my husband says, \\"I haven't lost yet!\\" I looked at the 6, 8, and 10 year old and said, \\"Super, honey!\\" Great game, lots of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"A logic game for the young 'uns","review":"Very entertaining. A test of luck and skill; your questions must be most efficient. Good for teaching basic deductive reasoning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some original set up required !","review":"Parents, note that there is quite a few minutes of set up required to punch out all of the cards and thread them through the plastic holders and snap them into place. However, this is only first time set up. Also, this game is really only designed for two players, which I didn't realize. Other than that, my son loves to play it. It is good for 6 yrs & up as they need to be able to use deductive reasoning to solve the mystery. Good for young kids that like mystery chapter books like my son."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk -- Extremely Poor Quality","review":"My kids (ages 9 and 7) were excited to play this game after receiving it for Christmas. After at least a half hour of initial set up (punching out and assembling pieces), they played the game twice. The yellow flip pieces would fall out of their slots and the flimsy cardboard face inserts fell all over the place. I threw all the pieces back in the box and placed it on a high shelf where it will stay until I throw it out. What a waste. This game would be enjoyable and fun if it didn't fall apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for mixed-age groups","review":"My kids, ages six and ten, love to play this game together. Finding something they both enjoy happens about as frequently as a total eclipse of the sun, so that ought to tell you something right there. The plastic frames are a little flimsy for my taste, but you can play this game even if you are missing a card or two, so I anticipate getting lots of use out of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suprisingly educational, fun for all","review":"My 8 Year old was given this game for Christmas. I like games, but sometimes it's hard to play round after round of a child's game without going nuts. This was a lot of fun for the whole family. It encouraged the kids to be observant and creative in their descriptions of the mystery person. I thought this would just be a \\"keep the kids quiet\\" game, but it ended up being educational and a good family game."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT game for kids and adults!","review":"No reading necessary - which makes it a great game to play with young children. At the same time, it is fun to play for the adult or older children playing it (how many weary times can you play Chutes and Ladders or Candy Land!?!)with a younger child. Helps teach observation skills as well as strategy and deductive reasoning by using process of elimination questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Assemble at your own risk","review":"After paying $16 for this game, I was very surprised that Hasbro requires their customers to complete the game construction that Hasbro chose to skip at the factory. What's the $16 dollars for? The box contains maybe $1 in flimsy materials. While my eager children waited, it took over an hour for me to assemble the game. Even then, the face cards continued to slide out of the ill-fitted slots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Fun and Instructional Too!","review":"My 6 year old daughter loves this game! It can keep her occupied for a long time and I believe it has improved her ability to take note of details (color, shape, expression). Very good all around!"},{"rating":"1","title":"racist","review":"This game only has white people's faces. There are no people of other races. Look for the spanish version at least there are black people, but only a few. The older versions of this game had also but I don't know why they changed the new versions. So look for the spanish version over the web."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game to teach with!","review":"I remember playing this game with my best friend when we were little, so of course I had to buy it for my son!! This game is great for little ones because it teaches them how to pay attention, look for detail, and search for clues. It's not even a hard game once you play it a time or two, and that's always great so that you don't always have to sit and read the directions every time you play the game. The only drawback to this game, is that you have to keep up with all of the pieces - we lost one of the people pieces, and so we had to sort through the other color to find that same person to take them out of the game. It would be nice to have a back up set of people pieces or something, but we know how to improvise, thank goodness :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun game flimsy materials","review":"I was so disappointed. I had this game for my children when they were young and they loved it. I purchased it for my grandson and when we opened it it was cardboard and plastic that you had to take apart and put together and it kept falling apart. Playing the game was no fun because the cardboard pieces of faces kept falling out of the holders and the holders didn't flip down or up all the way. It because such a trial for a 6 year old we just put it away. It was a waste of money. And of course there is no way to know before you get it and look at it."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY CHEAPLY MADE","review":"I got this game for my daughter for Christmas and put it together tonight. It is VERY cheaply made. The pieces that you \\"flip up and down\\" will not stay on, they're constantly falling off and having to fix them every ten seconds takes the fun out of the game. The concept itself is fun and great for kids, but it's sad how greedy manufacturers are these days, it could be made much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great classic game - new version is poorly constructed","review":"This is a great game. I remember playing it as a kid with another child who spoke French. Lots of fun, easy to play, not determined by chance, teaches children how to group into categories and narrow down choices - wonderful.Unfortunately, the new edition is very shoddily designed. The cards are flimsy, and they fall right out of their holders when they're flipped (or sometimes when they're *not* flipped).Ultimately, the game is almost totally unplayable!This is very disappointing to all of us. I'm going to go see if I can find a vintage copy of this game, and I'll be contacting the manufacturer about this as well... though if I have an experience similar to that of a previous poster, I'll probably get brushed off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game for two!","review":"My kids, all ages, loved playing this every time they visited Grandma, so, after years, we bought one for ourselves. One of the nice things is that younger kids can play with older kids, which is not always the case with games. The older kids develop strategies, of course, but the younger ones can keep up. We really enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made","review":"This would be a great game if it weren't made out of flimsy plastic. It is a pain in the neck to assemble and it constantly falls apart. The little flip-up doors don't stay hinged properly and if you don't get the little pictures inserted just-so, they fall out also. We've played it 3 times and I'm ready to throw it away. Shame on Milton Bradley for selling such a poor quality game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"This newer version is cheaply made. The plastic frames easily bend, don't lay down or flip up right. The face cards slip out. The older version is much more durable. The idea of the game itself is wonderful. But this version is a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun toy, TERRIBLE CONSTRUCTION","review":"I remember this game from my own childhood and was pleased to have it sent as a present for my own daughter for Christmas UNTIL we opened it and tried to put it together - VERY FIDDLY, took over an hour with poorly made cardboard and plastic pieces. By the time it was constructed I never wanted to look at the darn thing again. Give it 1 star because of this terrible construction. You'd think they could do better"},{"rating":"2","title":"A PAIN IN THE WAZOO TO SET UP!!!!!!","review":"I got this for my son for Christmas and after all of the running around and craziness was over we decided to get this out and try it. I about FREAKED when I opened the game and found out that I had to assemble 48 little game pieces where the pictures had to be inserted in SUCH a way that it was maddening!!!! Do not kid yourself...it will take you a good hour to assemble the little game pieces. So my son was disappointed to say the least, that it took FOREVER to get the game together and get started. You then have to snap in all of the little assembled by you pieces in as well, and some do not stay secure and you are constantly re-snapping them in....That said, once you get it together, it is a cute little quick game, but it only has 5 girls to choose from, so if you choose to be a girl, the game is over rather quickly. It is fun, but maybe the newer version is better thought out."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheaply made","review":"This idea of this toy is GREAT! It is very educational. Teaches kids to think and form questions, stratigies. I had this toy growing up and we loved it and it was durable. My daughter got it for her 7th birthday last week and I already took it back because it is made so cheaply now. It does not stay together. A few of the piece's moldings were not straight so you can't get the pieces to stay on the main board. WHen you go to flip up all the characters usually at least 3 fall off the main board. Very frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"For me, the hallmark of a great band is the ability to recreate their signature recording sound live on stage. And if this had been the only measure of success in the music world, Simply Red would certainly be right near the top of the all-time greats list. I thoroughly enjoyed the performance on this DVD from that perspective - they sound as great (or better) as on any of their studio albums. Mick Hucknall is an amazing singer and his voice is perfect in this concert, and the band is simply outstanding.Video and audio quality is very good. Mick keeps the chatter between songs to a minimum but manages to engage and thrill a very receptive audience nonetheless. I am usually not a fan of the \\"audience sing-along\\" style of concerts (I want to hear the artist!), but thankfully it doesn't happen that often here and does not really detract from the quality of an outstanding performance. Well worth the time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for beginners","review":"I bought this book for my 11 year old nephew who worked through it in a day. He loved it and found it be very simple to read and follow. He was playing most of the songs within a few days. He is now ready for another book. The diagrams and notes in the book make it easy to follow and it really boosted his confidence that he can play the piano! I have never gone wrong with John Thompson products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prong is Kanekovision time two","review":"Excellent DVD and I'm thrilled to be the first one to review.

She thinks the Night Eater has a carrot for a nose and gets very excited pointing at the \\"big moon face!\\" and the \\"little moon face!\\"I, too, love this book. Ana Juan's illustrations delight the eye with delicious colors and wonderful, quirky details. Her writing is equally strong. The story is short, yet Juan's prose is elegant and engaging.Most importantly, the story is original and entertaining. One can imagine that some ancient people might have believed in the Night Eater. It's a charming story beautifully presented."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I don't get it. It's one of those magazines that you should be able to pick up for free in front of your local pizza place or bar. There are a lot of ads for Orange County plastic surgeons and dating services; if you're looking for either of those, this ones for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a rewrite with more Dunaway","review":"This is yet another vehicle starring Faye Dunaway that did not fully utilize her incredible talent. Who needs Lara Flynn Boyle when you have Faye Dunaway? Miss Dunaway was not in enough scenes, though she's looking good. They should have ditched the Flynn Boyle character and had Timothy Hutton fall in love with Dunaway. People start to die mysteriously, and he's not sure if it's Dunaway. She could do a couple of scenes where she acts nuts and you're not sure if she's guilty. In the end, it turns out to be jealous women in her office trying to frame her to get Timothy Hutton to ask them out. Dunaway and Hutton run off together in the end. That is is a much better story and would have showcased Dunaway much better. Otherwise, the action was good."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE TEMP FROM HELL","review":"Having worked in an environment where temporary employees were utilized, THE TEMP offers a sardonic look at one such temp whose ambitious goals elevate her to a rather auspicious position. I have always enjoyed Lara Flynn Boyle's work; her performance on TWIN PEAKS was always worth watching. She chews up this role deliciously, without going over the top; Faye Dunaway looks great (even ten years ago), and she reigns in her potentially campy performance with a vengeance; Timothy Hutton does well in a role he is used to playing--the misunderstood underdog. The movie builds to a pretty good climax, and then unfortunately deflates it with a rather weak ending.But, getting there is fun and this movie works in its oft-abused genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Temp (1993)","review":"Very suspenseful film stars the (...) Lara Flynn Boyle as a temp who is climbing the corporate ladder faster than her boss (Timothy Hutton) and makes his life a living hell the entire wayby sabotaging his work and murdering various executives. Boyle turns in a delightfully wicked performance that rises beyond (...), and Hutton's performance as Peter Derns is exceptionally true to what any man would do. Direction and script make this taut thriller look very slick and sound authentic and real. All of the characters seem like they could be living next door. My only concern is the ending in which it rushes and tries to be dramatic with the last two words spoken by Hutton, but it only mildly succeeds. Great flick however and highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"yes. Yes. YES! Buy it.","review":"The author spells out, in common terminology, the basics of programming moving lights for theatre, concerts, television, festivals, and industrials.I teach at a University and our lighting intro class should be reading the first three chapters even without any need for the automated fixture information.

It feels stretched to me - like a padded long article. The info about cue types was good, but I'm sure it's covered in user manuals, and the insistence on avoiding mention of specific products diluted the rest of it too much for my liking. I think picking a console and fixtures, even if it's one per chapter, would allow a little more detail. As it is, readable, but unsatisfying.Certainly room for another edition, hopefully with more detail. I should note that I'm not a beginner, I've been programming other aspects of shows for decades. Possibly a beginner would get more out of it. I gave it more stars because it covers the exact topic I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much info on Programming","review":"I am an intermediate programmer looking to expand his knowledge. I was looking for a lot more out of this book. It doesn't tell you too much about programming Automated Lights. Let me sum up what the book did tell me: Save your show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated classic","review":"This is a terrific movie; it's too bad most people have never even heard of it. Besides being an entertaining adventure/romance, it's a quite surprisingly accurate and evocative representation of the chaos of Revolutionary and Civil War Russia. I know a lot about this period in history and, in addition to the story itself, I think an exemplary job was done with the sets, exteriors, and other visuals; sometimes it's hard to remember that this was all filmed in England, not Russia.The only drawback is the current condition of the image. Very murky and muddy. I've never seen a good copy of the film, so it's possible that this is the best we can hope for. It would be so great to be able to see a properly restored copy, though...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the price just for Peter Kingsbery","review":"I bought this album some years ago and have enjoyed listening to Peter Kingsbery singing Only the very best.

I like to be up on the latest real world trends. This magazine covers very few of those things. Readers will find instead, trashy, poorly written articles about issues that are frankly, morally corrupt and offensive. Contained within this ecological waste of trees, one would find a barrage of articles about promiscuous sex involving orifaces that I prefer not to ponder in that context. I have received this magazine for several months and have found nothing of value in any of them. The website wouldn't allow me to cancel by my name. I finally remembered to snag the wrapping in time to enter my subscription number into the \\"cancel my subscription section\\". I'll sleep better tonight knowing I won't be traumatized by another issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite...","review":"This magazine has really grown on me of late, for a lot of reasons. Glamour and Cosmo don't appeal to me as much, partly due the the drop in their quality, and partly just due to the fact that I'm not in their target age group. Marie Claire has far more articles that are in line with my interests. They attempt to cover real issues that have an impact on women's lives. They are able to write stories about the status of women in the world (i.e. their Taliban articles) in a way that makes the information accessible without treating the reader like you are stupid and totally oversimplifying. I also like that not all the models look anorexic, and they don't inundate the reader with diet advice, or articles on sex and how to find/get/keep a man. This is still a light beach read compared to a hard new magazine, but it's far better than most other magazines in this genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it once was","review":"Marie Claire claims to be written for \\"Women of the World,\\" but the changes that the magazine has undergone since the new editor entered have taken this publication far from their self-proclaimed audience.The stories have become increasing vapid and sensationalized. Worse, the quality of the writing has greatly decreased overall. How sad that the editors think that a mainstream Women's magazine has to be written on the level of Seventeen Magazine!Hopefully the magazine will get through their current growing pains and become an informative and fun fashion magazine again."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite","review":"This is one of my favorite magazine.

In the past I had to buy several magazines to cover what I wanted to know, but MC covers fashion (including both high priced items as well as items that a poor college kid can afford-a big plus since this is a large market for beauty mags) and it also covers important issues from around the world. Although I wish it had a little more on fitness and health it still keeps me coming back to the newsstand every month."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not what it used to be!","review":"When I was a bit younger, I subscribed to Marie Claire and it was the one magazine that didn't make me want to scream because of too much sex advice (like Cosmo), too much militant feminism (Ms.), or with everything being beauty and fashion related (almost all women's magazines!).There was something wonderful about this magazine for a young woman to read. So when I picked it up again a few months ago, I was saddened to see what direction they had chosen to go with it. Might be your style, but it isn't mine. It's just a bit too trashy anymore, the look is very sharp. I feel like perhaps they are trying to be a women's issues mag but mixing it in with how to please your man and what bikini to wear this season and it just doesn't work. I miss the old Marie Claire of ten years ago!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of shipping delay...","review":"I placed my order on March 19 (six weeks ago), and still have not received a magazine in the mail.

What, no 40 year old's live in America? Or maybe they just don't love anything about themselves?Issue always turns up at least 10 days after its available in store. ALWAYS! Why subscribe??!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who's Marie Claire?","review":"I ask 'who Marie Claire is' because I haven't received a regular monthly delivery. I love the magazoine itself but I don't like not getting it when it's expected. Years ago when I was getting all the 'chic magazines' they would be in my mailbox at what seemed ahead of time. I'm seeing the magazine on the rack in the store before it hits my door. I was used to getting my magazines before they showed up in stores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never received issues","review":"I ordered back in September. I understand that they might not have shipped right away. I waited until November, then called. They said I was not scheduled to receive any issues until January because that was the next cycle. I said fine. I was a little irritated, but fine. I called again the end of January, after I hadn't received an issue, and was informed that it was in the mail. It is now March and I have have received nothing. I should have listened to the other reviews stating the same problem, but I let the cheap price sway me. That, and i thought, how can they not send ANY issues? Well, its true. And not just with this magazine. I am on here today to write a review from the other magazine from this same company that I have not yet received. I would give no stars if I could. This seems simply outrageous."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Months and Still No Magazine","review":"I ordered this magazine for my daughter going on 2 months now and we still have not received the first issue.

We were going through one of those \\"rough-patches\\" and my life partner remarked: \\"Do we have what it takes?\\" I turned to him/her and said, \\"let's take that quiz.\\" We did. Several times. The 4th time around, we marked our multiple choices answers and nervously awaited. We made some juice (that Black and Decker...now there's a mate you can Depend on!) and talked it over.

Because of that, reading the first issue wasn't as painful as it could have been. It was still definitely painful, though.Wow, this magazine is full of ads. Every other page - and in some places every page for five pages! There isn't much substance to the magazine and it literally took me all of ten minutes to finish \\"reading\\" the whole thing. No useful articles, nothing but ads and pictures of frightening looking and rather gaunt women. Yes, fashion magazines are full of those...but some of these women looked just sick! It pained me to look at them. Toward the front of the magazine, there is one shot of three models in the middle of a page and they literally look like aliens. So thin and starving their heads look two times too big. Poor girls. That being the only thing that stuck out in a decent sized magazine...that's pathetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"Marie Claire is a great magazine with much variety.

So I made an excellent choice and the price is great too, need to say more?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Canceled the subscription","review":"I enjoyed Marie Claire for more than two years, but recently canceled the subscription over the Maura Kelly blogging incident. What I had liked about Marie Claire is that I felt they tried to embrace the diversity of all women (with mixed results sometimes, but still), but after the editors refused to refute the blatant bigotry and hateful rhetoric toward overweight people, I decided that I could not longer believe the magazine supported the beauty of diversity.As for the subscription, I will say that I never had a problem with receiving my copies -- they were generally on time to the best of my knowledge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not recuive not one number so far....","review":"Very hard to say anything as nothing was delivered as of yet.Mabye it can be double checked,not sure if it will come on kindel or it will be delviered to adress given."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used to be a good magazine.","review":"Total turn for the uncool over the past 2-years or so.Marie Claire used to fearlessly take on hypocrisy within the popular fashion magazine world, fashion industry and society at large but it has turned from a mini-Bitch! magazine into a toothless dog. If you're looking for real talk feminism that actually applies to the lives of 20-somethings then move along - Marie Claire has caved to fat advocacy pressure yet still runs tabloidesque eating disorder and body image sensationalist crap, still wants to have fun and affordable fashion spreads but the idea of fun and affordable is now aimed at $30k millionaires or the genuinely rich. It's become bland, insults the intelligence and authenticity of its readers and is just another lame women's focus magazine with nothing fresh to share anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Again!!!","review":"After purchasing this magazine subscription I was advised it wouldn't get delivered till mid - end june (this was a gift for my sister).

The articles behind the titles are something an intern might have scribbled on her ciggie break from a more serious assignement (such as a coffee run). As for the few \\"fashion\\" layouts: July magazine received in June, with fashions for the fall (which, in my climate, does not start until Nov/December)...Still, some of the photographs may eventually prove to be worth the five bucks I paid for a year's subscription...Oh, how sad..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Simple Review","review":"This magazine used to be good...but now, it is boring...the interviews are boring...I don't even bother reading them, they seem to mainly just tell you a couple things about what the person they are interviewing is doing at the time...what they are wearing, and ask a few questions...I cancelled my subscription too...there are TONS of ads!!! Ads take up most of the magazine! The only clothes they recommend...are usually more than $100.

The author is way way toowordy and never really gets to the point - no recollections of Studio 54 as promised and is not concerned with getting the reader involved in the story - really boring and not recommended at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comprehensive but lacking","review":"I agree with what other reviewers have said about this book; there is so much emphasis on the financial scandal of the club that it overshadows the content about what was going socially and culturally. I bought this book thinking it would be entertaining and full of antics and memories of people who had frequented the club; I thought it would be more of a reflection on \\"the culture of the night\\" as the title mentions. Instead, it was dry and detail-oriented only in areas that bored me; finance, real estate, etc. Plus the author himself seemed insistent on mentioning himself in the book, which I found egotistical and desperate."},{"rating":"1","title":"More about other clubs than about Studio 54","review":"I was quite disappointed in this book, which seemed to go on forever. I was hoping it would be stories about out-of-control celebrities, and the decadance of the 80's, but the book was really about club owner fighting, how they network with each other, how they finance clubs, how they skim some profits, etc.The book wasn't really about the people who went to these clubs, but rather about the owners and people who organized the parties, which quite frankly, isn't all that interesting. Even the pictures wern't very good.Furthermore, the timeline in the book wasn't honored. It constantly went back and forth, and it was difficult to get a grasp of how things happened chronologicaly."},{"rating":"1","title":"You don't get what you pay for!","review":"I ordered this product .

Yes, her baby wore glasses and found that this was the only chair that did not bump her glasses off.Once my friends daughter finished using the chair, I took it back for my #2 baby. The cloth is easy to slip off the frame and wash.The chair takes a licking (from my toddler) and keeps on ticking!If you can afford it or intend to have multiple children, buy this bouncy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing flashing at this piano","review":"Sure. I was tempted by the \\"flash\\" that would accompany my ability to make music at the piano. So many folks share that dream. You'd think with he convenience of the dvd, and the full set, my mission would be accomplished.The author, who plays very well, indeed, simply has not broken down the skills needed. OK, we don't want years of lessons at THIS point! But the shortcut method of \\"chording\\" didn't get me near where I wanted to be.Don't despair if this didn't work for you. Just try another adult method, maybe from a publisher like Kjos or Alfred, who have books geared for beginning adults. The chording short-cut is fine if you have a really good ear, can read music well enough, and have a steady sense of rhythm. Otherwise, you'll end up frustrating yourself, wondering why it doesn't sound better, and not knowing what to do to make it sound better"},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD is NOT \\"User Friendlly\\"","review":"I just received this DVD and can't really give it a content rating yet. I did want to chime in regarding the difficulty of using this DVD.Several reviewers have mentioned that they couldn't pause, rewind or fast forward their DVD, while others have said their DVD didn't have \\"chapter\\" markers, and at least one person claimed their DVD \\"worked perfectly\\". My copy of this DVD will move through chapters, but will not pause, rewind or fast forward.So, although the recording quality of the DVD seems acceptable, the functionality of the DVD is very poor and will probably result in an overall lower rating than I might have given it if it wasn't such a struggle to maneuver through the lessons.If I manage to make it to the end of the DVD despite my current frustration, I will post another rating for content."},{"rating":"1","title":"All talk - no playing","review":"Unless you want to sit and listen to some guy lecture and tell anectodes for what seems forever.. don't buy this.

You can tell when a speaker just likes to hear himself talk, and unfortunately that is the case here... I wish someone would come up with a snappy, fun, hands on the keys right away approach to learning basic chords."},{"rating":"2","title":"User Friendly on DVD decks but not on my G5-is it the DVD?!?","review":"This is a great program and makes piano playing a no-brainer. However, I play this on the Mac G5 and it crashes in some sections. I played my other DVDs, and they didn't crash. I don't know why. I'll have to take my computer in the Mac store with this DVD to see what is really going on."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY TOO MUCH TALK","review":"I SAW THIS ON PBS AND THIS GUY TALKS ON AND ON AND ON AGAIN,VERY LITTLE INSTRUCTION. IF YOU ARE GOING TO BUY SOMETHING DON'T GET THIS ONE .p.s. some video's like this one have a type of anti piracy encoding that blocks it playing on PC's and I guess buy the G5 users comment same goes for MAC because most piraters rip dvds with their computer, but for a learning dvd this is unacceptable this guy spent more time on the video graphics than on educating.His approach is like a salesman's he is trying to make you believe how great he is rather than just being great."},{"rating":"2","title":"This video was an eye and ear opener","review":"I have played piano \\"by ear\\" for many many years, but have always found reading left hand notes difficult, and this has led me to be defensive about my playing. But Scott's video made me realize that what I am doing is not wrong. I play for my own enjoyment and for how I feel at the moment. He demonstrated many chord patterns that I have been playing by ear, but couldn't have explained why. The blues section is a totally new area for me, and his explanation of the 6 note blues scale is one I am finding fun to \\"noodle\\" around with. One of my sons, who has no piano experience, watched the video and he was able to play something right away. I do think it might take a novice a bit longer than Scott claims, but if someone really wants to have fun and forget about reading notes, this method should definitely get them off on the \\"right note\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slick but pithy","review":"Well, the most I can say is that it will teach you a few tricks for playing chords along with a simple melody line, like found in fake books. Scott is a slick performer and he makes his examples sound good, but his method is adaptable to only a limited style and tempo of playing. This DVD is a companion to his book of the same title. Both the book and the DVD are overpriced for what they contain, in my opinion. A much better choice would be \\"How to Play the Piano Despite Years of Lessons\\", also available from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy Houston's DVD's","review":"I wanted to learn the basics of playing an electronic keyboard I recently acquired. I frequently watch Houston's TV show on satellite and subsequently purchased all three of his DVD's, (1) Play Piano in a Flash; (2) Tips and Tricks Volume I; (3) Tips and Trick Volume II. With the exception of his repeated focus on the chords of C, F, and G, there is very little to learn from these DVD's. I wasted $90 to watch something I learned on line for free. Don't waste your time and money buying these videos, they are horrible. Much of the video content is nothing more than video clips from various shows with featured guests. In my opinion, Houston should be ashamed of himself for selling these under the guise of a learning process."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Video, Money Ill Spent","review":"I purchased the authors book, same title, and found it to be less than informative, so... after reading a review of the author's DVD, and how difficult it is to watch and play along, I decided the video set (doesn't \\"set\\" imply more than one of something?)would be better, as I could rewind and review easily. The information contained was available free on PBS, and the additional 80 minutes claimed seems to be a reselling of how his system teaches.The video is a low quality recording and certainly not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much talk","review":"This DVD would have been a good one if Scott Houston would have played more of the examples. He talks 98% of the time the other 2% he plays. He states on the DVD that He knows that everyone wants to sit down and play the piano, and they don't want to learn all the music theory and do piano excercises. His approach is to sit down at the piano and start playing songs from the very beginning. With him saying all that on the DVD, he never really plays. He spends all the time talking. I wouldn't recommend this DVD to anyone, unless they want to hear a long sermon (lots of talking). If you like hearing someone talk for a couple of hours Why not just go to church and listen to a preacher. I was thinking about ordering Tips, \\"Cheap tricks and professional secrets\\" another DVD by Scott houston, but I'm going to passs on that one, Why because I'm not going to spend another $40.00 just watching some one talk for 3hrs."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS THE KEY THAT I NEEDED!","review":"This man is known for delivering the product and he encourages me to continue in my heart's desire!

In other words, there is very little substantive content. Houston is a marketer of hope and dreams, not an instructor of the keyboards. The mantra of \\"play chords with your left hand, and melody with the right\\" will get you nowhere. Get a good book and take your time. Playing piano is not easy; it requires practice. Houston would have you believe that you can play like a pro. Don't fall for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money Waster","review":"I learned nothing from the DVD or the Book that I already knew.

I found it surprising that he sang so well. The rag man's part was some of the only humor in the movie. When he is yelling \\"rags\\" it seems he really has some to sell. I got the feeling of the Depression in the '30's. It's one of those sleeper classics that needs to be seen by a new generation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeply Profound - Now for a Criterion Version","review":"I was also disappointed by this release of Ironweed on DVD, but it is a rare film of one of the most profound novels of the last 50 years, with two of the greatest actors of the same time. I note the technical review by another author explaining that not all full screen images mean there has been image cropped, but in fact many widescreen images have the top and bottom cropped! True. But this profound film deserves the Criterion Label treatment, with additional interviews with Kennedy and others, along with relevant extras on the Albany cycle of Kennedy's novels, Great Depression era history, and the filming decisions. This film was just too intense for the Animal House crowd, but another DVD should be published. Meanwhile, the price of this is so low, that I still think you should grab it. The novel should also be ordered at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a vert good movie","review":"We did not find the movie very interesting. So I can not recommend it to anybody.

Although I found it quite depressing, it was thought-provoking and made me grateful for what I do have and not lament what I do not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful film, dreadful print","review":"What can you say about a film that pushes the limits of our two finest film actors, Nicholson and Streep, and gives us a wonderful treat as Tom Waites shows he can hold his own in such company. Of course, Waites has made a career of being a grungy, depression-era street guy. Nicholson and Streep are utterly convincing as middle-class people brought low by misfortune, in the toughest time ever to be on the bum in this country. I was wary about purchasing a film I hadn't seen in 20 years, but 10 minutes in I knew I'd been right in trusting my instincts and forking out the dough. This one's a keeper -- until, that is, the owners have the good manners to provide it in proper wide-screen format, and a decent quality print. What they've given us is despicable. Yet the integity of the project, and the actors' obviously full commitment to it, shines through. It's the best thing any of them have done. So far."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellant resource book for preparation of acls course","review":"acls quick review study guide by b. aehlert,rn"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great content","review":"I have read more than one of this author's works.

Simply stated, this movie is so awful, when my friends and I, around 5 of us, all very much into cinema, and the art of, and the making of, got about 45 minutes into it, we all looked at each other as if we were watching a first years at NYU's project. (and even those are noteworthy!)Horrendous. Appalling. Should not even made it to DVD.

Shameful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye for an Eye movie","review":"GREAT movie. Sally Field and K. Sutherland played EXCELLENT parts. Keeps your interest from minute-one. K. Sutherland played a nasty, ugly man and he played it to the hilt. Great acting. Worth getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Seller!!!","review":"The item was as listed and arrived in a speedy manner. I would highly recommend this seller in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT ACTING!","review":"In this movie,Sally Field does an EXCELLENT job portraying an anguished mom who is seeking justice for the brutal rape and murder of her teenaged daughter. And Keifer Sutherland is absolutely HATEABLE in HIS role as the depraved, scumbag murderer, (which I guess proves that he did an EXCELLENT job, as well)! This film pokes fun of the American justice system: It's obvious that Sutherland's character committed the vicious rape and murder, (along with a SUBSEQUENT rape and murder!), but is allowed to go free due to some legal mumbo-jumbo technicality! You really feel Feild's character's rage at the injustice of it all, as she decides to get her OWN revenge on the brutal killer, (who actually \\"taunts\\" her in court)! Warning: The rape scenes in this movie are VERY harsh and realistic, but all in all, an EXCELLENT, suspense-filled movie, with EXCELLENT acting. In my opinion, this is one movie that is DEFINITELY worth seeing, AND owning!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic film","review":"i absolutely love this film, it's fantastic. Kiefer Sutherland plays a brilliant bad guy and shows us that he has the talent to switch roles. He is pure evil in this film but in my opinion he's brilliant. Sally Field plays a very moving part and plays the part of the grieving mother amazingly. The rape scenes are very brutal but the film itself raises very important issues of parental grieving and the demand for justice. One of my favourite films yet. Definitely worth a watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Movie!!!!","review":"I forgot how awesome this Movie was! I love Sally Field! I can watch overand over again! Suspense, Action, Drama and A+ Acting!!!! I recommend to anyone to buy this movie. Its sooo worth the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed due to the DVD being defective.","review":"I purchased this movie because I had seen it several years ago and loved it. Got a little over half way through and found that the DVD is defective. Guess I'll have to go through all the hassle of returning and then reordering. I despise having to return something!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Performances! Good Script!","review":"Should a man be allowed to get away with rape and murder? What happens when a mother's fury is merged with her helplessness? The outcome is: Eye for an Eye. Sally Field does act well but then again she was way too good in Forrest Gump according to me. Ed Harris is nothing but a puppet in the movie - rather more like just there hanging around. So, if the characters didn't do much for me then what affected me so much in the movie?It was the script that got to me. The frustration of a mother whose daughter is brutally raped and mercilessly slaughtered was what moved me. The not giving up soon attitude and wanting justice when all hope is lost - the idea of standing through it all, and hitting back makes this movie truly amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very convincing portrayals by Sally Field and Kiefer Sutherland.","review":"If acting is all about convincing us to believe the characters being portrayed, then this film is a great example. Both Sally Field and Kiefer Sutherland give outstanding performances. From the terror of a mother on the phone with her daughter who is being attacked and then killed, to disgust at the jerk who is responsible. The pain of seeing him walk away on a technicality, and the frustration of knowing he could easily kill again. This movie falls into my category of \\"films that make me yell at the TV\\". Yes, I was eager for anybody to run this guy over. Which is a good sign that what I am watching is very believable.I give it five stars, and highly recommend it. Just be prepared to really loathe the bad guy, and want the mom to release a pack of wild dogs on him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense","review":"Acting in this movie was amazing.

My sis ter and I had this game when we were little, so I figured that my nephew would enjoy it, too.Things sure have changed! That carboard dog thing that goes in the pants made it almost impossible to get the ants to go in the pants, so I ditched that. The ants are also not very \\"flippable\\". The overall quality of the game was much better 20 years ago! :)All in all, a waste of money and I do not suggest it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun, but can be frustrating for little ones","review":"I purchased this game (and others) as a Christmas present for my daycare kids this year. We opened it today and spent a long time all playing it on the kitchen floor. I had 2 & 3 yr olds and 9 yr olds (and me!) all playing. The very youngest ones got a little frustrated but I think with some practice they'll get it. They all still had fun with it and didn't want to put it away. I think this toy is great for working on their eye/hand coordination and problem solving. They also had to use some teamwork to retrieve each other's misses.Since we got it today I can't say much about the durability. The bottom is plastic and the top is cardboard. The cardboard is thick, but I can see it deteriorating over time.. especially with a daycare!Overall I think this is one of those great simple games that every kid should get to experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"No Ants-in-the-Pants\\"1","review":"We got this game for my son for Christmas. He'll be 6 in January. He has great difficulties getting the ants in the dog's pants. To be honest, I do too. I think he's played with it about 3 - 5 times within this past year. We used to love this game when we were kids! I think the cheap cardboard conastruction of the dog and cheap plastic contruction of theants fosters these difficulties. Now it sits on top of his closaet shelf. Frustration keeps him from wanting to play. How times have changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Durable and too difficult","review":"We bought this for our daughter when she was younger. It was too frustrating. The ants are not made like they once were and it is near impossible to get them into the pants. We would cheat for her and pretend they went in after a long while of trying. Even we could not get them in. Plus the material is so cheesy that they break very easily. Save your money and buy a better game instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good for preschoolers","review":"I bought this game for a 4 1/2 year old and 3 1/2 year old triplets. They were so excited to play it. Unfortunately that excitement quickly turned into frusteration, screaming and crying. Even my very patient and persistent 4 year old couldn't get these ants to jump right. I myself have tried to figure out the 'trick' to it so I could teach them but have had little luck.They haven't wanted to play it again and when I suggest it they refuse. Today we tried it a different way, we put the pants in the middle of a hula hoop and have the kids stand around the outside and try to toss the ants in. They enjoyed this much more as it was something they were able to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"We did not enjoy this game.","review":"Really, I think these reviews sometimes are just a matterof taste or opinion. We did not enjoy this game, but other families may enjoy it.If I were to give it an age range it would probably be 4-7 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"good fun for the price","review":"I picked up this toy thinking nostalgically about playing as a kid, but it turns out both my 5 and 2.5 year old have enjoyed this game for many months. Unlike some other toys that were popular in the 70s, and remade now as a shadow of the earlier toy, this toy is pretty faithful to the original. It is a little tricky for the kids at first, but the cardboard cutout which goes in the pants does help deflect many of the ants into the pants (was not part of the original, to my recall). This game is loads of fun, and depending on how motivated your child is with such physical challenges, they could play this game for quite a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating for little kids. And moms. And grandpas...","review":"My 3-year-old daughter couldn't wait to rip this game out of the box and play. Unfortunately, flicking the ants into the pants was a lot harder than it looked. After 30 minutes we were frustrated by trying and gave up. Later that night, my dad came over and gave it a try. This is a guy who shoots skeet in his spare time - he should know a little bit about aim and trajectory - but after 15 minutes, Grandpa gave up too.We finally had a little bit of success when we threw away the cardboard dog that goes into the pants and just started chucking (not flicking) the ants at the empty pants. But, even with that, it's a still a game we rarely play.I'd suggest skipping this one and purchasing the much more fun, much less frustratingDon't Break the Iceby the same company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun toy for young children","review":"I had this game when I was a kid and I loved playing with it.The pieces are charming, even though it tend to be pretty difficult operating if the muscle coordination is not good.

He loved it then and still does now at 6. He is better at it than I am but I can manage to get the ants in. If you push too hard on the plastic ants they can get a little bent out of shape and not work as well. Just pinch them so they aren't as flattened down and they work fine. He loves that it's a game that he is better at than I am. Just to put it into perspective..we got a wii this year- but he will put down the wii to come play a game with me. He enjoys having an adult play with him and it's a great way to get laughter started. I would advise waiting until they are old enough to play- 4-5. Kids younger might not have enough dexterity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD, but there is some missing music.","review":"This CD is great, however, being a big fan of the movie I can't help but notices some of the main and end title music has been left out.

If you are a true lover of the film and the musical composition within, then you have to venture out and obtain the 2 french volumes of this masterpiece. Forget The Big Blue and go for Le Grand Bleu.

Yes, we should all demand excellence of our schools and their teachers.

It makes a good companion piece to Action Jackson but contains more human drama. Carl looks as good as always with decent acting skills toaccompany his impressive physique. Billy Dee Williams makes a particularly malevolent villian but I found Lonette McKee's character vaguely annoying at times.The story moves along at a brisk pace and the action scenes are well executed. Despite some partial nudity, Dangerous Passion does have a TV movie feel (but not suitable for kids) particularly with regard to the bad guy's final comeuppance! Overall, if you are a Carl Weathers fan and enjoy his other movies, I recommend Dangerous Passion to you.Now will some studio please release Hurricane Smith and Fortune Dane onto DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after 1 week","review":"Worked OK for a week, although the light output seemed to be cut in half.

I have been a fan of his since the beginning and have been playing guitar for 19 years, and as a guitar player I have to say that people saying this album is not as complex as his others is insane! If you listen to his other albums, his rhythmshave always been somewhat simple but when its time for a solowatch out for shrapnel!!!Zakk is without a doubt one one of the finest hard Rock guitar players of our generation(not to mention he has the most coveted job in the hard rock world.....OZZY'S GUITAR PLAYER!!!I think there are a few not so great songs but for the most part its great. if you like zakk's hard stuff like his live album, you'll love this, and if you're a guitar player you cant help butapreciate it for the raw skill on this great effort!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong release.","review":"Wylde proves with a doubt he is a metal battering ram all on his own.

Every song on this album rocks, not another 2 great songs and 11 fillers album.I wore my original copy out to the point that my car wouldn't even play it anymore and bought it again instead of burning the copy from my pc. This album is completely worth another $15.Lords of Destruction!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Drop-D sound","review":"Thick tone and power chords is what this CD is about.A cheap version of this CD is worth it just for the patriotic America the Beautiful. Bleed for me rocks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bleed For Me (I've bleed for you)","review":"This is my Favorite Black Label Society Album. Except Speedball, Every track is a keeper. If BLS is new to you, 1919 Eternal is a great place to start! This Album has a bit of everything. And ends with a tribute to Zakk's father (America the Beautiful).Favorite Tracks:-Bridge to Cross-Demise of Sanity-Mass Murder Machine-Battering Ram-Bleed For Me"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not BLS's best, but still damn good","review":"This may be my least favorite Black Label Society album, but it's still great. Nothing here that you haven't heard on the other three, except Zakk's voice is deeper and gruffer here. The solos are mostly at light speed, Zakk once again proves he's about the fastest picker around, and he once again dazzles with the effects he can produce even though he has nothing digital, no wrack mounted effects devices, not even a whammy bar, just 4 pedals. I didn't like Craig on the skins as much as Philth either, but he's still a great drummer (I've seen him prove it live @ Ozzfest 2002 to boot). That guy who gave this 1 star was a jackass. So Zakk went and did heavy metal instead of more Pride and Glory. He's still got monster chops and tons of soul. There's no reason to give this a zero just because Zakk stacked a bigger wall of marshalls and cranked up the distortion."},{"rating":"2","title":"hard rock at its best","review":"This album is great.There is a solo in every song.Zakk Wylde shows Black Label society's soft side as donewith pastalbums with songs like \\"Bridge to Coss\\" and \\"Lst Heaven\\".The 57 second solo\\"speedball\\" caught my attention.Robert Trujillo formerly of ozzy Osbourne shares his talenton the tracks \\"Demise of Sanity\\" and 'Life,birth,blood,Doom\\".I recommend this album to any hark rock fan.if you havent heard this classic,you'll missing out on a great piece of work"},{"rating":"2","title":"BLS is the premier metal group of our time","review":"This may not be Zakk's best cd but it is pretty damn good. Bleed For Me is the perfect cd opener of all time. After that, the cd just builds on itself. There is not one weak track on this cd except for America The Beautiful. It may be a good song but it does not belong on a rock cd. I am a partiot but I do not want to listen to that stuff on a rock cd. Other than that, this is possibly one of the best cd's out there. Go get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds bloody awful!","review":"This album is appalling! Zakk Wylde can't sing at all and the vocals sound terrible. Sure, he's a great guitar player, but he really should ask somebody else to sing. This album is a blatant Led Zeppelin rip off, Jimmy Page was doing the same stuff 30 years ago and doing it 10 times better. The guitar playing also reminds me a lot of early Def Leppard, and perhaps Aerosmith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be sure to have a barf bag ready","review":"This is one of the worst metal album's I've ever heard. If William Hung put out a metal album, it still wouldn't be this bad. Zakk's guitar tones are terrible. Case in point: \\"Bleed For Me\\" Not only does this song have annoying guitar riffs, it has some of the worst and most cliche lyrics ever written. If you can't get past hearing Zakk say \\"Ow\\" a million times, I don't blame you. Furthermore, how many bands in history have written songs with bleeding for someone as the theme? Next time, try some originality Zakk. If you do, you might actually have a solo career."},{"rating":"1","title":"REDNECK!","review":"This is a redneck album, fueled by Zakk Wylde's racist beliefs.

The Amazon editorial for this states the following; \\"Frank Sinatra took on the role of a psychopathic hit man in this taut, low-budget film noir. The choice shows how interested Sinatra was in serious acting during the mid - to late '50s\\" -- LOLOLOLOLOL !!!!! The only thing anybody involved in this POS was interested in was a payday. Frank musta been short the day he signed the contract cause this isn't a B movie, it's an E if there is such a thing. Surpasses so awful it's funny straight to jaw hanging disbelief. Sinatra was well established at this point as a crooner but his acting career was just beginning without any stand out performances to date and from the looks of this, he was taking anything thrown at him. God awful !!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp, entertaining low budget thriller","review":"Intense, sometimes hokey thriller of small time hoods led by a surprisingly good Frank Sinatra, paid to assassinate the president when he stops in a small town. They take a family hostage, and cat-and-mouse game ensues. Sometimes obvious, some weak supporting performances, stagy. But still more fun and tense then most modern Hollywood thrillers.A warning, I've tried several different versions of this on DVD and have yet to find a decent looking copy.

But it was HORRIBLE! Sinatra is wasted and hammy in the role of the lead badguy. All the killers do is waste time! The other actors aren't any better, and the little boy was annoying. The ending is very ob- vious and stupid. The plot sounds like it can't go wrong, but don't be fooled!

Yes, there are a few good lines. But the acting is woeful, the plot is more predictable than Father Knows Best, and the dialogue is full of little monologues that most high school plays avoid. All that said, it is watchable in a so-bad-it's interesting way, and Sinatra is sometimes average. And as a period piece, it's probably instructive. But don't be fooled; it's out of date and it's not that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly dated, badly acted","review":"Just watched this film. Could not believe how truly, truly bad it is. I say bad man, BAD. A feeble script joined with overacted performances by all but especially Frank Sinatra. Let's face it, Old Blue Eyes is a two bit phoney as tough guy. As much as he tries to channel Duke Mantee of the Petrified Forest, he can't hold a candle to Bogie in any department, and especially the psycho criminal department. I actually found myself laughing out loud at the end, so ludicrous, so over-the-top melodramatic it was. The man had one of the great voices of the 20th century. He should have stuck to singing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somebody wants to kill the prez... do you know why?","review":"The president is scheduled to make a stop in a small town called Suddenly, and Sinatra and his buddies are hired hitmen who plan to bump him off when he arrives. In order to carry out their plan, they take over the house of a widow, her son, and her father-in-law, holding the inhabitants hostage.Sinatra's speech about guns and God is a classic, and the allusions to nefarious government plots will have the conspiracy junkies wetting their pants. I wouldn't be surprised if the NRA funded this picture. Four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Presidential Assassination Movie?","review":"This was filmed in 1954, when Ike was President and Tricky Dick was next in line. What could they have been thinking? It also shows an assassin as a psychopathic personality - another probable first.The assassin thinks his job is a joke: \\"if one is killed another steps in to take his place\\". That's true, but ticket-balancing usually means a change in personalities and politics, and the forces that each politician represents. But this is unmentionable in this movie.Their diabolical plans come to naught due to the sacrifice and patriotism of common men. The good guys win again in this movie. But Oliver Stone's \\"JFK\\" shows how it works in the real world.

Unfortunately, I have not been able to get a good, clean copy from this lable (Madacy)...hence the one star.

I'm currently buying all these volumes back-to-back and in this one I noticed Ken Curtis appeared twice in this volume 2 of Season 4, just as a regular character actor.

Now is a day of milk, and meat won't do for most.Still, if one loves the Puritan way of exposition, heavily steeped in the word of God, then this, ostensibly on the book of Job (but, in true Puritan fashion, taking in all the counsel of God)...then this is for you.8,000 pages, facsimile of an early edition (f's looking life s's, etc.), I am currently using it as my answer to \\"What is your favorite book aside from the Bible?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely happy","review":"Joseph Caryl's work on Job is very helpful, not only on the book of Job, but because of the Scripture index in the first volume you can use it as a commentary on the whole Bible.

I personally have known and have counted among my close friends many of the characters in this book. Except for some obvious descriptions and badly disguised names, these people are nothing akin to those in this book. Factual errors abound in names, events, characters and locations - which wouldn't be too bad if the book were truly a work of fiction. However, putting a bunch of misrepresentations based on fact into a book doesn't qualify as either 'fact\\" or \\"fiction\\".

I am an American, married to a Jamaican who has lived in Kingston and that owns a house in the Port Antonio area and so am very familiar with topics Mr. Banks touches on in his novel. One could get a better insight into Jamaica by reading the original James Bond novels set in Jamaica by Ian Fleming (Dr. No, The Man with the Golden Gun etc.) than to try to get any insight from this regrettable effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turns an OK toy into a world of blur","review":"Makes the Opteka 500mm lens go from standable to blurry.

The game is much shorter to play the Monopoly, so it is perfect for the younger set. Keep in mind, it does not require the strategy of Monopoly, but it isn't supposed to challenge the adults. If you like, you can do away with the rule that requires you to buy everything you land on and let the players choose what to buy (like the grownup version). My daughter has already figured out which properties are the best to have in order to bankrupt your opponent. Even my 2-year old son is enjoying it. It is a great family game.

So many of the sales books I've read talk about customer interactions where the customer is open and receptive to the salesperson and his/her message, when in fact, many customers are the opposite -- cautious, skeptical, and standoffish. How do you handle that? That's exactly was why I bought this book, and frankly, this is the first author seems to be the only one who talks about the harsh realities that sellers face on a daily basis, and how to use technique and strategy to overcome and avoid them. This is definitely a book I will refer to often to reinforce the QBS Methodology. Thank you for the insight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy these shoes.","review":"1.

It's about connecting, and the film does a good job of showing how that can happen for many different people under different cultural circumstances.

He was 10 months old, took a sip from the cup, threw it on our kitchen floor, and the handle busted off! I emailed Thermos, and after many other emails, they finally sent me a replacement cup. Now my son is 20 months old. He seems to use the cup really well. However, the cup leaks like crazy! He thinks it is really funny to shake the cup upside down to watch the milk squirt out. It leaks from the top and the bottom of the lid. I have finally lost my patience this morning when I discovered my son's diaper bag full of milk that had leaked out of his cup!

The first one seemed to leak immediately. Liquid doesn't pour out but there is a small trickle if its not sitting up. I have taken it apart and reassembled it many times to no avail. I even purchased a second thinking I was being dense with putting it together. Nope. It happened again with the second one. I hadn't even taken it apart to make sure and it still leaked. Granted I had to shake it a bit but it shouldn't leak no matter what. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept, horrible execution","review":"I have always been frustrated during the summer that I can't keep milk cold and fresh throughout the day for my daughter and would really prefer she not drink a ton of juice. So when I saw this product I was really excited. For about one week. Everything the other bad reviews say is true. It is very difficult to assemble in a way that won't leak. It is equally difficult to clean. And the sour milk smell that developed after a week of use (if you're out all day, the milk will eventually go bad) has made the cup totally unusable. I use a Thermos brand coffee thermos every day and don't have any of the same issues with that product. In fact, if they could just apply the assembly that they use on that mug to this cup they would probably have a perfect product. Until them, I am still in search of an insulated sippy cup. Don't waste your money on this one; it won't last long enough to be worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stripped on first time use","review":"Maybe I got a bad one, but this little thing stripped the first time I tried to use it with a socket wrench.

He's trying to develop an environmentally-friendly method for exterminating bugs. Unfortunately the word gets out that he exterminates people for cash down, and from this misunderstanding flows some of the most snappy dialog, off-beat characters, cannibalistic insects, and wide turns of plot since Carl Hiaason. It's all you ever feared about New York, trying to raise a family and run a quiet little business there, and dodging the bullets in the streets and the crazies in the subways. As a New Yorker I found it just as funny as I found it implausible, that's to say, completely. Try it and see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An easy, fun read","review":"This is a funny book. If you happen to have liked collecting insects, you'll love this. Action abounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who knew assassin bugs could be so funny?","review":"I picked this book up for a light read by the pool. I found myself laughing so hard that reading it in public was no longer an option. My family has now read it and we each found it too funny to keep to ourselves. Though the premise of the book seemed interesting, the likelihood that it was possible seemed remote. The author was able to use what must have been extensive entomology research to make the situation seem believable. At the same time, the twists and turns of the book left me laughing out loud. I found the book entertaining. I couldn't put it down! I'm anxious for Fitzhugh's next offering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and Fantastic Read","review":"Pest Control is a well written, fun adventure of Bob Dillon. Bob is an exterminator who is looking for work, after quitting his job to follow his dream of an all natural pest control. Bob applies to an ad in the paper for an exterminator and this is when the story shifts. The ad was for a professional killer - not a bug hunter.The characters of this story draw you in and create a world that you feel apart of. Even the #1 killer has a hold on you. This story is crazy, out-there, and just enough of reality to keep you believing. A must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TOP FUN.","review":"I don't often read comedy books, they tend to try too hard to be funny at every possible moment; they just don't know when to quit and give the reader a breather. Bill Fitzhugh's, Pest Control, is an exception to this, it being highly humorous, but careful not to overdo it.Basically, the story centres around the character Bob Dillon, who dissatisfied with the use of poisons to kill bugs, such as cockroaches, etc., quits his job to go freelance and do the same job with his specially bred Assassin Bugs. He advertises his services as \`The Exterminator' and accidentally becomes of interest to those who hire hit-men, and, in turn, the real hit-men who see him as competition. A misunderstanding compounded by some coincidental killings which Bob had nothing to do with. Bob does get to try his assassin bugs out, too, but they prove to be as big, and in some cases a bigger pest, than the pests their meant to control.This is a well written, really fun book to kill a lazy weekend with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably bad. I beg of you... stay away!","review":"I have never felt compelled to write a book review for Amazon... at least not until I read 'Pest Control.' It's not possible to go in to everything that is wrong with this mess, so a laundry list will have to do: The writing is atrocious, the premise is ridiculous, the plot holes are enormous, the characters are unlikable and downright annoying, the New York references are insulting to anyone who has actually been to the city more than once, the political commentary is asinine, and the humor is so telegraphed you'll know each punch line about three pages before the author does. I am stunned at the large number of positive reviews for this book and can only assume that Bill Fitzhugh has a large extended family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh-out-loud funny!!","review":"The book caught my eye because of the cover, so I flipped it over to read what it was about. The synopsis on the back alone made me laugh so I figured \\"What the heck?\\" I'm glad I did. This book was hilarious. I'm trying to push it on to all my friends and family so I can crack jokes and have them know what I'm talking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cracked me up","review":"This is a very funny book, in my opinion the best of Fitzhugh's work that I have read so far. The Organ Grinders is also worth reading although I did not have quite as much fun with it as I did with Pest Control. Not great literature, but a lot of fun to read. The musical allusions are clever and enhance this enjoyable work."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the funniest books that I've ever read!","review":"The title is somewhat misleading, but this book is a hoot! I read this book while taking some training classes and I laughed the entire time. I would strongly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun reading","review":"I have never found anything funny about bugs until I read Pest Control. Fitzhugh's characters are wonderful and his writing style makes them come alive. I would have liked more on the people and less on bugs, but, oh well. I am looking forward to reading more by Fitzhugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading this book won't BUG you.","review":"I first decided to read this book,as I am in this field and was curious about what the author had done to the BUGMAN. The book starts out at a slither and quickly goes to a crawl and then emerges into a full blown rat race. The author sets up the jargon of the pest control and the other \\"professionals\\" industry to start the misunderstandings to hatch. Once this is established I found the book quite amusing and at times suspenseful. Watching the relationship build between the main character and his assassins made you feel there was a brotherly relationship as well as a professional admiration between the two. Overall this book was just as much fun as a major ROACH cleanout. I give this 7 \\"dead bugs\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is....humor?","review":"I read the author's comment, and he sounds like a nice guy. As a writer, my own skin is not as thick as it should be, but I still have to say this book was terrifically unfunny. Maybe I've been reading too much Woody Allen and Douglas Adams, I don't know. I was actually kind of, well, horrified, at the lack of humor in a supposedly humorous novel, but everyone's opinion is different, and maybe the fault lies with me. Not that I have any other faults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enertaining, but not his best work.","review":"Fitzhugh specializes in filling his books with absurd characters in absurd situations. This is my third Fitzhugh book and I have to rank it in second. It is funny, but at times his characterization of New Yorkers as oblivious and callous to the violence that can be inherent in that city is even a bit much for me.The overall premise is funny but the book somehow fails to hit the high level of promise that this reader anticipated. That said, this would be a heck of a good movie if you get the right actors involved.If you've never read a Fitzhugh novel, I'd recommend 'Cross Dressing' to start with instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been much better","review":"I bought and read this book on the author's recommendation (by email) and while there were some fairly funny parts, the story was tedious and the language was atrocious.

The characters are extremely underdeveloped, however, and seem to be mere characatures. They could have been a lot better. The book would definitely be better off as a film.Fitzhugh also has some serious issues with New York City. Unless there was a joke I missed, he must HATE it. He spends 15-20% of the book describing how awful, dirty, and crime-filled it is. All landlords are scummy, all the subway riders are crazy, or dirty, or \\"suits.\\" Cabbies carry guns and will use them, and so does everyone one else. Even if this were still true, it detracts from the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hillarious","review":"I never bought a book just for it's cover but this one called to me. If you liked a fish called wanda you'll love this book. I can't wait to see it on the big screen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bill Fitzhugh's got great potential","review":"Pest Control was a good way to pass a weekend that would have been otherwise been spent cutting grass and performing other mundane chores. While Bill hasn't yet reached his full potential as a storyteller, one can gather by reading this novel that more original and readable stories lie ahead. Pest control, while providing plenty of laughs, suffers from slight over-usage of literary cliches. Nevertheless, I'm glad I snatched it from the shelf at the bookstore, and look forward to the future of Bill's creativity."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Led on by the blurbs on the cover, I expected to be helpless with laughter reading this book, but I was bitterly disappointed -- I barely cracked a smile. The author strains mightily to write a \\"caper\\" thriller, a la Donald Westlake or Carl Hiaasen, and this straining is all too apparent. The cover art, for me, was the most amusing part of the book. I see that Warner Brothers has bought the movie rights -- with the right cast Pest Control might make a mildly amusing movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very funny","review":"I had to review this book because I am a big fan of Tom Robbins. What?, you ask, this isn't a Robbins book. The good folks at Amazon lump these books together(other people who bought this bought...); however, Pest Control is no Jitterbug Perfume. If you are looking for another author with his panache, style, and spirit, you will find none of these things in Pest Control. Now, the premise of P.C. is a decently amusing one, and the possibilities exist for hilarity. Upon delving into the book, I found the subject to be the only funny aspect. The characters are unbelievable, and the situations impossible. By contrast, I believe that all of Tom Robbins fantasies could indeed be reality. Let there be immortality, boundless sexual energy, and tons of kinky, inspired, enlightened people all over the universe. If you love Tom Robbins, spare yourself Pest Control."},{"rating":"2","title":"What could go wrong?","review":"Why do I love Bill Fitzhugh's books? I'm a little worried about what that says about me. Pest Control is off-kilter and hilariously disturbing, and I learned way, way more about bugs than I ever wanted to know.The central character, Bob Dillon, wants to create a non-pesticide cockroach killer. What could be more \\"green\\" and \\"environmentally friendly\\" than a natural cockroach killer? Ok, a genetically enhanced mutant cockroach killer bug, but what could go wrong with that?That's what this book is about. I first read Pest Control back when it was first released in paperback, but recently bought the Kindle version so I can read it whenever necessary.Be sure to read the sequel, The Exterminators, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragged too long for me.","review":"Although I recognize the humor in this book, I was more amused by it than finding it \\"laugh out loud\\" funny. The misconception that ensues with the CIA is just not believable to me. And the coincidences that abound were just too convenient and obviously there to move the story forward.

Case in point - Killer Pad, Tequila Body Shots, Hallow's End, etc.In this case, polynesia may be the only thing that approaches my passion for horror flicks. Hawaii is by far my absolute favorite place, and so wish the polynesian supper clubs (esp. Kahiki) are as popular now as they were in the 50s. So with this predisposition, I approached this movie not expecting much but really hoping it would have something redeeming. Nope.

Don't get me wrong, they sound great but on the page, they are slightly lacking. This album is about how it feels not how it looks. I also like the knowing but not slavish debt to the 60s (Yes, they own some Elephant Six records!).Another downside, I think the album is too short. Granted with the other deficit on the album, I appreciate the \\"get in, do what you gotta, and split\\" feel of the album.I don't want this review to sound like a slag. I think the band is in the ballpark. Next release, I will be there. There is an enthusiasm here which puts this over the top.

This version is cheaply made junk. The bean pot is made of two thin plastic halves that snap together. It's supported by \\"hands\\" that are even flimsier and make the pot tilt in one direction before you even put any beans on it. Even if you try to load up the opposite side of the pot to balance it, it stays tilted and the beans all end up sliding down to that side and off the pot. My 4-year-old daughter and I tried playing it several times until we both got frustrated with it. Now it just sits boxed up in a corner of her playroom, because whenever I ask my daughter if she wants to play it she says \\"No, it's no fun\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent","review":"This is perhaps Meg Ryan's best role as she delivers a truly emotionally scarred and self-forgotten Kay. Ryan's portrait of her character is so real it's scary.Dennis Quaid is also on one of his best performances, though at the end seems a little off, but not by far. Excellent work.Gwyneth Paltrow is memorable as she blends into the story so naturally and sharply that eventhough her character is vague in the storytelling, she shines like a true star.James Caan is scary. He acts so naturally that you wonder if the guy is really like that. He is a solid good artist.Bottom line: everything comes together (acting, story, photography, pauses) to produce a unique and rare jewel of a movie. If you like movies that make you think and reach deep into the soul, you gotta see it (and probably own it, I know I do)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"I really enjoyed this movie.

Thomas Newman's score is haunting and evocative; Dennis Quaid, James Caan, Meg Ryan and Gwyneth Paltrow offer complex, fleshed out performances. What destroys the film in my opinion is its listless pandering, its inability to focus on the truth of the issues and its ambiguous and unfulfilled ending. FLESH AND BONE also pulls a big coincidence that manages to be both improbable and unbelievable. Kloves \\"twist\\" is predictable from the moment Meg Ryan appears on the screen, and the inevitable confrontation between Quaid and Caan is also telegraphed a mile away.

James Caan's menace comes across as very real and horrifying. Some people are just no good and need to be taken seriously. This is a quiet, very sad and scary movie. Meg Ryan did a good job but it didn't change her image. Dennis Quaid as always was very good. Gwyneth Paltrow was scary but a relief everytime she had a scene.

The depth is good to stuff a shirt into for comfort, but the extra width can't be accomadated for.

So you have no idea whether you comprehend something or not.The presentation of the book is ordinary at best. You just get huge slabs of text.

I suggest using only part of the cards and gradually increasing the number of cards as the child gets older--otherwise, they may become frustrated and give up. I agree with the reviewer who suggested that the cards should be laminated. I am not sure how long they will hold up if used much. The pictures are all familiar objects that preschoolers will readily identify, and it's a great game for spending time together.Update February 17,2009: Yesterday we had this game out again. My 5 year old grandson and I enjoyed playing the game several times and I must admit we make our own rules as we play and I think everyone should, taking into consideration the child's ability as well as the grandparent's.

Even Donald Pleasance looks like an idiot, trying to keep a straight face while saying his lines in that aweful make-up. The movie has a totally generic feel.

He gets shot, blown up, then goes on vacation for the 3rd one, and in this one he's back, and gets shot a hundred billion times. It isn't realistic! How is this scary?

Overall, the movie was good, but could't find the mark as in the first two films. Maybe if Carpenter stepped up and directed this version, it might of found the same ambition as the first few. I would recommend this movie, but would tell the viewer that if they expect the same atmosphere as the previous ones, they are mistaken."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than 2, but not as good as the original.","review":"Halloween: The Return of Michael Myers, is a great comeback after the simply average \\"Halloween 2\\" Back in Haddonfield, Michael is ready to kill again. This time, he is after his nine year old niece, Jamie, who lives in his hometown of Haddonfield. Great scenes in the locked house, especially when Michael's mask \\"glows\\" when they show Rachel and the police officer talking.

Thank God Dwight H. Little and Alan B. McElroy decided to return Michael Myers. And from that day on, Myers' has been back on the big screen.Halloween 4: The Return Of Michael Myers returns Donald Pleasence as Dr. Sam Loomis. After 10 years, Myers' wakes up from his 10 year coma, and now heads back to Haddonfield to hunt down his niece Jamie (Harris). Loomis, Rachel (Cornell), Sherriff Meeker (Starr) and a lynch mob of rednecks must stop Myers before his completes his mission.Halloween 4 is the second best in the series. Maybe because it goes back to it's roots and gives it a nice feel of the first Halloween film. Now, with a new HD transfer and new features, Halloween 4 is a must have for Halloween fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly bland installment but not as cheesy as part 2","review":"A respectable comeback for Micheal has some scares and a few shocks(the ending is great and dove tails back to the origin of the evil of Micheal Myers)but other than that this is just a typical eighties slash'em up with some mild gore and music alternating between dumb and spooky. Rachel is likable as was Laurie in the original,and captures some of her wholesome,All American girl charm.Daniel Harris is cute in the lead role(Mikey's 8 year old niece).The Myers mask is not as scary as it was in parts 1-2,but other than that,we see the old boy is still at the top of his form. Somewhat scary,and better acted than you might expect.Worth at least a rental."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Night He Came Home with a Blu Ray","review":"This movie has become an annual tradition. Sure the originalHalloween [Blu-ray] is the best of the series, but Halloween IV's faster pace, action, and set pieces pull me in every time.I was pleased with the quality of the Blu Ray and enjoyed the new interview with the director.If you watch this movie as often as I do, you've already ordered your copy. If you've never seen this movie and don't care about commentary tracks, you could grab the DVD, but I'd still recommend the Blu Ray since it is the best version available.Recommended for fans of the Halloween series as well as the other serial killer slasher flicks. This one moves quickly and has greater plot depth than most."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little better than part 5","review":"This was the first halloween i saw in the theater.Watching all the films and owning all of them makes this entry a little dull now.It doesn't compare with the first 2 an h2o."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Sequal On Of The Better ones","review":"This Movie Is A Good Addition To The Halloween series The Best Of the Ones With Jamie Definlety Worth Seeing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maltin Type Review","review":"back on track with the original series, Halloween 4 returns to Haddonfield, where Michael Myers' niece Jamie lloyd (Danielle Harris) is living with her foster family and foster sister.

But I knew I could take care of that later. One way or the other, I was going to have access to this product.Now, I hear that all of that was a lie. No deleted scenes, no alternate footage, nothing.There is simply no excuse for this type of chicanery.

Not movie...","review":"Halloween 4 the movie I give 5 stars no doubt! This is completely based on the Blu Ray...While this looks better than my Divimax version, I was pretty much let down with this transfer. Extremely grainy. The sound sucks, it's just completely flat. There were a few good looking scenes, but is it worth the upgrade because Brady's shirt looks extra colorful in the drug store? lol. This is one of my favorite horror films of all time... But yeah, this Blu Ray is pretty weak.Seeing how great Shout Factory did with their transfer of Halloween 3, it's sad this release wasn't done the same way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Halloween 4~is totally awesome","review":"As I already own Halloween 1 and 2, I recently rented Halloween 4, 5 and 6. I am amazed at how the story line was kept in order and how each movie explains it's self well. However I am very confused in the last Halloween H2O. It never says that Laurie Strode had a daughter, but she does have a son, John. And why did she give her daughter away and stage her death? Well, the staging of her death I understand, but why did she give up her daughter and why was it never mentioned in the last sequel? If anyone knows, please, please let me know.

What it did do, was follow the rules perfectly. The movie was finely acted by it's stars, especially young Fisher. The music was intense as usual, the characters were colorful, and the scares were genuine. Gore galore. As a college student I can tell you this is one movie that is almost always watched at least once a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool beginning, but not that great after that.","review":"The beginning scene where the paramedics are transferring Michael Myers (who has been in a coma for 10 years) is a very exciting scene. However from there the quality is not that great. It lacks entertainment values, the Friday the 13th series and Nightmare On Elm Street series always have. Also the Michael's mask is very cheap looking, whereas Michael's mask in 1&2 is very creepy and awesome. Also, The edgy look of John Carpenter's first two (aswell as his other movies) is gone here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really \\"Halloween\\" type","review":"Well I suppose this movie was alright, but the atmosphere just wasn't Halloween! This movie portrays Halloween as some little country hick filled town, which was very dumb. The redneck hillbillies were also stupid! This movie just doesn't start out with a story at all and I found it to be a major dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Cashing In On A Classic\\"","review":"The original \\"Halloween\\"--the film directed by John Carpenter, was is an immortal classic; \\"Halloween 4,\\" on the other hand, reeks in it's use of cliches, tired old plot contrivances, an offensively young heroine, and too little imagination to make a third installment feasible. The new Sheriff of Haddonfield is a cartoon characterization of Wyatt Earp; Michael is built like Arnold Swarzenneger, and behaves more like Jason in the \\"Friday The 13th\\" Movies. The film has one redeeming merit--it is an excellent showcase for Donald Pleasance's talents, because he carries the entire movie. One wonders how, and why this loser was produced in the first place, although the answer is painfully obvious--money."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've really got to be kidding me...","review":"Suddenly, as the film opens in Halloween 4: The Return of Micheal Myers, we as the viewer are subject to some odd little facts that just suddenly happened. Jaimie Lee Curtis is nowhere to be found, she suddenly has a daughter, Loomis is at his looniest and SOMEHOW survived the explosion in 2 (impossible) and on top of THAT, he lived threw it all with only a few visible scars on his face...Need I mention that Micheal was shot in both eyes in 2, but has them back (but some strange turn of events) in 4...I know a lot can happen in \\"10 years\\", but i mean some of this stuff is just ridiculous...While i respect the attempt made here...it was a terrible attempt...and yet, they went on to make 2 more terrible follow up movies...no good..."},{"rating":"1","title":"spare me............","review":"Michael burned up an the doc blew up in Halloween 2, end of story, end of franchise. Money hungry producers and writers need to get a brain and think of something new. The mask is even horrible in this so called film. Rest in peace Mr Plesance, I hope God let you through the pearly gates after making such horrible sequels. Currently Rob Zombie is remaking the original Halloween, what a travisty. What next, Alice Cooper remaking Jaws or Ted Nugent remaking The Godfather. Leave classics alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Movie of All-Time","review":"Halloween 4, remarkably is better than the original and any of the sequels. Donald Pleasance (Dr. Sam Loomis) gives one of the best performances that I've ever seen as he tries to track down his obsession, Michael Myers, while he fighting his own problems. This installment, has by far the best plot and most superior feeling to it. Ellie Cornell (Rachel Corruthers) also gives a great performance.I could go on about the greatness of this movie, but I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"In my opinoin it is the 3rd best in the series next to the original and the second one. Has a good plot in which Michael assumes his sister to be dead and starts chasing his niece and has an ending in which his niece goes nuts and kills her mother."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was lame!","review":"Are all you people nuts? This was a very weak film. If John Carpenter is not involved in the writing or directing then don't buy a Halloween film. I and II are pretty much where the quality was. H20 was the best attempt since and that was like film # 7"},{"rating":"1","title":"Halloween 4","review":"He was shot in both eyes at the end of Halloween 2. And now he can see. Micheal Myers (who I refered to he) used to be to be scary and had ambiguity --- now he's terrifying. I like that he got scarier, but he can magically see? I find this ridiculous.Pleasence returns as the doctor to the evil monster, determined to kill him. A new character is in the Halloween series, Danielle Harris. She playes Myers' neice.But I find it boring that he's going after a little girl. I find it boring that the scream queen (Curtis) is not in the film. It just wasn't like the climax of the original Halloween. I think Michael Myers' character is a little off, and he gets worse by H8, and I just think that the horror of the original just was better and more enjoyable. Finally, I think that H 4-6 was a mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael is back!","review":"Halloween 4 brings back our old friend Michael Myers as he escapes from a local hospital and tracks down his young niece in Haddonfield.He massacres more than 20 people and takes on the local sherrif's department on his quest to complete his objective.Danielle Harris plays Jamie,a young girl who learns that Myers is her uncle.Oh,jeez!This movie is fun and exciting to watch,if you like old-fashioned slasher flicks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!","review":"This is actually my favorite out of all the Halloween movies. It has good characters and good acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's Back!!! - \\"HALLOWEEN 4 - THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS\\"","review":"GREAT!After the horrible Halloween III - Season of the Witch (1983), this series needed a jump-start. This is what it got. Carpenter is gone from the series but Moustapha Akkad (master of the Halloween franchise) manages to put forth a solid film. Picking up ten years after the Haddonfield incident, Halloween 4 follows \\"the shape\\", masked-maniacle killer Michael Myers, as he terrorizes his young niece, Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris). Jamie is the daugher of the now-deceased Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). Also in the movie is Dr. Sam Loomis, again played by the wonderful Donald Pleasance. Pleasance gives his usual top-notch performance as the doctor who forsaw the horror. If you're looking for something good to watch, give Halloween 4: The Revenge of Michael Myers a chance. It is definitely one of the better sequels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael is back and scarier then ever","review":"I rented this movie at the Video Store and after i watched this one, I was really pleased. This Halloween is a slasher dasher flick.If u a Halloween fan than get this one, just dont get Halloween 3.But Halloween is really worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Your Time","review":"I absolutely hate this film. Most of it is boring, the death scenes are SO unrealistic (to kill one man, Michael forces his thumb into the guy's forehead, and it goes in like a knife or something), and Danielle Harris cannot act! She does tremindously better in Halloween 5, but she just hadn't learned to act when they made this film. Still, it's great to see Michael again..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly Bad!","review":"Poor attempt to bring back Myers into the series. The mask was super awful, not even remotely scary. The acting was decent to awful, more awful than decent. The plot was super weak and adding the little girl was puzzling. Bad entry and wait for number 5, it's even worse than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 2nd best out of the Halloween series","review":"So returning to the 4th movie into the series with the 3rd movie having nothing to do with Michael Myers. I found it very entertaining to watch, especially the parts with Dr. Loomis in them. There is no Jamie Lee Curtis in the film, but still found it good without her, until the next film in the series which wasn't good and needed Curtis badly in it. I like the look of Michael in the film, his appearence is more buff and muscle toned, and the mask looks better too. Overall I rate the film 2nd best in the series next to the original one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sequel!","review":"I have to give this movie lots of credit. After part 3, I thought Halloween was done. Even though this movie may not be scary like the first one, it still has it's moments. It is shot really well, storyline is good too! This is my favorite Halloween next to the original. It makes me laugh that a couple people involved in writing H20, wrote it to make it look like 3, 4, 5, and 6 never even happened. It's a shame because 4 was ranked one of the best sequels by a lot of Halloween fans! Me Included!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the worst, but not great either.","review":"I'll give it two stars for effort though (and for Donald Pleasance's performance + some other good acting). It is better than 3, 5, 6, and 8, but not really worth owning. I recomend you stick with the true Halloween trilogy of numbers 1, 2, and 7."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 10-year Return","review":"This has a really good story.

We did chuckle mildly exactly once.The segments, which consisted mostly of people under the influence of alcohol, ran much too long and were way more sad and pathetic than funny. We found the video to be more of an indictment against over indulgence of alcohol than a legitimate platform for anything related to comedy.Leland Gregory, who narrates, is certainly likeable and an articulate enough of a fellow.

She is only four by the way, but has been playing it for the last year. It is one of her favorites and mine too. It is quick to play and we can easily play it three or four times in a row in less than a half hour. It is true that it does not fit properly back into the box, but that has not been an issue for us and it could be more sturdily made, as our button sticks once in a while.

So we pushed the button around 500 times and he NEVER popped up. Okay, faulty game, back to the store. The second Don't Wake Daddy we brought home worked three times in a row, so we decided \\"Hooray!\\" and proceeded to assemble the rest of the game. Well, that was the only 3 times he worked. We never got him to pop up again. It's such a great idea, the way the board game part of it is played... but the manufacturer has some serious quality control problems. I give it one star because 2 out of 2 games tried failed to work. (I also gave it 4 stars for the potential for fun.

She was so excited to play until the first time the dad popped out of bed. She got scared and started crying and didn't want to play anymore. We put it away for about 6 months thinking maybe she was still too young. When we pulled it out again, she wanted to play but she wouldn't let anyone push the button on Dad's bed until she was watching from out of the room. We ended up giving the game away.

Unclassifiable, it's so good!","review":"This sublime, dreamy, silky, soothing, mature release makes me want to use my Radiohead CD's as coasters! The Church's latest music is so phenomenal, this would have sold millions if only people were turned on to it, or aware of its magic! The songs are compositionally intense, but beautiful, and reflective of a band whose longevity has only increased their cohesiveness and creativity. This CD is truly a creative, alternative 'artrock' masterpiece! It's almost as if The Church have worked all of their lives to achieve this pinnacle in their career. AENT is a must buy for 2002, if you love great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps their best album yet","review":"Box of Birds, made me suspect that The Church had lost the plot. However, this is a fantastic album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding music that showcases depth and maturity.","review":"The Church have released what may very well be their best and most mature/creative work to date. Without repeating all the positive accolades afforded them in previous reviews, I will say this. In a sea of arguably VERY mediocre music the record industry has been foisting on us lately (with the exception of a few bands or independents), this CD is a beacon of hope and shines way high and above most garbage out there. The cohesion and musicality of this band leaves me breathless, and hopeful for the direction of rock music in general. THANK YOU Church for NOT 'selling out', and thank you 'Thirsty Ear' records, for working with this very underrated band!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Record","review":"This is the best record in years from these guys! This material is just beyond description. Why this band isn't getting the attention it deserves is beyond me. 'Chromium' would have to be my fave, but its a tough choice to make. I waited for a long time for this record and it has been worth it ten times over!!I just wish they would stop by Phoenix on their tour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing album that grows every listen","review":"In their 22 years of making music, The Church have released one of their finest albums to date. After Everything, Now This is simply a beautiful album. These 10 songs will take you to another place. It is one of those magical CD's which just grows and grows on you until you discover that the CD has grown roots and refused to leave the CD player. Things kick off with 'Numbers', the first single from the album, a rollicking and great song. Following are one gorgeous song after another, with layered guitars and mystical lyrics. If you like good music, buy the CD, put it in, turn it up, and prepare to smile."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Church Strike Gold Again","review":"From start to finish, this is classic, timeless,yet contemporary Church... dreamy, deep, and moving. When I got this cd I must have played it 5-6 times over and over: getting more out of it with every play. For us old-timers (a Church fan since '83) it's everything we love about these guys-smart, interesting, great musicianship-they can PLAY!; for newbies, a beautiful introduction for the most underrated band on the planet. If you want music that you can listen to 30 years from now-check out the CHURCH!!I also HIGHLY Recommend: Priest=Aura;Hologram of Baal; HeyDay;Sometime Anywhere; and a release of 3 early lps: sing songs/remote luxury/persia on 1 cd! Fantastic way to start your collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice title, nice album","review":"I got this simply because I liked the title, and I wasn't disappointed.

Of course, we've come to expect this from the band that constantly reinvents itself and does so in a fashion that can only be described as The Church. What fascinates me about this cd, other than the incredible songwriting, is the fact that everytime I play it, I hear something new. The Church are the band as far as I'm concerned. For the uninitiated, get with the program. As I stated in a review in the Stater: (college newspaper at Wayne State College,Wayne NE) \\"Some may do it faster, some may do it louder, but nobody does it like The Church\\". Enough said.

Ironically on the cover it says 'Our Biggest Training Issue' BUT out of 289 pages a whopping 167 of them contain full page ads for food supplements (and i didn't even count the pages with half and 1\\\\4 page adds), including one which will make you 'gain size and strength 344% faster', and another which will 'grow muscle while you sleep'. The other 102 pages consisted of an article on 'supplements to help you sleep better', 'American pin-up girls', the Rock's training program which has you training 5 days a week with 20 sets for the arms and no squats or deadlifts, Aaron Madrons new secret chest routine, oversized photos of the 'champs' and other related nonsense.

Peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"A better choice","review":"Muscle & Fitness is an extremely overpriced magazine and mostly consists of ad space. Each issue seems the same, with the cover touting chiseled abs, bigger arms, tree-trunk legs, ect. The routines are all very similar, and are geared toward amateur and professional bodybuilders.

I used to buy this magazine way back in 1987 and continued to buy issue after issue until 1989 when I noticed that it's the same material over and over again with different body builders illustrating the same routines. You may get a few variances about technique or some good tips here and there, but weight training is not as complicated as this magazine portrays it.I suppose I would recommend it if you are a beginner, but honestly - just ask a lot of questions in the gym. The best way to learn is from others. And discipline and consistency is the key! Also, change up your routine every 5-6 weeks. It all depends on your body type and what you are trying to acheive.Don't waste your money on this magazine unless you are a beginner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's like reading spam mail","review":"Literally, 95% of magazine is advertisement for dietary supplements (most of it is with Muscle Tech).Pages and pages of spam... sometimes of the same product from the same company will place these advertisements in the first couple of pages, then in the middle, and then at the end of the magazine.If you are looking for pictures of bodybuilders screaming like they are having a roid rage episode, this is prefect magazine for you.If you are looking for new weight lifting techniques to freshen up your workout routines, definitely look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has Been","review":"Five to seven years ago this would have been the premier Bodybuilding magazine to read.

Muscle and Fitness has been doing it for many years now. Eats lots of protein! Don't overtrain! Take our supplements! Look at 125 pages of Muscle-Tech ads!It's insane. Not only is this book 1/2 filled with ads for supplements that do nothing, the pages are also filled with meatheads that are on $10,000 worth of steroids per month. The fact is, the routines in this magazine are targeted towards those who use the drugs.Other than the \\"latest in nutrition and health\\" section, this magazine never changes from year to year. And of course, the latest in nutrition updates are all biased to begin with. How can anyone say milk is good for you these days after everything that's been exposed in the dairy industry?What a waste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip-Off!","review":"I'm referring to the U.K version of this magazine but my sentiments are the same as that written by most of the other reviewers. This mag has deteriorated so much over the last few years. I recent;y discouraged my son from reading this magazine as it almost resembled a soft porn mag! Also, if you were to follow the routines in this magazine, you will just end up overtrained and frustrated with your lack of results. Why? the rotuines listed here only work if you have 6 days a week and two hours a day to train. and it also requires that you live on supplements! Most of the 'champs' feautured in this magazine are just paid to say they use the supplements. in reality they are all surgically enhanced and are on large amounts of anabolic hormones. There is no way the routines in this mag will work for typical people. please look elsewhere!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to write home about.....","review":"I agree with Darshan & Scott.....this magazine is all hype and too commercialized.

Therefore, this slender tome is going to be tempting. The breed is endlessly entertaining, fascinating, and different, so reading personal stories is inevitably going to appeal to the Iggy owner/ed. Obviously self-published, this book isn't very good, in spite of the subject matter. The illustrations aren't all that great either.

The inarticulate Kahn once again makes his reader wonder if he possesses any capabilities of basic reasoning at all, basing his entire thesis on the kind of unsubstantiated leaps that are the hallmark of grade school essays.

He had many unattractive qualities but they were the shortcomings of someone who never really grew up, a lifelong adolescent. He had some finer traits that might have served him perfectly well if he'd been a private gentleman instead of the heir to the throne. I was particularly interested in the theory that the Regent suffered to a lesser extent the hereditary disease that most historians believe caused George III's madness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"I'm past halfway and feel I know enough of the book to judge. The title, subtitle and back copy are misleading. This book offers far more political history than cultural history and the focus on the Prince himself wavers so often I found myself wanting to sit Saul David or his editor down and deliver a stern talking-to. Prince of Pleasure? Prince of Politics is more like it, with one endless shuffle of the cabinet after another. As if that weren't enough, the writing is flat, though at times David gets slangy or jokey as if aware of his prosaic style. And as a historian, he;s inconsistent: we get endless gross detail about how unclean and unhygienic Princess Caroline was, yet she goes on to have many lovers--did no one else besides her husband and some courtiers early on ever comment? Or did she have a soap-related epiphany?

I am not fond of Guru books in general, but I have used Richardson's books to coach sales teams, and gotten results. Salespeople at every level fail to integrate skills like checking into their presentations, but most think they do. Too much \\"telling\\" happens during presentations, e.g. most salespeople see an interruption by a client as rudeness rather than an opportunity, and respond accordingly. Richardson's tools help coaches manage even the most seasoned sales pros to their potentials. If you are looking for motivation, this series is not the ticket; the success stories focus on the sales process, not results. However, I have seen salespeople become better personal communicators after attending Richardson's seminars, while achieving better sales results; I do not think this was just a coincidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here","review":"For anyone selling high ticket items business to business, this book will get you get killed.

My son is nearly 4 years old, so maybe if he were a bit older, I would feel differently. I did not like this script because I found it very harsh and the characters didn't seem to be very forgiving. I am not opposed to reading or watching things that deal with lying, cheating, etc. (obviously since I bought this movie) however, I just really expected it to be more about the forgiveness and changing of the heart rather than being so focused on the lying. My other issue with Hermie, and again I have several movies, is that there is no word about Jesus. HE is the reason for the Bible and for our salvation and I wish I could find early childhood videos that talked about HIM!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This video clearly shows the negative consequences of lying and demonstrates how frustrating life can be when no one will believe what you say.

But after using them, I don't know whether I'm more baffled by the fatal flaw in their design or by the prevalence of good reviews. As some have pointed out, the lead tends to break. Uh...yeah! This is because the pencil extends the lead 1.7 mm each time you push the button for more lead. Since you need to do this when the lead is down to about 0.3 mm beyond the tip, you start writing with at least 2.0 mm lead exposed. Unless you press very softly, the lead will break.

This afternoon it took FOREVER for my 5 year old to roll a one, then a two. (She wouldn't play any other way except by the rules, and those are the rules). My 3 year old couldn't concentrate long enough to get enough parts to build a cootie, although he did pretty well. We finally stopped and just built cooties. The parts don't fit well.

The pieces are difficult for her to put in by herself because they have to be inserted at exactly the right angle. She can, however, roll the die by herself and understand the rules of the game, so it's a favorite of hers and she rarely gets frustrated with it before we finish, as she does with other games geared to her age group. We have modified the rules so that we get all six legs when we roll a six, instead of having to roll the 6 six times. The whole thing takes ten minutes and is great for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Time","review":"I was excited to find this toy for my grandchildren. After I bought it and prepared all the pieces, I was really disappointed. The pieces didn't fit well (one head fell off the body, while the noses barely fit in, and the legs were difficult as well.) Kids today also find it tedious waiting to role for the piece they need. Simply put, the game of my childhood is not the game of my grandchildren's childhood. I wish they had the old game to play.

I had to toss three of the legs and one body piece because it is so cheaply made that the legs break off in the body. Some of the pieces are also difficult for small fingers (I have a 4 year old) to put into the bugs themselves. What dissapointed me most was that cost for replacement parts is equal to or more than just buying a new version of the game altogether. We liked the Cootie game until it broke, and now my opinion is that its just a cheap, worthless game because it doesn't hold up very long at all. My daughter is gentile, and doesn't have many things break on her, so for this game to break on her (and I) in the middle of a game, it was a real downer for Mommy & Daughter game night."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Should Have Stuck with the Original Version","review":"The version I remembered, probably from the 1980s, was terrific. The pieces fit well and the number of pieces was manageable. This newer version, purchased in December 2010, is just awful. There are far too many pieces and most are either too tight or too loose. The heads fall off with the slightest touch. The game board is flimsy. I was so disappointed. I had looked forward to using Cootie in physical therapy sessions with children. I'll probably throw it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very fun, poor quality","review":"I and my 4 year old son haven't found this game to be that much fun, but I've found it to be of poor quality as parts fit loosely or too tight (heads may easily fall off the body) and male attachment parts too easily break off and get left in the holes.Also, \\"MADE IN MEXICO WITH DIE MADE IN CHINA\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"looks cute, but just doesn't cut it as a game","review":"I always wanted Cootie as a kid, so I bought it for my son after loving \\"Don't Break the Ice.\\" As a game, it is unfortunately, too long and drawn out for what it is. If you play it by the game directions, it is too long for a three-year-old, and too boring for an older child (or adult). We've decided it's a toy. But unfortunately, as a toy, it is very breakable. The first time my 3-year-old son played with it, he broke many pieces. On the upside, Milton Bradley was great with replacing parts.Furthermore, it is not a good game or a toy for young children, because the pieces are difficult to fit into the holes, and my 3-year-olds have not been able to do so. My little girl who turns five next month could not put the legs in today. And the head keeps falling off the body while you're holding the cootie. I was thinking today that I should discourage people from making this purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating for different reasons...","review":"This game could be easily frustrating to 3-6 yrs old, or even to adults.1) The rule of the game: once you get some parts on the body, numbers on dice you can put more parts on get limited very quickly. (Roll a 1 and pick a body, roll a 2 and select a head, roll a 3, etc. - so second/third time when you \\"roll a 1\\" you have nothing to do) This concept could be very frustrating to the little kids. You cannot do anything until you get certain number on the dice... I changed the rule for my kids. Waiting game was too boring for mine.2) The parts are not flimsy but still cheap as other reviewers said. Meaning, some holes are too big for the parts (keeps falling off) and some are too small (legs or the bug won't fit in to the board or body!). Small kids would have hard time putting the parts in.Oh, well, I was at the toy store when I bought this game and didn't read any reviews. Next time I will check the reviews for sure.

I remember playing this game when I was a kid and was looking forward to playing it with my girls. They were so excited to play the game and to put all the pieces together. As it turned out, the plastic pieces were of extremely shoddy. None of them fit together properly. Either they were too loose so they didn't stay connected, or they were too tight and broke off when you tried to connect them. So rather than enjoy some quality time together, we all ended up frustrated. I threw the game out before even one Cootie got built."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT what I remember","review":"Not sure if I just didn't care when I used to play this but it is not what I remembered. I ordered this for my 3 1/2 year old son, and while he was just as excited as I was, the heads do not stay on the body and it took us FOREVER to roll a one just to get a body and head. And nevermind trying to keep rolling sixes to get all the legs. How do you explain to a 3 1/2 year old that you just have to pass the die back and forth until one of you rolls a six in order to just get a leg.

This was unbelievably disappointing for the kids. It was really just about unplayable. I had to get rid of it.Maybe we were just unlucky or maybe they're making this cheaply these days. I don't know.

(Hi Ho Cherry-O is one of my favorites.) The object is to roll a die to collect the cootie parts to put one together. You have to get the body first, which means you spend the first several turns waiting for a certain number. Many preschoolers will be bored before they even get started. Also, the legs go in at an awkward angle and my four-year-old is frequently frustrated when he can't do it himself and when they fall out again. I'd have given it one star, but the bugs are cute. You might have some fun playing with them if you don't actually try to play the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son likes bugs.","review":"My son who is 4 years loves this game, he likes to count all the pieces that come with the cooties and always likes to make them look different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustration","review":"I bought this game for my three kids (3 year old twins and a 6 year old) thinking it would be a great game for them to play together. It could be fun, but the fact that the pieces are constantly falling out makes it incredibly frustrating. When I play with them, I spend all of my time putting their cooties back together because the head, legs, lips, keep falling out of the body. The board fell apart after about two games also. Milton Bradley should be ashamed to be putting out a product that is of such poor quality. In my opinion it is worthless and I certainly wouldn't recommend buying it.

The pieces are so cheap. The heads wont stay on so you are constantly re-attatching them and the legs are impossible for a 3 year old to get on. The ears and eyes are now one piece so you are basically waiting mostly for the number six.

She is only 2 1/2, but we figured it would be fun to just try and put together the legs, eyes etc. My husband and I were so disappointed in this game. You just keep rolling for legs basically. The eyes are one unit now. The head kept falling off of the bodies. The lips on mine fell off throughout the entire game. None of us could get the legs into the holes without a huge effort. We knew that our daughter might have difficulty with the game at her age, but we never anticipated the trouble we would have. I would not waste my money on this game.

Perhaps they didnt learn the courage of those men who braved the savage wilderness of Europe to convert barbarian tribes to Christ and introduce them to civilization. Perhaps they didnt learn that as the Roman Empire died the Church arose carrying the morals and organization needed to continue civilization. The Church in the Dark Ages clearly illustrates the role Christianity has played in European history. Daniel-Rops presents the reader with all aspects of the Churches role, positive and negative.

You can make it into a solo game for one child, but its really more like flash cards for spelling if you do that.The product is basically a set of flash cards for spelling, with some letter cubes for the kids to spell out the words. The rules propose two games, which are basically see if the kids spells the word right, they get to keep the card if they do, first kid with 5 cards wins. Adults can pretend to play along if the child is younger and will \\"fall for it.\\" It really works as a game only if there are two kids the same age playing.I don't know, but I can't see my daughter pulling this out when a friend comes over. Therefore, to the extent this is a set of flash cards for spelling, its kind of expensive for what it is.Don't get me wrong, you can definitely make it into a learning tool. Your call."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Learning GAME opportunities","review":"I agree that the \\"game\\" is more learning vs playing per the directions. However, a little creativity and a fun, educational time can be had. The newest version that I play with my 3.5 year old son has us splitting the dice and taking turns rolling our dice with the goal of getting one of the word's letters. He has fun rolling and searching his lot even if he doesn't roll a needed letter. Plus he can easily handle 4 dice. When you roll a \\"needed\\" letter you place it in its place. The player who fills in the last letter \\"wins\\" and gets to spell out and say the word. Sometimes we make up our own songs about the winning word.

My 4 year-old loves to play games and gets frustrated when I can't play with her, but this is one she plays by herself! Very stimulating and educational for 3s and 4s, but they will probably grow out of it once they can read. My daughter didn't seem to care that she couldn't read before playing this game, but in the past 2 days since I opened the game, she has really shown an interest in learning to read.

At most, it is a manipulative teaching tool for letters and how, when assembled in a particular order, they form words. We were VERY disappointed.

All this does is have the child look for the letters that match those in the word on the card. No game, no fun. We used it once. It now collects dust on my shelf.

This one went to Goodwill after a few plays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe educational, but boring","review":"My son has played this game exactly once - it is just not a fun or interesting game. He just turned four and ran through all the cards the first time he played it. All you do is match the letters on the dice to the letters on the card.

I will however state that my family does not particularly care for any pork products to be cooked in a rotisserie.

However it does offer some good workouts and or changes you can make and shake things up in your day workout. Lots of ads for things you don't really need in my opinion. It does offer other god tid bits about food and life. Best bet it to go to a trainer or Specialist in Fitness Nutrition like myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"love the recipes","review":"I agree with all of the reviewers who commented on the auto renew. I had to call to cancel my husband's subscription b/c they kindly auto-renewed him - twice - in the same month. As a female, I enjoyed the recipes and found the sex tips humorous. I agree that the magazine tends to regurgiate the same information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only somewhat useful but very annoying","review":"I have twice subscribed to Men's Health and both times was disappointed. You really only ever need two issues of this repetitive journal of contradictory advice and mediocre fitness strategies. Real information is offered up sparingly and is often incomplete. There is however, an abundance of absurd success stories of people who are either so young that they can easily achieve their fitness goals or have so much time that they have no excuse not not be in shape.There is little that applies to anyone over thirty who have actual jobs and need to live real lives.Furthermore, they slip additional book offers and subscriptions in with your contract. You can easily spend 5 to 6 times the subscription price per year if you don't stay on top of the junk that hey send you. Honestly, one of the worst magazines in terms of all the additional crap that they send to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"enjoy the mag. would never buy again online.","review":"This was a gift and the recipient only received 2 copies and then a bill in the mail. and when i tried to update this w/amazon, i keep getting emails saying to contact Rodale, but no one at rodale can find a copy of the subscription/order. They cant even look it up by the amazon confirmation. This is more frustrating than if i would've just filled out a card and sent the payment by check directly to the magazine companies. The customer service on this is just extraordinarily poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Men's Health rip off","review":"If you want to take a look at this magazine get it off the shelf 1st. If you like it, keep buying it that way. Nothing against Amazon, I've always been happy with their service. The problem pops up when you go to renew your magazine subscription. Rodale books, the publisher, has a REAL nasty habit of setting people up for auto renewals and not really telling them. Once you end up on auto renewal good luck trying to get it canceled. What you end up with is a lot of threatening letters from collection agencies and lots of time trying to get a hold of a real person to cancel the subscription."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of being ripped off","review":"I subscribed for 1 year and got only 8 issues. When I asked them about it, they said my subscription had expired. And when I told them I had gotten only 8 issues, they never replied.

I have been a regular reader since then. The primary reason that I read this magazine is because it motivates me. The interviews and articles are written in a way that encourages reader to engage in healthy lifestyle. For instance, a typical celebrity interview would include their favorite exercise, often with pictures.The articles are informational and are written in simple English. I especially like their coverage of medical issues such as memory loss or diabetes. They provide prevention tips and support them by latest research.This is not a fitness magazine. As the title suggest, it is about Men's Health - fitness, exercise, food, clothing, style, and habits - anything related to health. Overall, it is an excellent magazine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ship has sailed","review":"I'll echo what has already been written by quite a few: Men's Health has become a shell of what it used to be. You can only go over the same routines so many times, over the same routines all the celebrities are doing, and what foods a guy should eat this month before someone decides they're the wrong foods to eat next month. It has become so repetitive that they used the same cover, with all the same articles teasers, and just changed the guy on the front (Tyler Lautner...whoever, one of the guys from the vampire movies). Anyway, MH could be salvaged if they would leave out the Obama propaganda pieces and just decided to step outside of themselves for some fresh content. I hope they do...but I'm not counting on it.Oh, and don't even think you can unsubscribe once you've paid. It got to be a joke how many times I tried, but they kept sending issue after issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its been 2 months and I have not received the first issue yet","review":"Hello my friendsIts been 2 months since I placed my order and I have not received my first issue yet.

Lots of helpful articles and information even for people who are not trying for washboard abs. It is helpful and encouraging. It was purchased through Amazon.

Still, I believe that there is a standard quality when it comes to providing you fitness tips- The articles are entertaining, still not as in depth as I would like, but it provides me with enough knowledge- I love the exercise charts they have for each issue. I use them for reference when exercising- There's a section about the top cities for a certain topic. One example would be \\"Most cleanest air in U.S. cities.\\" It's good to know where cities rank compared to other cities.- However, there is an absurd amount of advertisements in the magazine. I don't know the exact amount, but I would estimate it's up to 40%.Overall, it's a good, inexpensive magazine subscription that will provide you with entertainment, knowledge, and fitness tips. Don't expect it to be perfect though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great monthly advice for men","review":"Only complaint is that some of the material is repetitious after subscribing for a couple years.I have subscribed for a year, skipped a year, then subscribed again and I find that I am happy with the magazine again for the most part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agreed, one year is all you need.","review":"I subscribed to Men's Health for over two years and recently I've been going through the back issues to cut out some stuff for an art project and I can attest that 'there are only so many ab exercises one can do'. Every month there is a fold out workout plan /poster that focuses on a certain area of the body (abs, shoulders, legs, etc) and looking back it was pretty much the same stuff every month. I guess it would be good for someone that needs a new routine every now and then or a reminder of how to properly stay in form. The stuff in the beginning is usually diet and quick news bits about health, some sex-related Q&A, and well ads throughout. Go to your local market and pick up a copy. Go through it and just imagine every month being basically the same with minor tweaks in the info. There are good articles from time to time however. I would simply read these online if it happens to catch my interest from looking at the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality has gone down hill","review":"For several years I was a subscriber, but within the pas couple years it seems the quality has gone down. This magazine is no longer something that I enjoy reading every article of as I did in the past. I still get one or two copies a year, but its content has changed for the worse. Now it seems that its more focused on trends and trying to be hip in a metrosexual sort of way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible company","review":"I understand that subscriptions can save you money with magazines, but honestly you will save your pocket book and possibly your credit score by just buying them from a magazine stand. I honestly do not know how they can continue to be in business! (Rodale books that is) Its like selling your soul to the devil, or being in debt with the mafia. Will never ever give them anymore of my information. I literally had to get new checking account cards and everything for them to stop billing me, but that caused problems in itself as well, but worth it now that i do not have to deal with them anymore! Save your time, money and sanity and just spend the extra couple of bones at the magazine stand. It will be cheaper in the long run! I promise!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Men's Health Magazine through Lightning deal","review":"Pretty tricky.I order 1 year Subscription. It is noted that it will be 4 - 6 weeks before I get my first copy, no problem with that.But when I get my first copy, Mid June, it's the Issue for March. So I am started off with a 2 month old issue. Why would anyone want or expect back orders as part of a New Subscription? I am expecting, mid June, to get July's issue.I find this a little crooked and crummy.If that is part of my 12 issues, I certainly will not reorder and will be more cautious of Subscriptions through Amazon's lightning deals.That is what my Rating is based on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rodale Customer Service is Pathetic","review":"Be warned! I'm only a casual reader of Men's Health, but I recently contacted their costumer support via e-mail to inquire about a back issue.

The mag looked interesting and appeared to have some good articles. But, when I began to look inside and read these articles I found that they were a very shallow representation of the title on the cover. I found these tiles on the cover to be a gross misleading description of the contents. I am now in the process of cancelling my subscription. It is insanely difficult to find a link that will allow you to cancel. I won't be ordering any more magazines from Amazon. Too difficult to communicate. We asked for some communication about this account to verify the cancellation and have yet to receive any."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eternal Subscription","review":"My problem isn't with the magazine itself, but with their new (or at least new to me) subscription policy. Subscriptions now automatically renew, which means you will start receiving bills months before your current subscription ends. If you decide you don't want to renew you must call them. If you don't they will turn you over to a collection agency, even if you don't receive issues from the new subscription.I have subscribed to Men's Health off an on for many years, and even own some of their books. This is the first time I have had this problem, and it will be the last. Apparently they are getting desperate trying to keep their subscribers."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't be looking here to get healthy...","review":"Unless being healthy is defined as the most updated clothes and fragrances...Magazine has gone downhill over time to included less and less on working out and eating healthy.

If you ignore it, they will have North Shore Agency (collector) send you a collections notice. Think I'm kidding? Just Google it. They do this to everyone.My wife got me a subscription through her airline miles program. I hated the magazine and never renewed it. Apparently that means little to Rodale. I got a notice from North Shore and challenged them to prove I asked for a renewal. Never heard back. I expect to see this on a TV \\"rip-off\\" report soon. You've been warned!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely a \\"Health\\" magazine anymore","review":"I used to enjoy this magazine, but it has gone downhill. Rather than \\"Health\\" the magazine's focus has become getting women to bed, sex, and fashion. The title of the magazine should be changed to \\"Men's Fashion\\" or \\"Playboy\\". If you want a fashion magazine, there is already GQ. The magazine cover usually tries to portray \\"muscle\\" type articles, and there are articles on working out, but the focus on \\"Health\\" is very limited."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Cosmo, in convenient dude format","review":"This is a periodical for Your Standard Guy. It's fun to read without all the boy glam of, say, Details, and less of the steroid pumping Mr. Ed's of Muscle 'n' Fitness. With a focus on health the monthly exercises are exceptionally explained (several have made their way into my routine). This is the perfect time killer while you tick off the miles on the treadmill. Fun-to-read trivia pages and articles like \\"How To Spot Fake Stuff\\" (breasts, $20 bill, Cuban cigars, breasts) and \\"How to read your dog's body language\\" punctuate every issue along with the standard \\"Should I Take Creatine\\" and \\"How to win her over in bed\\". The monthly stories of how normal guys lost 8, 9, 10+ inches off their gut are especially inspiring (complete with before and after pictures, plus their workouts and diets explained). The clothing articles are a bit yuppie as are their \\"Get the right gear for the season\\" recommendations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did it take so long?","review":"It took forever for this magazine to get to the address and it also is shipped a week to 2 weeks after the magazine is already on the stands.

All I can say is the amazom service is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was a Good Magazine in the Past","review":"In the mid-90's, Men's Health was a fantastic magazine. For the past few years, it has been nothing but a mouthpiece for nationalized healthcare, taxation on \\"sinful\\" foods, and other bad ideas designed to limit personal freedoms. It still has a few good tips from time-to-time, but you have to be willing to overlook a lot of nonsense to find them."},{"rating":"1","title":"a month later....I still haven't received a single issue","review":"Can't really tell you how the magazine is...still haven't received a single issue.

Entertaining fluff, but the same recycled content, again and again, slightly or completely wrong. (I know because I happen to be an expert on one subject area that they occasionally cover. They get it ALL wrong.) But you probably knew that already.Secondly, and the main reason I got up to write this review, is that when your year is thankfully up, they send a small postcard saying they will \\"for your convenience\\" automatically bill your credit card for a renewal!So it becomes your responsibility to contact them (of course, the phone number is \\"temporarily\\" broken) or else negotiate with your credit card company for a reversal. Your time and hassle - free to them.

They do now have Joe Quenan after the mororn who runs GQ now fired him. Workout articles can be found for free on the Menshealth website or other forums. Fashion is ok, realisticly priced (at least for me:). Maybe most importantly, it's NOT a sexist and misogynistic magazine such as FHM, Details, etc. They have some mindless fiction each month, also. I just wish someone could put it all together: fashion, fitness, current events."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"MAGAZINE REVIEW:The magazine has plenty of good articles on health, exercise, nutrition, sex, etc.This is one of the few magazines that I can actually read from cover to cover; it has tips on how to fight off sickness (i.e. cold, flu, etc.), how to exercise--I've found out what I've been doing wrong in my workouts as a result, and how to please a woman.If you're interested work-out tips like I am, this magazine offers some but not enough... For extensive work-out tips, I suggest you go get \\"Exercise&Health\\"; in my opinion, \\"Exercise&Health\\" has the best work-out tips, and the magazine has lots of them!

They continued to send it I thought in error... Now over a year later they send me a collection letter from a collection compnay for the 19.95 subscription fee.

There are good ideas for mixing up your workout, for eating nutritionally, and motivation.Check it out...Amazon often has killer deals on this subscription.

Their treatment of customers is another story. I dislike the fact that they regard a subscription as permanent until you figure out how to turn it off. Just now I spent $7.50 returning books I didn't want. They sent me a notice beforehand allowing me to opt out, but I was away on vacation. When I returned, I sent in the opt out form, but apparently it was too late and I received the book for a 21 day trial. I was ready to return them immediately, but the fine print says that an invoice is to be included; in another place it says the invoice will arrive in a few days. After at least 15 days (of the 21 day period), the invoice hasn't arrived.

We were not alone in this experience.The invoices from them were extremely misleading at times and even threatened to begin collections on us! Yikes! This for product renewals that we did not ask to receive and for which they refused to provide any proof of our order.We had to resort to filing a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission to get them to stop.Warning: don't even get started with them.

I had done nothing to the appliance, so I figured it was just a defect and sent it in to Helen of Troy (the company that produces it) for a replacement. 1 1/2 months later, I receive my replacement. Things are going good until yesterday, it stopped heating again! Something is definately wrong with the way these straighteners are produced. I would recommend getting an HAI instead. My friend has had her's for over 18 months and has had no trouble whatsoever. Remember- always go with ceramic for less damage to your hair, and make sure that the straightener produces at least 170 watts of power.

I don't mean challenging or not recommended, but literally impassible.

There are several different versions to this classic which add on more technical details to an already cool game. However, more often than not you find yourself leaning in to hear what the computer is saying or trying to figure out how to enter in the right codes to load your settings into the game so it registers where your ships are.

Man your battlestations!","review":"I first borrowed this game from a friend and after one game knew it was a must have. The fact that you can play one or two player game is neat in itself, but the advance missions really blow the game wide open. One of the things I like are the planes that take off from you aircraft carrier and will scout out ships for you. I found a many a ship this way, thus lead to victory. Don't think you plane is free and clear just because you get it off the carrier, each side is equipped with anti-aircraft guns! It takes a reasonable amount of time to program, but nothing to complain about and it's so easy. There is a lag when playing one player games as the Puter has to think but if you played against an AI before you're use to this. I like the look, feel, and playing of this updated battleship. The special weapons heat things up as well as the sub's sonar ability.

The book consists mainly of short examples and the book does not help to understand the relation of the equations. Also, the book as many errors. Because there are errors, you assume that every answer is possibly wrong and that you are doing the work wrong. The errors also do not help when you do have the correct answer.

This method should work well enough to prepare the reader for the relatively easy exercises that they will find at the end of each chapter, but it ultimately fails to prepare them for real-world problems.Now I have heard that some students prefer examples to words, in which case they should look at this book.

Scrabble really expands your vocabulary, but DON'T expect it to use them in daily life, or more commonly, not know the meaning at all. You see, to achieve Scrabble 'cramming', top players rarely, if ever memorise the word meanings. They memorise them for utility. So while you may triumph in many a word game, it will not significantly improve your English. In fact, the 2003 world champion Panupol Sujjayakorn has admitted that his English is still poor in spite of what must be a massive vocabulary numbering over a million.I highly recommend one of the Scrabble dictionaries, to cut out those niggly disputes when a person invents and insists that a word exists.

The made up story/facts... also awful. If you do watch it, you won't be able to believe how cornball the gun battles are, especially the one in the amusement park. As a work of art, this is 180 degrees from \\"The Godfather\\", which as we all know was excellent (and it also made up stories and facts... but did so exceptionally well).I would predict that virtually anyone that watches this will feel they've wasted their time and come away quite disappointed.I'm the type that believes film critics are way too negative most of the time, but this movie deserves a thumbs-down for certain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work.

He deals with politics, drugs, capitalism, archaeology, and an alien civilisation that with all its technology and culture raises Kursall at times to the level of the Alien moves.

The laser installed fairly easily after reading the instructions, but then was a pain to adjust.

This Item is just not up to par with the rest of the saw which I am very pleased with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Wow. DeWalt has really let me down this time. I paid $600 for the 718 saw, which came with a cracked base the first time, brought it back, then the 2nd one has poor plating, ugh. i thought that the laser would at least not let me down. I was so wrong. It wasnt so bad to attach to the saw, but after aligning the parallel & perpendicular axis, i discovered that you can't get the kerf line to fall visibly on the cut line, its off by 1/16\\" or more. I tried it on both side of the blade, the left was worse than the right, but both sides dont allow you to be accurate with the side of the blade. This is because the laser is mounted above the blade, so the blade blocks the laser from falling on the cut line, you can get a very dim amount of the line to fal about 1/32\\" from the cut, still not acceptable for $70. Also the laser shakes and moves when you make adjustments, and I have no doubt that it will require constant re-alining during work use. A real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"I have years of experience with dewalt miter saws and have kept returning to them after much success. I have seen laser systems before and thought they were a gimick. Since this one carried the dewalt name I thought that it would be professional grade. This is not the case the laser leaves a fat line that is not fine enough for trim and cabinetry work. The laser was easy to put on, but took some time to adjust. After I had it sighted in I found that the line it projects completly covered my pencil line on the board. This attachment is not meant for professionals"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Outdoor Use","review":"My DeWalt 716 is a fairly good saw, but a laser is really needed to avoid \\"trial and error\\" cutting. So, I bought the laser to aid in cutting siding for my home. If you are planning to use this laser outdoors, don't bother unless you work after sunset or on VERY cloudy days. On even \\"cloudy bright\\" days, the laser line is not visible. In bright sunshine, you can't even tell if the laser is \\"on\\". I never gave this a thought before I purchased the laser. I guess I'll keep it for use indoors after the siding job is done. Setup was kind of a pain, too. The wires were difficult to connect and place in the recess provided. Accuracy seems fair to good, but the alignment screws seem too loose and prone to vibrating out of adjustment. All in all, pretty disappointing, and I certainly wouldn't call this item \\"heavy duty\\". If I ever buy another miter saw, I think I will look at Makita."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for precision","review":"I bought this laser along with Dewalts 12 inch double bevel miter saw. Attaching it is easy and alignment wasn't too bad once you figure out how the set screws work. The laser is fairly bright but also wide, maybe 1/32. It is also hard to keep aligned. Everytime I move the saw the laser seems to be off a bit. If you keep all of you cuts to one side of the laser it works okay, but remember to check alignment during the work day, even the vibration from the saw causes it to wander a bit.

If you want a \\"general\\" idea of where the cut is going to be, then waste the 70 bucks for it. The problem is that when you adjust it to get close enough to the actual cut made by the blade, the teeth on the blade get in the way and cuts the light output of the laser by 75% or so. Although I only used it to make about 3 cuts before becoming frustrated enough to take it back off, I could imagine that the laser could easily be vibrated out of alignment just because the adjustment screws didn't seem to be very taught. Charge me an extra $70 bucks for the saw and make one with the laser already attached. Three cuts and back to the store it goes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as bad as I read","review":"The laser works well for average precision. It will not mark to a 1/32\\" accuracy but it is great for 90% of cutting. A great purchase.

As previously stated the laser projection is too thick, you need to recalibrate it just about every time you change the angle, definitely every time you pick it up or move it, and now that I have it set up in my shop it seems as if just about once or twice a week I recalibrate it. I have gone so far as to just leave it off and eye ball the cut, tried and true method!It really is a shame that this product isn't as great as it should be. I thought I just had a defective unit, but no, it really sucks!I wanted to try the IRWIN laser that mounts directly to the blade shaft, although after speaking with a friend I heard that one is just as good as this one.Save your money.

Otherwise, skip it, especially at sixty plus dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very difficult to install and adjust","review":"I would describe the laser as a device that was intended to be installed in the factory. Plugging in the connectors was very difficult; placing the connected plugs in the right spaces was very difficult; the adjustments of the laser are confusing. I had to use needle-nose pliers to twist the power supply connectors into a position that would allow me to press the power supply into place. I've read the instructions and tried to adjust the laser, but it's not easy at all to get the line to come down parallel to the saw blade. Part of the problem is that some adjustments are made with the blade down, but most are made with the blade up.My initial reaction on installing it is that it's not an improvement over lining up the cut by eye. Hopefully my opinion will improve once I've managed to properly adjust the laser. I imagine the laser is really intended for cutting moulding, which would be difficult to line up by eye."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unstable!","review":"Not difficult to adjust, once you practice a little. But the laser won't STAY adjusted! All it takes to throw it out of line is a little semi-rough handling of the saw. Every time I move the saw or put it away the laser is useless the next time I use it unless I adjust it again.There's a lot of potential here, but if it won't stay stable, that pretty much blows the entire value. It's hard to justify 2 or more stars when you're not getting any use at all out of the product.I really have no idea why they gave it \\"soft\\" adjustments with set screws working against springs -- shouldn't it be tight two-way set screws that won't move except when you turn them? And no springs? Honestly, this laser goes out of adjustment if you so much as slap it on the side with your hand.

They tended to have problems getting the fish hooked (even my husband did), and as other people have said, it's quite loud. We were unloading the truck when we moved, and could hear it through the box across the garage. Jostling the box will turn on the thing, and you can't turn it off outside the box (at least, I've never been able to get it to shut off without rearranging the contents of the box). If they'd made the song a little slower (so you didn't hear so many repetitions), or a bit quieter, it would have been less annoying. I was lucky that the kids didn't play it too often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Game -- not song, after a few hours playing non-stop","review":"I bought the game for my 4-year-old son & 2-year-old daughter. Our daughter has enjoyed the game more because she likes the music it plays. When she decided that the music that the game plays was better than any music tape, cd, or video ever made -- the music became annoying. We would turn off the game when we thought she wasn't listening to the music and in no time flat, she had that sucker back on. Our kids played it but it didn't hold their attention for long. Our son is now 7 and doesn't give it a second look but our 5-year-old daughter still likes it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much fun, they wore it out and we bought it again!","review":"My daughter received this when she was 3. She loved it, and usually played the game without the cards, but using the hooks to catch the fish as they swim around. Over the next 3 years, she and her baby brother wore this game out! (The board became scratchy and the magnetized fish would no longer \\"stick.\\") My son cried for it to work again, and we eventually bought a new one for him when he turned 3.Yes, it is a noisy game, but we've easily solved this problem by placing the game on a bed or pillow to muffle it. My son loves to smack the turtle (which turns the game and song on) and leave the game on. When his friends come over, this is the first game they always play.What really drives me crazy is not knowing all the words to the song . . . \\"and they swam and they swam all over the dam!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the fishing game","review":"The above title are the words of my 3 year old neice. She loves the game - The game is colorful as well as durable. She can take out the game and set it up and even put it away all by herself. It's easy to turn on and off. I think the only drawback from having this game and it's not for the kids - it's for the adults is that there is no volume on/off or control switch to lower the volume. So this can be annoying. Other than that the game is lots of fun and she loves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good product","review":"very poor quality it broke within a few uses.

I bought this to chop walnuts and it absolutely doesn't work. I tried chopping carrots for soup- another fail. I even tried onions, since other reviews had mentioned how great it was at making salsa....mediocre at best. The blades are sharp and I like the design of the handle, but it doesn't do the job. I've already tested it out too much to return it, so I imagine it's going to the highest cupboard graveyard of useless kitchen implements.

That is the understatement of the year! It chops onions in seconds. I'm sure it works with other things too, but I use it for chopping onions for chili, Spanish rice and other dishes I make often. It eliminates the tears and speeds up the work incredibly. If this one breaks I will be buying my third one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Sturdy, Parts fall off chopper ......","review":"Two parts that keep falling off are the thing on side & the white thing on top beside the turner. Drive me nuts finally I took that little thing on side off the chopper. It is also difficult to put in LOCK postion so it stays put so you can chop onions, etc. It is not made to last - it is a good substitute for a better apparatus. You are constantly removing those SHARP blades in order to wash this chopper. It does do a good job chopping onions, peppers, and prearing egg salad.

In place of Carroll's immortal humor and wit, we have the pathetic (sometimes imitative) efforts of NBC hacks accompanied by canned laughter and applause.

If however, you've delved into this area before, you'll find it wishy washy and wished that the author would just get to the point! With that in mind, I found it rather boring.

Definitely a book for people who are looking for a starting point in this subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess Rosemary Altea is not my cup of tea......","review":"Perhaps I bought this book thinking it was something else.

It does make various good points here and there, and perhaps things you will remember for a long time to come.

Really, a BIG disappointment for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a waste of hard earned money","review":"I purchased this book and one by Wayne Dyer at the same time.

I saw this con artist on Larry King Live. During the show, a young man phoned in and said he lost his grandfather, whom he was very close to, in a hunting accident. Clairvoyant Altea, in her infinite wisdom and God-like powers, said \\"I see a wooded area, lots of trees. There are dogs as well.\\" We're talking about a hunting accident here and she sees woods, trees, and dogs. Imagine that! Further, the caller happened to be from Idaho. And lo and behold! Ms. Altea saw a mountain range. Pathetic. My heart goes out to her victims (the gullible who want desparately to hear a message from their deceased loved ones). How does she sleep at night!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgot to add this into my other review!","review":"From reading the reviews on Rosemary Altea, I had considered buying her other books.

I am glad I saved my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Platonic form of Joke","review":"This book states that people can get in touch with dead people. The fact, however, is this: there is no evidence that people who are living can communicate with those who are dead. Rosemary's book won't teach you how to speak with the dead. Fact: If you're thinking about dead people, and if you have a strong desire to get in touch with dead people, you'll actually get yourself to believe you've had an encounter with a dead person.

The book sounded very interesting after listening to her presentation. I agree with a previous customer who reviewed this book. There were so many errors within the book, that it took away any credibility this author states she has.

I was WRONG... they made this movie EXACTLY the way it should have been and stayed true to the perfect book by Colleen McCullough.This movie will stand the test of times and has become an instant classic.No matter what age...

It embodies many literary themes: ambition,spiritual questing, unrequited love, undying love, hatred, jealousy, devotion, temptation, failure, friendship and unconditional love. It spans three generations and ties them together by showing how these themes repeat themselves, from one life to the next. It is a literary masterpiece, and one worthy of study.

The remaining cast members, including Christopher Plummer, Piper Laurie, Earl Holliman, and Mare Winningham are exemplary as they bring to life the pages of McCullough's best-selling novel.However, the movie belongs to Barbara Stanwyck. Although the character of Mary Carson dies early in the production, the scenes in which Stanwyck appears are stunning in their execution. As a \\"woman of years\\" pining over the younger de Bricassart, Stanwyck's Carson has that would be her last great one.

J.- Toy Story short: Small Fry- Cars shorts: Air Mater, Time Travel Mater- 7 student films\\"Small Fry\\" is an absolute hoot, just perfect - while the others are so-so.Still, such a release would be a nice thing for Pixar completists like me. Emphasis on \\"would\\".You see, this collection is not complete at all, because it omits the third Toy Story short, \\"Partysaurus Rex\\", which was shown in theatres along with the 3D version of \\"Finding Nemo\\" this summer. Why this short isn't included is just baffling. To top it off, \\"Partysaurus Rex\\" won't even be on the upcoming \\"Finding Nemo\\" Blu-ray.So, two stars. One for this set being incomplete, and another for the brilliance which is \\"Small Fry\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pixar Quality Compromised.","review":"I own Pixar Shorts Vol. 1 and value it as an exceptional collection of very unique and special short films.

One reason being that Angela Lansbury is my favorite actress of all time. The show is just great about an amazing detective and how she solves the murder mysteries. The show was amazing most seasons but unfortunately the last 2 seasons werent as great. Most likely because they ran out of good ideas/material to make good story lines.

Like many reviewers have said, the first three Seasons the disc was two-sided, but in Season 4 they rectified that and now it is only on one side.The quality is wonderful and I can watch these episodes over and over.

However, I must agree with many fans of the show out there that have had problems with the double-sided discs, which Universal has, for some reason, felt they needed to use up to this point. In particular, my season 2 set sometimes won't play certain episodes, and other times it will!?? I see that season 4 indicates is a 5-disc set -- which leaves me wondering -- are we finally to be given the privilege of single-sided discs??? I TRULY hope so -- as do many other fans. Thank you, Universal. I am also pleased that they are releasing these season sets at a fairly decent pace. I'm excited to get this next season set!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Quality issues","review":"Before purchasing this set I read through the reviews of previous seasons. I read several that mentioned the poor quality of the dvds for season 2 and 3 and recommended skipping to the 4th season. I did as suggested and am here to report that season 4 has major glitches with quality as well. We have tried to watch 2 of the dvds and have ended up very frustrated when they begin stopping, pausing and skipping around. One episode was totally unwatchable once it began to pause etc...I haven't returned it nor will I purchase any more simply because I don't trust what I will be getting and it sounds like when people return their faulty sets they are merely replaced with another faulty disk set...It also sounds like Universal does not care about the feedback they are getting from customers...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas gift delight!","review":"I bought the 4th Season of MSR as a Christmas gift for my wife and she loves it!

The articles however are extremely long and contain next to no information. Don't get me wrong, I am all for long articles... if they contain well summarized, well researched information. This is not the case for most articles in Mother Jones. It seems that the authors are trying to hide as little information as possible in a 10 page long prose story about sympathetic characters. In some cases, a bit more semi-humorous information is hidden amongst some drawings.All in all, this seems like kids news for hip grown-ups: the author knows that the reader doesn't really care about complicated stuff such as politics or economics, but still wants to pretend to be a well-informed intellectual, so he wraps about a bit of information in a nice story. Some people might like that kind of journalism, I prefer real news!And be warned: if you subscribe to Mother Jones, you will be flooded with junk mail."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible service, terrible PR","review":"I signed up for a one-year subscription.

This was just stupid. I don't understand why in most of her movies they just have her change from one gorgeous costume to another while trying to wade through banal pap for a script.

Frankly, this cd ...!!! The last track is a great rocking song, but they should have thrown the rest in the garbage... I love the bottle rockets, and i am hugely disappointed in this... They should have included the one good song on an album with their own material, and canned the rest of this ... I had not known of doug sahm before, and after hearing this, i would never listen to him if i had the chance....

If you like ANY of their previous disks, it's NOTHING like them.

That movie had the best music and some awesome base jumping in addition to the great skiing and boarding. I get the feeling that many, including the WM team, acknowledge that this was one of their best. The sound track to \\"Cold Fusion\\" was their best. I even wrote all of the songs down from that movie and made my own soundtrack CD. I feel that \\"Higher Ground\\" was an attempt to return to that formula. I found it more entertaining than the past two films but the soundtrack didn't match \\"Cold Fusion\\"; not a big deal though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Let down","review":"I'd say this film is THE BIGGEST let down, next to Impact, in the Warren Miller film collection. Like the previous reviewer said, this film is extremely over-commercialized with all kinds of garbage, and there's a lot less skiing/boarding, and more movie-like attempted story telling. Stay far, far away from this film. It was a waste of money to go see, and definitely a waste of money to buy.On the upside, this year's film, Off The Grid, was very enjoyable. They must have finally got the hint to get rid of the ridiculous amount of commercialization, and go back to the roots of what made Warren Miller films so succesful. Look for that film to be released some time in January of 2007, and get that instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Warren??","review":"Warren Miller is involved with this movie in name only. His catch phrases \\"if you don't do it this year...\\" were dubbed in from earlier movies. I could live with the departure of Warren (he's in his 80s after all), but the movies are also over-commercialized -- hitting too many mountains and helicopter trips, and too many product placements. There's very little of the spirit left that makes Warren's millers so wonderful. Buy an old one and skip this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of blabla any little action","review":"This documentary takes you frequently behind the scenes rather than to the action itself. The director shows he is very keen on the Alaskan landscapes with some respect to other remarkable ski resorts.I was expecting a more extravaganza-ski-type movie rather than a documentary-type film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Same Good Old Warren Miller Movie","review":"Boring. It's transparent that the few lines actually spoken by Warren Miller are clips inserted from other projects. The new narration is not engaging or very humorous or even very interesting. Without Miller's quips and keen sense of humor and vision, I'm afraid that merely putting his name on the movie and including recycled Miller lines is not going to keep a lot of Miller fans interested for long.

All I can say is WOW! Christopher Lawrence has definitely taken it to the next level on this CD. There is no doubt that Lawrence keeps pushing how quality trance and progressive house is defined - rightly earning him the title of one of America's top DJs. This new CD still maintains the chunky, powerful and driving force of his live sets, but it also has a subtle, catchy groove. It is the perfect balance and Lawrence's most mature CD to date. Favorite tracks include \\"The Curse\\", \\"Indya\\", \\"Hong Kong Junkie\\" and Lawrence's own mix of \\"Nightfever\\". Like Lawrence's earlier CDs - \\"Around the World\\" will have enormous staying power. And like a Sasha or Paul Oakenfold CD, you will be listening to this for years to come. Trust me - don't miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starts as suspense, ends as romance","review":"When I saw this film for a film class years ago, it was called \\"Romauld et Juliette\\" and it had subtitles.

These stories are not necessarily his best but they give a flavor of his obsessions with the dark side of the puritanical Victorian soul.

The title sounded intriguing, so I bought the book. I may not be in the age bracket to be nostalgic, but I think I was anyhow. The author does some fantastic digging into the history of this 150-year-old school (If still standing today, it would be over 211 years old). In addition, he sometimes places this story into the national scene, which adds a broader perspective: For example, he doesn't gloss over the effects of segregation and racial prejudice.What blew my mind was the determination of the \\"Powers that Be\\" to make schools bigger and bigger to the detriment of students and learning. And Mr. Charnock backs up his (actually, the Small School Movement's) philosophy with easy-to-read research briefs.The section on pictures of the old school sort of \\"takes you there,\\" too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spanish Songs","review":"I have listened to Eydie interpret both English and Spanish songs and it is in the spanish language songs that she attains her true greatness.

It was way too small.And then, within a matter of minutes, the plastic adjustable clasp broke.It's really too bad, because it arrived so quickly, and it looks quite sporty."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE PRODUCT!!!!!","review":"We puchased these for our (3) guinea pigs and they are awful. The leashes do not fit on the animal - we tried in vain for 45 minutes to get these to work and the guinea pig simply puts its front paws through the front of the velcro and slips right out. We woud have returned these products (the three we purchased), but the kids were SO excited (thinking they would work) that they tore the packaging. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! These should not even be sold."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR GUINEA PIGS!","review":"My guinea pig is less than one year old, and this harness was still too small for him. The neck is too tight, and even once I expanded it with Velcro, the waist was too tight anyway. He looks ridiculous in it and doesn't like it one bit. I'm sure it works fine for ferrets, but don't buy it for a guinea pig. Both you and your cavy will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Dangerous for Piggies","review":"Since my guinea pig loves to run, I thought this would be perfect; but it's far from it! I tried both the medium and larger sizes, and both were too small. Even the largest size was too small around the neck for him. It fits around the middle, but not around the neck. I reccomend NOT using this product at all! It is dangerous to the guinea pigs as it may choke them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much drama and not enought substance.","review":"At first it started out with an interesting subject then quickly fell off into the vast pit of dumb.

Mistake! At a second reading, I let myself drift along with the embracing flow and only then did I experience the sense of Jorie's words. I thought of how I had experienced James Joyce's Finnegan's Wake, and though not comprehending the words or even able to parse them, I began to absorb images and impressions, which became unravelled into a sort of experiencing the reality within the Music of the words. Jorie's language is, indeed, another Music which one ingests much as one experiences an intoxicant dream. Her detractors say that she is an elitist with language, and full of vain puffery. But they do not understand what they're seeing. Jorie's words are a wonderous and beautiful and magical melody!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This series has developed a cult following...","review":"...and that should scare any Christian who sees it. Bruce Wilkinson is self-serving, and motivated by dollar signs, and in essence has created a cult. His books (and the candles, journals, coasters, ballcaps, and posters) try to brainwash people into believing that God is some kind of genie. The book itself is condescending, and teaches children that God is just something else to manipulate, instead of being the awesome, mighty leader that He is. Instead of reading this book to your children, try the Bible. It will set them on a much straighter path, and will have much better results."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 words: Industrial music","review":"Let me qualify: Not 100% of my music collection is stuff I'm happy with.

The image quality is appalling and paper quality very low. As everyone within electronmicroscopy knows the image quality is essential and here are all images pixelated covering important information.

Good advice for almost any situation. This book has an incredable amount of information on pre-fight posturing. His \\"de-escalation/first strike stance\\" is something that should be incorperated into every practical personal defense program, from police/security to the average Joe. The drills in this are golden. Much of the training involves proper mental attitude, which is essential when in a high-stress situation. My only real complaints are that there are too many techniques (doesn't look like he follows the KISS principle) and that Mr. Franco's \\"reference material\\" is pretty much just his other books. Also, I think some of his principals are better suited for advanced students, even though the book is supposed to be for begginers. Those who are familiar with JKD may find a lot of similarities in this book. Overall, a great book, especially for self-defense instructors, but sometimes just has too much information."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Start To Practical Self-Defense","review":"A wonderful concept, the preemptive strike. This book starts out with a great concept and begins to cover the topic in detail and with logical reasoning(first 2 chapters). Then it turns into a basic how to fight book with simple techniques dispalyed in simple photos. The topic is a relevant one for realistic self-defense and hand to hand combat. The author writes with some apparent authority on the subject matter, yet the book fails to live up to the concept. This book is acceptable for the novice to intermediate student of realistic hand to hand combat. It is by no means acceptable to those of us with the expertise the author claims to have and may possess; yet the book failed to meet the expectations it leads one to believe. The topic could have and should have been covered in greater detail, such as in Dave Grossmans book \\"On Killing\\" or other such books dealing with the psychological mindset of a warrior. ... see my \\"Listmania\\" suggestions."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny all the way!","review":"Funny all the way! there are constant sight gag, horrendous puns, parodies!

Also, the tv show was made before 1985 and tv and movies were more solid in feel than practically anything that came after 1985 (as this film did). And the movie's slight attempt at more real story than the series also turns me off a little more. Priscilla Presley (sexy though she truly is from head to foot) is slightly vapid but being a mostly slapstick film that's ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"I just love these stupid Leslie Nielson movies, they are so stupid that they are great. The Naked Gun is probably the funniest of Nielson's comedies. I highly recomend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great baseball parody makes this all worth while","review":"The 15- to 20-minute baseball game sequence in \\"The Naked Gun\\" is - in my opinion - the funniest stretch of cinema in American film history. From Leslie Nielsen's rendition of the National Anthem under the guise of opera singer Enrico Pallazzo (shades of Carl Lewis' infamous attempt at 'singing') to his classic balls and strikes calls to the Queen doing The Wave and passing hot dogs, the Zuckers just absolutely nailed and perfectly zinged everything there is to zing about baseball. You can watch it a dozen times and discover something new every time.Also, every fan of this movie probably thought of Frank Drebin recently when a CNN reporter left her mike on the restroom. That's right out of The Naked Gun."},{"rating":"2","title":"If Only O.J. Wasn't in it","review":"I love this movie.

But if you do, you are in for a real treat. This is a good as pharse gets--EXTREMELY funny, witty, and entertaining. Leslie Nielson is just great. And in response to a review from below: it's not really bad acting--it's is very clever acting, intended to seem \\"bad\\", which is part of what makes it a pharse! This kind of comedy isn't supposed to be taken seriously in any way. It made me laugh hysterically, and I have never seen a better movie with this type of comedy.The first sequel is almost as funny as the original; the third sequel is less so--but both sequels are funny and worth viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I actually preffered the TV Show","review":"Some comedies just do not hold up. Enter The Naked Gun. I have the TV Show on VHS and have watched it for so long and I had seen these NG movies sooo long ago, that I just assumed 'they were good.' I rented this last night and man, this movie just isn't very good. It has good bits like Frank looking through the microscope with his closed eye, but many many gags are long winded and simply not funny (like the urination scene). This comedy works better on TV b/c it is a faster medium. Making unfunny jokes much longer doesn't make them funnier it makes them tedious. Also, the acting is just not any good, I much preffered the TV cast to OJ and company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed the target, on this one....","review":"Okay, this was an okay movie.

(Don't Call Me Shirley! Edition)in regards to its level of humor but unlike Airplane Leslie Nielson tends to be the only character who takes things literally which definitely puts a spin on the style of comedy. It's enjoyable from the very first moment until the credits with very few scenes lacking some form of humor.If you enjoy non-stop completely goofy comedies you'll really enjoy this one. If you tend to dislike movies like Airplane, Spaceballs, Blazing Saddles, or Robinhood Men in Tights I'd avoid the movie though."},{"rating":"1","title":"baseball songs for church","review":"Way to churchy, too much God and baseball.

If this was something for myself I might not care, but every baby item I purchase I have always made sure it is sealed for sanitary reasons - most of the items I purchase are Medela and they have the safety seal stating that if the seal is broken, the item cannot be returned, which i like - it makes me feel safer about the products I am purchasing.

I have never had problems with them leaking like I have had with some other systems. Once I went back to work and was only pumping once a day, they have been the perfect size. I have always switched to bags for freezer storage, so I can't comment on their use in a freezer. The markings are nice and dark and easy to read and haven't really faded even after a lot of use. I would have done 5 stars except that the measurement markings didn't quite match up with the snappies I was using from the hospital so when I was trying to use smaller, more exact amounts I usually ended up about 10mL off which was a big difference for my preemie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bottles","review":"These bottles are awesome for storing fresh expressed (and frozen) breast milk.They fit perfectly with my Medela Pump-in-Style pump parts.They travel very well (no leaking for me in two-plus months of use) and warm nicely.The ones I received had labels, white lids (a couple extra) and were packaged loose.If you run out of labels, use a bit of masking tape.When freezing the bottles note they definitely expand, even with 1oz of room at the top and will crack/break if they fall on the floor.Overall, I would recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"extra bottles helpful","review":"It's really helpful to have extra bottles so I don't have to spend time washing bottles every night.

It has value for all levels and so it's something I love returning to as I gain experience. There is nothing like a good intro or ending. They are classified by style which makes them especially valuable. Take example the old classic western \\"El Paso\\". By applying Turners intro's and endings in D you can have your very own, personalized styling that will sound unique and appropriate to lovers of the song.My favorites however are the turnarounds. Most of us are introduced to guitar with individual chords, then progressions. Toss in a Turner turnaround and you have 80% of a song.

The work has an almost dreamlike quality to it. Traditionalists will hate it but on every watching after the first I came to appreciate more what the people behind the production were trying to do.There are low budget productions were people don't try.

It looked as if it had been filmed on two stages and the quality of the film was extremely poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Islands magazine is like a \\"bible\\" to me..........","review":"I was in the Naval Reserve for 7 years-of which 3 were on active duty.....and I had 12 years in the travel business..4 years at a cruise only agency....I think Columbus would have been a subscriber if Islands was being printed in 1492.............I love knowing the planet Earth and since it is mostly water..what better way than with Islands magazine!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad But Not Great Eather","review":"Got a year sub to this magazine as a year to Caribbean, the later is a better buy... for me anyways.

You have to assemble the board everytime and pray you get the houses in the right spots, instead of it being fixed and ready to play like the GOOD version. The people fall out of the cars and are so microscopic, I'm sure the vacuum cleaner will find them before I do. There are these strange \\"Life\\" cards that make no sense whatsoever, debunking the whole purpose of earning any real money. There are no gifts from the other players when you get married or have kids. In fact, there's no reason now to even have kids!

This is not the game you remember!","review":"Do NOT confuse this new version of LIFE with the old version!!! The old version is a classic--this new version is a big disappointment. In the new LIFE you don't get to choose your career or anything. Instead of monetary bonuses throughout the game (e.g. spinning for gifts when you have a child) you get these silly \\"Life\\" cards that you can't look at until the end. At the end you get huge amounts of money with each \\"Life\\" card and it's possible to win even if you don't have very much cash in front of you because of those cards. It's disappointing to play the whole game and then lose because of those cards, which are totally random. It's like you play the whole game and then spin to see who is the winner.

The new version has added several new and VERY confusing rules, changed the colors of the money (Which is only bad if you have the first version memorized), added many new parts which will just get lost, and have made it a more mean spirited game.

You must set up the board every time you play it, inserting the useless little houses on the board, and setting up the bridges. While they're okay to look at, if we have to set the game up like that every time, it's not worth it. Print the whole board if you can't box it properly.

We bought them a current version in 2001 and have been very disappointed. We had no idea that a game that had been great just the way it was had been changed. It is more difficult to play and geared more toward older kids--probably teens. There are now life tiles which add nothing to the game at all. The players can decide to buy stocks, insurance policies, take out bank loans. Players pick their own careers as well as their salaries and even which home they will buy. Requires strategic financial planning. Also, the money amts. involved get very high making counting work, not fun. In addition, our board folds up and is already falling apart on the folds and we take very good care of our games! We miss the old Life!! This new version is too complicated for younger kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy","review":"This games has way to many rules to understand unless you are a professor or someting.

We started playing when they were 4 and 5 1/2 years old. Sure, they needed help with reading and counting the money but we had a great time nonetheless and they have learned a lot in the process.

And what is with those Life cards that range from $50,000 - $200,000. Get real! When in life can you move a couple paces and receive that much cash. There were some highlights to the game that I thought were pretty cool, like the night school switch career thing, paying taxes, etc. I however did not like the fact that you had to get married, had waaaaay too much money, no one hit the poor farm, etc. I want the old version back!

There are 6 pages of rules to go by. Confusing ones at that. We didnt make it 1/4 of the way through before we gave up, it was that difficult.

I ended up giving it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Game","review":"This game is very challenging . Very well put together and is very interesting. Very much enjoyed by the whole family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Family Game","review":"This is a classic game for the whole family, the new design of the game board is great with it's 1 time set-up. I recommend this game for anyone who want's a fun game for family game night."},{"rating":"2","title":"very fun game","review":"I played it a few times with some friends off and on since I was ten(I never had any board games and neither did my fam)-this is actually a very fun game! I loved it and so now I have it(but I have no friends now, so, what the hell? ). This really is a cool game just like monopoly(except it has a little more action). buy this if you dig adventurous games and monopoly if you don't have this yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"If you loved playing Life as a kid, don't buy the new revised version. They took out all the fun by making it politically correct. If you find the original game, buy it and buy it fast. That's what I'm going to do. Just wish that I could return the new version."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Game of Life - HORRIBLE","review":"We recently purchased this game for our daughter because it was one of my favorite games when I was a child. Unfortunately I wasn't aware that it had been \\"improved.\\" I can't even express how disappointed I was when I realized how much they had changed this game. It has gone from being a simple pleasure to play to a complicated mess! Not to mention the board that has to be put together each time and the people that won't stay in the cars... I plan to log onto the Milton Bradly site and let them also know my opinion, maybe the will remarket the older, better version. I suppose it might be ok to anyone who has never experienced the 70's version - but if you are expecting the good old Game of Life - Buyer Beware! I advise all of those out there who are as disappointed as I am to also write to Milton Bradley, maybe they will listen if enough people complain and bring back the one we all remember!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring back the old Life!","review":"Noticing how my board game collection did not include Life, I went to buy it. Much to my dismay they had changed the game. This game includes cards in which came be switched around between players and little cards in which you receive $50,000-$200,000. It all just seemed way too easy. I used to love Life, one of my favorite games. I never play the new game it's no fun. Funny, I still find myself browsing the game aisle looking to see if they changed it back yet..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tell MB to quit making this sooo cheap- by not buying it.....","review":"Ok, here is my gripe. When I was a kid, you took this game out of the box, did the regular passing out of money and other administerial stuff, and away you went. Not with this POS......You have to assemble the whole game, every time you play. That means putting the houses onto the board. You even have to attach the mountains! Maybe I''m getting too old, but the version I had you didn't have to do this. Talk about cheesey. MB make a little less money and atleast give us a pre-assembled board."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't fix it if it ain't broke!","review":"I miss the original game of Life. The new version is fine but, for those of us who grew up with the original it's not the same. I would like to see Hasbro offer both versions or go back to the original. My original Life game is tattered but I will continue to play it as opposed to the new game."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE!!! LIFE IS MORE COMPLICATED!!!","review":"I bought this game at the store for my girls because I remember it being relatively easy and fun as a kid. The creators of this game have made this game so complicated, I as an adult had trouble keeping up with it. I remember playing this as a kid in 3rd grade and having no troubles. There is no way my 4th grader could play this with her friends. LIFE IS WAY TO COMPLICATED (Pun intended). Life was much easier and more fun when I was a kid! They have complicated the fun right out of the game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed- this is a cheaper, changed version of the original","review":"The game is ok, but I was disappointed as this now standard version is a changed, lower budget design of the original game. In general it is cheaply made. A couple pain points is the spinner does not stay in place unless you are very gentle with it, the people always fall out of the cars, and trying to get it all back in the box really does not work.And again, besides the poor quality, the game has been changed I assume to be more politically correct and is not as fun. Try and get the original and skip this version if at all possible.I did see what looked like a much nicer version in a considerably larger box at a major book store retailer (has two names that start with \\"B\\" and \\"N\\"). It was at least 2x the price I paid, but I again bet a much nicer, higher quality edition worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN! But realistic? Not so much!","review":"My favorite board game growing up was this game. My parents and I played it every night, and my mom would say \\"this is how life works\\" whenever I lost or got screwed out of some money or something like that, so by the time I moved out, I thought I had real life figured out. Obviously, that wasn't the case, and now I'm in some trouble with the law... and I blame this game!...though it is very fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS AWEFUL!","review":"Oh My Gosh the new version of life is AWEFUL it was my favorite game and then as time went on I lost the pieces so I had to buy this one/ its so annoying it was much more fun when you could be a doctor and make 40,000 or be an artist and make 100,00. also there aren't those little things like if the wheel spins off the computer consultant gets paid to \\"fix it\\" this one is so much worse!!!!! dont buy it or you'll be very disappointed i wish i had read the reviews BEFORE I bought it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the young at heart.","review":"This is a revised version of the original. Almost every detail that made this game spectacular changed. If you enjoyed the original (or have any form of nostalgia for it), avoid this sham. The game has lost its flair."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best games in my childhood and still is.","review":"This game is just suitable for all ages and great fun to be played with family and friends in a short sitting. Monopoly is fun, but it can take too long. The game of life has a definitive ending and you can judge the progress rather easily. So planning for dinner becomes simpler. Through playing this game, you can teach your kids about a lot of things in life, such as investments and decision making.[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Primer","review":"For a COM beginner such as myself, this book provided a vital introduction to necessary concepts and techniques. The author wasted few words in conveying his information, and never talked down to us poor dummies.I was particularly taken with the author's didactic technique of including at least 2-3 egregious typos or omissions in the examples at the end of each chapter.To find the source code for these examples -- and unless you're already an expert, you *will* need the source code -- do not bother checking the url in the Introduction. Go to the Prentice Hall home ftp site drill down from there. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs work.......","review":"This book leaves a lot to be desired. First it has numerous mistakes. Second the title of the book is way misleading. You will not learn COM from this nor will you even come close as this book is way too general. IMHO this book is a complete waste of money. Granted that it will probably take 3 or 4 books to get COM down but this book deosn't aid you in anyway. The author's idea of laying the foundations of COM is walking you through an example where he leaves out explainations to the point that you can't create your own COM servers without a great deal of additional references. This book is not for C++ developers, its for analysts who need to evaluate technological alternatives or, perhaps, Visual Basic programmers who don't need the underlyings of COM just a high-level overview. In other words this book is of no help to C++ software engineers. Instead check out \\"Inside COM\\" or \\"Essential COM\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Stars","review":"I was very excited when I read chapters 1-3 as the content was clear and understandable, however the example as described in chapter 4 does not compile. I write lots of technical documentation for a living and I dont understand why these authors (not just this book, in fact a good many of programing books from many publishers) cannot supply working examples. Its just not fair when you dump $40-50 into a book to learn a subject then you have to spend hours figuring out how to get working examples, IF I WANTED TO LEARN THIS WAY I WOULD JUST READ THE COM DOCUMENTATION AND WRITE MY OWN EXAMPLES, I spent $45 for a reason!If it were not for the excellent writing in the first 3 chapters this book would get 1 star like most of the other programming books with flawed examples.I guess its just a money making scam, pump out the books as fast as they can regardless of quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"C++ programmmer trying to learn COM","review":"The book is riddled with errors. It's ridiculous how much time I've wasted trying to fix the author's mistakes in the code. While the content might be worthwile from an academic standpoint, the time you'll spend debugging the examples will drive you crazy. Very pool editorial quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"He is a real teacher !","review":"Think about it. If you have a knowledgeable teacher who does not know how to teach you whereas you have a normal teacher who does know how to teach you. Who would you choose ?I will choose the latter. The author of this book has both characteristics I have mentioned. He knows what his readers think when they read to a particular sentence.For instance, when the book discusses Variants data type, most readers dont care much about Unions therefore they need further explanation about it. He does.I can point out a numbers of times he know the problems of the readers.To sum up, the books and author are incredible.The next are Don Box's,Dale Rogerson's and Brent E.

I used to be a fan, but the last few books of hers that I've read have left me cold.Same here. She sets up an intriguing protagonist, Lara, and a tantalizing premise. Unfortunately, the promising start leads to a bunch of \\"Is that all there is?\\" plot developments and revelations, which try hard to be shocking but which telegraph themselves from miles away. None of the characters is plausible or sympathetic. Lara changes her mind so abruptly and often that I finished the book feeling like I'd suffered whiplash. The end left me thinking: \\"What an idiot.\\" I can only assume this isn't the reaction Oates was aiming for.I give this book two stars for the author's deftness with language. Otherwise I think her career would be better served by publishing less, not more. Take a vacation, Ms. Oates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreck","review":"If I had known this was by Joyce Carol Oates, I would not have bothered, and can't believe the reviews this book got.

Never having heard of Lauren Kelly, I was pleasently surprised (after a few pages)to realize that the author could be none other than one of my favorites... Joyce Carol Oates. I was thrilled to read another short novel by the amazing JCO. I have read all of her Rosamond Smith stories and find it truely intriguing that she has yet another alias. I only hope this means more creativity to come.

She keeps injecting these thoughts throughout that are supposed to give you a feeling of suspense but it just got annoying. She kept saying the same exact phrases over and over to the point where I just wanted to tear the book apart. I know a lot of the stuff that annoyed me was mainly to show us what the main character was like, how she was raised, and the horrible things that she had to deal with...but I just wanted her to SHUT UP. I skipped over several paragraphs because I was sick of reading the same thing so much, and I wanted this book to be over as quickly as possible.Absolutely the worst book I have ever read. HATED IT. I saw that it is selling for 18 cents on amazon...don't waste your money. No wonder this book was in the bargain bin at my local bookstore..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Trite","review":"This is one of the slowest books I have read in quite some time. I tried so hard to make it through but I just couldn't do it, I only made it about halfway through. Kelly tells the story in the 3rd person which makes it even more impersonal and dull, I just couldn't bring myself to give a damn about any of the characters! Maybe there was a story in there somewhere, but I couldn't get through enough of it to find out. Much better books out there....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Design Flaw","review":"I picked one of these up in my search for an affordable compressor.

The music was melodic across the board and funked harder than anything I've heard in a long time (check out \\"Dance for Free\\"). The guest musicians add a nice flavor to the cd but don't walk in and overpower the main vibe of the record. Big props to the production on this cd as well. Not a hair out of place, even the ones that are left to be strays. Given the junk that is filling most airwaves these days, I hope this cd gets the play it so richly deserves.PS- I hope Amazon gets some downloads on their site soon so you can hear for yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Way Funky !","review":"This is an outsatnding CD. Anyone into real raw funk will love this album. The singing is extremely soulful and the backup singing with the likes of Bonnie Rait , Bobby Womack, Sweetpea Atkinson and Aaron Neville is beyond compare. The mellower tunes are also outstanding and one tune reminds me a little of Lenny Kravitz. The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is the mix. It is heavy on the voice, bass and drums and sometimes leaves the other instruments weak. It is a shame that this record will probably never get any airplay except on college stations. Anyway my hat is off to David Letterman who brought this to my attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"I purchased this book as a Civil War buff, and I chose this book in particular as I've enjoyed Mr. Nesbitt's other works.The writing style was boring, with a slow, droning pace. Needless to say, it was a tough read,especially as he didn't leave out a single detail. And I mean, every little, trivial, inconsequential detail.More importantly, Mr. Nesbitt claims that Stuart's accusers were using flimsy, crony-based arguments against him. I found Mr. Nesbitt's defense of Stuart flimsier and tinged with more cronyism than the arguments he's trying to dispel.All in all, a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alanna Reveals She is a Girl Knight","review":"This one continues where the first left off and covers Alanna taking her Knighthood Trial, revealing herself, contacting her brother, dealing with romance (as Jonathan's Squire), and clashing with an evil sorcerer. Almost Sueish vibe -- violet eyes shared by Alanna's Goddess-given pet cat, but violet-eyed Alanna isn't always the conquering hero, especially in real combat.A quick fantasy read with a good female role model for teenagers. If parts seem simple, it's because they work well in the context of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book but what happend to Gary","review":"Great book but what happend to Gary the page who helped trainAlanna he was running even with George and Prince Jonathon to marryAlanna"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book i have ever read!!!!

I have to do a report on it for english and i have to identify the best thing in it. That's character deveolpment and conflict. I wish I was alanna.

It isn't. The plot is exciting, and the characters are engaging, but...ewww. Tamora Pierce seems to think that if you are three months into puberty and still not sleeping with someone, there is something wrong with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total BS!","review":"This book was the biggest disappointment in my life! The cliches were beyond what I had imagined! And this is written for 9-12 year olds? I fear the sexual standards this sets for them. After all if Alanna was going to do it with someone, at least do it with someone who is sincerely serious about you. I'm not going to dis out Jon here, because words cannot describe this loathesome bastard. But GOD! Don't waste your time with this regurgitated, media inspired, crap. If you want a strong, realistic, female lead go read Yukito Kishiro's Battle Angel Alita. That is actually worth your money. It's real sad that a MAN knows how to make a better heroine, than one of my fellow women."},{"rating":"2","title":"The adventure continues...","review":"Following their last adventures, Alanna and her friends continue on, Alanna not far from becoming knighted. Duke Roger, Alanna's mortal enemy, is getting more and more powerful every second, and so are Alanna's emotions. This book contains romance and for those who are wary of the love scenes, it's a part of life...deal with it...at that time, people married young and had children young. Alanna wasn't exactly a kid--so just read it! :) Great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"Having read all of Tamora Pierce's wonderful literature for children and young adults, I can say that this is still probably my favorite one. This book presents Alanna as a more interesting and adult character than the first novel, and signals the beginning of the facinating character interaction invovled in the rest of the books in this series. This novel seems by far more deliberate than the first, and is the better for it. As a 15 year-old now, I still purchase all of Tamora Pierce's novels, no matter what age group they are actually geared towards,and am a loyal fan. I do not feel that I would have the same devotion to this author's work without this book. It is truly wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does a girl have the courage to face her destiny?","review":"In The Hand of The Goddess is one of my all-time favorite books. Adventure, action, deceit, truth, magic, friends, evil,-- every thing is in this book, told in a wy to draw you into it and grab you. This book is about a girl, Alanna, disguised as a boy at court. As if that isn't hard enough, two men who have discovered her identity are determined to become her lovers. then there's Duke Roger. Every one likes him, loves him. The uncle of the prince, the greatest sorcerer alive. Charm, wit. Alanna hates him, hates him with something she cannot understand. She is a Chosen of the Great Mother Goddess. She must slay the Queen's favorite nephew, befor the Duke purposely destroys the Queen, the King, then the Prince. And after the prince the next in line for the thrown is Duke Roger. Alanna failed to act in her first book, Alanna: The First Adventure. Will she now?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lioness trilogy continues!","review":"This is only the second book in this series, but so far it is the BEST!! In this book Alanna is constantly faced with her deeply hidden fears. Duke Roger (Jon's cousin) becomes a more than signifigant character in this volume. His growing stregnths become powerly over-whelming to Alanna and could effect the whole kingdom.If you've read the first book you know what is nessicary to become a knight: the Ordeal of Knighthood. This test has trouubled Alanna ever since Jon and Gary had gone through it, and now it her turn. Last, is Alanna's consistent refusal to accept her inner feelings towards others. Even towards her good friend Myles, she shuns his fatherlike manner towards her. You also get to better know the characters you were introduced to in Alanna: the first adventure and how they have taken a life of their own. This is definately a MUST READ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL WONDERFUL GREAT GREAT A-W-S-O-M-E!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This book is great!! I love how non-sexist it is. Also tyhe frendships that accour and the Knighthood witch I love. 5 stars!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Funny, romantic, interesting, suspenseful, magical, fantastic -- what more could you ask for in a book? In my opinion, though, it's not for young readers: they probably know about sex, but that doesn't mean they have to read about it.P.S. If you like Tamora Pierce, you'll like Robin McKinley. Check her out."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lioness's Second Adventure--Highly recommended!","review":"Although not one of Pierce's best books, In the Hand of the Goddess is certainly the most memorable of the Lioness quartet.In this book, we see Alanna's personality grow and develop. She fights in her first battle, finds love, and acquires an unusual new pet along the way! The book comes to a climax with Alanna's thrilling battle with her archenemy, Duke Roger.As for the premarital sex issue, I wouldn't say it's a big deal. If children don't know what sex is by the time they're eleven or older...well, frankly, in this day and age, they SHOULD. The romance scenes between Jon and Alanna are FAR from explicit, and she even uses birth control! Parents, please get over yourselves. Chances are, your children know more about the \\"birds and the bees\\" than you think they do."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best. Simply.","review":"This is definitely the best of Tamora's books. I mean like, all of them. It's my favourite out of all of the quartet, probably because there is actually a war, while the rest of the time she is training or drifting, not really using what she learned while training to become a knight. I, personally, am glad that she fought Duke Roger, became a knight, and fought a war all in the same book. It's a book to savour."},{"rating":"2","title":"The books is the best in a great series","review":"In the Hand of the Goddess is the best of the Alanna series. It has everything: romance(i love jon), action, adventure, mystery, conspritacy(sp.), and magic.Song of the lioness is my favorite series and this is by-far Tamora Pierce's BEST!!!! I can't wait for her new series, which is going to be about alanna's daughter!If you haven't read this series at all, then you are missing out!!!I orginally read this book w/o knowing it was a series. It left me on edge and in love w/ the characters. Alanna is my favorite heroine of all time. She isn't perfect or strikingly beautiful. She is hot-tempered, funny, true to her friends, afraid to love, pretty(in my opinion), brave, and much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the 2nd part of the Lioness quartret and is thrilling.","review":"I think that its a really wonderful book. I've read this book like 6 times already its my favorite part. I hate George for breaking Alanna and Jon apart. think that they both belong to each other and George is a nut to contend with someone as goodlooking as Jonathan. If I were Alanna I would stay in the Palace with Jonathan for the rest of my life.I think that Jonathan is much more worthy than George for Alanna. After all whom did she love first Jonathan or George.Duh the answer is obvious."},{"rating":"2","title":"I HATE PEOPLE THAT HATE THIS BOOK","review":"Now, if you don't like this book, I suggest you see a psychiatrist, a doctor, or the floor after a 60 foot long drop. This books was filled with action, fun, humor, deep internal questioning (just kidding), and great characters. So there you stupid people! Although I played a small part in this book, I thought I added a great deal of character and enigmatic thoughts. By the way, I have now graduated from the City of the Gods, and you should be able to find me in your locall graveyard. If you need any supernatural help, just call. FAREWELL! (not)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Power of a Goddess","review":"A world of mystery and adventure awaits in the sequel to Tamora Pierce's first book Alanna, The First Adventure. This sequel titled In the Hand of the Goddess has plenty of mystery and suspense to keep the reader interested and never bored. Alanna comes to learn that her feelings are changing towards the people she cares about, especially the prince Jonathan who found out that she was a girl. Tamora Pierce did an excellent job in creating this piece of literature. The first book was very exciting and the second book was just as adventurous. This book is great for anyone to read, and I believe it is one of the greatest books of all times."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was fine, not great, I expected better","review":"I had been dying to read this book since I read Alanna, the first adventure. When I got it I found it more than a little disappointing. Alanna seemed to have had a major personality transplant.What happened to her anti-guy attitude? I mean I expected her to grow out of it but it would have been nice if she could have done it slowly. Instead she took this major age jump from 12 to 15.The plot was predictible and I wouldn't have finished it if I hadn't grown to care about the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please read this if you have a good imagination!","review":"This book, the second in the Lioness series, is in my opinion the best. I first read the series when I was in yr 7 at school [aged about 12] and it instantly captured my interest as I had been reared by my mother on fairy tales and Tolkein as far back as I can remember.Alanna is in many ways the perfect female role model for young girls; they can identify with her problems and moral situations as well as wish to aspire to be as determined and go-getting as her.But on a completely different level, these books are FUN!! easy reading for all ages with an enchanting and unashamedly fantastic style; the kind of book you read as a girl and then re-discover 5 years later when clearing out your room. It's like finding an old friend! re-reading the Lioness series is delightfully nostalgic."},{"rating":"2","title":"NEATO!","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. After I borrowed the first one from a friend I couldn't wait to read this one. Even though this one was not as good as the first(sequals hardly ever are anyway)it kept me interested. I really enjoyed the interaction between Faithful and Alanna and the romance was a plus."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"Oh, I love this book! In my opinion it is the best of the Alanna series, although the others are excellent also: I love Alanna, her friends, the adventure, Tortall, and the romance, etc. The author lets us really get to know the Alanna, which was nice. It is very well written and a lovely reread on a rainy day. Highly recommended (and much better than \\"Circle\\" which I didn't enjoy)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for young adults","review":"This is a really good book, but I rated it with four stars because she does some bad things. It doesn't describe to much but a young child shouldn't read that part. Other wise the book is really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just SKIP THIS ONE","review":"I really thought this book was going to go somewhere and as I got closer to the end, I was waiting for a great climax to the story. I was definitely disappointed in the end. Everything just kind of peters out and falls flat. I won't sum up the story .. that has been done before. However, I will say that I thought the book had some promise but after closing the cover I realized it was just an exercise in futility for me. All in all ... kinda blah."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book in the Lioness Quartet series!","review":"I loved this book! If there is any of Tamora Pierce's books that I read over and over again, it's this one. The sheer enjoyability and good reading in this is comparable to triple fudge chocolate cake. I'm not sure quite how she does it, but she adds a sort of mystical flavour to all her books, and this one in particular is great. When I finished reading this, I felt like I had devoured a really good meal. :) Perhaps not intellectually stimulating... but this book does seem to have a quality to it that is simple, yet intelligent... a lesson in every day people politics."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazingly awesome novel","review":"I think that this is one of the most enchanting books of all time. I also love the rest of the series, and Tamora Pierce's other books. In the Hand of the Goddess is an amazingly awesome book for anyone looking for a great book about magic, war, love, and a young girl. I love the contrast of excitment and romance that blossoms inside the pages of this book, and I must say that this is one of the coolest books that I have ever read. It is definitly a favorite, and a great addition to any collection. I think that everyone should at least try reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of the Series","review":"I think that of all the Song of the Lioness series, this book is the best. In the first book, Alanna is mainly getting settled in and making friends. In books three and four, she's wandering around and doing good deeds. I like this book because it has a very strong plot, and you really know what's going on. Now that Alanna is used to the castle and all the people, she starts following up on some of her suspicions, and she struggles even more with trying to disguise the fact that she's a girl. This is also the book where she starts to see some people as more than just friends. I love all of the Tortall books, and I think that this is really the best of them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was awesome!","review":"I loved when Alana went into the ordeal of knighthood and had to face all of her fears. I'd say this book overall was the best book I have ever read. This book was action packed. I couldn't stop reading it. I recommend this book to anybody who likes to read about battles and adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good golly! These series are wonderful!","review":"We need more stars! These books are absolutley fantastic. All my friends at school are hooked on them, I definetly recomend them to anyone. Even though the books are written are written for a younger audience, I recomen them to people of all ages.

I'd prefer NO sex in my YA novels, and certainly not sex after 3 kisses! I'm very sad to have such good books ruined in this way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review by me","review":"I really like all of the books in the Song of The Lioness Quartet. This was an excellent book in my oppinion. It had a very good plot. It's all about how Alanna (Alan) is dressing as a boy and trying to win the right to be a knight. In this book I found that it covered a vast amount of things that could happen in war, treachery, along with a touch of romance and other such complications. There was one review where the reviewer mentioned that the romance between Jonathan and Alanna was a bit odd. As she said, you don't just sleep with someone just 3 minutes after you realize you like him. But, as the reveiwer did not add, that's the way Tamora Peirce is, slight hints and then a huge love scene (if you don't believe me, read the last book in the Immortals seires). Anyway, it was a great book and I'd suggest it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book I loved","review":"...The story unfolds well, with dramatic twists and turns and a wide range of oppositions.

I like Scott, he's my third favorite Kid, but somehow the \\"Buddy\\" character just needs his vocal delivery to work.

I normally refill my green tanks to no more 65-75% full and mark the green tanks with a fill date and will toss it after three refills. Reason is I don't know how many times the canister can take the constant refilling pressure and or how long the valves will hold. I had some canister distortions and valve leakage from the forth fill up @ 75% fill cap..These canisters were not designed to be refilled. I feel three times is pushing it so they get discarded after the third fill. Just check the valve for leakage after filling them to no more then 65-75% of full, just not worth the risk of getting a few more ounces into the green tanks.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work as I expected","review":"I bought the unit figuring that I would attach my 20 pound propane tank to the 1 pound canister and open the valve and that the pressure differential between the two would result in the one pound canister filling up to one pound, but after a few seconds of gas moving from one to the other it stops and only about .25 pounds of propane moves into the smaller container.

Because the propane will run down into a cold space from a warmer larger tank better. Attach this adapter to your 1 lb tank, then attach the other end to your larger tank. Then invert the whole thing and open the valve on the larger tank. The propane will run down into the smaller tank.Any air or gas inside your 1 lb tanks will be trapped there. There is no gas release on this system.I found the whole process to take more time and be more work then it was worth.

The main body of \\"Ext. night\\" are soft, atmospheric synth sounds, overlaid by spare electric guitar textures which veer between growing more prominent and calming down again. That makes for relaxing, effortless listening, yet the music never gels into something distinctive and remains too static. Without any rhythmic accompaniment and fully developed melodies, \\"Ext. night\\" can only be considered as background music, but given that ambient music has made a great leap forward in the '90s - with bands like Autechre, Main, or Seefeel - that is a disappointment.

With no god or cavalry charge to save him, he cooly blasts an assortment of desert urchin to kingdom come. The surf guitar soundtrack and deadly dramatic gunfighting served to take the western to a place John Wayne never could have imagined. The second of three westerns Clint would make with Italian director Sergio Leone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The sequel to A Fistful of Dollars.","review":"The man with no name returns in this sequel which is better then it's predecessor. Clint shares the spotlight with Lee Van Cleef in this superb western. Watch out for the excellent ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Clint and Lee Show","review":"This is the only Sergio Leone film released in America worth your time, and the attraction has nothing to do with anything Leone put in it. The script is the same kind of brainless, illogical mishmash Sergio brewed all his swill from. It's Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef who salvage the whole thing. By the mid-60's these two had put in a decade and a half in the Hollywood studio system and bring every bit of that long experience to their scenes together. They have economy and humor that's great to watch, even in this tripe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great western","review":"Another great Clint Easwood western. There's really not much I can say. It's just a great movie that all western movie fans need to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, single disc DVD not as great","review":"In my opinion, this is the best of the Eastwood-Leone westerns. No point in going over the content, as other reviewers have already done so. Unfortunately, the single disc DVD is not enhanced for widescreen TVs, so if you have a 16x9 set, the image won't fill the screen. There is a 2-disk British edition available from Amazon UK (or EBay)which is far better than this one: it's enhanced for widescreen TVs, the picture and sound have been restored and cleaned up, there's a commentary and some featurettes (and it gets 5 stars). If your DVD player can play Region 2 discs, THAT'S the version to have. We were supposed to get this in the USA in fall 2005, but after Sony bought the MGM film library, they dropped it from their fall releases and I've heard of no plans to release it, or \\"Fistful of Dollars\\" or \\"Fistful of Dynamite,\\" all of which received similar upgrades. Let's hope Sony changes their mind about that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is the soundtrack fixed?","review":"The first issue of this DVD had the soundtrack out of synch with the film. Has anyone played this release yet (6/2001)?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning about the DVD!","review":"The DVD's I bought and saw had a voice soundtrack that was horribly out of sync to the point of ruining the movie. I don't see that anyone else mentioned it, but both copies I've seen had the same defect."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Sound Out of Sync with Picture","review":"The sound is out of sync with the picture on all copies of this DVD, so every gunshot is ruined; people are supposed to die AFTER the shot is heard, not before. Since all the shooting is one of the best things about this movie and is messed up, the DVD is unwatchable(to me). The beating scene is also ruined; Manco & Mortimer keep reacting before you hear them get hit. The picture-quality is impressive, though. The movie itself is a classic, though much better when watched as part of The Dollars Trilogy.UPDATE: This review was for the one-disc version. Now there's a \\"2-Disc Collector's Edition\\" that fixes the problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"A top ten western of all time, let alone among Clint movies","review":"This is one of the top ten westerns of all time, let alone top Clint Eastwood westerns. Everything comes together, in a perfect confluence of melodramatic music, cinematography, and characterization. Sure, the bad guys are cardboard cut-outs of villains (except for Indio, who is truly unique and insane), except to the umpteenth degree. I thought the plot was original---a bank safe hidden in plain sight in the bank, inside a specially-built cabinet, that Indio learns about from his cell-mate (whom he promptly butchers during his jail escape)...an older bounty hunter, seemingly out to compete with Mango (Clint) for the rewards, but ultimately, only in it to avenge the death of his sister at Indio's hands. Very textured, powerful film. I'll never tire of watching this. And the last Clint quote of the movie tops any of his famous quotes (\\"No problem, old man...thought I was having trouble with my adding...it's alright now.\\")Brilliant"},{"rating":"1","title":"soundtrack is not in synch","review":"I bought the \\"Man With No Name Trilogy\\" and the soundtrack for this DVD is greatly out of synch.

The picture quality is very good for such an older release and the sound, while not as good as newer films, sounds much better than it did on DVD.

Mortimer, \\"His name is ... Manco\\" along with the cut to Manco walking into the town of White Rocks. Sound synchronization doesn't seem to be a problem as reportedly has been the case with the initial release of this DVD, though with a movie as heavily dubbed as this one is to begin with, it's hard to tell for sure. [Others have] mentioned some frames were missing from the scene where Manco and Mortimer are being beaten up by Indio's gang. I'm sorry to report that this is true; they don't even show where Indio suddenly stops laughing and orders his men to stop the beatings. They cut to where he tells his gang what he plans to do with Manco and Mortimer."},{"rating":"1","title":"For a Few Dollars More","review":"Hands down this was the worst download of ALL TIME!!!! I have ben watching the no name movies for so long I don't notice the little things that some claim take away from the quality of this movie genre.

However this movie is the worst I have ever seen after making the purchase and downloading it under the assumption it was viewable.

It's more of a look and consideration of the people that comprise Wicca, on the whole, across the boudnaries of various Traditions. It's a look at the general mindset and philosophies of those apt to call themselves a Witch/Wiccan. Personally, I'd strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in/exploring Wicca as it's light on the intracacies of ritual practice/magic and heavy on the general mindset of those often drawn to it.

Some say they crammed too many songs on here, but I don't think so. If I could only have one cd by connie, this would be it. (even though its two) All of her classics and the best version of \\"jealous heart\\" I've ever heard. Top notch recording and sound quality make this a no brainer.

Another hodge podge of hits that can be found on SO many compilations that have come out of the US.

While RS would reminisce about the heddy days of 60s and 70s rock, Spin exposed the exciting and original artists of the 80s and 90s. Today, Spin reads like a stilted and biased advertisement for corporate rock. Nothing is fair and balanced here: If Spin slammed you a decade ago, you'll be slammed with every mention in the future. Conversely, Spin would have you believe that Radiohead and Coldplay were the Second Coming with they way they're exalted with every breath. No pun intended, but Spin plays like a broken record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spin doesn't spin","review":"Spin magazine has gotten a lot less cutting edge.

They must have the greatest time just sitting around finding how many contradictory adjectives they can tag onto useless music and still manage to say nothing. They sound like cyber-nerds who need to get out a little more and stop getting thier info from mtv.com.

But if you want information about innovative developments or noteworthy achievements in recorded music, you will rarely find it in the pages of SPIN.

The photography, which used to be fantastic, is now sub-par and lifeless--with a cheap, barely trying aesthetic that seems to be everywhere these days (if you're looking for comparisons, think those Calvin Kline TV commercials from about five years back that got them into so much trouble). As far as the bands they now cover, they seem to be taking their queues from MTV (where you can scarcely find a video anymore). And there is so much filler and non-music related material, you might forget that you're reading a MUSIC magazine. Even the record reviews have changed--SPIN is a LOT more generous with the 8, 9, and 10 ratings than they used to be. The focus of their reviews now seems to be moving product--why I have no idea. Bob Guccione Jr. is sorely missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Irrelevant.","review":"Really.

Another reviewer was right on the money: line your bird cage with this waste paper. Spin may have started out catering to the underground, but now they're basically a slightly less hip Rolling Stone. Don't you love it when companies start producing the same product as their rivals just to stay in competition? At least, that was probably the strategy over there at Spin, whether anyone there wants to admit it or not.Too bad, because the popularity of bands like Radiohead or Gorillaz plainly shows that there is a market for more different music. Of course, they'll still put Radiohead on the cover, if only because of a desperate need to appear \\"cutting edge\\".

It's the writing, mostly pretty stupid photographs and record reviews that don't excite me. In my opinion, a better magazine supposed to cover similar ground is \\"Under the radar\\".

It has very few options in this category. I wanted to be able to upload one image every minute or less even. It can either do it continously or you can set up a schedule or times (to do it continously). On the FAQ there is an area that looks like there is some extra menus for doing a manual setup. Guess what? Those menus are not included in the actual firmware you get with this product. I upgraded to the latest firmware version, hoping it would be there, but this changed nothing in the options.If you just want a camera for network security to be monitored remotely or from inside your network, this will work, although its quality is NOT that good. Id recommend even the bottom of the line Axis cameras as their picture quality is much better.If you are looking for a camera with a good ftp upload client like I was go with Stardot. They are more costly but they are twice the camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused About Sampler Pack","review":"I ordered this sampler pack of instant soups and it was delivered very promptly. (arrived within 2 days)The confusing thing is that I'm not sure what I received in the package. I was expecting some instructions and/or information in English..... but everything on the packaging is in Japanese. Unfortunately I live in an area of Pennsylvania where there is no Japanese population.The package contained a total of 22 small packets in eight various sized strips .... two packs(4 strips), three packs(2 strips), and four pack (2 strips).I have no idea what is in the packets or how to prepare them. I assume that they are various kinds of instant soup.Do I combine them?Is each packet a complete soup mix?Does this represent 22 servings?Your guess is as good as mine.

This was a good idea, as it happens. At first glance it seemed good but upon further investigation, I was baffled by Moses' still lifes, which seem to hover in space with no visible means of support, and her flowers, which often have a spattery, abstract look. Her use of salt for textured snow is heavy handed and distracting.On the other hand, I applaud Moses' generous use of the last portion of her book as a showcase for her students and their work. And her friendly, encouraging style of writing would be helpful for beginning painters.I did like some of Moses' paintings. But the more experienced artist would be better served with Marilyn Simandle's \\"Capturing Light in Watercolor\\" for advice on creating strong compositions. And if you want to paint bricks and building elements, skip Moses' scanty two-page explanation of this subject and see Richard Taylor's excellent \\"A Watercolorist's Guide to Painting Buildings.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"An Appaling Book","review":"This book is the worst I have ever seen for learning to paint in watercolors!

If the 2nd edition was bad, this one is slightly better, but it is still a hard book to put into practice. Half of the stuff discussed in this book is not used by professional translators, and it is targeted towards students whose 1st language is English, not Spanish. So for a person like me, taking a Spanish course in translation, the book doesn't work. Unfortunately I don't know if there's a book written in Spanish about this topic, so that's what the professor assigned. (and he's from Spain... go figure!) The student will learn quite a bit of new terms related to the translation business, but that's about it.

These were hardened men from a way of life growing up in the old west,where survival was a reliable .44 - where violence was just an ordinary daily routine, and the women were mainly the Ladies of the night of local saloons. The music,the unique music scores in these spaghetti's always seem to fit in with each scene,giving it that western feel ,kind of like,\\"ghost riders in the sky\\",although some scores should have been shot,and there's always the \\"go for the gold\\" plot,just remember \\"A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS\\",started it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant western","review":"This is the first Spaghetti western and a superb film.

Jimbo!","review":"The opening credit montage heralds something new and exciting. A majestic Ennio Morricone score played over silhouettes of cowboys and the sound of gunshots. What follows doesn't fail to disappointment. Director Sergio Leone reimagines the West with a flavor unknown in these parts. Star Clint Eastwood,at the time wallowing on TV's \\"Rawhide\\", presents a new archetype with his drifter whose motives are unknown. He wanders into a lawless Mexican town playing two warring crime families against each other. His intentions aren't so much altruistic rather it involves a profit motive. This film is unlike anything that came before it and influenced generations to come. Quentin Tarantino's \\"Kill Bill-Volume 2\\" is one example of Leone's influence. So what if Leone cribbed Kurasawa's story. In this case imitation is the best form of flattery. Both Leone and Sam Peckinpah reinvigorated a genre that may have been on it's death bed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor copy of a great movie","review":"This is a must-have for any lover of the western, especially the updated 60s version produced by Sergio Leone. This is his first production, followed by For A Few Dollars More, and The Good, The Bad, The Ugly, and culminating in Once Upon A Time In The West. These films are great art, although many will disdain the high testosterone level and iconic character portrayal. (Not to mention flagrant sexism and latent misogyny.)This DVD copy of the film is very poor. While the video quality is acceptable, the audio is not adequately tracked to the video, causing a Japanese monster-movie effect and requiring the viewer to avoid looking at the actors' lips. This DVD also has no bonus features. It is a basic and careless reproduction. One hopes that someday, someone will reproduce this movie in DVD with more care and features, such as was done with Once Upon A Time In The West. But until then, there is this DVD, which at least was fairly inexpensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was the worst movie i have ever seen!","review":"A Fistful of Dollars was the worst movie i have ever seen.

This is a western for semi-literates who can't connect with real people or the world around them and so prefer to inhabit a place like Leone Land. Nobody you know lives there, just a race of moronic stereotypes; there's the constant scream of ersatz opera in your ears from the crazy soundtrack; and the director rubs your nose in endless closeups of his repellant cast and dares you to find some plot in their aimless comings and goings. To his credit, Eastwood fulfilled his three picture deal with Leone and never worked with him again. Anybody with a taste for good films will quickly see why the actor was sick of the clam sauce."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Like the Movie, what of the seller and media?","review":"One of my favorite movies (along the the others in the set).

It came in a non-shrink wrapped box, and the DVD has no label on it which makes me think that the disc was copied from another one. DVD played fine though and the price was good and shipping was good, (3 days from order placement to product in my DVD player).The movie itself is slightly grainy and has voice synch issues in many spots with sound to lips being a bit off.But all in all, an enjoyable experience and I can live with the dollar savings for what I received.Hail Flavius!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My mistake, four coffins","review":"A Fistful of Dollars DVDA Fistful of Dollars is the second in Sergio Leone's spaghetti western movies about the \\"Man with No Name\\" following For A Few Dollars More .

This movie is the first in wonderful series of movies by Sergio Leone starring Clint Eastwood as the \\"Man with no name\\"(even though he had a name in all three movies).

I believe all strategists know that these unstable regimes might be tempted to blow the planet up if they are going down the drain. Hitchcock tries to bring Bible readings as a justification for showing the end of the world. I believe any philosophy colored by religious fundamentalism causes problems in the world. Hitchcock might have a PhD in religion, but I feel he does not understand the Mideast enough to write a valid, scholarly work that would make strategists understand the problem of nuclear weapons better. This is a book written stating the undesireability of Iran getting nuclear weapons with some scripture thrown in.This is not a well thought out book. There are better books out there to understand the crisis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! A Must Read!!","review":"This book was the fourth book I read by Mark Hitchcock. I have never been disappointed with his books and this one is no exception. He ties the current crisis with what could happen in the near future as predicted in the Bible. It's the only way to clearly understand what is happening today and what may well happen in the near future.My only disagreement with the author is that he believes Babylon in Revelation 17 and 18 is the city in Iraq that is rebuilt there. I disagree with that view as I believe Babylon in the end times (Revelation 17 & 18) is a reference to Rome. Space does not permit why I believe it's Rome but that is what I believe.The slight disagreement I have doesn't take away from recommending this book. I liked it so much and read it in one day.

Teachers do not remain with the class during library time and help the librarian. It is their plan time. This book gives a librarian role and teacher role for each lesson. Research skills occur more at the middle and high school levels. Teachers usually bring the class during their regular class time so they remain with the students. That is when collaboration can occur.I also found the activities and worksheets to be boring and unimaginative.

It was actually HELPFUL for teens just starting high school too. It usually takes me a while to read it not like other magazines that i get through in 15 minutes. Teen Vogue is so expensive i just read regular look at fashion ideas. I also like the mail page you can read other girls opinions about past stories. A great magazine. ALSO can't wait for the show on mtv!"},{"rating":"2","title":"getting old...","review":"My favorite thing about seventeen magazine is the health, your life, and seventeen buzz section. All the fashion stuff I can live without; they always have things like 'petite' or 'tall' I don't need that garbage, heelloo not all girls fit into your specific categorites seventeen!! I also feel like the issues lately have been terrible, like they're running out of ideas. I miss the old issues. I think one good thing about it is that lately they've featured new cover stars instead of contstantly repeating the same celebrities. I still like the magazine and the stories and articles, I wish they would step up their game though and this is a good magazine for girls ages 15+, definitely not for 12 year olds because it contains sexual content sometimes, my cousin subscribes now she's 12 I think it's ridiculous but it's all up to you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seventeen is more for preteens...","review":"I think Seventeen has changed a lot since I started subscribing to it 3 years ago. There used to be a stronger focus on fashion and beauty, but now there's a lot of quizzes and articles that aren't very helpful. Now that I'm almost 18, it doesn't have the same kind of appeal for me anymore. Despite the magazine title, I think it's become more geared toward younger teenagers, ages 12-16. I wouldn't recommend Seventeen to someone over 16. If you're under 15 or 16, it's still a great magazine to read and you should definitely try it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok Maybe I am just 15 going on 21..","review":"I am only 15, which is a targeted age group to \\"seventeen\\" but it lost it's appeal when I was 12! It's so young and immature, but the ironic thing is that I, too, am young and immature. I just got new interests, eclectic tastse, and my own sense of \\"style\\".But if you are still stuck on having to be \\"in\\", listen to what's \\"in\\" and wear what's \\"in\\", then seventeen is for you. It's all about the \\"in\\" thing in today's teen girl society. Quite frankly, I am not up for reading about those poser punks like gc and avril (who doesn't know who the clash is!) all the \\"twinkies\\" (steryotypical teen girls) listen to and I'm not up for reading articles and what new pair of blue denim flares are in for the season.Have denim flares even changed since I last read seventeen- no!! Hence.......Seventeen is a redundant magazine that you'll enjoy before you've really gotten a sense of self."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR ME","review":"I thought I might like this magazine better than cosmo because it wouldn't have so much about sex in it, but this magazine is starting to contain more sexual content. I've never been much for fashion and make-up either. I just don't like girly magazines!Update: My subscription expired 1/1/11 according to Amazon, yet I am still receiving the magazine. I am not on auto-renewal (Amazon specifically says 1-year and that it is expired as of 1/1/11) and I never sent in any of the renewal forms the magazine sent me, so as of now I am getting free magazines. They better not stick me with a bill later!"},{"rating":"2","title":"YESSS","review":"I love this magazine, mostly the August & September. They came out with there new one i love it You can get taller & skinnier in 2 weeks. Actually look but it still great. Im updated with celeb gossip, im updated with the HOTTEST fall fashions! I just love this magazine, you got everything. Funny stories, coupons, freebies, etc. I never won a freebie but im still trying (i been for 4 months). So this is a great magazine for a 13-20 year old girl. Great for a gift so subscribe today!! =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"nOt sHaLLoW","review":"i have been subscribed to Seventeen Mag. for 2 years now.. and i do agree that some issues are a little... small.. but i also think that a lot of the articles are inspirational, and have real meaning. The other stuff like the quizes, and the fashion stuffs are just additives. i personally love them.. because they help me know what to look for when i go shopping.. so if you are a girl that likes real meaning in her life while still <at least tryinG> to look GREAT.. this is the magazine for U!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Closing the Generation Gap--Seventeen Magazine Perfect Gift for Teenage Granddaughter","review":"When I saw the great bargain Amazon.com offered for Seventeen Magazine, I remembered how much I loved to read it when I was a teenager....a great gift for my 16-year old granddaughter who lives half way across the country. The first issue arrived, as a surprise. After reading the entire magazine in one sitting, she called to thank me and tell me how much she loves Seventeen Magazine. Second surprise for her--the subscription is for two-years. A great way to close the generation gap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best, but not all that bad","review":"I have to admit I like looking at the nice pictures and cute bags and so on. But who really really goes out and buys them? The whole reason is just for looking. I mean, some people have lives. They can't spend their lives going around following the magazine-trend and shopping. I like the clothes and everything, but it's a little pricey. I love the little articles like \\"Trauma Rama\\" or such. I don't really like the shallow-ish articles saying \\"Look! She's 17! And she's cool!\\" Those are redunadant (blah blah blah). But overall, I like wasting my time reading a mag at home, but not shopping for overpriced outfits and make up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one!!","review":"I started reading this magazine around 12 years old - then it was pretty interesting to me and appropiate for my age. Now that I am seventeen - the age that the magazine is supposed to be for- I have completely lost interest. This magazine paints teenage girls as materialistic, self-absorbed, and boy crazy. YES, we can be that, but for most of us, there is a lot more going on. If you've got more on your mind then whether \\"boys like you?\\" and what color glitter to wear this season I recommend SELF magazine. It deals with everything that is important to a young woman (including beauty stuff). If you don't believe me check it out at the market!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey, why not just order a free abrocombie catalog!","review":"This magazine really blows. There are virtually zero interesting articles. Want stars? If you dont like who is on the cover you are out of luck, because there is nothing else. Want boys? None. But its a teen magazine. hmmm... I usually just like looking at these magazine for light, fun reading...but there is really nothing. But hey! If you want perfect skin, turn to page five where there is an ad for loreal. wow thanks. a catalog of ugly clothes and one article about jessica simpson, which they even manage to make boring. and *gasp* see the NEWEST fall fashion! Oh my gosh! boha girl is in! and then 50 pages of ads. Please, seventeen is the most hyped up and worst magazine i have ever subscribed to. it is not 'mature'and i really dont get why ANYONE likes it. just save yourself money and order a free abrocrobie catalog or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vapid and Shallow","review":"This magazine is for the stereotypical teenage girl whose only concerns are makeup, boys, and (of course!) celebrities. The Lizzie Mcguire girl whose mind has never considered any ideas more significant than this season's newest shade of lip gloss or the cutest guy in math class. This is the written equivelant of cotton candy: fluffy, weightless, and cavity-provoking. Only with Seventeen, the cavity is in your brain, not your teeth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent","review":"This magazine used to have nothing but ads. Well, they have cut down some of the ads and the meaningful articles. Every once in a while I come across a reall good interview, such as the one on Alicia Keys, and Ashanti however, this mag doesn't offer much more. There are plenty of quizzes and such. Overall a decent magazine for the preteens."},{"rating":"1","title":"My daughter likes this mag when it comes","review":"Order and got for 4 or 5 issues. Then my daughter tried to sign up for a contest, missed where it was signing her up for a year subscription (for double the price) we canceled the unwanted subscription, but that seems to have canceled the valid one.Interestingly they never sent the promised new one or old one, but got tons of email and physical bills.Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"DELIVERY DATE DISASTER!!!","review":"I was informed that I would receive this subscription between the dates of Dec. 21-Dec.24, which was perfect, because I had planned it as a surprise Christmas gift for my niece. Unfortunately, and obviously, the item has not arrived to her address as of yet, and Christmas has come and gone. Economically, times are difficult for me. So, this is the only gift I purchased for her, and she felt awful when there was no gift from me. However, I felt much more awful than she did! After logging into my account, I have come to see that the delivery date of this package has been changed to Jan 6th! I am irate about this, because I never even received a notice of this change! I learn from my mistakes. So, obviously, I will never order another magazine subscription via amazon.com."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift for Granddaughter","review":"This was a gift for my granddaughter. She asked for it again for Christmas this year. She looks forward to this every month. She loves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get billed an extra $10 the next month after your subscription 'begins'","review":"The bill says \\"thank you for your recent subscription to Seventeen Magazine.

If corrections are needed, just mark them on your invoice above and return it with your payment in the envelope provided....Payment due 1/05/13\\". I had gotten this from Amazon for my twins birthday in late October. As suggested I went to the website where I could access our account using the account number on the invoice. There is a place to enter credit card information but no where to correct the invoice or ask why the extra charge.

Then I read the covers of the 10 or so magazines sampled. Paleeeeeeease!\\"How to get a great butt\\" \\"how to have perfect skin\\" \\"how to get a great body\\" 95% of the cover headlines were about meeting the beaty ideal. Oh, yeah, there was the headline about how to \\"flirt the right way\\" and how to be a random hot guy's \\"regular hook up.\\" I guess those are the more substantive articles.It's amazing how the magazine has made such strides since when I was a teen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Editor","review":"I often find it hard to buy a teen magazine because there are a lot of redundant articles and trashy topics. However, Seventeen has a great new editor now who is really representing today's girls. I appreciate the new direction she has taken the magazine- less trash, more health,less boy stories, more faith. This magazine still has shopping and fashion and everthing we oodle over, but it also has some quality. I would recommend 17 over the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seventeen is not just another stupid mag for teens","review":"I found this magazine because one of my favorite actresses was on it- I know, sallow sorta-. I bought this magazine pretty much because she was on it. I now understand this is an amazing magazine. It focuses on real problems for teenage girls from the ages of 13-20. It has real stories, stuff about the celebrities and how we can learn from them, and some fashion. It has a great mixture, which makes for a great magazine. With it's realistic topics and amazing fashion- which it affordable! - It makes for a great magazine to just sit down and read for advice on many things girls need some help on. I think this is a very well rounded magazine with hope for others out there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best teen mag out there!","review":"It is the best.

There is something for everyone, from AMAZING fashion and beauty articles that cater to girls of all skin colors and body types to scintillating stories on politics, health, and issues that affect real girls, such as teen pregnancy and eating disorders. The sex articles are for older girls only, but they do offer some sobering thoughts (read the \\"Hook-Up Report\\" in the July 2005 issue and you'll know what I mean.) It promotes self esteem and isn't all about how to attract boys, like its slightly less mature counterpart, Girls Life. It shows all sides of a variety of touchy issues. I recomend Seventeen to all girls of all races, creeds, and political standings."},{"rating":"2","title":"A matured magazine","review":"Seventeen is a magazine for teens, and it offers advice on love, friendship, having a fun time, and life in general. Not to mention the great price, Seventeen is an all time favorite.I have been a subscriber to Seventeen for 4 years, and there have only been 1 or 2 issues that I had no interest in. Since 4 years ago, Seventeen has matured beautifully. It's not all about fashion and boys and having a body of a supermodel. As a matter of fact, it shows you to love your body, and to love your life, and to IMPROVE it, not CHANGE it drastically.The layout of the pages are well organized and the color schemes fit well with topics. On their main site, if you have the magazine, you can enter every day for a contest, and even a contest for the first 1,000 to enter on the 17th. Creative, beautiful, and it helps teens to see what life is really all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Happend?","review":"Seventeen used to be great. Stuff about make up and evrything like that. It used to be really thick a lotta content. Now all Seventeen talks about is college and more college. It's still an okay magazine. It mentions good clothes and make up and has good interviews, but it used to be better. There isn't a lot of real life stories. I used to like it better. It's too short with everything now. There's not a lot about make up and fashion and mostly about college. But it's an okay magazine."},{"rating":"1","title":"my opinion","review":"Seventeen (is bad)!

Its still a good deal but I paid $5 for the year to begin with and I got emails of $5 subscriptions on magazines before it was time for mine to renew. So I figured it would renew for around that price so I didn't think twice about it. That was until I saw my bank statement and it was more then twice the price I originally paid. I will cancel after this year and renew it myself when I see a deal I like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never got my magazine","review":"I bought the subscription in June of this year and I waited all of August to get my first copy, the one with the Jenner sisters on it and I never got it.

I emailed the publication company through a link Amazon provided me and they told me they'd fix it, but nothing was ever done."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like Seventeen","review":"Honestly, I'm 19 and I still read seventeen. I've read it since I was 15 and it's always been the same. I like the freebies and coupons, I laugh at the traumaramas, read my horoscope and roll my eyes at their flirting advice. It's all good fun. I have to admit their new-er sections, the freshman 15 and the beauty smarties are nice. I hope to one day join both. The Freshman 15 give real advice about college and that's cool and the beauty smarties are okay. It's the same basic, overrated chicks you see on YT, but every now and then you see a chick with some actual makeup skill that knows what she's doing and makes you want to try it. Other than that, most the tips are pretty lame and obvious and the celebrity sections are boring with the same lame celebs. Luckilu, Seventeen isn't that expensive. Mine was $5 for a year. My next subscription was free, so I continue to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suprised","review":"I thought I was a mature 17 year old when I was that age. Wow how times have changed.

But the second issue that came was just sitting on the counter, begging to be read. I picked it up and started reading and found that the magazine had a lot to offer, not just for mechanical geeks like my husband, but technology geeks like myself. I found that the articles were not just geared towards men - which is sometimes difficult to find in magazines like these - and that the articles weren't written in techno-babble so they were easy to understand.I just ordered 2 more years of the subscription, we've liked it so much!

I like that they keep a couple of cars for a number of months and tell you how they're doing over time. I also enjoy articles that help you understand the basics of scientific developments, like a recent article on the science of fusion energy.

The 2008 announcement was more in-depth than this article.The backyard inventions article featured a spokeless bicycle from Yale.

The longer ones, which strive to be informative, are aimed at teen-age or younger readers. Even the ads are crumby. I am always interested in reviews of new automobiles.

There is always something interesting for everyone. Each issue covers topics ranging from cars and tools to gardening and cooking utensils. Aliens? covered.

In my opinion there is a severe lack substance, depth and are in general poorly organized. Articles are diluted and peppered with ads right in the middle of the text...organization is atrocious. As an adult, you'd think you'd be able to push through it and get it read. Then I realized I shouldn't be doing this. You'll start reading an article of great interest and you just fade out in frustration. Also, the magazine has a political agenda that is disheartening when the focus is and should be DIY and product education. It's just not worth it anymore, so I cancelled my subscription and will have to find something else.

I agree that PM gives a good overview of tech stuff and its great to have the advice columns for us home and auto owners. I find, though, the mag is too technical at times- it echoes the all too common tendency of many companies to focus on features and not on ease of use or simplicity of the product. Tech for its own sake, in other words. They often write about \\"fantasy inventions\\"- things that would not work in the real world, e.g an underwater house- how would you deal w/barnacles? They also make a big deal over \\"patriotic\\" events which seem too bureacratic to be in this mag.

You don't see a lot of girls rapping in the music scene so anytime I hear one, I am filled with envy and admiration. Another attractive about this duo is that it's a boy/girl duo, that's not very common, and it's cool how well it works out though. The purpose of their music is to send out messages, some that you can relate to. If they could be promoted more on national radio, they could have a bright future for them to represent the Asian American community in the American music industry.

The Mattress Remedy arrived quickly, and I followed the instructions, getting it placed and inflated. I inflated while my wife was on the mattress, so she could tell how firm it was getting. Got it to where she was comfortable, and after I got on it, it kinda moved around. We keep feeling like we where going to roll off the bed. If we let some air out to solve that problem, then it was not comfortable anymore. We tried different amounts of air, but could not find that comfort spot we where hoping for. After three nights of trying, I had to return for a refund. I guess maybe it would work under the right circumstances, but we gave up.

It made my lower back worse(we bought this in hopes that it would add support to the lower back which it does not!). The pump came apart before we could even get it pumped up.

I overinflated and felt like I was ona wobble board so we let a lot of air out. But after all that.....a good night's sleep!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of time and money","review":"If you want to watch hours of training films from the 30s, 40s, and 50s, from the Air Force, Navy, and Army with a few from the FBI and CIA then this is the set for you. As far as I am concerned, it was a total snooze."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting read","review":"This book turned out to be a very good read. Some of the reviews had caused somewhat of concern; however, having read extensively on the airwar in Europe during WWII, I found this book to be interesting and from a different perspecitve. It is not the usual naritive from an air crew member; it does provide more insight in to the thoughts of a twenty-something person during this incredible time in history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Account","review":"This is an excellent account of a pilot's story who flew B-17's over Europe during WW2 and rightly considered a classic in aviation literature.Bert Stiles wrote his book during the war but did not live to see it published. After completing his 35 bombing missions in a B-17, instead of returning to the United States, he transferred to fighters and died in his P-51 over Germany, aged 23 years.His mother arranged to have his book published after the war in his memory. The book isn't all combat and flying but also reflections on life and war as seen and experienced by a young man, this is a great story and I am glad that I read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shows how dangerous and deadly the air war really was","review":"When Bert Stiles wrote this book, the war was still raging across the world. It was 1944, he had just completed a horrific tour of duty as a B17 co-pilot, and the memories were fresh in his mind. Even though Bert seemed to be a somewhat sensitive man, some of his words have a callous feel to them. He talks about the officers and enlisted men forming a baseball team, and \\"..after the Schweinfurt raid, we had to replace the whole infield\\"-Simply put, so many men had been killed on that mission, no one was left to play on the team. Bert was an intelligent man, a good writer, but he lacked the experience to know when to back out of the war. Passive, intelligent, creative people do not make good fighter pilots. Bert was killed in action shortly after writing his memoirs."},{"rating":"2","title":"He had the gift of immortality","review":"Bert Stiles at age 23 was thrust into a war he didn't understand but one that he knew had to be won. He gives us his thoughts and emotions starkly and beautifully, and if he had lived, he would have been one of our best writers. When the years have done their filtering process, this book will be a classic of World War II."},{"rating":"2","title":"A voice form the past that speaks of today","review":"This book chronicles the life of Bert Stiles, who was killed during the war. Considering when the book was written speaks wonders for Bert's insightfulness, and understanding of humanity. This book is wonderful from an historical aspect, as Bert gives us some in-depth insights into life in the air and on the ground during the air war over Europe. Bert also gives us something else, even more wonderful, his understanding on both sides of the battle of the people involved. Bert had a unique sense of what this war was doing to people, and just how the world would perceive it years into the future. Bert gave his life for us during those years, flying the fighter he always wanted, but his words sail on through time, to inform us even today."},{"rating":"1","title":"content free guide to RIP?","review":"Thank goodness for the large font, and wide spacing on this fluffy attempt at presenting a technichal topic: otherwise far more extraneous and useless information would have had to be included in order to make this book big enough to keep from sliding into a fold of flesh in my ponderous belly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute shoes for my collection","review":"I really like them, but they are about a half size too big...but that is no biggie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Can't They Just Release the Original Music in the US?","review":"These were just plain awful.What's so hard about releasing the original music from the Second Lupin III series?Original versions I want to hear:opening themes from second seriesLove SquallSuper HeroManhattan Joke (I realize this is from one of the films, but it's a great song)The tracks on this disk were just plain awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Partners against slime......","review":"I love these towels with Microban. My husband and I bought a set. We were especially curious about the statement that Microban fights against mildew, etc. And, now that we live in humid Houston, TX, we didn't want to have to wash our towels every other day. But, these are great! This Microban stuff works just as its claim. Now we just wish all of the other colors were available. We could only buy the crystal. Highly Recommend these towels!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unraveled after First Washing :(","review":"I ordered the towel for a present for my husband and was extremely disappointed that the hem came unraveled after the towel's first washing although it was not in a bag with or washed with anything that had a button, snap, zipper, catch, or anything else that could possibly have snagged it.It was not nearly as soft as I expected for the price either. It was better than what you'd expect from your standard hotel towel, but it wasn't any softer than my towels from the JC Penny Collection.The redeeming quality is that the size is great for larger people and those who simply want to be completely wrapped up in a bath sheet."}]`),z={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],H={key:0},N={key:1};function x(a,e,n,u,r,s){const g=y("PoemCard");return i(),o("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(i(!0),o(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,c)=>(i(),p(g,{key:c,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(i(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(i(),o("span",N,"Loading...")):(i(),o("span",H,"See more"))],8,O)):b("",!0)])}const B=d(z,[["render",x],["__scopeId","data-v-3943a518"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/21.md","filePath":"guide/21.md"}'),W={name:"guide/21.md"},L=Object.assign(W,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(i(),o("div",null,[v(B)]))}});export{j as __pageData,L as default};
