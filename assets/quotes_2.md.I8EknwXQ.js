I wish I had read the reviews more carefully, particularly the 2 and 3-star reviews. I bought this calculator because it was one of the bestselling basic calculators and had a 4-star average. I wish I had read the lower star reviews a bit more carefully. Like several other reviewers have noted, the main problem with this is the keypad. I just tested the calculator with a few basic calculations and it frequently does not register a key strike. I bought this calculator so I could do basic math for my tests, and there's no way I'm going to rely on this calculator because it's very easy to hit a key, think you punched in a number that doesn't register, leading to a wrong answer.

To say it's durable would be an understatement. In my later college years, I preferred using this portable calculator over my graphing calculator for most purposes.PROS: It lasts a long time and suffers little damage when tossed/thrown around (I don't recommend purposely slamming rocks against it). It's basic design is easy to navigate. I never needed to replace the battery inside. It fits nicely in my back pocket.CONS: It can't (or shouldn't) be opened. The keys require a bit of force.IMPORTANT - The TI-30 series in general is often the among the few allowed calculators on certain exams and classes. I know that the Engineer-in-training exam uses it as well as some college courses that restrict calculator use (some of my roommates have borrowed my calculator for entire semesters).Overall a solid calculator, and I will be buying a second one once I get around to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes","review":"This is a very inexpensive calculator that has served its purpose well.

The buttons on this calculator are VERY loose and make data entry tricky for fast calculation. One must constantly verify that each button press has been recognized. These loose buttons are annoying if you are accustomed to quick calculations. It makes the calculator essentially unusable.

Then I used sandpaper to roughen up the parts a little. Then I mixed the epoxy (you have 6 minutes before it hardens). Applied it to both sides, slid it around for just a few seconds to spread the epoxy around, then clamped it in a vise for over 24 hours. Put the knife together, laid it down, and didn't pick up the knife til the next day. Put the knife in my pocket; pulled it out less than 90 minutes later to cut a cardboard box, and the plastic part practically came off in my hand - it took very little pressure to remove it all the way off.

The very personal and elegant atmosphere of a string quartet, easily one of the best. If you like any of these, this could be one of the CDs you take with you to a desert island.Although these are separate pieces, the overall CD is a perfect whole.

Unfortunately, the flea medication first recommended to us by our vet was hard to administer (much more liquid) and also had an unpleasant smell and greasy residue. (Not to mention our cat despised the whole process.) After two months of dealing with this, I decided to look into other options. Amazon reviewers pointed to Frontline plus, and I'm glad I followed their advice! Clear, convenient packaging (including stickers for your calendar) AND the job was done in 10 seconds flat. No mess, no fuss. I don't even think Kitty realized she was receiving flea medicine - she just thought she was getting her usual kitty massage. I should say that at this point we do not have a flea situation, this is just maintenance/prevention, so I can't vouch for how it actually works. But unless you see an updated review from me in a few weeks, you can probably guess it's doing the job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only thing that works!","review":"I've been using frontline for years in the months that I let my cat outdoors.

They wanted to do flea bombs and all kinds of crazy traps to attempt to get rid of the fleas, none of which worked it was so bad, so I put my foot down and no more of that and got frontline for our cats. Within a couple of months they were gone.

She had to have an IV drip for 2 days to clear the Advantage out of her system, and I was told the Advantage was far too strong for her.

I put FrontLine on every month and always check for fleas before the next application. Two weeks ago confirmed no fleas and applied the monthly treatment. Just got back from the vets and several pets covered in fleas. Heard about black market FrontLine but thought I would be fine with Amazon.

Will buy another product throughAmazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frontline works well","review":"It's very easy to use but keep off your skin: just place the drops on your cats skin between it's shoulder blades or upper back and it lasts for a month. The Frontline Plus also kills the eggs and larvae to end the flea cycle,where regular Frontline doesn't. So, spend the extra money on the Frontline Plus instead of just the regular Frontline. It is worth it. The price for Frontline Plus on this sight is a good price. Frontline Plus is the best flea control medicine I have ever used for my cats. I had a cat that I could never get rid of the ear mites despite costly vet visits to clean it's ears, but when I treated my 2 cats for fleas with the Frontline Plus, surprisingly it also kills the mites, they say but I have not confirmed that."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Poor Kitties","review":"I was using the protocol which recommends using Frontline one month and then Advantage the next month. Unfortunately, after using Frontline, my poor kitties were scratching non-stop because of their flea infestation. It seemed as if Frontline did not kill a single flea. I had to use Advantage much sooner than recommended because I didn't think they would survive until the next dose was due.

Many products come from foreign countries and they are not regulated. I used this product on my two cats last week and they both got sick. Thank God my cats are ok but I am so upset over this incident and don't want anyone else out there to go through heartbreak. If you love your pet, don't scrimp on the money - take them to a vet!

Not only is it not keeping fleas off of her or killing flea eggs (I've found both eggs and larvae on her) but the fleas don't seem to mind it either, even with a flea collar! I don't know if these are super fleas, but I'm switching to Advantage and hoping that will give her some relief since bombing, bathing, constantly vacuuming, spraying (floors, furniture and the poor cat) doesn't seem to be helping. If I could keep the fleas off of her, since she is the only one getting bitten, then the cycle would stop. I realize this is a bad year for bugs, but Frontline does not work for her.

There has been no change. I'm glad I only bought the 3 month supply instead of wasting more money. I should have listened to my intuition, but I didn't and it was a waste of money.

Periodically I will buy it through Amazon when I don't see it on sale at Costco. But this time when I received the package and opened one of the applicators it smelled just like a skunk.

The packaging I buy from the vet looks identical to the package I received in this order. When I opened the vial to apply the product, I noticed an unusual odor, like a skunk smell. I applied the product according to the directions the way I always have. At the time of application, I noticed 1 or 2 fleas on my cats. After the first application, there were no results. In fact the fleas were multiplying. I vacuumed and cleaned all rugs and furniture in the house (didn't notice any fleas anywhere accept on the cats). I applied the product again a few weeks later. Again- no results. The cats are now infested. I am on my way to purchase the REAL product. Do not waste your money on this fake frontline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive waste of money","review":"Think twice before buying, we have been using for 6 months and no change.

It worked very well for over a year and then we began to notice fleas increasing in quantity. I discussed this with our Vet, and he recommended changing to Advantage. He said that others have complained about the same situation we experienced and that he was planning on not stocking it any longer because of that. His opinion was that Frontline doesn't kill fast enough and that after a period of time the fleas adapt and are able to prosper. We've changed to Advantage and all fleas have vanished over a 2 week period. We've used Advantage in the past and now will stay with it again. Sorry Frontline....you need to improve your product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"I've used frontline plus before allowing my cat to start going outside.

We applied exactly as directed, gave it time, but because the fleas became resistant to the toxin or because it stopped killing them quickly enough to break the life cycle, we got a full infestation despite both of our cats being treated, and regular diligent vacuuming. They are indoor only, so it wasn't like they were bringing fleas in from outside. The company shrugged and said it just takes more time. Well when your product lets the fleas get a foothold I can't wait for it to start working again! We went with a different spot treatment and Fleabusters borax powder in the carpet and now not a single flea. Never ever going back to Frontline."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Effect At All","review":"This is the second time I've bought Frontline from amazon. The first time it worked well, this time it didn't work at all. I'm pretty sure it didn't even kill a single flea.

We used the last dose thinking that maybe we missed dosing by a week and it was our fault, but after just a couple weeks we noticed fleas again on a couple of the cats. I went and bought Frontline Plus at my local veterinarian office and have not had an issue since.

My healthy 6 year old Abyssinian cat had an adverse reaction to Frontline Plus within 3 hours of putting the medication on his skin. He had tremors, was lethargic, had trouble standing and walking, vomited several times, and had foul-smelling diarrhea. I washed the stuff off him immediately, but it took a few days for him to recover. Other pet owners haven't been as lucky and their pets have died. Frontline Plus is even recommended as being not as toxic as other meds. Be prepared to wash this off immediately at the first sign of an adverse reaction (Dawn dish detergent is recommended for its degreasing properties), and a make quick, expensive trip to the vet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"I've purchase Frontline from a vet's office before and it has always worked.

When I checked the packages, there was no expiration date to be found. I tried it on my cat(twice) and she is in misery (scratching, biting, trying to run away from the fleas..) as it does not kill the fleas. In otherwords, I've wasted my money.

The writer, a veterinarian, explained that many times pet medications offered via online vendors are not manufactured in the U.S., thus there are questions about their viability. I checked the label of what I had purchased and sure enough, it was manufactured in France. I would like Amazon to address the issue of why products like Frontline, which are American in origin, are being supplied from another country. I suppose the simple answer is that they're cheaper -- but are they effective? According to the above-mentioned article, the pharmaceutical company in question does not guarantee the product unless it's supplied through a veterinarian. Next time I will purchase through my vet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cat protection","review":"Ordered 4/26/09 received 5/2/09. Applied to our cat and so far it is working very well.

I tried to file a product complaint with Merial but I got the a long well rehearsed description of how the product works (Doesn't prevent attachment. Kills the tick. Most active time of the year. Tick engorgement depends on species and sex of the tick). Nice but not helpful. This stuff doesn't smell like the previous batches I've used.

I don't use it continuously on her, only when fleas have made their way into the house once in awhile. i now have 2 strays outside, and have applied the product to each of them, with excellent results. They were given Revolution by the Humane Society when they were spayed/neutered and given shots, but I have not had luck finding that product, especially at a reasonable price.

I finally tried Frontline for the first time, and it's been about 3 weeks and I have't seen a single flea on any of them (I have 7 cats). I haven't been bitten once since I put the Frontline on them.

It did not kill the fleas fast enough to prevent the life cycle. I applied the Frontline Plus to my cats as soon as I noticed one flea in my house. 3 weeks later, I was dealing with a full blown infestation. When I contacted my vet, she said Frontline is a waste of money. It takes up to 24 hours to kill the flea which does not prevent them from laying eggs. And the longer the product is on the cats, the less effective it is. So by week 2 it may take up to 48 hours for the flea to die. My vet highly recommended Advantage, which kills the fleas within 5 minutes of biting the cat. I applied the Advantage and 2 days later, not one flea in site. AMAZING. Do not waste your money on Frontline... buy Advantage, your cats will thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective or knock off?","review":"Just opened one vial of Frontline Plus for cats we purchased through Amazon.

I really wanted the Frontline to work because it costs a lot less, but it didn't. I even applied a second dose after two weeks that still did not kill the fleas. And yes the house had also been treated. So I went to the vet after four weeks of Frontline Plus not working and and spent the big bucks on Revolution. All four cats are now flea free again.

I carefully read the directions about parting their fur and applying the whole dose in one spot, and dutifully did so on each kitty. One day passed: still combed off live fleas...two days, three days, a week, etc. Live jumping fleas! All over!! In our desperation, we didn't wait quite a month before dosing them again with a second tube of Frontline. Same exact results. I'm so disappointed; it might as well have been water.

I told the guy I talked to from Frontline that I kept finding LARGE, very ACTIVE fleas on the cats, and he said that \\"the fact that the fleas were ACTIVE, proved that the product was working because that's how the fleas died...they bite the cat and ingest the formula and EXHAUST themselves!!\\" Bwaahahhahhah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem with Product","review":"ACTUAL RATE: ZEROI purchased Frontline Plus and received Frontline Combo instead.

When I did some further research on the frontline site, they say that there guarantee is for after three months of use. That is how long it takes to break the flea breeding cycle. Frontline kills adult fleas and flea eggs but not fleas in the larvae stage, which is the middle stage. So any of those fleas will emerge as adults and you have the problem all over again. If you already have fleas you should definitely go with Advantage that kills the larvae and adult stage. Frontline is only good as a prevention and who wants to pay that much for only preventative purposes.

She is an indoor/outdoor cat with lots of fur. A few weeks ago, I noticed that she was really irritable and didn't want us to pet her. I took her to the vet only to learn that she was invested with fleas! I never missed a monthly dose of Frontline with her and had just applied less than 2 weeks ago. I was horrified! My vet told me to switch to Revolution and I have. I called Frontline to complain and they said since she goes outside that she may still get fleas. I find this unacceptable! I told them I would NEVER use Frontline again. Since Frontline and Revolution are about the same price, I recommend cat owners to get Revolution which also protects against ear mites and heartworms."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't now, my cat still has fleas!","review":"2 month later cat still has fleas!Maybe after 6 month they have vanished ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This product used to work, but this go around was useless on six cats.

When I opened it, found that it had leaked all over the box, rendering my expensive purchase useless.Here's the kicker Amazon won't accept returns on this product, because it's classified as hazardous material. And Frontline won't refund or replace it, because it wasn't purchased through a Veterinarian.The funny thing is, my wife is a vet. We bought it before a vacation, because her clinic was out of stock.

Are the people who gave \\"Oscar & Steve\\" five stars deaf? Mr. Patinkin was not in good vocal form when he recorded this. There's a gigantic chasm between his upper and lower registers. The keys that the songs are arranged in are bizarre. If the high notes were any higher, dogs would come running, and the low notes have a comical, bass-baritone, cartoon-villain sound. In between, the voice has a vibrato wide enough to drive a truck through it. Add to this the fact that every song is dreadfully over-acted. Was M.P.ill when he recorded this, or what?

I ended up with Hilty and Brown's book by sheer coincidence, and I was not at all disappointed. The text and information is superb throughout, and I was able to identify several species on habitat description alone. For example, the authors clearly describe the preference of many taxa for varzea (seasonally flooded) or terra firme forests, which made a fleeting glimpse more of a certainty, and the range descriptions were invaluable. If I have only one very minor criticism, it is that I have never found plates in black and white particularly helpful, and since several artists were employed, there were differences in visual interpretation in several groups (e.g. the Picidae).

After two filter changes our unit is useless because of this cheaply made soft plastic nut. Within a few weeks the unit leaks and the shut off valve stops working automatically.

Particularly interesting is his portrait of Mary Todd - she is a fascinating, mad figure who both tormented and consoled Lincoln in his struggles. While it is a big novel, it is rarely difficult to read (except when it gets bogged down in some silly conversational one upmanship between the politicians at various social settings). I enjoyed it very much. Vidal has a very clear idea of what he wants to do and does it very well. A great way to spend several evenings.

However, this is not necessarily a good historical novel. It is quite long on conjecture and supposition, too much so. As a result, the history, the central topic that sells this book, is skewed, questionable.But that is quite alright. It is why Mr. Vidal titled it, Lincoln: A Novel. There is no reason not to enjoy this work, it is good. Just understand that Vidal's book is more good, novelist conjecture than solid, factual history. It is an interesting and fun read, one to be enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is thin and unfocused.","review":"After reading the reviews on this page, I was looking forward to reading this book. However, after getting about four hundred pages into it, I was completely dissappointed and frustrated. The book spends way too much time exploring what I perceive to be completely irrelevant storylines (i.e., the courtship of Kate Chase, daughter of the Secretary of the Treasury), yet deals with such events as the debacle at Fredericksburg with literally one passing line. Maybe I'm missing something, but this book seems to be more written toward being a made-for-TV miniseries than great historical fiction.

It tells the tale of a pivotal time in U.S. History as it was presumably lived by Abraham Lincoln and his cabinet and staff. Instead of wallowing in Civil War statistics and data, we experience the spirit of the times through the people who lived them. Abraham Lincoln was very believably portrayed as a real human being with weaknesses and strengths we aren't told about in History class. It was fascinating to see inside the political machinations of that time and note that very little has changed. There were also interesting side plots to keep the reader's interest and provide a respite from the accounts of the war and affairs of state. Since I read historical fiction for education as well as entertainment, I feel I was well served on both counts. I look forward to reading other books of American Historical fiction by Gore Vidal."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Vidal's best","review":"Got this for my wife to read after seeing the Lincoln movie with Daniel Day Lewis.

I actually ordered a dozen of them so that I would have them on hand for occasions such as these. I recommend it to all my friends!

I initially agreed, and did remove the feedback. But I've had time to reconsider.I think this is not ethical practice.It bribes folks to mislead other customers.

However, I a/b'd several other mics to compare and be sure. Several of them were more expensive than the 58, a couple were a little less. This comparison exercise went on for over an hour. One of those that were a little less was the Samson Q8 which was the last one I plugged in. Just as soon as I tried it, I knew it was a winner. But I told myself it couldn't be, it's priced 30 bucks cheaper than the Beta 58. But after further comparisons, it just seemed to have the fullest, warmest sound out of all of them while still maintaining great clarity...and just as much punch. I walked out happy with the Q8, and spent about 40 bucks less than I had intended."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE picture, VHS better than this","review":"This a great film ruined by an awful DVD. This MADACYENTERTAINMENT/\\"HOLLYWOOD CLASSICS\\" thing is ... seriously overpriced.Great film, terrible DVD.The packaging is good. The problem is the TERRIBLE PICTURE QUALITY! The picture is blurry and from a bad print, and part of the picture is cropped off. For instance, the title of the film reads \\"METROPOLI\\".Hopefully the AFI or another company can release a great DVD of this great film, or maybe it's already happened.

They better remaster and print the DVD version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made from a terrible print","review":"In my book, Metropolis deserves at least five stars out of five. This is just an incredible movie. However, the print from which this video was made is a sacrilege. In spite of another review to the contrary, this is a bad print. It is either overexposed or underexposed, the intertitles are fuzzy and cut off at the edges, and it is just altogether a disappointment to those of us who love this film. Try to obtain the version from Kino International which seems to be the best one out there in English.The version by Moroder is also worth seeing. It is a crisp print with lots of restored scenes that are not found in other versions. However, it has been color tinted and has a modern rock scoring. Many people hate it. I personally think it's great, but consider it to be a different work of art from Fritz Lang's original.My rating: 1 star out of 5 (because of the print)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Barebones edition, only reason to buy is price.","review":"I picked this DVD up at a local store, because I've been meaning to see the movie and it was quite cheap. It's the original 1927 theater cut (I couldn't tell you if the tinting was added later or not), which means it's only a small part of Lang's masterpeice. The plot is, as it was, choppy and hard to follow without reading up on the movie itself. The scenes that were cut seem to have been important, in that you get the general gist of the story with this truncated version, but there are things you won't pick up on unless you watch it repeatedly.It's a poor version of the classic, but the price is right. If you want to see the masterpeice, buy the restored, authorized edition as was recommended above. If you want to watch a mildly entertaining silent film that sounds like the soundtrack was put together by the Residents, this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, terrible, terrible print DO NOT BUY!!!","review":"I knew I was in for trouble when the opening words were out of focus and half cropped off by the edges of the screen, then the music began and it got worse.

I loved it! I wish I could find it on DVD. I purchased the new \\"authorized version\\" that has restored footage. It's good but to the average movie go'er a bit long and boring. I like the Giorgio Moroder version much better. The over all story is better and makes more sense to me. Also the music keeps it interesting & entertaining. It also helps in the telling of the story in a way the original never will. I think the best senario would be to use the newly restored footage and the effects and soundtrack from Giorgio Moroders version and put it out on DVD. I would buy it in a hart beat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Landmark movie with the worst conversion possible!","review":"This movie is a touch stone for sci-fi and social commentary on modern society.The transfer is the absolutely worst one they could have used! It was a silent movie, watch it that way! . It is also the shortest version available at 83 mins (the original was 139 mins).I got it because of its importance to me as a film maker, not for the technical merits of the transfer to DVD, which looks worse than the VHS dub I had!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the version to see","review":"This version is produced by a company called Madacy Entertainment and is sad at best. The picture is very washed out (The title shot \\"Metropolis\\" can't even be read) and it isn't even centered on the screen. It was also recorded in \\"EP\\" mode. The reason for one star is because it was the lowest score available. I was extremely disappointed.This movie is a classic and deserves better treatment than this production company has given it.Also, if there is ever a version released that is accompanied by music from the \\"Alloy Orchestra\\" I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie; horrible dvd","review":"Yes, Metropolis is a classic and is a wonderful film which I love. I only wish when they made this DVD they would have used the restored version.... I remember seeing a restored version in the theatre, and not just the GM colorized rehash. So why didn't they use that one? The resulting film is so fuzzy and out of focus it is almost unwatchable.This is a great film, I only wish it had a decent DVD to go with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metropolis DVD does not do Lang's Masterpiece justice","review":"I remember this film as a breathtaking visual feast, but this transfer to DVD is dreadful! We loose the perimiter of the picture, most noticeable when heads are cut off at the top of frame. I am sure there are better quality prints out there, the one used for this transfer was dark and murky. The music chosen seemed wildly inappropriate at times, I ended up turning the sound down, it was so distracting."},{"rating":"1","title":"a classic, but not on d.v.d.","review":"This movie is an absolute sci-fi classic. The dvd version is an eternal flop! The lighting sometimes dims, making the characters look dark and blend into the background. There is no lobby poster that comes with it! There's a picture of the lobby poster on the dvd details. That is ridiculous. The trivia has eight questions that my wife could answer! There is absolutely nothing good about this except that i could swear that there's a couple of extra small scenes. However, they completely cut out the part where the worker dies for the mediator. Where's the justice? If you're a true fan and have a couple of version, maybe it's worth it for the collection..but I'd hate for them to collect another cent for this abonomation of this absolutely timeless classic. Where's the justice?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad version.","review":"The only thing I can add to the other excoriating comments on the DVD is that the two-channel sound appears to be unidentified mono recordings of various classics (e.g. Mendelssohn's Italian symphony, Prokofiev's 1st symphony), from the early electrical days, judging from the poor quality (performances OK), prepared by recording the channels with opposite phase. This gives a very strange sound, depending on your system. I ended up using the L-R mode of my preamp for a semblance of centered mono.I got this as a gift, but I had asked for it; I should have read Amazon's reviews first. I can't imagine how this ever got produced or marketed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong speed!","review":"I had a long argument with KINO after this restoration was released in the theaters. I know how difficult it would have been to release it theatrically at anything other than 24 fps. But with the DVD, we finally had a chance to see this film at the correct speed! They refused.The claims of 24 being the \\"authentic\\" speed all rest on one score that actually has \\"28 fps\\" hand-written on it. I think that was just somene's error.The simple fact is that if you watch the film, it is clearly shot at silent speed. People are sped-up at 24fps, as they are in all silent films. It's painful to watch.So sad - KINO could've included a version at the correct speed, even with no sound - I would've happily played my own music while I watched this beautiful restoration at the right speed. As it is, we have a gorgeous print with characters who move like the Keystone Cops - what a missed opportunity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metropolis - Giorgio Moroder Version Blu-ray","review":"For so long I have been waiting for this and finally its available.Unlike a lot of purists I prefer the Moroder version with its contemporary soundtrack. Sure the film is grainy and dark in parts compared to other versions and it is colourised which may not to be to everyone's taste but the total experience is fantastic.The 5.1 soundtrack is excellent but it's relating to this that I could only give it four stars out of five. One of my pet peeves with DVDs & Blu-rays is when a film has a 5.1 soundtrack but the rear speakers are only used for reflected sound and emphasis so you end up with essentially a \\"wide stereo\\" sound and unfortunately this is what has been done with the Moroder version of Metropolis. There is no discrete use of the rear speakers at all so its not much different from stereo. So what you get essentially is a great stereo DTS-HD MA soundtrack which sounds much much better the PCM Stereo track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metropolis","review":"You will love this movie with the Giorgio Moroder score along with other artists. The music and the ol time color is absolutely great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational film making","review":"So ahead of it's time and not comparable to anything before or since. Did a lot to show people the power of cinema in it's infancy, and to me it still looks incredible some 90+ years later.The imagination and vision of Lang's skyscraper landscapes and draconion underbelly of poverty as it's hidden foundation speaks just as loudly to today's world as it ever did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible print of a masterpiece","review":"This dvd is almost unwatchable. The film is actually printed so that a significant portion of the sides of the film runs off the edge of the dvd format. The image quality is poor and the music is unappealing. Get the Georgio Morodo version if you can, all things considered it is by far the best print available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hold out for Moroder... its coming","review":"Tinted and intoned with rock music most memorably by Queen, Moroder's version should have offended Metropolis fans everywhere. But instead it is chosen by most as the best way to watch Metropolis and I agree. It is the best looking and most pleasant way to view this film. As important and visually exciting a film as it is, a lot of it can be quite a chore to sit through and the modern touches add a lot to make the experience more enjoyable. As you can read from the rest of the Amazon kingdom, other versions of the film are relatively atrocious. You won't regret waiting a while to see the new disc. For purists there is no reason you can't turn down the color and turn off the sound. Moroder's version is Metropolis for the masses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metropolis","review":"The DVD of Metropolis is truly bad. How bad?

But...unfortunately the folks at Kino decided to present the movie at 24 fps rather than the original 20 fps. 4% difference in length of film and the film will draw snickers during certain key sequneces. Why oh why did they do this? Speeding up the film. Kino toured the film at it's original 20 fps format at considerable inconvenience. Why they didn't just keep it faithful for the end product is beyond me.

This one, while not complete, gives you a better understanding of the story than most versions. However, indications from this film are that the original version contained too many confusing subplots and bogged down the tale. In either case, this is clearly the best version of Metropolis I've seen. Both firstime viewers and fans of the film are in for a revelation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metropolis Review","review":"This version of Metropolis is about as complete as you will ever get....just the story behind how the remaining pieces of the movie were discovered and restored is amazing. The story is, of course, a classic. Robots before Asimov? Wow. As with any great sci-fi movie, this primodial work uses technology as the vehicle to expound upon sociological philosophy. One cannot say they are a master of literature without watching and understanding this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment","review":"When I first found out that Metropolis had been produced in DVD I was thrilled. When I played it, I was disappointed to say the least.I had expected the DVD would be of the American release of the 80's (two thumbs-up from Siskel & Ebert) with the rock music score (which it was not) but the quality of the video is the real disappointment -- it would have to improve to be poor -- unwatchable when compared to the copy of a copy of a tape I already had.I should have read the other reviews before purchasing.

The restoration is virtually flawless. I can't imagine the picture looking any better at its Berlin premiere so many decades ago. Missing passages (about 30 mins.) are filled in with narrative cards so that now the plot makes sense. (It never did in earlier versions that I'd seen.) The symphonic score, which survives, has been orchestrated and joined to the film, a most moving impression. With excellent features on the making of the film and its restoration, plus a splendid commentary by a leading Lang scholar, this DVD will long hold a high place in my library. If you love \\"Metropolis\\" as much as I do, you owe yourself the pleasure of owning and viewing (repeatedly, as I already have) this splendid disk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable","review":"Don't buy this.

This is one of the great early films -- the predecessor to Blade Runner in its imagery and its plot, but this DVD falls far short of doing justice to the original. The sound track is an unrelated series of pieces of impressionist classical chamber music, and the picture is almost indecipherable much of the time. When Giorgio Moroder's colorized version came out, purists groaned, but in retrospect it was better than what's currently available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gleep. Um... Gleep.","review":"Brilliant! Metropolis drags you into a world of heaven and hell. The workers down in the caverns keeping the power running for the rich in the gigantic skyscrapers. Revolt is inevitable, but can the two sides find a way to live together without oppression? Bridget Helm is fantastic as both Maria and her evil robotic double. The sets are wonderful and the soundtrack admirably fills in any void felt by the lack of spoken dialogue. It is incredible that a film made in the twenties is still so exciting. Be warned though, this is a review of the Georgio Moroder version. Another version mentioned by another reviewer is really terrible, half the scenes are missing and there is a muzak soundtrack! Buy the Moroder version, be wary of any other. If Amazon could say which version theirs is it would be helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the Kino DVD","review":"If you're reading this, you doubtlessly know already that Metropolis is a magnificent classic of the silent era. No definitive version is available yet, they're all incomplete, but this DVD is especially atrocious. The picture quality is an insult to DVD technology. I just saw the theatrical release of Kino International's new restoration, and it's a beautiful, pristine print. The film has been restored to be as close to the original theatrical release as possible, with title cards inserted to describe the missing scenes.

I could only bear to watch two minutes, before I ran to my computer to see if other folks agreed that it was bad - maybe this is the best that was available?

It looked it was filmed directly off the screen in some old cinema; the fourth-rate print used for the transfer must have been pulled out of rubbish somewhere.

I'll be on the lookout for a better DVD version of this amazing Sci-Fi classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like it even less than originally!","review":"I feel sorry for the more unsuspecting people that work for Madacy Entertainment! This is a company that besmirched its own reputation by releasing the WORST quality prints of classic films, and yet they're still pressing on! BTW, I heard a rumor (let's just say a little birdy told me) that quite possibly (but PLEASE don't quote me) Criterion or some reputable company might release THEIR version of METROPOLIS on DVD. If there's any justice from the movie gods, we could use it now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"METROPOLIS: I could've assembled a better cut AND scored it!","review":"OK, I bought this disc--I'm hugely disappointed this wasn't the version that was broadcast on WNET, Ch. 13 in NY about 20 yrs. ago with a sinister synthesiser-music score. I DO hope at some point we see either the aforementioned Moroder version on DVD or the one I saw, or at least SOMETHING resembling the original film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Movie Is Great...But this release is terrible","review":"Thank god I saw this before I bought it. I was not impressed with this version at all. The quality was just not there, for picture & music.I'll stick to my 80's version of the classic, it was released though \\"Vestron Video\\", and its been modified.But this version has some cool groups from the 80's that performed on the soundtrack, such as Bonnie Tylor, Queen, Jon Anderson, Lover Boy, ect, and I do belive it is a classic to be experienced.Now, this is not the fully restored version, but it is very clear and clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad transfer of a brilliant movie","review":"The music is terrible, and the quality is horrendous! The music just didnt fit the scenes at all. I sure hope Criterion picks this title up and restores it with the \\"original soundtrack\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS!","review":"This version is an insult to the film, being of horrible quality as well as a version that Lang himself detested. It's not even worth the low price. So what to do? The most accurate version of this film since 1927 has just been completely reconstructed in Berlin after a three-year effort, using the latest restoration technology as well as newly discovered footage that doubles the running time of the SEVERELY edited existing versions. It is being shown in cinemas now, and upon its release on DVD later this year, it will be the only version of this film to own. The version offered above is basically like an 8-track tape from 1975, and the editing and music makes the film look like a bad comedy. (This is not the Moroder/Queen version, which is far better, but still nothing like this latest version.) Do yourself a favour and wait for the restored release. It's incredible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor screen version--do not get it!","review":"Well, I was compiling a collection of my 25 favorite films, and this is on it. Prior to my purchase, I read reviews on this, but they seemed positive.Forget that! The version is poor , choppy, and most dissapointing(I've seen this film before) on a 55\\" screen, the film is in a box that uses only half the screen andd cuts out subtitles, dialogue, even implortant parts of the pictures.

That sounds just postivilt wonderful doesn't it? Lets all rave about how great this movie is, telling nothing about why I should spend thirty dollars on it. It only matters that the \\"effects\\" are \\"great\\".

Currently there are a number of prints of this DVD out, but most of them utilize 16mm prints that are often grainy and blurry... which is NOT a good tribute to what is considered one of the greatest sci fi movies ever. The Kino video offers a beautiful soundtrack as well as a clear, near pristine 35mm print in its version.The Kino version also contains a very thorough movie, which, once again, is absent in most prints. Weeks after METROPOLIS was shown, it was cut drastically. Kino has released the most- complete version to date, using footage that was from some of the cut to enhance and explain the story. Parts of the movie that have been lost, presumably forever, are explained through intertitles. The story makes much more sense and offers a great deal more depth now.I cannot recommend this movie enough to anyone who loves silent film or science fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Metropolis DVD version to get!","review":"Forget about all of the other Metropolis DVDs out there, this is the Kino restoration that ran in the theaters in 2002. While it is still not in the original 1927 edit, this is the most complete version known to exist. Title cards are used to describe the still-missing scenes, but many scenes have been added by Kino for this edition.This is also much longer than the much sought after Laserdisc.A highly recomended Silent Classic Science Fiction story of a two class world. The underground workers who keep the city running, and the above groung businessmen who live off of the undergrounders work. Trouble errupts when litigation between the two breaks down and a mediator is suspected of being a spy.This 1927 movie seems like todays current headlines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metropolis lives","review":"This is an amazing film considering the year in which it was made. The special effects are far ahead of its time. Although the restoration isn't 100 percent it is amazing they saved what they did. Every science fiction fan will recognize at least one plot device that started here and has been \\"borrowed from\\" time and time again. It is thoughtful, the acting compelling in spite of it being a \\"silent\\" film, a little bawdy and deeply intriguing . A must for film buffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very forward-looking for its time","review":"For what it is and when it was made, this is a forward-looking film that gives a simplistic but appealing message about treating workers fairly and not building empires on the backs and on the blood, tears, and sweat of others. Obviously, many parts of the world are still not that progressive and probably never will be, human nature being what it is.The idea of blending a robot with a human is also fascinating and is explored to some degree here, both literally and metaphorically.The score seems to be pervasive and rather distracting, and the quality isn't all that good. But these elements can be overlooked for the overall purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Future is Now","review":"If you have never seen classic cinema and don't know where to start, look no further, because you are home with \\"Metropolis.\\" Simply put, this is the very best films ever made and one of (if not) the very best film during the Weimar Republic era."},{"rating":"1","title":"bait and switch","review":"I ordered the 2010 \\"restored\\" version of Metropolis after viewing a film about it on cable; as per usual, Amazon's poor resellers sold and shipped me a 1984 version complete with added music---NOT what I ordered at all!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"faulty version...","review":"I bought a copy of this film, but was disappointed to find that I couldn't watch past chapter 22-23; the image wouldn't play, no matter what I did. So I bought another. Same problem. There's a line across the top of the DVD, so there's likely something wrong with it. I'm not sure if this is a problem with every disc, but I bought 2 faulty ones. I hope yours isn't messed up too. The movie is 5 stars, but I give it 1 star since I couldn't finish the film due to technical problems - there is no excuse for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lies and butchery","review":"Why oh why don't they just settle on one good print with a synchronized soundtrack that matches the futuristic feel of the film and then make it play out for the full 139 minutes! The number of times I've seen 139 mins of the back of the box and then wound up playing 86mins on my VCR to get from start to finish on each version is insane!This movie has been shat on by mindless marketeering and lab people with no taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"1984 re-release of Metropolis is the only version of quality","review":"The 1984 re-release with the Georgio Moroder music score is the only version worth buying and it is no longer available. The '84 release originally came out in VHS and eventually Laser Disc--a demonstration that exceptional quality is possible. I wish I knew what studio produced the Laser Disc and that they would re-release the '84 version of Metropolis with Georgio Moroder's music score on DVD with the same quality that was given to the Laser Disc. It seems that when Laser Disc went out of style in favor of DVD, the public lost the only consistant quality product available to a cheap, mass-produced, entity. I guess if you have not seen the '84 version of this movie or have not seen it from Laser Disc, then you have nothing to compare the the junk being offered currently!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible restoration","review":"I saw Metropolis for the first time in an architectural history class. The film was about an hour long, and it was so badly deteriorated that it was hard to watch. I could tell that it was an incredible film when it was made, but time had taken it's toll.All I can say about the restoration is WOW! The visuals are incredible, and there is now enough original footage that the story makes sense.For it's history and pioneering visual effects, this is an absolute must-have for any film buff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait","review":"Not a good copy of this great movie.

The music soundtrack that was just slaped on is ridiculous, but Metropolis is Film History. Probably the first real science fiction film ever made, if you ever see it as it was ment to (check out local film art houses, and if they have an original Wurlitzer Organ playing along like they do at \\"The Tampa Theater\\" so much the better), you would see that it is one of the greatest films ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a great movie!","review":"And now better than ever with the 25 minutes of recently discovered footage. The quality is amazing. The clearest I've ever seen it. And now the story makes sense. There was always a feeling of \\"Huh?\\" when watching the edited version.It would have been nice if Kino included the documentary \\"Metropolis Refound\\", but I suppose they didn't because it was edited in standard definition and might have looked out of place. There is, however, a newly made doc using/interviewing the same people, but \\"Metropolis Refound\\" had a better flow and seemed more interesting to me.Awesome deal from Kino. Now if they would just release Nosferatu on Blu-Ray..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Complete METROPOLIS is beyond AMAZING!!","review":"KINO's The Complete METROPOLIS is a superb presentation of the classic Fritz Lang vision.

I am looking forward to sharing this amazing experience with my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"SPECTACULAR: Hat's Off to the Team That Restored Metropolis!","review":"The team that restored Metropolis has done an absolutely fantastic job. This is certainly one of the greatest silent films, and now we can see it again in all it's glory, as it was meant to be seen. Sure, there are some missing parts, but they have put in just the right title cards and stills to fill in those gaps. I could go on and on about the greatness of Metropolis and the restoration ... but I will sum it up in one word: AWESOME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie HORRID DVD","review":"This is the problem with movies that fall into the public domain. Anyone can release a copy and BUYER BEWARE! This version is one of the worst DVDs I have ever seen. You know right from the opening titles which don't fit within the frame. The whole thing looks like it a videotape of the film being projected onto a bed sheet. ....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Film, Horrid DVD","review":"This film is great, its a masterpiece, a classic, words cannot begin to describe both the importance of this film.This DVD, however, is horrid,, featuring a grainy picture, that at times looks like the film was stored, unprotected, in someones garage for 70 years, and music that seems to have nothing to do with the film.If you can't find any other version and really have to own a copy, then this may just be inexpensive enough for you to overlook the failings. Personally, I recommend the Kino version, which is now unfortunately out-of-print, and would never recommend the tinted 80's version as the soundtrack is just too distracting.One final thing: No matter what anyone else says, this version is NOT tinted. Only one tinted version exists, and this is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"sci-fi","review":"the special effects in this ancient movie are genius! any movie buff, especially of the silent era, needs to at least see this movie (if not own it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible quality","review":"I must add my voice to the chorus of disapproval surrounding the VHS and DVD releases of \\"Metropolis\\". The Australian release of this title is, I assume, identical to the \\"newly restored\\" 139 minute version mentioned in other reviews. Warning: this version is as bad as everyone is saying. The picture quality is appalling, the soundtrack complete shlock, and the film speed is crushingly slow; my memories of this great movie were dealt a severe blow. It was also embarassing to invite a bunch of friends who'd never seen the movie to sit through it. Please attempt to preview this transfer before buying, otherwise you may never watch another silent film again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great film, very poor transfer","review":"Save your money on this DVD. I have never seen such poor sound and picture quality on any tape let alone DVD. This disk was made by a roomful of monkeys, all of whom were blind and deaf."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Insult To Metropolis","review":"Metropolis is the outstanding masterpiece of Fritz Lang. The version recorded on this DVD, however, is an insult and a disgrace (hence the low price tag on it). There is no gray scale through much of the movie (faces are totally black in many scenes!), the quality of the print from which this was lifted is abhorent!If you want to see Metropolis in all of it's glory, find the Georgio Moroder version which was restored and re-released in the 1980's complete with contemporary soundtrack and color (in some scenes, mostly sepia tones). It's hard to find, but worth the effort - this DVD version is a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome Work of Genius","review":"This is the 3rd version of this pioneering Sci-Fi flick I now own and I am still awed by the advanced photographic techniques, visual composition and creative imagination born full blown from the brain of director Fritz Lang. Anyone who cares about the history of motion pictures should have this 'complete' version in his/her collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie restored again","review":"Just for all those people waiting for a better version of Metropolis: there's a new restoration! Yes, they've showed it here in Rotterdam (too bad I didn't know, I read it in the papers afterwards) and the reviews are very good. It seems to be a restoration that began in 1998 and was finished in 2000. I'll just wait till that version is on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BUTCHERING OF BRILLIANCE","review":"This may be the worst transfer in the albeit short history of DVD, but it might quite possibly qualify as the worst in the entire future of DVD transfer as well. It looks like some company decided to be the first out the gate with Metropolis on DVD and didn't bother to do much more than set a DV camera in front of a TV and taped the screen image of a bad transfer on VHS. I'm not sure which version this is in terms of content (there have been several different edit versions circulating on tape over the past twenty years or so). The reason I don't know is because I couldn't watch more than about ten minutes before I said, \\"Screw this!\\" and ejected the disc. The only reason I gave it one star is because \\"no stars\\" wasn't a choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY","review":"This DVD does no justice for this Sci_Fi classic. You would think if someone was to put Metropolis out on DVD, they would at least put out a quality print. Sometimes the images on screen are so bright, you're just looking at a white screen. The soundtrack sucks because for one it doesnt correspond to the screen action, and two, it sounds too \\"clean\\" for this terrible print. My advice? Save a few bucks and pick up the Giorgio Moroder version at an online auction house. The print quality is much better, it includes a few missing scenes and still shots, and if you dont like the early 80's soundtrack, turn the volume down and play what you feel like. I would have given it one star but it's such a great movie if you get the right version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, but geeeez","review":"I know this film is 75+ years old, but did they HAVE to use a master that was so badly scratched,scuffed, distorted and aged? As mentioned previously, the laser disc release was MUCH more pristine. I don't mind the music 'misplaced' with the action, and I'm certainly glad that I didn't shell out ten bucks for Bonnie Tyler yammering away on the late 80's release of Metropolis, but this DVD felt like it skimmed on quality to get it out of the door. Metropolis deserves better than this treatment, especially in a digital format. If we live in a society where Natalie Cole can sing with her dead father(and we do), we can see the negative to Metropolis restored."},{"rating":"1","title":"you won't believe your eyes (cause the print is that bad)","review":"Metropolis is a great film, and it's shocking that a print quality this bad is out there.

The picture quality of this DVD is the worst I have ever seen. There are better prints available to remaster it from. I have the laserdisc version and it is much better quality.

It is a well crafted story of opression of the working class when cold-hearted capitalism takes hold. What really impresses me about this film though, is the wonderful sets, which are very advanced for its day.The DVD of Metropolis on the other hand, doesn't do the film justice. The print is often so scratchy it is not exactly clear what is going on. If you cannot find a copy of this film anywhere else go ahead and get this. Only if a better copy can't be found though, because a clearer print would be worth the money. By way of extra features, this DVD only has one worth mentioning. This is the trivia game. At the end of the film there is a multiple choice game that asks questions about the content of the film. It's amusing, but only the first time you play it."},{"rating":"1","title":"keep your cash","review":"ce dvd est une horreur, je n ai jamais vu une aussi mauvaise copie de film, tout support confondu.je ne sait pas ou l editeur a trouver le master pour la gravure mais ca devais certainement etre au fond d une cave humide.la bande son est a pleurer et l image ...... et bien je ne prefere pas en parler on dirait un scopitonne des annees 40.de plus l intro du film est manquante ainsi que certaine scenes.enfin pour en finir garder votre argent jusqu a la sortie d une meilleur edition celle ci ne vaut pas un clou.conseil pour ceux qui comme moi ont fait l erreur d acheter ce DVD: revender le le plus vite possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flashbacks to the 1920's AND the 1980's in one DVD!!","review":"I have just about worn out the vinyl LP of Georgio Moroder's Metropolis I bought almost 30 years ago - fantastic music by some 80's legends. And I haven't seen the version combined with this music since our local VHS store finally closed down in the 1990's.

I'd give it five stars. Unfortunately, you can't give it a breakdown. Five stars film, four stars for music, etc... anyway...I think this film is fantastic. Every serious fan of the medium should watch this work. However, this dvd transfer is very disappointing. I'm not going to go on at length about it because I've read some very creative and, sadly, accurate descriptions of what it looks like. While this DVD is a bargain, it is not worthy of the film. Don't buy it and wait for a nicer version to come along.

Its a silent film, its expected to be grainy. But the music...one can only conclude that they found a cd of public domain classical music and played it for the duration of the film. Nothing matches. In fact quite the oposite. We have music from a comic-opera playing during what might have been a frightening stalking scene. While the children are drowning in the Depths we are treated to happy, playfull, down right romping melodies. What is supposed to be tragic is full of triumph. What is deep is comical. YOu say, it's just 8 bucks; its worth it to check it out. NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO. Buy ANY other edition but this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I threw my copy away.","review":"I'm writing this so you don't make the same mistake I did.

The tinted Moroder videotape version and laserdisc formats are much, much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy- under any circumstances","review":"If there were a 0-star rating, this would be it...The video is horribly cropped, as if they transferred it by zooming in on a TV playing the movie. The print is grainy and overexposed, even for a 72-year-old movie.The sound is a joke; the score feels like they're playing Muzak over the scenes.

Instead of going back to the higher quality new found elements and re-colorizing this film, they apparently just went ahead and shipped out the junky old version from 1984. There is a better, much cleaner version of this film online (albeit unauthorized by the studio) by a guy online by the name of 'Gilchrist'. I wish like heck the studio would have the brains to team up with the guy. But of course, they won't.

A muddy, scratchy version is introduced by title cards that go off the screen and a pretty bad musical score. Things get so bad that first time viewers will have trouble even figuring out what's going on. There are also the usual not-very-good Madacy extras (Poster, Biography, Trivia Game, Credits). In fact, the only reason that I haven't given this disgraceful disc one star is because the movie is just so good.A prestigious, fully restored and digitally remastered version with a full plate of extras has been released by Kino.

The original was severely edited and rebuilt over the years. Moroder took the basic, what survived film and added a [1980s] contemporary soundtrack. He did leave out some references to \\"moloch\\" and did not r-time the film to move in real time, rather than \\"jerky-time.\\" (For those who still do not know, film in the 20s ran at a slower frames-per-second than they do today...hence the jerkiness of the movie.

It never happened. In fact, I repeatedly wanted to hit the eject button on my VCR, but curiosity over this film's reputation kept me from doing so. Maybe this was the \\"Star Wars\\" of the 1920's.

Croatia, which was likely Hitler's greatest Nazi ally and conducted a brutal Holocaust against its Jewish and Serb minorities a mere fifty years ago, is according to McAdam one of the West's greatest allies and victims. McAdam's next \\"work\\" will likely be on how Nazi German death camps were actually work and rehabilitation centers for Jews!A shoddy work of little historical substance.A review of the Holocaust and Croatia's horrid role can be found in any library and will provide a reader with a very different perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a credible book","review":"McAdams' book is NOT a serious academic work on Croatia or the conflict in the former Yugoslavia but a pure propaganda piece. At times it crosses the line of what should be allowed to be published when it reduces the Croatian state's genocide in WWII. The only reason why somebody might want to read this book is as an example of the propaganda and lies not to believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally the truth!!","review":"Excellent written book by Mr. McAdams.

A big part of it is the songwriting, which is Billy's weakest yet (as of 1990); but then again, he wasn't helped by the extremely session-like dullness of new guitarist Mark-Younger-Smith, who made you wish Steve Stevens hadn't departed.The 'hits' (\\"Prodigal Blues\\", \\"Cradle Of Love\\", and their cover of \\"L.A. Woman\\") are fine, but toothless. After the pure pop decadence of \\"Vital Idol\\", I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised, but I was.

It's a very good mix of ballad and fiercely pumping arm tunes.While listening to this disc, I was flashng back to \\"rebel Yell\\", and \\"whiplash smile\\", and the Billy Idol I saw live in concert about five times. Even into the 90's, Billy was still pumping out some great tunes. His cover of \\"LA Woman\\", paid homage to Jim Morrison, and he added his own flavor to it. \\"Cradle of Love\\" is the first single, and I remember quite vividly that around the time of this album's original release, Billy Idol had a major accident on his motorcycle and with his broken leg, he made the video for \\"Cradle of Love\\".I still love his music now, after all these years. \\"Charmed Life\\" is a slightly more mature Billy Idol, who is still pumping that fist furiously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Men in black","review":"Great movie.

We missed it at the theaters so we were anxious for the DVD release.Besides being thoroughly grossed out a couple of times and tempted to shut it off and switch to something else, we stayed with it to the end. We struggled to stay connected to the film throughout, however. There was a lot more dialog and the witty comebacks between the main characters just seemed to fall short of their mark. The actors were excellent and did their best, but this version was a bit of a disappointment. There was action, but the tempo or pace of the film seemed off. The special effects were incredible, as expected.We'll be adding the DVD to our permanent collection as we already have the other two, but I don't see it getting watched a lot in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"So So...","review":"I thought this movie had a lot of potential but it is another case of the special effects and CGI being more important than the story line.

And, I do felt that this film can stand on its own without having to watch any of the earlier films. The most surprisingly to me was how Josh Brolin was able to portray the \\"young\\" Agent K so well and so convincing that I actually stood up in my room and applauded him for that.As for the concept of \\"time-travel,\\" it is fair to say that I expected the outcome the way it did.

But this third installment misses the mark. There's nothing new, other than a great portrayal of a younger version of K. Admittedly, the final 15 minutes are good, but it isnt enough to make the movie a good investment of your time. You'd do better to watch MIB or MIB II again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge let-down","review":"This movie was a huge let-down. The jokes are bad and the story is hard to follow and seemed like little thought was put into creating a compelling story.

There were real possibilities of humor that was missed due to a lack of imagination on the part of the writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Continues the MIB tradition!","review":"Sequels are typically disappointing, so my expectations for MIB3 were low.

This isn't Academy Award material and that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. But for those of us that enjoy this kind of movie I only gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because it's no longer as new and innovative as the original. However, it still retains the humor, effects and story line. For those folks that don't care for this genre of movie I don't recommend it, but for those of us who do - I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy of Tommy Lee and Will Smith","review":"This movie has everything you need: humor, action, Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, aliens, and a little bit of tender moments.

Sure Josh Brolin was a nice addition but totally under utilized. Will Smith looked more bored than the plot to be there. His performance rivaled some of the recently arisen on the Walking Dead. Someone thought, \\"sure, let's get the band back together one more time\\".

It was funny and then the fast pace. Exactly what I would expect from a man in black movie. I would put this on our with the first and second one. Definitely worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Terrific Entry in the Men in Black Series","review":"The high point for me in this film is Josh Brolin's amazing impression of Tommy Lee jones as a young man. The computer generated effect are amazing -- from alien effects to a terrific sequence where New York city goes back in time to prehistoric eras and back to the early 70s -- all in an instant. The effects are capped off by a shuttle launch sequence that that was equal to, and possibly surpassed \\"Apollo 13.\\" The dialog in places gets a little touchy-feely, and seems to go on for a bit too long in spots. Men in Black fans will not be disappointed in this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"It good.","review":"I thought thiss was a great movie! I was abit skeptical after the lackluster 2nd movie but I really enjoyed this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the first 2","review":"Usually movies get worse as they go, but we thought this one was even better than the first two. Totally worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, but too much swearing","review":"This was a great movie, but it could have been a perfect one if they had omitted all the foul words. I wouldn't allow my children to watch it because of that. Otherwise, it was another fabulous installment of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snore","review":"The story had a good idea, but it didn't follow through. I think it has the same problem as Terminator 3,4,5,etc... It is a new movie, but nothing new is really happening...save the world from the evil bad guy. I just thought the characters(good/evil) weren't set up to make you root for or against them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow start","review":"The chemistry between actors was good. Slow start to the movie had me wanting to turn it off. Glad I waited."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst MiB","review":"This is the worst of the MiB series. But I guess when you get to the third of any series that's probably going to happen. The villain in this one is ridiculous. Just bad. I do love Will Smith but even he can't save this one. I would only watch it again if it was free and I was really high, and there was absolutely nothing else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good as others","review":"The third movie in there franchise was just as good as the other ones. Would of been worth to see in the theaters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected","review":"There were a few corny, reused jokes from the rest of the series that didn't really fit the movie. Beyond that however, this movie had some excellent plot twists that I didn't expect, and I was pleasantly surprised in the way it concluded. All in all, it was a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"MIB does it again!","review":"Another delightful and entertaining yarn from the MIB folks.

Great Story telling","review":"Many of the characters were not very well developed other than Josh Brolin who was absolutely dead on with Tommy Lee Jones' character. Acting was excellent in that regard. Boris the animal's character was interesting but a lot seemed to be left out and kind of hollow as to WHY he did all that. I get that he had a grudge but still...K's character was rich but again seemed like a lot was left out and the story didn't explore that well enough, especially the relationship between O. and K.The story was funny and I highly recommend people to give this a good watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"MIB 3","review":"Brolin was.

My family found this one boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay movie","review":"Not as good as the first two, but worth it if you like the series. The younger version of k was funny"},{"rating":"1","title":"why was this movie made?","review":"I loved the zaniness of the original Men in Black. The sequel couldn't match the original, but at least had some funny moments. But I just don't get the decision to even make Men in Black 3. It's not as if the world was screaming for a sequel.Indeed, MIB3 lacks the humor of its predecessors. It tries to be a character story about Agent J and Agent K's origins. However, neither character is particularly interesting or worthy of a movie outside the trademark MIB humor. Agent J is just Will Smith being Will Smith, while Agent K is dour and humorless.MIB as a franchise just isn't about compelling characters - it's about alien gags. And MIB3 had surprisingly few aliens or alien humor, outside a bar fight in a Chinese restaurant and the main villain, Boris the Animal. Even the little cigar-shaped aliens only get a cameo.MIB3 is worth watching for fans of MIB, but it's a somewhat pointless end to the trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the high quality humor of the other ones","review":"Not the high quality humor of the other ones. Possibly took itself too seriously. Bad guys were overtly more violent."},{"rating":"2","title":"MIB3","review":"This one was weaker, but certainly more moving....the new, younger version of K was perfect and the very personal twist in the story line was great...but, it didn't seem to flow as smoothly as the others...I still really enjoyed watching it...it was fun..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best MIB Yet!","review":"MIB has been an ok series, nothing too special, but I really enjoyed MIBIII, much better story and I love the job Josh Brolin did playing a younger Tommy Lee Jones. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good as the first men in black movie","review":"Fun to watch.

We loved the ending and would like to see more in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good entertainment","review":"One of the few sequels to be better than the original. Josh Brolin is excellent as young K, and Will Smith excellent as ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good movie","review":"Great to buy movies through Amazon, where I can pay less for the same product. I'm always scanning at the store into my Amazon app on my phone to find out that I can just buy from home.

I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Loved the movie Men in Black 3...lots of action and a good story to go along with the action. The movie was actually better than I thought it would be."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother buying it","review":"I didn't have time to go see it in the theater so I was excited when it came up for purchase. What a disappointment. Gathered up the kids and the popcorn then fell asleep twice watching it. Save your money for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mainstreamed","review":"Not to say it was terrible, it had funny parts, a decent story, and good acting for the most part; the thing that kept me from enjoying more of it was the incessant subliminal suggestions that are wrought in everything I've seen out of hollywood as of the past few years (more than before anyway). The the spin-off references to esoteric information.. general corniness and unnatural quality of interactions between people.. you can go on about how I should lighten up and it's only a movie, but I enjoy movies w/ thought-provoking themes & substance with at least some metaphoric resemblance to real life.. this is in suit with more of the watered down, 'appeal-to-everyone,' cliche present in much of the media now. I still thought Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, and the rest delivered great performances, and it was entertaining aside from the aforementionables."},{"rating":"1","title":"50 bucks","review":"$50?!!!????

I'd watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"We were not impressed with the movie at all...no wonder it didn't do well in the movie theatre! Will Smith was great, as usual, but even he couldn't pull this movie through!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great followup","review":"You know what makes MIB great is it's whimsical approach to the sci-fi genre. It doesn't take itself to seriously, but it still has a great story line and lovable, approachable characters. This film seems to have lost all of those elements in an attempt to churn out another money making film for the franchise. But what else is new? Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humorous - Rental Time should be 48 hours not 24 hours","review":"It was one of the better Men in Black movies.

I was ready to turn it off at the restaurant. only the fish kept things going. about 30 minutes in one is either inured to how weak the writing is or it gets good enough to watch till the end. in some respects it is typical III of a series. the only thing keeping it going up to the weak end was the almost snappy patter of K and J. why O was even there is a mystery. Unlike I which is rewatchable at intervals or II which is significantly less rewatchable than I. I doubt I'll revisit III a IInd time."},{"rating":"2","title":"very interesting","review":"I enjoyed this movie.

The story line kept falling apart and the whole thing, in my opinion, was contrived, ridiculous, and just plain horrible. The concept was good but they totally missed being able to carry it out.

Heck, sequels are rarely that great. That said, the Men In Black series definitely lost its charm by the third movie.

If you loved the first two, maybe watch it, but I would not recommend watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG","review":"Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are way to old for this nonsense and look it. Emma Thompson was terrible. Must be her worst movie ever. The plot was sort of interesting. Josh Brolin's imitations of Jones' mannerisms was amusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch this if you like MIB","review":"This really is better than MIB 2. Great pace, awesome villain, you simply need to watch this if you like MIB. In some ways it reminded me of the cartoon series (I watched with my son), in that it is very inventive. I started the movie very, very, skeptically and quickly changed my tune. It was like, \\"aw...cool\\", \\"wow\\", and so on (sorry for the hippie vernacular, but it works well here). Will Smith does appear a bit tired, but wouldn't J be a bit cynical after a few years in the company? Much, much better than I anticipated, I am actually excited that they cared enough to do this one right. This has some amazing homage's after J travels back in time, it may take a couple of viewings.

Not easy to do in a film series of such visual & broad comedy. Made me want to watch the two of them again in 'No Country for Old Men', to see what a difference 5 years has made.

I had low expectations for this movie but it turned out to be really good. Will was funny in it actually much better than that lame ass last sequel. Tommy Lee wasn't in this one as much but Josh Brolin really did his thing to play a young Tommy Lee. Him and Will definitely made the movie worth while.

It is not easy trying to top the original movie let along making something coherent and excel with new one-liners.Yes why not time travel, revenge, and evil. Who would ever expect something hidden in a cake being brought into the jail?I will not go into detail as that is the fun of the movie as secrets review themselves.

The 1969 setting served the story well and the production design was faithful to the era. Josh Brolin makes a great \\"K\\" so it's disappointing that (save a spin off set in the early 70's) he will not get to reprise the role if there is a Men in Black 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of This World","review":"MIB 3 is very entertaining, and the addition of Josh Brolin as the younger version of K is inspired. The plot is surprisingly tight and the action is constant and lots of fun to watch. I haven't seen MIB 2, but this may be the best of the three. I'm only sorry I couldn't see it in 3D.

The only good part is the ending. Acting is just above mediocre, foul language comes around a number of times. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not as good as the first two","review":"I liked Will Smith but the synergy between Smith and the younger Jones was not there like it is between the older one and him. In the past the creature characters had a good vibe to them, there was some good and bad, funny and not so but all and all rounded toward the overall feel of the story. This one was overall just a bit darker in feel and the creatures rounded toward that. Too much drama.I have seen all the previous ones (and have the DVDs) but will probably not buy this one.If you loved the first two you will like this one, if not it will not improve your feelings about them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Movie","review":"I rented this movie via Amazon Prime on a Roku device.

He was disappointed in MIB2 and had heard some negative comments about MIB3.

Over all it was great fun and full of laughs, just what you would expect from this all star cast."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprisingly good","review":"I usually do not expect much from a 3rd installment of a francise movie but Men in Black 3 proved to be a good story. It succeeded in answering many questions one might have had from the other 2 movies. If this was intended to have been a trilogy, it was a nice, complete ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"When I heard there was a 3rd Men in Black movie coming out I thought it wasn't going to be very good (the second movie just didn't win me over as much as the first). I was surprised at how good this movie actually ended up being. It had a lot of the charm of the first movie and was able to tie up the Men in Black trilogy nicely. Also, Josh Brolin was amazing as a younger Tommy Lee Jones. Definitely worth watching this movie even if the 2nd one didn't impress you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb performances of all the cast of MIB3","review":"Very, very good.

It's obviously the most punk-like and aggressive song in their repertoire, but in my humble opinion it ain't the best. I'd vote THE MODERN AGE or SOMEDAY for that honor. I do hope at some point this is added back to the US release of IS THIS IT. I understand the reason behind keeping it off the album, but I think any intelligent person should be trusted to be able to differentiate between a young person's rebellious view of authority, and the truly heroic and selfless acts of the NYPD.

They're older, so the large numbers on this clock are a plus. I can see the time on this clock if I'm walking by the bedroom. Also, it has a gentle wake feature that's very nice to have should guests decide to get up at a certain time.Simple buttons, nothing too fancy or complicated, but with a sleek overall look to it, so my mother-in-law wouldn't think I put a junk alarm clock in their room to use. :) At the time of purchase, it was ten dollars from amazon, so I wasn't breaking the bank for a clock I'd rarely use.I've had this alarm clock over 6 months, it's kept the time right on, and I'm quite pleased with it. Should one of the two alarm clocks in our bedroom ever fail, I won't hesitate to confiscate this RCA Smart Snooze from the guest bedroom, and give it a permanent home on our own bedside table."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Alarm Clock","review":"The description provided is self explanatory. Ramping up of volume of buzzer is great, and provides a nice gradual awakening. One reviewer claimed that the buttons on the top are metal, and not plastic. This is NOT the case. The buttons are silver painted plastic. Overall - very happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"This is a good little clock for the price. It has two different alarm settings which is nice. I am happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst buy on Amazon ever! Terrible radio","review":"This clock radio does one thing as advertised, it takes up little shelf space. That's about it. And it is easy to use, because there aren't any features on the thing.They built better clock radios in the 1970's.If you wish to sleep to the radio, have fun trying to turn the volume down low enough so that is doesn't affect anyone else in the room; the sound cuts out right when the volume gets to just about the volume you want. And if you want to change the radio station, have fun doing that in the dark; the radio AM/FM band switch and dial locator (to switch stations) are located on the side of the thing. Why is radio station 95.7 past the 96 marker on the FM side?It was a terrible buy. Might serve it's purpose as a travel clock or for a hunting trip, but as a true home everyday convenient alarm clock, zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"RCA RP5400","review":"I first time I used the alarm, it was so loud I flew out of bed. It was not that loud when I set it the night before. So, after many attempts of trying to control the volume for the alarm, the next morning I didn't hear the alarm at all! Never woke up, was late for work. I spent an hour turning the knob up then turning it down and there is not a gradual increase or decrease in sound. So, after two weeks of playing with the volume control, it's going back! I have had enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"Purchased this product because we were looking for an inexpensive no bells, no whistles, DUAL alarm clock.

It was very difficult to tune into a station, and the reception was poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Expected","review":"I bought this clock/radio because it is the model they had in a hotel during my stay. I liked the gradu-wake alarm (the volume comes up slowly). I find that I wake up more natually. My old alarm clock would jar me awake.I also like that it has two alarms that can be used individually or together, and I like the dimming in the display.The radio function does not work. It worked for a few minutes and then it went to maximum volume with a lot of static, so it's useless as a radio but I don't use it for that anyway, so I'm happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Tuner","review":"I had to get another alarm clock. The tuning drifted terribly (they haven't improved this in the past 20 years?) and was beastly hard to try to re-tune, because the tuning dial is so small. I gave up on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Product","review":"Bought this for my mother who is in a nursing home recovering from surgery. Thought it would be nice for her to have a little music and see the time. The light on clock did not work from the start.

The \\"Lock/Wake 1, Wake 2,Time\\"button is hard to slide back and forth! What the heck is Wake 1 and Wake 2 anyway? You have to reset the alarm for weekend mornings or you're waking up at the pre-set weekday alarm time because there's no way to shut it off! Oh, and what's this whole \\"nap\\" button doing right next to the snooze button? Because if you want to snooze, you can hit either button, but if you hit Nap and mess with the nap minutes at all cause you're in a fog from having to wake up to go to that freakin' job you freakin' hate, you'll be snoozing for another MINUTE instead of the ten minutes you needed to defog! It's mean, just plain mean. And if the electronics engineer who designed this thing was standing here right now, this clock would be a part of his face right now! I hope everyone got a good laugh out of my diatribe/venting here...but, jeeze, this clock! I HATE it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the alarm clock & features, but it died after 3 mos. Bought another and it died 5 mos later.","review":"This alarm clock has two features that I love 1) the nap function, which lets you program the clock for naps in increments of 10 minutes, and 2) the gradually rising alarm buzzer that starts out as a very soft tone and eventually goes into full blast after about 15-20 seconds.The problem with this particular unit is that it keeps failing! I bought my first one from one of Amazon's resellers and that broke after 3 months. I then got another one from a local store and the LED's started failing one light at a time. Really weird. The radios continue to work on both units, but the lights keep going out.Poor manufacturing is my guess, and I'm out $50."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart Clock Radio","review":"The radio is exactly what I needed.

It was my first time using patch panels like this, though I have used various other punch-down terminations for some time. I was a little concerned by the low price but I was happy with how they worked and would buy them again.I liked being able to snap them off the bracket, punch down a new line, and quickly pop it back on the wall. I used a Fluke 110 punch down tool that neatly trims the end of the wires, but I believe a plastic push-in tool was included. I think it also included mounting screws but the board on the wall in the utility room where I mounted it was thin and I think I had to use my own screws. If I had one concern about it, it would be that the mounting bracket seemed a little flimsy and the panel was not held as tightly as I would have preferred. For all I know, this may be normal and nothing to worry about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good unit, a great price, and fast shipping.","review":"Have ordered this Intellinet 12-Port Cat6 Wall-mount Patch Panel before and I was happy with it.it is constructed reasonably well and functions as expected - no unwelcome surprises here.Doesn't say it in the description but the back of the block is 110 punch down."},{"rating":"2","title":"strait forward","review":"I liked everything about this product it was a nice complete kit for an air ride suspension that worked out great for my car.

For example, when considering the problem of rising unemployment in South Africa he argues that it is simply \\"largely a consequence of the government's efforts to protect workers\\" (p 223)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shackled Continent, Robert Guest","review":"The book is immature and riddled with inaccurate information and frequent exaggerations. Guest is no doubt an able communicator capturing your imagination but the book has more fiction than facts. One example is his reference to a purported myth supposedly rife in Kenya that any HIV AIDS positive sufferer can get cured by having sexual intercourse with a mad person.

I have made the mistake in the past of purchasing \\"cheap \\" memory foam only to be quickly disappointed. This is certainly not the case with this item. Very pleased with the purchase. The foam is good quality and although it has only been 2 weeks of use, it only seems to be getting better and more comfortable every night.Only 4 stars for a couple reasons; First of all, 5 stars has to be absolutely spectacular (which is a very difficult achievement) otherwise the only real complaint is a \\"minty\\" smell that is slightly overpowering.

I gave it to my son and daughter-in-law for their very hard futon (a bed of nails, really). They're in heaven! It transforms the worst mattress into a high quality bed, one that cushions your shoulders, hips and any other sensitive spots while offering excellent support at the same time. There's just one downside: they report that it's mighty hard to peel themselves out of bed in the morning, poor souls. I'm going to order another for my horribly uncomfortable guest bed. With Amazon offering such a great price and speedy delivery for Christmas, who could ask for more?Update - two weeks later: my son and daughter-in-law asked to return this because they've felt groggy and queasy every morning since putting this on their bed. Perhaps it's off-gassing? Allowing the topper to air out thoroughly before using it might help."},{"rating":"2","title":"really pleased","review":"I gave this five stars for the combination of comfort and price. I bought this for my teenage son who is temporarily sleeping on a hide-a bed from hell. I figured for the price, it would be worth it for a couple of weeks. It really has made a huge difference, and because it's so light weight, it will be easy to take with us when we move. I have a nice memory foam mattress cover for my bed. It's wonderful, but HEAVY. That's why we like this one - comfy, lightweight and cheap!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a comfortable night sleep","review":"we purchased the memory foam topper to replace our old one. The Sleep Studio Memory Foam Mattress Topper is much more comfortable and easy to intstall. Great price too."},{"rating":"2","title":"hello mornings with no backache!","review":"I started waking up every morning with an ache in my lower back. We had purchased a new firmer mattress about a year ago, so it wasn't that our mattress was old (we rotate it and flip it regularly). It wasn't a horrible pain, and it would go away after I was up and moving around. It was a nagging pain that would make me get up out of bed though. We didn't want to invest in another mattress so soon, so I read reviews on this topper. We love it. I can't say that my backaches immediately stopped, but even after one night, it definitely felt better. We're both sleeping much better and that's well worth the cost of this topper. We slept on it the first night and didn't notice any \\"chemical\\" smell, but maybe we're just less sensitive to odors than others. We're definitely pleased with the purchase and would recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid mattress topper","review":"It might smell a little when you first get it, but let it sit out for a day or so before putting it on your bed. Extremely comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bet!","review":"We purchased one for our queen bed, earlier this year and love it. It was about half the price as the ones in the stores. There is no plastic odor but a faint minty smell. This was the way to go since we did not want to purchase a new mattress. I recently purchased one for my sons bed. We bought his bed off of C-list, didn't want to pay alot for something he jumps on as much as he sleeps on it. You will not regret buying this, you will feel the difference when you sleep. We also got the waterproof mattress covers on Amazon, and they have really worked great protecting the foam pad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memory Foam Mattress Topper","review":"I was happy to find a mattress topper for a king bed that wasn't outrageously expensive. This topper is only 2' thick, but made our bed SO much more comfortable! It does smell a little minty right now, but that should fade over time. Overall I am very happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"son loves it","review":"I bought this for my (30 yr old) son.

I absolutely love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!!!","review":"I purchased this item after reading many reviews. I was amazed at how much better I felt after one nights sleep on it. It was easy to put on the bed and thats important to me since I live alone. There was no strange odor as is reported by some. I have recommended it to all my freinds and family! The price was very reasonable too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Purchase","review":"I was a little skeptical when I was reading the other reviews, but I purchased the topper anyway. We actually sleep more that 4 hours at a time now. We let the topper air our overnight in the spare room and we haven't had any issues with the smell that others talked about. The ventilation on this keeps you from getting too warm as your sleep. I don't want to get out of bed now, this has made a world of difference in the comfort of our bed. Very good product and the price was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't live without this topper!!","review":"Has made such a huge difference to the confort of my bed. I can not live without it. I LOVE it!!! Worth the money. Great on your back and you get a greats nights worth of sleep. Must have product!! Only negative thing is that I have a hard time getting out of bed because its just to darn comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelieveable","review":"I have only written one other product review in all my years using Amazon, but this product deserves attention. I bought one for me and one for my business partner and we actually leave them in storage at the overseas hotel where we frequently stay. Our three star hotel now feels as good as a five star. The old mattress is irrelevant. I don't think I will ever bother to buy an expensive mattress again because with one of these, you sleep like a baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smelly and Ineffective","review":"The first thing I noticed was how the item was packaged. No product information or instructions, just the item all wrapped up in plastic.Second thing I noticed was the smell. It has a chemical like smell that lingers.I decided to give it a go anyhow. We slept on it for a week and I think my back and neck hurt more than ever before. Definitely didn't improve my sleep experience.I'm not sure why other people are giving it such high reviews. I think you could buy yourself an egg crate for 1/4 the price and get the same results.I don't recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"too hard","review":"I did extensive research on different mattress toppers on Amazon and found that this was the highest rated. I seriously wonder if i received a 2\\" topper because it felt really thick and was very hard to lie on. It wasnt as soft as i wanted and it felt almost crispy to sleep. I slept on it for a while in hopes of it getting softer but it wouldnt budge. Sold to someone else instead.. what a disappointment.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre quality","review":"I've purchased a number of memory foam mattress toppers over the years, and I'd rate this one as the worst. The foam has very little memory to it, to the point where calling it memory foam really seems like a stretch. It compresses quite easily. Also, the topper is three inches shorter and two inches narrower than my standard-size mattress, which looks pretty bad. Granted, the manufacturer states the dimensions on the product page, so it was my fault for not reading carefully enough and assuming the topper would fit the mattress well. The other two toppers I've had fit their mattresses perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"prolongs mattress life","review":"Ever since private equity took over Sealy and Serta, leaving us without competition in the mattress market, mattress quality has plummeted. Mattress life seriously shortened. This foam topper will make your dying mattress feel good again. It is hard to describe the feeling of lying on it the first time, I wasn't sure I liked it. Now I am certain I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleep in peace","review":"We have a great mattress, however I would feel aches and pain after 4-6 hours of sleeping. I read an article that memory foam could help a person with arthitis sleep comfortable. The article was correct and I love the memory foam mattress enhancer. In fact,this is a second one purchased for our winter home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skeptical!","review":"Yes I was a little skeptical that this \\"mattress enhancer\\" would actually make a difference. Well it did! I had done all my homework to try to find the mattress enhancer that would be the best for the best price and I think this one fits the bill. I did purchase a queen size for my double bed because I had read that it runs small. It doesn't; however, with a large pocket fitted sheet, the mattress molds around the edges of the bed very nicely. I have found that I am not tossing and turning as much in bed and I don't wake up in the AM stiff and achy as I previously had on my standard pillowtop matress. It is a little warm to sleep on but I just adjust by not using as many covers. There definitely was an odor when it first arrived but after 2 days of airing the odor dissapated. I am very happy with this purchase and feel like it was a good buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad odor","review":"This foam mattress cover has a very bad odor. I tried to contact them at info@sleepquestions.net but could not find them thru google"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love my memory foam topper!","review":"I love the way the mattress topper feels on our bed. We have a new bed that was just a little too firm, but the topper makes all the difference. It is not too warm, but just makes the bed very luxurious! The only one complaint I have is that I purchased a King size for our King size bed, but it seems to be a little big and hangs over the edge a little. The sheets help keep it in place but either our bed is a little small for a king, or the pad is a little big. Overall, love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Smell Is Overpowering","review":"The most notable feature of this mattress is the smell. It was so bad that even after 2 days out of the package and airing it out we still couldn't sleep in the same room. Eventually we put it INSIDE our sleep number bed and we could still smell it through the top mattress covering for over a week. It literally took a month for this thing to not smell so bad we could actually sleep on it.The second thing is that we almost returned it. In addition to the horrible overpowering odor it also made the bed HOTTER. Within minutes it absorbs your body heat and throws it right back at you. The only reason we didn't return it is because our inner foam layer on the sleep number bed was torn and need to be replaced anyway. Luckily with this foam pad fits OK inside the sleep number bed, though it is a bit too large.Overall I would not recommend this product. It did not help cool the bed, make it more comfortable, and it stinks to high heaven."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regret buying","review":"Bought this with high hopes.I do not understand all the positive reviews. At least, what I received does not feel like memory foam at all. It feels like regular sponge which springs back after you press your hand on it. I waited too long to test it out. It had very strong minty odor when I received it. I left open it in a room in the basement to air out. Took more than a month to loose the smell. When I tried to use it, it did not feel like memory foam I have seen at friends homes. Then I tried basic pressing hand test. I press it and let my hand go, foam springs back to original shape immedately. Feels like regular sponge.I have a suspicion, they may not be shipping the same item to everybody. But, it is too late to return. I will swallow the loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT memory foam!","review":"This is not memory foam. If you press down on it, no impression remains. I purchased a different memory foam topper from Amazon back in May and it was wonderful...it took 2 days to fully \\"puff up\\" and it is VERY heavy. I would have bought this same item, but it doubled in price! I guess the secret was out. I then saw this foam topper and it had very good reviews. I unwrapped it and it \\"puffed up\\" immediately and it is no where near the 15 pound weight that it claims. It does have a nice chocolate-mint smell, however. I will be returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hot and soft.","review":"I had this topper on my Sleep Innovations 10\\" memory foam mattress. this combination is not good.

It's as hard as a rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very uncomfortable","review":"The memory foam is so cheap that any points of contact on your body will sink all the way to the bottom. I could not sleep at all on this given how uncomfortable it was. It certainly was soft (I also did find it slightly cooler than my previous one) but unless you are able to sleep with half of your body 3 inches lower than the other, do not buy. FYI I am 5'11, 165 pounds, and unless you're significantly smaller, I imagine you will have a similar issue. Amazon was great at processing the return, so worst case scenario you always have that option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Memory Foam","review":"This item is not as described by the seller. It is a very soft, non-supportive foam that does not have the true property of \\"memory\\" foam. In other words, it does not hold an imprint from pressure and rebound slowly like real memory foam does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"I have just returned my Mattress topper for two reasons:1) the mattress topper was not fully wrapped in stretch wrap, which is not very sanitary2) the product is dark yellow, and does not match the item in the photo."},{"rating":"2","title":"memory foam topper","review":"If you don't feel like spending the money on a new bed just yet this is for you.

I now believe this was a great deal! The item description said the material was Visco2 memory foam and mentioned nothing about polyurethane. When it arrived the sticker on it said the material was 100% polyurethane. I called the manufacturer and they said the chemicals in the mattress are what they label Visco2 but the foam itself is polyurethane. I believe they should clarify this in their item description. Since then I've looked up memory foam on Wikipedia and found that all memory foam is polyurethane foam with chemicals added to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Others","review":"This is a much better quality product than others I've owned, and it does NOT make your bed too warm. I live in FL, so this is a big consideration for me. Make sure to allow at least 2 days for airing out before putting it on your bed. I've been using it for 2 months now, and it shows no signs of uneveness or deterioration."},{"rating":"2","title":"memory foam mattress","review":"very satisfied with product.very comfortable on old mattress. good price. havent tried any other memory foam mattress enhancers, but am very happy with this one.my daughter got same mattress and i got mine on her recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slight Memory Problem","review":"This mattress pad bears no resemblance to \\"memory foam.\\" It is merely a 2-inch thick piece of foam rubber with holes in it, something that probably cost $5 to produce.

After adding sheets I laid down and was in heaven. It has made sleeping more incredible and comfortable on a nightly basis.

I've had this topper on my mattress for about a month and a half now and I can't explain the difference it has made in my sleeping habits. The only reason I gave it 4/5 stars is for the first 3 weeks it smelled really weird. Almost like bengay or some sort of muscle rub. Slowly it's going away or I'm getting used to it. But SO comfortable. To get a 3\\" and pay all that extra money is pointless, because the 2\\" works wonders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not real memory foam","review":"If you're looking for real memory foam, this isn't it, but it's a nice alternative to memory foam.

Unfortunately the product I received was quite different than the product advertised. Similiar to other comments left in 2012, the product is not memory foam.... or at least this foam had no memory, the density as measured by the product weight was also not as advertised. The entire shipping weight was 25% less than advertise. I don't have a way to actually measure the density of this foam, but based on the weight, I do not believe it to be the 3# density as listed.I had read the other recent reviews (2012) and there is a consistent message that the product currently shipping is NOT the product advertised on the Amazon listing. I should have heeded their warnings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for 3 months... only","review":"I loved this foam topper at first. Now, I have had it for 6 months and hate it.

I would not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrible side effect!","review":"Got the pad in a square box. Unwrapped, unrolled, tossed it on my old bed. After the first night, I woke up 3 hours late for lecture (I slept through the alarm). Ok, maybe I was just tired from all the box unwrapping and unrolling. Then second night comes along, I again woke up 3 hours later than usual (alarm was on). Astonished, I did a little experience: I slept in the afternoon which I never do. After laying on it for 5 minutes, I woke up in a daze. It was dark outside. I checked the clock and realized it has been 3 hours.Though super comfortable, this pad has terrible side effect(make you sleep too much); it's almost voodoo. Buyers beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE SAME PRODUCT AS EARLIER THIS YEAR","review":"I had to come and write a review bc I was so disappointed with this.I ordered this same topper from the same company for my king bed in January and it was fantastic. It was true memory foam. The hand print stayed for a few seconds. It was hard to move the box and get the topper out for my king bed it was so dense and cumbersome.I just ordered this product again from the same company in a Twin for my son's bed.When it arrived, the box was so light, I thought it was something else.No hand print at all. It's just foam, not memory foam.THIS IS JUST REGULAR FOAM WITH A $60 PRICE TAG. SO disappointing.FUTURE BUYERS BEWARE- If you're ok with regular foam, go to Walmart and get an 'egg crate' foam pad. It will pretty much be the same as this. If you want true memory foam, don't buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely soft-not a memory foam","review":"The density of the foam is wrong. This mattress has nothing to do with regular memory foam mattresses. Maybe some people like it because is really soft, but that is not what memory foam mattress should be like and that is not what I was looking for.With the heat of human body the foam changes its density to really, really soft (its like u don't even have mattress underneath you) and you just sink into it. There is definitely no hand as shown on the picture :) maybe, when its cold it's seems like memory foam mattress - but with your body heat it changes immediately to jelly.However, there was not bad smell at all. Morelikely it smells a little bit like green tea.. but only for first days and it was not disturbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleep on a cloud!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I must tell you, I did read the reviews of this product, and they were certainly accurate.This topper is wonderful. I have a sleep number bed, not the best one so I did need more cushion.Bought this and it is absolutely wonderful. I am a poor sleeper but since I put this on the bed,I don't want to get up in the A.M.I highly recomment this to anyone who tosses and turns and finds difficulty sleeping. Another pointmade, the price is wonderful, quality is great, and as for the faint smell of \\"mint\\" that wasmentioned, I found it rather soothing, but it does disappear in a couple of days."},{"rating":"2","title":"comfortable and affordable","review":"I was worried about the smell after reading other's reviews. Really hardly had a smell, just kept it out in the hall for a day before putting on my bed. Noticed my sheets smelled a little weird but after one change, smell is officially gone. For price, can't beat this, it's very comfortable and easy to put on the bed. No con's, other than the slight smell, as expected.. which was mostly gone within a day, totally gone within a few days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it.","review":"I'm very impressed with this mattress enhancer. I purchased it for my girlfriend's queen-sized bed and now I want one for the bed at my apartment. We didn't notice any odor after opening the packaging. We did air it out for one day before using it, but I think it would have been okay to use it the first night. The pad has good density and we've noticed much better sleep and far less achy joints in the morning. We're very happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Sleep","review":"I recently moved to a furnished apartment and the bed was like sleeping on the floor! It was like concrete.... I live in Cabo San Lucas and tried finding something here but to no avail..... I finally broke down and ordered this mattress topper and I am having a great sleep. My hands usually always fall asleep in what ever mattress I have had in the past and now my hands do not fall asleep so that is a bonus. I would recommend this bed topper for the price it works well. If it can work on a mattress such as this one it would work well for any mattresses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dense and functional","review":"When I received this matress topper, I was prepared to smell that horrid smell that most memory foam mattress have. When opening this very densely packed mattress toppper, I noticed that it smelt of peppermint-- almost a peppermint chocolate smell, it was nice and reassuring that I made the right purchase. When I put it on my bed, it wasn't wide enough, but it is very easily managed and molded to the size of your bed. I had to pull it here and stretch it there, but it finally fit the entire king size mattress and stayed in place! The mattress foam is so nice and comfy, it feels like I have a brand new expensive bed. The one down side, which doesn't effect its quality, is that you might need to switch to deep pocket sheets. Our original sheets have a hard time staying on due to the new founded mattress thickness. I 100% recommend this for anyone who is having back pain or joint pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps my guests comfortable on sofa sleeper","review":"I added this memory foam as an added layer to my guests sofa sleeper. Believe me that there is no sofa sleeper comfortable as a bed but this topper helps make it a close second."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Expected - Good Stuff","review":"This item was as we expected based on the reviews on this website.

All in all, a very good purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made a hard mattress just right!","review":"We purchased this for an IKEA mattress that was just a little too firm.

When I rolled out the mattress topper I was not impressed because the smell was so overwhelming. It wasn't as thick as I thought it would be until the next day. However, the first night sleeping on this mattress felt so comfortable since we have an old mattress it was such a good value because originally we were planning on purchasing a new mattress all together. This purchase saved us a ton of money. We felt like we were sleeping on a plush cloud. It's a great purchase I would recommend it to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice!","review":"Very comfortable, I sleep great on this thing. It's a little warm, I've woken up a couple of times and felt like it was making me a little hot but I wouldn't consider this a terrible thing. It kind of hugs you and this makes me sleep better in general. I'd recommend this and give it a 4 star rating any day. I bet you'll sleep better with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good topper!","review":"I bought this for my husband's hospital bed and added it to another piece of regular foam I was already using. I expecially liked the idea that it was ventilated. I really couldn't afford to get what I'd like to have bought (a Tempurpedic mattress, even if they made that size!) so I just kinda built it up to make it as soft as I could for him. The point is that is that he is very happy with it and that's what really counts!! I would recommend this product or the 3\\" which I see they also make as long as they are ventilated. I think that makes all the difference and, believe me, I've tried several products!This is great!Judy SnithSleep Studio 2-Inch ViscO2 Ventilated Memory Foam Mattress Topper, Twin XL"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good product and quick shipping.","review":"I really like this product. Although this is my first buy for a mattress topper, this product is really good and all the other reviews about this product were right on - I immediately saw the improvement in my sleep. Also, the shipping was really quick. Overall, I am really happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy with mine","review":"Despite some other reviews, I didn't find odor to be a problem. I unrolled and let it stay in the hot garage for 3 days before putting it on the bed.It was also sized well, fitting my twin bed just fine. Using a new mattress (Plush) it may actually make the bed a bit too soft.It doesn't seem to be made of the old heavy \\"memory\\" foam, but is lightweight. Soft but doesn't seem to have a lot of \\"memory\\", rebounding quickly from pressure.Good price , good (so far) product. As is the case with any of these foam products it does make the bed feel a good bit warmer with \\"hot spots\\" developing if you stay in one place too long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less tossing and turning, updated 1 year later","review":"I am updating my original review, which follows this. After one year and 2 months on the bed, it had to be removed. Strangely the foam seems to have hardened and is not as pliable, soft or \\"cuddly\\" as before. It had to be taken off the bed and is on its way to the trash dumpster. Lots of money to spend for 14 months of use. Original:I went from a total memory foam mattress to a coil mattress and needed just a little foam on the top to make it \\"just right\\". This mattress topper did the trick! It so far, has not made me have any night sweats, which is a problem I had w/the last memory foam mattress I had. It has a nice green tea minty smell and cuddles me when I sleep. Very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable but smelly.","review":"Received the mattress topper 2 days after purchasing (chose regular shippping). The topper was vacuum sealed and just needs to be aired out. I would let the topper air outas well for the smell! There is a horrible smell that I am sure is from the chemicals that are used to make it. Other than that the first night that we used the topper on our bed we both slept great! I just hope the smell goes away."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Far Great Product!","review":"We've had this mattress pad now for 4 months. It's just as comfortable now as it was on day one. There was never any awful smell like prior memory foam products we'd ordered. It's not too hard or soft and doesn't take much time to mold to your shape. I would highly recommend one to anyone looking to make their existing mattress more comfy."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO COMFORTABLE","review":"I have always wanted a tempur pedic bed but because of the price never got one.. this gives me the same effect and feeling for such a affordable price.

They seem a little firm compared to other memory foam I've tried, but overall very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this! Great purchase!","review":"As a college student, I wanted to save money when purchasing my bed, so I bought the most basic queen mattress the store offered. I figured I could invest the money I saved in cheaper alternatives to make my bed more comfortable. What a great decision! I purchased this mattress pad a week and a half ago and it is amazing. I honestly feel like I'm floating on a cloud. Although I haven't had it for that long so I'm not sure about the long-term durability of this product, I am very impressed thus far. My only tip is to know that it smells very strong of mint for the first few days. However, that was a good quality to me! I would suggest this to anyone looking to make their bed more comfortable without breaking the bank."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahhh Sleep......","review":"I've been contemplating buying a new mattress because of sore hips waking me up during the night even tho my mattress is only 3 years old. So I searched and read all the reviews on the memory foam mattress and thought I'd give it a try. The day it arrived, I unpacked it, laid it out on top of my mattress, and swore to myself, I'm sleeping on this tonight!!! Next morning I could NOT believe how good I felt. No waking up in the middle of the night, no sore hips. I 'strongly' urge others to try this topper. You will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing for Bedresters!","review":"I bought this after being in a lot of pain from complete/strict bedrest in my pregnancy. The first night I used it, I slept the entire night and woke up completely pain-free. It was incredible! It's been about 10 weeks and I am in love. I bought a second one for where I lay during the day. I am so glad I purchased this."},{"rating":"2","title":"get bigger size pad","review":"This is a five star pad, but only gets 4 stars because you need to know that you should get the larger size foam, then cut it to fit your mattress (as the mattress foam sizes are all slightly smaller than the size of mat they're made for). I didn't find it smelly, but I did air it out for like an hour. I also didn't find it too hot. It makes a very nice memory foamish cushion. I'd also recommend getting a mattress pad to put over the foam, like:Newpoint International 370-Thread Count Mercerized Cotton Queen Mattress Pad."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best","review":"Having college kids on the move for several years, we've tried a lot of different toppers, including other memory foam. This one is one of the best ever. If you want to turn a tired old mattress into comfort then this is the one. With memory foam you get what you pay for, this one is top shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pregnant womans savior..","review":"Truly! At 7 1/2 months pregnant, sleeping is almost impossible. I was amazed with the shipping speed, we're overseas (APO) and got this in a week.. that's impressive considering the weight, etc.. I wasn't expecting it for at least another week. It's true that you need to air it out before use.. NEED to. Unless you want a headache from the smell, (and I'm not sensitive to smells at all!).. but when you climb into your bed for the first time after putting this topper on.. your aches and pains just melt away.. it cradles you perfectly, and the 2\\" is perfect, thick enough that it makes a real honest difference. It's an amazing value for the price, easily the best purchase I've made on amazon.. and I've made plenty! If you're considering I would recommend, I can't imagine why anyone would regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy","review":"Was presently surprised at how much we like this mattress topper. As we were doing price matching prior to purchase, we were a little concerned about whether we would get a good deal for our money and we're very happy with this product. I have less pain in my lower back and our bed feels like new.Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"The product was delivered late, but i cant put the fault on the product or amazon, I hate fedex. The memory foam took a little muscle to unpackage, it was cold out and was just about frozen solid. Once we had it unwrapped i placed it on an open area and let it sit for about 2 hours we did some holiday shopping, once we return the foam had been restored to its original shape and only a slight odor, I let it stay for a few more hours and the odor is pretty much gone. we used it that night, it fit nicely and its very comfortable, the odor was completely gone in a few days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made a hard sleep surface much more comfortable!","review":"I recently bought a new Captain's bed (with storage underneath) that required me to get rid of my boxspring and put my mattress directly on the wooden slats of the bed. The result was a bed that was far too hard to sleep on comfortably! I bought this mattress topper to try to combat the problem and it has worked out wonderfully! I've been using the topper for about a month and it's super comfortable. I like a firm mattress in general, but the combination of this topper and my new bed work out perfectly. I don't get too hot or sink too much (as I think some reviews have stated). This topper is well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleep Studio 2-Inch ViscO2 Ventilated Memory Foam Mattress Topper, King","review":"Bought this pad for a 15 year old mattress & it feels like new. Finally getting good night's sleep & waking with much less pain. I would recommend this mattress topper for any size bed, was convenient for me since they only sell king mattresses in sets with box springs, and couldn't afford that.With this foam topper I think I can get another year or 2 more use before having to replace the entire mattress set.Would purchase one even if I purchase a new mattress.Sure is nice & soft, if you prefer that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Topper","review":"We purchased a new mattress deciding on a firm base after reading of disappointments in the toppers on mattresses that are part of the product. Since this is the weak link on a good mattress, we decided to just replace this when needed. This product is very comfortable and filled our needs for now. It can be replaced as needed for much less than the cost of a new mattress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for daughter's dorm room","review":"I purchased this for my daughter who had complained that her college dorm bed was very firm and uncomfortable. I had it shipped to her college and it arrived in four days via standard shipping. She opened it and after allowing it to expand for a few hours, she placed it on her bed. She informed me that there were no odors (no complaints from roommates either) and therefore no need to air it outside like some other reviewers have described. She reported that it is extremely comfortable and that she now enjoys deep long sleep (when her busy schedule allows!). I should mention that I purchased the Xlong twin to fit her bed. She reported a perfect fit. She particularly likes the fact that this mattress topper has a removable and washable cover. Great product and service."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've never seen anything like it!!!!!","review":"Now that I've got your attention, it's pretty decent. A chemical odor that lasted 3 days - yes. Did it fit my queen decently - yes. Will it REALLY ventilate - Maybe. I will write a follow-up during the summer months. I am a 6 ft, 215lb guy and the 2 weeks I have slept on it, it has supported me well , even with all the little holes drilled out of it for said ventilation. I went to all the \\"Beyond\\" kinda places and the prices were double for a comparable item. I would recommend this. And I am not an avid recommenda!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems like a bait and switch","review":"Not as advertised . Do not be fooled by the reviews. Check out the recent reviews. Waste of you time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look nothing like the picture","review":"When i open the package i was really disappointed, my mattress pad is hard, flat and the length is shorter then my mattress. Don't worth it for this price. Very unhappy with this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not super impressed","review":"This mattress topper was okay for the money I guess. It doesn't look very high quality as it's kind of discolored and the edge is kind of jagged. It's relatively comfortable and for my purposes (which was a way to buy time with my current mattress until I buy a new one) it works but ideally it wasn't what I had hoped for. If it weren't so big & bulky & hard to package back up I probably would have returned it because of the lack of quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheapened product","review":"I just received this mattress topper in a twin size and I am very disappointed. A few months ago, I got this same mattress topper in queen size and it was excellent, nice and firm. The twin sized mattress topper that I just received is much, much softer, more like foam rubber than memory foam. I will talk to my daughter about whether it is worth keeping, but you should know, that in my experience, the positive reviews that are posted are for a very different product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely little topper","review":"This thing is great. Had it for a couple weeks now, and definitely very happy with it.Pros:I no longer wake the girlfriend up when I roll over.My back doesn't hurt anymore.It's lovely and soft.The \\"fresh foam\\" smell that we got was actually quite minty and still lingering. We are not upset about this, as it is nice.Normal fitted sheets have no problem fitting over it. In fact it has made our sheets fit better - rolling over no longer bunches them up on one side, for example.Cons:It doesn't make me breakfast.I can't take it to work with me and lay on it all day.Seriously, this thing is great.Also, I dunno 'bout people saying this makes their bed hotter. Have not had that experience at all. Not even a little. Can't say it's made it much cooler, but certainly not hotter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enhanced our sleep...immediately!","review":"It did take about two nights of sleeping on the pad to get used to the \\"new\\" bed, but once we did, we had significantly better sleep. A great addition to any bed. The only thing I've discovered about memory foam that I don't like, is that it's much harder to move around on. Flipping from one side to another is more difficult. So we did notice that even though our queen size bed became much more comfortable, it also felt alot smaller to us, because we weren't able to move around as \\"freely\\" as before."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOXIC SMELL","review":"The smell is horrible and it contains chemicals that cause cancer. I aired it out, hung it up outside for over a week and it's still smelling horrible. If I had known it causes cancer I would never have bought it. What a waste of money and a hazard to the public."},{"rating":"2","title":"terrific product","review":"Has saved back. Cool, clean, non-smelly, comfortable. Minimal packaging. All that you could ask from a foam mattress cover. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Love It :-)","review":"I've only slept on it for a few nights, but I have to say it is very comfortable. It does have a strange smell, reminds me of mint chocolate, which is bearable, not overwhelming. Fits my mattress wonderfully. I have had problems with my hips and lower back, and so far I have woke up with no pain. I bought this as I couldn't afford a new mattress at this time, and this is the perfect alternative. Now I want one that fits my work chair. :-) A good buy, would buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"We purchased this topper because of our own arthritis and pain and it seems that our 3 dogs are happier sleeping on it too. Now we have to drag them out of bed in the morning. Super comfortable! Our pain has decreased since sleeping on the this topper. I highly recomend it and the price is very fair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy college kids","review":"Bought 2 of the toppers for my daughter and son who are in their second year of college. Both rave about the comfort and fit is perfect for the Xl twins in the dorms. Great value"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"Recent reviews are correct. I own a memory foam mattress and wanted something to top an airbed. Its worse than foam I bought from the hobby store for a project (which was also way cheaper). You're getting about 5 dollars worth of foam. I would rate this less than 0 stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not memory foam","review":"We bought one of these toppers in December of 2011 and LOVED it! We just bought another one and it is not the same quality. We took it out of the box, left it for 24 hours and it had no memory foam capability. We are returning and looking for a new memory foam topper, so disappointing. Based on some other reviews of recent, I have to agree that they have reduced the quality of their product and it is not up to par. I do have to say though, Amazon is awesome about their return policy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"We ordered this mattress pad because we have an Ikea mattress that is starting to smoosh down and is not very comfortable. It is extremely soft and my boyfriend and I sleep amazingly well every night now. The first night we got it and slept on it we weren't sure if we liked it. I think we just weren't used to how soft it is yet. Now we love it and cant believe we slept without it before. I have no more pain in my shoulders and hips from the hard mattress and i don't wake up through out the night anymore. I definitely recommend this mattress pad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best sleep ever","review":"I got this just 2 days after I ordered it. As many have said, it has a mint smell which I actually liked. It went away after only a few days. I opened it on the living room floor around 4 in the afternoon and put it on the bed around 4 hours later and every thing was fine, sheets fit no problem. My mattress was about 15 years old, hard and worn out. I now sleep thru the night and don't want to get out of bed, it's so comfortable. I see it's $100 now I got it for around $85 just a few weeks ago but it's still worth it. This is really one of the best things I have done for myself in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"There definitely was an odor. Oddly enough it smells like mint chocolate chip which is really just more annoying than horrible. I let it air out for 36 hours but it still smells up my bed. After sleeping on it, all it did was shift the pressure point I had in my shoulder without the topper to my hip with the topper. It also makes the bed very warm. I enjoy being able to move to a cooler spot and now there are no cool spots. That's nice when you first get into bed on a cold night but not toward the morning as you're trying to cool off"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"The only reason I didn't rate this 5 star is because they seem to run a little on the small side. I suggest you order a size larger that you really need. You may have to then trim in a little but I like mine to go all the way out to the edge of the mattress underneath it. It was easy to trim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately Unhappy","review":"We purchased a good mattress, but when we got it home discovered it was absolutely TOO hard. For years we have been complaining about it and have used the inexpensive \\"egg crates\\" which provided a softer, more restful sleep. When we saw the Sleep Studio Ventilated Mattress Enhancer, we were so excited to think that finally we had found the answer to our sleepless nights. We were very disappointed. There was just \\"something\\" about it that was not comfortable. We both tossed and turned all night. The bed was too warm...and it was winter time. We didn't want to take a chance of roasting in the summer so we returned it to the company. The return process was very easy and we appreciated being reimbursed quickly (minus shipping costs which we were happy to pay). We're headed to Walmart for a couple new \\"egg crates!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Revolting, powerful odor","review":"There's a small slip of paper included with this product that warns that the product may have a \\"Fresh Foam\\" smell.If you're set on buying this, make sure you have an outdoor space you can air this out for at least a few days. I live in an apartment where no such space exists. My entire apartment now strongly reeks of \\"Fresh Foam,\\" which, to me, smells like being trapped inside a box of Girl Scout Thin Mint cookies. The odor is so strong in my apartment that I'm literally dizzy. Sleeping on the pad, even with it wrapped in layers of sheets, is impossible. I cannot overstate how powerful the scent is.Needless to say, I'm sending this back to Amazon. I need to get it out of my apartment as fast as possible. I'll never buy bedding online again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave it a try..........","review":"I have always been interested in a memory foam mattress, so I thought this would be a good first stepto see what they might be like to sleep on. From prior experience with feeling the substance in stores, it seems great and it looks like it would be comfortable. Wow, was I wrong! Your body sinks into the foam and it feels really weird - not comfortable to sleep in or watch TV in, no support. Just my opinion. Keep in mind I am used to a firm, \\"pillow top\\" mattress.If you've used memory foam mattresses and like them, this may be for you.However, for me I'm taking it off today (after 2 nights), due back pain, problems sleeping, and oh, yes...the smell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this!","review":"I never write reviews, but this thing is awesome. I had really bad back pain in the mornings and couldn't even bend over...after buying this, the pain is gone!

So comfy and I loved the green tea scent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Improves any mattress","review":"My daughter is renting a room, and the bed furnished was not very comfortable.

However, after letting it relax for a few days, the memory foam really softened up and the odor disappeared, so hang in there. All in all very pleased.

However, as many others have reported, it is a different kind of pain. It was fascinating to look in the mirror and see myself standing straighter and walking straighter from better spine alignment. We have been using it 3-4 weeks now and it definitely is not as \\"cushy\\" as it started out, but it still has extended the life of our sagging mattress.

It is the second one I've bought for two different beds. The quality and price can't be beat by any of the stores I shopped at.

The two inches is quite comfortable and adequate for comfort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome mattress topper!","review":"We needed an extra bed for some guests and instead of buying a cheap bed or inflatable mattress, we purchased this mattress topper. I had used a mattress topper (although not as nice as this one) during my college years. Anyway, the mattress was much better than expected.

We couldn't afford $500 for a pillowtop mattress for him, so we started looking at mattress pads to at least make him more comfortable. When we first opened the pad, I was concerned because there is a strong odor, but I unrolled it on the floor and let it air out for a couple of hours, and it was fine after that. It fits just right on his bed, allowing me to still use his sheet sets with no problem. It makes his bed SO much more comfortable! Now we all want one for ourselves!

But that thought instantly got away the second I laid my body on top of it. It was so comfortable that I could slept through without turning my body in the middle of the night liked it has always been. I couldn't feel my actual mattress below the topper and that's amazing. Compare to a memory foam mattress price that is easily $1,000+, I would recommend this topper to anyone whose looking for a nice and comfortable memory foam bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"COMFY!","review":"These things are the way to go!

I was so excited to get this. I tried it for one week but my sleep was so terrible that I decided to return it. Like the other reviewers said, it's not very memory-foam-ish. It doesn't spring back up when you put your hand on it. It's just a bit denser than a regular egg-carton foam topper. I wanted some extra padding on my futon mattress because I was starting to feel a hint of the metal bars on my bed frame. However, I could still feel the metal bars even after I put the topper on! I was better off just buying a quilt on sale for less money but provided better padding than the topper. I was fine with the minty smell - it made me think of mint chocolate chip ice cream which I bought later that week.ps - I do not weigh that much and my futon mattress is not the thin cheapy Walmart/Target type so my bed issues were not like I had a total crap problem and expected the product to work miracles."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong size or wrong foam dencity?","review":"Received item was marked as quenn size on the box but it was 5lbs lighter than the sizing table on the plastic packaging cover.

It was a little smelly when I pulled it out of the packaging, but the smell disappeared in a day or so (we put it over the railing outside overnight). We used this in our camper since the beds are thin foam mattresses and very uncomfortable.....this made a world of difference!

One had a defect and was exchange without a problem. One topper had no bad smell.

No more aches that force me to move around all night. It's just soft enough to provide amazing comfort but not so mushy that it defeats the purpose of a firm mattress.

It's worth every penny and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memory Foam mattress topper","review":"I purchased this topper for my daughter while away at school. The bed furnished by the apartment was a hard as a boxspring, so she needed something to get her through her college years.

I unzipped the topper and placed the memory foam inside and my back is not hurting anymore and I'm sleeping like a baby. This product has saved not only my back but my sanity.

The new one is still not terrible and it became about $20 cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ohhh That Smell","review":"As someone else commented it has a scent to it from the natural materials used to procue it. The smell isn't gone yet after 3 months so I purchased a mite proof matress cover to try and seal it. Cuts down the scent about 50%. Using a lot of Fabreez Linen Scent spray.

My wife and I were talking about how hard the boat cushions (4\\" thick) were and how we could solve the problem. She mentioned a memory foam topper, so I got on Amazon to see what was available. After reading the reviews for this product, I decided to make the purchase. What a great decision! This 2-inch mattress topper added to the boat cushions made sleeping so much more comfortable and was worth every penny. I just had to trim 2 inches off the width due to the odd size of our cushions and it fit perfectly.

Decided to purchase a queen size two months later and no memory effect. Requested an exchange, and the replacement has the same memory issue (leaves no imprint - kind of like pushing down on a sponge - just bounces back quick). Tried to contact the manufacture (got the number from Amazon) and the number doesn't work! I figured that maybe they had a bad batch so I request a refund of the second queen size and ordered a King size one thinking it would be the same as the king I purchased a few months ago. The king came and has the same issue. I will be returning that one and maybe look for something somewhere else. Love the product if it would stay the same quality as the 1st one I purchased a few months ago with the memory effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard and Smelly","review":"I laid this topper out for days but the mint smell was still very strong, although not as bad was when I first pulled it out (my whole apartment smelled for two days!). Desperate for a good nights sleep, I still tried to put it on my bed. I can't believe how uncomfortable it was. I used to have a foam topper on my old bed so I was shocked at how hard this one was. It takes a while to \\"sink in\\" and forget if you want to move or roll over cause that re-adjustment period takes a long time and is painful if you have a bad back, which I do. I felt very claustrophobic when on my side and realized this topper was not what I was hoping for. I removed it and had to have help getting it back in the box but once I did, of course Amazon made returning it easy. I have ordered a different kind and am hoping this one feels like the cloud that I remember from my old topper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bait and switch -- Beware!","review":"Length:: 0:12 MinsIt seems that this company had sold a decent product. However, the product that I received (and several other recent purchasers) was inferior.First, it is not memory foam. This short video demonstrates there is NO memory effect.Second, the density is not as stated. This is confirmed by the shipping weight of only 12 pounds, when the listing states 16 pounds.We sent ours back and were promptly refunded by Amazon. We found another product on Amazon that is the proper density and is memory foam (we paid a little more for it).

You basically bought a ordinary foam which absorbs water and give you a feeling of sleeping in water and coldness if you want to buy this one. Very bad experience, and my back hurts after I started using this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toxic gas release","review":"This topper feels good, but it gives off toxic gas.A perfumy scent that the manufacturer has presumably applied and possibly other gasses are being released from the foam. This may be the cause of an unusual fuzzy feeling in my head and respiratory inflammation from sleeping only one night on this topper. I am not generally sensitive to chemicals. I have uncovered the foam and opened the windows to give it a good chance to air-out. I patted the foam firmly all over, flipping it periodically through the day to encourage the release of trapped gas.I have given this product a rating of one star because it is not usable due to toxic off-gassing. I am returning this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Memory Foam, Do Not Buy","review":"Please see other most recent reviews, this is a regular (overpriced) foam mattress.

I just cannot deal with the smell of this thing. It's been weeks. I've left in out uncovered and it stunk up my entire apartment with a strong chemical smell. After about a week, I put it on the bed hoping that between the mattress cover and the sheets, it would be okay. It still totally stinks. It's a sickening smell I can't really compare to anything else. As far as comfort, it's okay, but what difference does that make if one doesn't get good rest due to the odor. I'm looking into whether or not it's returnable, but either way, I'm getting rid of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for college","review":"Wow I must say that this has made a world of difference for me. If going off to college, this is a perfect investment to circumvent the not so desirable mattress given to you. While some people may say that it wont hold up, if I get three years out of it (the time I have remaining in school) I will have gotten my money out of this! Lastly, this would make a great emergency futon of need be. When I got it, I was letting it air out for the 48 hours as described. However, when my sister came to visit I have her my bed and went to the couch. Through his bad boy on it and had a great night of sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deception","review":"This products big selling point was that it was memory foam.

I sleep mostly on my side and ended up sinking towards him all night, leaving me crunched and in pain. Visited the Chiropractor yesterday and was feeling great, woke up this morning not so great. I ordered this mattress topper Sunday night, and it came today, Thursday. I just barely took it out of the unusually and impressively small box, and made the bed. Not 30 minutes later, I am lying flat on my back, super relaxed, and contemplating a rare afternoon nap.

Had I the chance to do it over again, I would have:* Ordered a little bit thicker topper (3\\" if they have it)* Found a mattress with a little more resilience (density?). The topper compresses quickly when I lay on it. It would be good to have something with a little more support.Overall, nothing major.

I took it out of the packaging an it plumped right up. I was kinda worried about the reviews of the bad smell.. But it doesn't smell bad at all. I mean it doesn't have a fresh out of the dryer scent but its still not bad. The smell reminds me of a chocalate mint for some reason. Lol. The topper is great!!

Sweetheart that she is, she loved it all the same. We put it on a used full size mattress we had in a camper. It did seem to keep us cooler, which can be a rarity with memory foam toppers. It really does make the bed more sleepable and comfortable. We've been completely satisfied with it. We've been using it for the past 6 months. It was really an incredible buy on the budget I was on at the time. If I had to do it over, I would do it again. Really seems to be a quality product and it's performance has been great.

If you're looking to make a firm mattress softer, this is what you need.

Order at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not memory foam","review":"On a positive side, it is 2 inches thick and fits a queen sized bed perfectly fine as advertized. On the realistic side, it is only made of regular foam, not memory foam as advertized. If there is memory foam in it, it is only a very small percentage. I thought 2 inches would be good to prevent body aches from laying on a firm mattress. However, 2 inches is too thick creating pockets where one lies on the bed. I believe a 1 1/2 inch thick mattress would be better. On the negative side, there is not the cushioning and coming back to regular shape like memory foam. It is a regular foam that creates more of a pocket where you are lying. Through these pockets I am not sure if it is the cause of current back ailments or not. It is still in the testing phase. Personally, I would not purchase this product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst three nights of sleep","review":"I bought this from Amazon. Shipping was fast as usual.The dimensions of the topper were correct, fitting perfectly a queen-sized bed. The foam expanded in about one minute to final shape. The weight of the foam was 19 lb, which does not fit the stated foam density.I had the chance to try a Tempurpedic matress briefly at a Mattress Firm store and there is no comparison between the materials. The foam of this topper is almost non-memory when compared to a tempurpedic material, bouncing back to the original shape in less than a second.Now to the sleeping experience: Granted, my preference is for the firmer matresses. However, the \\"sinking\\" feeling was so annoying and moving difficult, and both wife and myself has the worst three nights of sleep in our lives before we returned it.Didn't work for either of us, that is for sure.

I adjusted the springs which are spring cylinders to match the lowest tension for .22 bullets and it was still VERY difficult to swing some of the targets from side to side.The steel work is very solid and the construction is good quality, the only issue is with the springs which should allow the target to swing to the other side when hit.I inspected the target to see if there was any way to maybe fix this and all the spring workings are internal.

Number one, whenever my baby wiggles or moves he starts to slide down or into an awkward angled position so that eventually he ends up either with just his head on the wedge or he's lying completely perpendicular to where I placed him which defeats the purpose of the product. It needs something additional to help keep baby in place. Second, I don't like vinyl type covers on baby mattresses because they don't allow the baby's skin to breathe and he end's up with his back covered in sweat.

The wedge comes in 2 pieces of foam, and the foam is inserted into the cover. The foam isn't the problem, it's the cover.

If the zipper were on the side, the product would be great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two pieces of foam!","review":"After reading the reviews, I decided to risk it and buy the product. Unfortunately, I got the two pieces of foam with the zippered cover. It was not expensive enough to deal with the hassle of returning it.

There is a little \\"bump\\" where the wedge meets the mattress."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is your TV packaging material","review":"You will receive two pieces of thermocol and a zipper bag. You need to stuff these pieces into the bag which will make it a split bed (uneven) for your baby. I believe the reason they send you two pieces is to reduce the cost of transportation.

The doc's office says they don't really stand behind that since nothing is supposed to be in the crib. Also, my baby had trouble sleeping when I tried it. Not sure if it was just that she wasn't used to it or because of the separation/zipper in the middle of it making her uncomfortable. I tried putting it under the mattress instead and my baby was sideways in the crib from rolling down. I think it raised it too much. I just gave up on it. I would suggest saving the money and trying rolling up towels under the mattress!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"Purchased this item since my daughter has acid reflux and can not sleep laying flat. I was unsure how she would do with it so we just tried it at nap time. Everytime we put her down it wouldn't take her long to slide down and almost into the bumper (she is only a month old).

I'll say that it's a poorly made product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby Slides Off","review":"My daughter has reflux and we purchased this wedge in the hopes that she'd be comfortable sleeping on her back in the crib while slightly elevated. This is not helpful. We placed it under her sheets and mattress cover but all my daughter did was slide right down or off to the side. You can probably get the same effect from strategically folding towels. I wouldn't recommend this to help your baby with reflux sleep.Ultimately, we purchased the the Fisher Price Rock 'n Play for our daughter instead after reading a bunch of reviews from parents with refluxy babies and our daughter LOVES it. It sits at an angle, cuddles the child's sides, and allows you to physically rock the baby back and forth as she goes to sleep. Unhappily, our girl loves it so much that she's still sleeping in it at 8 months and we can't figure out how to get her to a crib -- but the wedge isn't the way to do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong product","review":"I wanted the one piece wedge described in this listing.

I think it might be too much of a incline for a 1 mo. old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"My 2 month old has a lot of breathing issues and I have found that just the slight angle provided by this wedge has relieved a lot of her symptoms without making me worry that she will roll around too much like with some of the larger angled ones. Fits right under the crib sheet and stays in place really well."},{"rating":"2","title":"My baby's best night's sleep!","review":"This is a one-piece wedge that is ready to use right out of the box. There is no assembly, buttons, zippers, or anything else a couple of people have mentioned. Our baby girl would only sleep in her bouncy seat, which we had to place on the floor by my side of the bed. She absolutely would not sleep for more than five minutes laying flat on her back in her crib. After reading all the horrible reviews on the expensive incline sleep positioners, which lay completely flat because it doesn't support a baby's weight, we gave the Safe Lift Deluxe Crib Wedge a try. I bought this from Toys R Us and she slept through the night in her nursery. In fact, she's napping in it now! I'm already recommending this to all my new mommy friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zipper RIPPED","review":"I ignored the previous reviews which stated that the zipper ripped when assembling the item; but I wish I hadn't!

We wrap a blanket around the edges of the crib, as the hospital taught us to do, so that it does not move. We did that on the first night using the wedge. To my absolute horror, my baby slid down the wedge and his entire head was trapped underneath the blanket. He was swaddled so could do nothing about it. HE COULD HAVE SUFFOCATED!!!

It gives a decently close shave with just a few passes. The foils are comfortable and flex nicely. The pop up trimming attachment is a good length and works ok for cleaning up the edges of my beard and sideburns.Compared to my cheap old remington microscreen, this razor is excellent. It fits comfortably in my hand and aesthetically, has a sporty look. The battery life is amazing. Out of the box, it holds a decent charge for over a week. Please note that the charging stand requires enough space above the outlet to allow the razor to fit. The charging stand plugs into the outlet and the razor sits on top of the stand. I would have preferred a corded method, but this is ok.If you don't want to spend more than $40 bucks on a razor, but still desire a decent, quick shaving method, get this razor.

I've been pleased with its (wet) performance. I even dropped the unit once in the shower, and after putting the foil and blades back in place, it still works.Small manufacturing gripe - the foil release buttons on the side can get stuck if you push them in too far, keeping the foil from reattaching securely. Not a big deal if it happens - I just have to manipulate the release button to pop it back out - but it does keep the shaver from working correctly until it's fixed."},{"rating":"2","title":"good razor","review":"This is a great little razor.

I also like that it cleans very easily, and it has a nice feel in the hand. My two disappointments relate to its battery. It holds a charge fairly well, but there is no indicator on the razor that the battery is running low. Since I tend to go unshaven for a few days, this can leave me in the lurch when I go to shave and the only indication that the battery is low is when I put the razor to my face and the motor bogs down. I also regret that there is no charge status light on the charger, either. It will tell you that the razor is connected, but nothing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not shave well","review":"I wanted to like this shaver, as I was looking for something different than the traditional Norelco rotary razors. It is well made, sounds like it has a well-built motor, and is submersible.However, this shaver does not give me a good shave; it misses hairs.

I read that it takes some time to get used to the shaver but after over a month no change. I never tried the shaver wet because to me you might as well use a traditional blade razor.

As in, if I use a 3-blade disposable, then use the Panasonic at end of day, the Panasonic won't get any closer. I've tried gel, cream, and dry.

I was pleasantly surprised with this shaver.I'm still somewhat of a Braun guy and I think they make the best overall electric shavers, but this Panasonic is good. And for the price (around $30 at the time of purchase) it's almost impossible to find a better deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't ask for more","review":"Love it! I paid $20.95 with free shipping for my first one. I just ordered another one for $25.88 with free shipping. If I could find them at the lower price again, I would order 6 and give them as gifts.Close shave, maintains charge, unique charger. This shaver is cheaper than buying blades for my expensive Norelco, and gives me as good or better shave.Jim"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depends on your beard hair.","review":"Pros. Ergonomic design.

I had a Panasonic Smooth Operator Men's shaver in the 80's and loved it. It finally gave out after three years or so. I thought I would give Panasonic another try, but they only seem to have these double head shavers. It shaves as close as the old Panasonic, but the double heads cause me to miss single whiskers. After a day ot two, I will find one lone whisker approaching the 1/4 to 1/3 inch length. This is my only gripe about the double head system. If you like a double head, this is a great shaver!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Feels cheap","review":"Bought this to replace my Braun shaver after I lost the charger. Feels cheap.

OK I thought. and WOW!!!This shaver is SO SMOOTH!!! It actually takes me less time to shave with this Panasonic ES4026 than with a regular razor and shave cream. In the past, with an Electric Razor it would take nearly 2x as long, and still not get a great shave!Except for a few little 'red patches' the first few days-- which is totally normal, THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT!!!Cannot be Beat, would say especially for the price, but seriously - CANNOT BE BEAT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Panasonic Wet/Dry Men's Shaver","review":"Very convenient to use, and it provides a much closer shave than I possible without using a blade.

Not long hairs but a lot of tiny short hairs that won't cut no matter how many times I go over it, and over it and over it.I tried it dry and I tried it wet. With shaving cream and without.

But, it does not give a close shave no matter how many times I go back and forth over areas. I feel like it leaves me with the equivalent of about 12 hours growth after a good close shave.I see that many reviewers have said that it does give a close shave- It must depend on what you're used to. This was my first experience with an electric shaver. I normally use a 5 blade \\"sensor\\" hand held razor so maybe my idea of a close shave is different from what you look for in an electric model.Anyway, it is easy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid","review":"I bought this from amazon a couple of years ago.

I REALLY liked the fact that it was battery powered. This part of the shaver works well; the battery holds it's charge well. Other than that, I was very disappointed in this shaver's performance. Shaving dry, it always left stray whiskers standing that I had to cut with the side burn trimmer. I also attempted to shave wet as the manufacturer recommended, but this was even worse. Shaving wet nearly doubled the time it took for me to shave and again left stray whiskers. I purchased this to replace a Norelco three head electric razor that was over ten years old.

While I'm sure it's a capable razor for some men, if your beard is particularly thick, look elsewhere. Even after just a few days of growth, I found it unable to shave my beard sufficiently. The way I see it, when I have to go over my face with a regular razor after I've used an electric razor, the razor become unnecessary. For people with thin/regular beards or more moderate growth who shave every single day (twice?), the Pro Curve would probably do a serviceable job, but it's not a good match for me. It gets points for being usable in the shower, good battery life and having a pretty decent trimmer, but even at that it barely musters a two-star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panasonic ES4026NC Shaver","review":"I have use this product Panasonic ES4026NC Shaver for three weeks.

The shave head works poorly, but really, the worst part of this product is the trimmer. It doesn't do anything! I mean, you feel it vibrate, so you know it's working, but it's the only clue you have. It combs your facial hair instead of shaving it. Since I always need to trim my sideburns and beard, this product really lets me down on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great...for 2 months...","review":"This razor (Panasonic ES4026NC) was the best electric razor I ever had... when it was new. It was light, quiet, easy to clean, held a charge for 5 days, and shaved quickly through a weekend's worth of beard. It was better than my $100 Braun. Plus, it was $20 after the $10 mail in rebate.After just two months, though, the cutting capabilities greatly diminished. It made cutting/grinding noises, but needed multiple passes, where I had to push down to get it to shave. As everyone knows, multiple passes and pushing lead to skin irritation. It feels like the cutter is not as flush to the microscreen as it used to be. I tried reinserting the blades, but no difference. Also, the batteries are just NiCads (to keep the cost down). Now, after 4 months, they barely hold 2 days worth of a charge.Overall: just skip this one. It's more of an 8 week disposable razor than a long term morning friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price, great product","review":"$30 for an electric shaver is a bargain - it's easy to spend $100 or more. I was skeptical that the quality wouldn't be there but actually it's just as good as the Braun I replaced. I love the wet shaving feature which I find considerably better than dry shaving.My only gripe is that the charger isn't very sensibly designed - it mounts the shaver directly into the socket. This is problem in standard US sockets where the female side is vertical so the shaver falls out. Why they didn't just use a cord like every other shaver out there, we'll never know.Other than that, highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money and and is very painful","review":"I have tried it twice already Dry and Wet(with Shaving Gel), and both shaves have been very painful.

Sure there are no special features on any of the discs but the japanese aren't big on that stuff anyway. The biggest flaw in the set is the absence of Godzilla vs Mecagodzilla II witch could have been in the set instead of the American version. I would have given it a full 5 star rating with raving review if they took all the movies and repackaged each DVD case to be a uniformed set. The earlier ones like the two double featured could have been remastered and have had the japanese language audio added as did the later DVD's in the set.Over all it helped me gather up all the newer Godzilla movie, some awesome,(which is why I give it a 4 instead of 3 )at a lower price then buying them separately."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cellar","review":"Not sure why people HATE Abercrombie per se...But maybe this will help.http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/2a5b52b523/the-cellar-tease"},{"rating":"2","title":"More than expected","review":"I've had the pleasure of hearing Emerson Hart live...I have never heard a song that was sung with such heart as Greenfield Hills Race for California.Trully a beautiful song that will, no doubt, be underated and under appreciated by those that never had the pleasure of hearing it live."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST!","review":"Simply put, this is one of the best recordings I've ever heard.

Let me first say, Goode is highly underrated -- his playing is top notch. If you get the chance, buy Goode's Bach Partitas. I just recently purchased them and each partita was magnificent. His interpretations are the best I've heard. However, I was disappointed by this disc. His playing was rigid and mechanical, and at times, rushed. Chopin's music is filled with so much emotion, it requires a pianist's poetic interpretation to really bring out that emotion. After listening to this disc, however, I was left feeling cold. The romanticism in those pieces were stripped away. On the other hand, Arrau's interpretations explore those emotions through contemplative and graceful playing. Although slightly pricier, they are the better buy. If instead, you're looking for something cheaper, Idil Biret, has a 15-disc set of all of Chopin's pieces at a great price."},{"rating":"1","title":"The status quo","review":"Given the divorce rate and the work many couples are doing to understand each other better this book is rubbish,.

The story, such as it is, move forward very slowly and without any real sense of urgency. As far as it being based on the true story of a friend, it's just a bit too much of a cliche for me to really believe.On major problem is the sound quality of the film.

Of those that I have owned are the TI 92 and the HP 48 (and 49). If you need to do any serious computation then this is not the calculator for you. It is an infix calculator which makes it slow and time-consumng to use. I recomment checking out the HP 48 or HP49 (I prefer the 48). These are RPN calcuators so computation becomes much quicker and you have alot more control over the stack. The one advantage of the TI92 is it's ability to do symbolic manipulation but I prefer do do that by hand anyway, the point of using a calculator or a computer is to get rid of the number crunching, not thinking altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEEDS HIGH CONTRAST DISPLAY!!!","review":"I'm sure the capabilities are wonderful.

However, if you are into saving money and are willing to live with a smaller screen-size the TI-89 Advanced Graphic Calculator is basically the same thing. The only difference is the screen-size and the QWERTY keypad, which makes the 89 a smaller and a more manageable calculator.

I do agree the author was easy to read, but I would often lose interest after 10 - 20 pages. If you would like a similar book which you will not want to put down from start to finish, I recommed Relic or Reliquary, by Child and Preston. Happy Reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Premise but.......DOH!!!!!","review":"Started reading Sleeper with high expectations. It seemed like the perfect book for my daily 2.5 hour commute home from work. The premise of a creature running amok in the Pentagon ripping people to shreds is too good to pass up. However towards the half way mark it became obvious (painfully so) what the plot twist was and how the book was going to end. I could not believe that the author was moving the story in this direction. Why? to what purpose? (I Don't want to give anything away) It started off great and it ended rather badly. Give it a try you might like dumb plot twists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this book great? Uhhh.......NO!","review":"I really do not understand the hoopla that this book has gotten. It's formulaic, the characters are nothing more than cardboard copies of the same characters (beautiful single scientist, Rambo wannabe, man who has GHOSTS IN THE PAST to deal with) that you'd find in most books and movies similar to this. As a matter of fact, the plot and characters rip off a book called Hunter by James Byron Huggins a bit TOO MUCH for my liking.

This has good character development and I enjoyed the style of prose very much (some funny discriptions in here still have me laughing). While the plot stumbles along at some points I don't think you'll be disapointed if you go in with an open mind like I did. I wasn't looking for Willam Peter Blatty and I didn't find him.

From the first few pages I was riveted to the book -- like one of the other reader reviews mentioned, I couldn't put the book down! The story line is very original, tying an old Nazi conspiracy to a modern day crisis. The subject matter shows the scope of Steven Harriman's imagination -- absolutely boundless! Adding a dash of romance to a freight train of horror and science fiction, he produced what is, in my mind, one of the best novels to date. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes science fiction or horror novels, though I personally found the book to contain more of the former. In any case, this book is a deliciously blended modern masterpiece and I hope to see more such works from Mr. Harriman in the future!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who is the Monster?","review":"Sleeper, by Messrs. Harriman and Spruill, will keep you awake at night. My first glance at Sleeper; thought it might be a spy novel. Then when I read the reviews, I was hooked.

This version is made by Martin Gates, and is in full screen, The colors and characters are good for kids, the length is 71 minutes. Now the Disney version is fun, but too short. The best animated version in my mind is the one with the live introduction by Vanessa Redgrave produced by John Coates (who produced The Snowman). It is beautiful, sticks closer to the original book than any other.So again, this version is decent and fun to watch, great for kids, and if you want to see another version of the classic it is worth a a viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Am I entertaining myself?","review":"Yes! I purchased this dvd with the expectation that I would learn a few really good pre-canned routines that I could use to entertain my family. What I got was a whole lot more. The bulk of these videos provide you fundamental moves and concepts that you can use to build your own routines. I can sit and imagine any impossible scenario involving 3 cups and 3 balls and then apply the lessons here to make it happen. It's almost like a puzzle that I present to myself and solve. Then I can display my new 'astounding act' to others and be doubly rewarded.I am not a professional magician, actually I am a computer scientist ;) But I've been able to put together material in the last few days that I honestly believe people would pay to see.

This book logically and scientifically filled in the gaps. It makes sense, it all fits. Sitchin's bibliography to support his research is tremendously extensive and impressive. I recommend it highly for the searching mind, and have given copies as gifts to many friends and associates."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true classic in the genre","review":"I am normally pretty stingy with giving 10's to books, but this chapbook of one of Kress' strongest novellas surely deserves the rating.Kress never fails to deliver utterly believable characters while driving plots forward with her straight-forward style of prose. \\"Dancing on Air\\" is no exception.Upong starting the book I was immediately put off by the fact that it is narrated by an intelligence-enhanced dog. There are, of course, countless novels using this device, and I'd say all but Simak's \\"City\\" are completely forgettable. (I would include \\"Watchers\\" and \\"Lives of the Monster Dogs\\" in the \\"forgettable\\" category.) But, I trusted Ms. Kress to deliver and was ultimately rewarded. Kress' narrator choice turns out to be wonderful. The dog is impossible to dislike and presents a point of view so objective as to be unquestionable and yet filled with raw emotion as could only come from a dog or perhaps a small child.If you are a fan of short fiction, don't miss this one!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading synopsis = major disappointment","review":"If you buy this expecting a discussion that \\"revolves around three of Kushner's most renowned plays: Angels in America; Caroline, or Change; and Homebody/Kabul,\\" you are likely to suffer major disappointment. Despite what the synopsis asserts, the plays are pretty much an afterthought in a discussion of American and Middle Eastern politics and the Iraq war, circa 2004. Given the subject matter of his plays, it would be foolish to expect Kushner not to talk politics, but I certainly expected more than a question at the start of the interview and one at the end. You're wasting your time -- and your money since you can't return an opened DVD -- if you're looking for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The only reason that I did not give this 1 star in each category is that it did fairly well in the \\"creep me out\\" factor in a couple of spots.Issues I had with the game:Needless profanity. If you're going to swear, have a reason other than trying to make the game seem--and fail--to be more adult oriented.Mindless tasks. The puzzles were challenging but not impossible, the mindless tasks (talk to the guard four or five times without accomplishing anything in between conversations) is a common complaint and rightly so.Worst of all? The ending, I mean I went through all that for such a worthless ending? Let me put it this way: Everyone dies for nothing. I was so disappointed by the ending that I immediately uninstalled the game and will definitely not be returning to Nibiru. In fact, the only good thing about the ending is that it was so final that there's no chance of a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Graphics...........but","review":"The idea for the game is good, has a definet goal to reach. On 2 discs that do not need to be in the drive to run is a plus. The graphics are pretty darn good.Actual game play is akin to taking a sedative, slow movements, watching your figure move from place to place gets real tiring, very sleepy actually. Making the character move is about all you can do in this game. There are a few puzzels to solve, though not as many as there could/should be. Near all the conversations are game run, the player has no, none, nada, zilch control over what is said in conversations, and you can't do anything but watch.The subtitles are written with a lot of typos, and painfully slow, even at the fastest setting.Better than nothing, though not much. My 2 star rating is entirely based on the graphics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustratingly SLOW-Save your $$$","review":"When I read the plot of this game i rushed out to buy it-unfortunately I didnt read further or I would have known that this is a POINT & CLICK game, and as someone else mentioned, the main character moves from here to there at a snails pace. I wanted a game similar to Myst, where you are the P.O.V. and you could go anywhere and look at anything. Not so with this game, you can only go into certain hot spot areas, and only pick up and examine certain items. You watch the main character as he slowly walks to and fro, repeatedly having to go to the same place, leave, go back, leave, go back again. UG, maddening!!!There is no way to speed up the action either. Can watch TV and play, and not miss a thing. BORING!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing....","review":"Have previously played MISSING from the Adventure Company and was hoping the puzzles in this game would be similar. HUGE disappointment. Very few puzzles - possibly six total - and most of them were pretty lame. Required very little thought.A lot of mindless babbling on the part of the \\"hero.\\" A big \\"time filler\\" perhaps. Also a lot of back and forth with characters which also seemed like a waste of time. Beat the game in three sessions (about six hours total) and the ending was lame.Skip this one... buy MISSING if you're looking for intellectual challenges."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame dialogue leading to anticlimax","review":"Features include annoying main character with lame stilted dialogue (eventually I just clicked through all speech, of which there's tons) and unbelievable character actions. Simple linear game play. Main menu hides in the upper right hand corner - have to hover over it a while, or you'll never get out because the escape key does nothing. I quickly looked up a walkthrough so I could just get on with seeing the semi-pretty pictures and be done with it.It's a good game if you like to go back and forth asking a guy for a bucket of water. There were a couple clever puzzles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I found the author took what could have been an intesting topic and made it so convoluted that it was boring and a chore to read. The main character was so one-dimentional that I had no sympathy for his conflict. The main character could have had many levels of emotions due to his conflict, but the author couldn't seem to touch on any of them. By the middle of the book, I was so lost as to who was who that I found myself constantly retracing what I'd read to remind myself who these people were. After a while I just didn't care and lost interest. It felt as if I was reading a \\"piece\\" novel. A book where the author took pieces from other books and tried to make an original novel from it. Never once did I believe the story. There are so many other really good novels in this genre that I'm sorry I wasted my time on this one. What I don't understand is how this book is part of a series, are the publishers kidding?!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great rare gem","review":"The Krush remix of Makeups to Breakups is worth the album in itself.

Just listen to how butchered \\"To be Demon\\" is(the butcerhed version is \\"find a way\\").The first 3 tracks are new songs, but honestly they are not that good. I actully like how Masaki sings \\"down n dirty\\" live on \\"Once and for All\\" better than this studio rendition by Mike.This is by far one of the worst Loudness albums and a dark time for the group. Only get this for collection purposes, like I did.Sadly, I must give this 2 stars. I would give it 1 star, but I must say Wounded Bird remastered this album quite well. Why they remastered this album the best of their loudness catalogue is a major question to me though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incorrect Editorial Review","review":"The editorial review states this album is a 1982 reissue which means it would consist of the original Loudness line up.

Like his other books, this one was well written, but I just could not get into the subject matter. The main characters that he follows were uninteresting and pretty one dimnesional in their rowing obsession. Halberstam seems to worship their dedication to a sport that few care about, but I find their masochistic pleasure in continuous pain and lonely training quite odd and certainly not anything heroic. I think that if I had been a rower at some point in my athletic career instead of a track athlete and soccer player, I would have enjoyed this book more.

There's very little of the dance on this disc, but there is plenty of the rhythmic dialogue between sound and silence that Monk mined so richly. Hersch's touch creates breathtaking sounds, and his re-thinking of open spaces (never has Misterioso sounded so enigmatic) owes its debt to the master while touching new territory as well. This, along with Steve Lacy's, Bill Holman's, and Bud Powell's tributes, makes my list of essential Monk cover discs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked fine","review":"Noticed one of my cat had worms and treated all of our cats with this product.

After sitting through endless bloodshed and voilent attacks (on 2 perfectly nice people) it soon becomes clear that this film says more about the strange mind of the writer/director than the film.Every other line in this dirty piece of mindless violence is delivered with the monotonous tone of a 'straight to DVD criminal' seeking revenge. The sarcastic tone that is so embarrassingly over-used in TV drama: \\"well, let me see, ohh you seem scared...ohh, how would you feel if I stabbed your pretty little....\\", \\"oh look, I think he is scared oohhoohhh\\", \\"Ha ha, why don't you stop lying to me or I might just have to xyz\\"Why do film directors always use the same, lazy old stereotypes, when it comes to violent white supremacist thugs? i.e The confrontation with a black or Asian man serving in a store.

Save your viewing time for a better film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mean Spirited Junk","review":"Yet despite its slick invocation of political concepts, As Good As Dead is never anything more than pop culture junk. What works about it comes mostly through its use of setting and its persistently slow pace, taking the time and care to adequately ramp up the tension. Frank Whaley turns in a competent performance as a sweet-talking sociopath with an SS neck tattoo. Otherwise you find performances equal to typical SyFy movie cast. Yet like so many contemporary thrillers, the film can't help itself from throwing in a dissatisfying last-minute twist that rips the spine out of the entire story. There were no innocents. The movie preaches a message of hate and a world that works for no one. This movie was a hugely flawed product that trades in ugliness and fear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ground Hog Day It's Not","review":"This has to be one of the worst movies my wife and I have ever seen.

Two things we need to do in the future will be to exercise more caution about \\"R\\" rated films and those Andie McDowell might be in.Andie McDowell should be ashamed to have been featured in such trash as this, That's especially after all her cosmetics commercials and starring in the classic, \\"Ground Hog Day.\\" It still ranks as one of our all-time favorite movies.

(Compare the scintillating, gripping film Billy Wilder made from the same story and see how Guettel and his collaborators have drained the tale of drama and significance. What exactly were they trying to say? After repeated listenings I'm still not sure.)I know people like to be \\"hip to the new\\" and that may account for some of the baffling raves posted here, but I really wonder if all these people sincerely like this pinched, fussy, self-conscious, unmemorable, uninvolving music or if they think it's smart to pretend they like it?

Guettel writes songs that soar, interesting music that singers must cherish. I discovered his equally hard to characterize \\"Saturn Returns\\" which is due out on CD in March. Hopefully, with help from singer Audra McDonald's recent debut album, wide-scale recognition for Guettel is on the way. Just don't let the country/old-timey feel to the music put you off.

This so called \\"future of musical theatre\\" is definitely taking a step in a direction away from all other contemporary and developmental theatre. The lyrics are essentialy simple and not thought provoking, and the overall storyline is not great.

The seriousness of this show loses everything by cutesy little songs sung by hard working blue collar men. The songs are almost embarrassing to listen to.

When the program is one with which listeners feel some deep personal connection, such listeners then project their personal feelings and experiences onto the given music. This creates a sense of depth and connection to that music which may not actually be present. When confronted with programmatic music, I prefer to listen first, without direction, influence or the reading of liner notes, so that the music will either communicate something to me (or not). When listeners rely on whatever gloss a composer has imposed on his/her music, they may be lulled into a false belief that the music itself is profound. That is my problem here with Professor Golijov's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a bad printing...","review":"I want to confirm what others have said about the 3rd edition. The print is not great. I should be clear that so far, I haven't seen anything that was so bad that couldn't eventually make out the text (in context), but I shouldn't have to squint and stare.Yes, this copy is brand new direct from Amazon.If the good Walter Jung comes back here, I want to recommend that he not use the small bold print, which is the worst. ex: pg.12 \\"Summary of Summing-Inverter Characteristics\\" is pretty much a squiggly black blob.

I was so disappointed by this one because if they just followed the first one, they could have had an alright movie, but they decided to change it and it ended up just being the longest, screwed up plot I've ever seen. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"No chlorine","review":"We had the water tested after installation and the results came back 0% chlorine and .500 floride.

I think Mr. Sankey needed to maybe give a few more examples/elaborations of the points he was making... not to clarify them, but rather to give the reader a chance to absorb them before proceeding to the next point.

While these are magnetic and hold the nail somewhat, for picture hanging, I'm better off using my fingers. This actually increased safety hazards rather than reduce them. The nail would be attracted to the magnet, but it wasn't at all strong enough to hold it tightly in place, so it would slip around when hit. I was extremely disappointed with it.

I have had bad experience with hinges becoming loose on one and breaking on another. I think the problem is that the hinges are not strong enough to hold the massive screen. It would be worth your while to compare how the screen in held in various brands (both 15 and 17 in.) you will be able to see the difference for yourself. Customer service is definitely lousy. They will never call you back (called them 3-4 times ans asked to call back).Toshiba might be a great laptop, but we have not reached the age of \\"defect-less\\" manufacturing, and we will need customer service and replacements.

I just wished a sequel could have been made with all the original characters returning. Maybe a few new ones, maybe retaining some of the positions of some of the main characters,such as the police captain who wanted to run for mayor. Maybe Mr. Norris returning as a contender for the position of the captain? Now that would be funny! And maybe some of his co-stars having promotions too. A few new people with a new plot, but saving the part of that amazing dog's penchant for people's scarves.Oh and bring back the lady who played Chuck Norris mother and the young man who played the part of the grandson maybe would be older and have a larger part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Ever","review":"This movie should never have been made. Everyone that was a part of this movie wasted their time and effort. Chuck Norris is cool to watch and to do karate and stuff. He should star in a movie where all that happens is fighting. Watching grass grow is a better use of your time, than watching a movie about a police officer where his partner is a DOG. I saw this movie before.....it was called \\"Turner and Hooch.\\" Chuck Norris needs to stick with his roles as fighting and not do any more family oriented movies such as this one. He is good at fighting and karate, and that is exactly what he should stick with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical product of the1980's genre","review":"Looked like it would be a nice entertaining family movie however included foul language and wasn't old enough to be cute and wasn't new enough to have decent acting.

The story used every gag to hook the unwashed. The cranky \\"sweet old man\\" gets killed first thing, the likeable little kid who like to jump his \\"cool\\" bike, the fuzzy dog, the stereo typical drinking, loner bad ass cop and nasty boss, villains wanting to take over the world and kill all minorities etc. Watch the staged fights then return the video back to the rental store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action Comedy Dramatic films","review":"Chuck Norris is awesome in this film and the dog is cute too.

What were the other cops doing, were they all on border patrol? Wouldn't it have made more sense to use an ethnic actor SOMEWHERE in the film about white supremecists? No, this movie instead shows you that an old white cop and a canine can solve racism and stop terrorists. Nothing about this picture was believeable.

It dries fast, holds well, and becomes really steel-hard after cure. Now I decided to give a try to this glue. I was dissapointed.First of all, it was very hard to get a drop of it, since one of nozzles appeared to be clogged with dried epoxy. I had to use screw to remove the hardened epoxy cap.Second, while bonding properties of this glue are ok, it does not cures to fully hard condition, it remains a bit soft (soft enough that you can leave significant mark on it by using your finger nail), so it is very difficult to finish the surface - imagine you've glued some metal pieces together, then sanded whole area to receive the clean surface, then painted it, but you discover than under the paint you got the soft surface, and slight finger press can disturb it.

It all starts out well, in fact, it has the feel of \\"The Creature From The Black Lagoon.\\" The characters are not too annoying and the premise is solid, but it completely unravels halfway through the episode. It seems that after 20 minutes, the director had the actors do the script as an improv because NOTHING happens and everything just goes in circles.

As a matter of fact, the \\"Preludio Para El Ano\\" was translated from Spanish to Italian so that the diva would be able to sing in her native language! The other French vocal piece is also loud and obnoxious.If you can get this cheap then do so because two pieces by Piazzolla, \\"Pachouli\\" and \\"Milonga Per Tre\\" are exquisite as is \\"Los Mareados\\" by Juan Cobian.At 51 minutes, the skimpiest of the recordings chronicling Kremer's voyage across the music of Astor Piazzolla."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yo amo El Tango!","review":"Tango elicits numerous responses and everyone has special things they like abou the music and the dance. Indeed, one could say that Tango is a culture and world unto itself and Piazzolla is the ruling god on high. His works made Tango accessible to the rest of the world and bridged the gap between it and other types of music (jazz, classical, popular).This is an individual interpretation - but then what recording is not? The details are stunning in their brilliance, the tension a counterpoint to the dreamy melodic line. The pace never seems hurried and each line is extended to the breaking point. Especially appreciated are the vocal recordings since so many times we forget that Tango was - and is - primarily a song of temptation.

Clearly, the ideas of culture and identity matter to him passionately, and that feeling is easily conveyed to any listener regardless of ethnic or religious background.

All of the songs are great, and the singing is superb. The characters draw you in, and their emotions are very believable. I can't wait to see the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new favorite soundtrack","review":"I always have to get the soundtrack to a show and listen to it before I go to see it on Broadway. I can't wait to see this show. Although the story is from the 1800s, the music plays like it could be on Billboard right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the hype?????","review":"This one totally escaped me...I can't believe it won so many Tony Awards. Most of the music sounds the same ...without a real melody to be found. A Rent wannabe that falls way short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not living up to the hype.","review":"All the hype and samplers were great. But, calling this show the next \\"RENT\\" just ain't right. Also, raved as a \\"rock and roll musical\\". It is NOT. Some okay music, however, no show stoppers and no hummers."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the young and the young at heart","review":"This album, although fairly specific to the show, has some of the most inventive, clever, poignant and lyrical, music you will find in the contemporary modern American musical theater. The actors, young, spirited and dynamic, give perfomances that will raise your blood pressure, tear your heart out and bring tears to your eyes. Their portrayal of youth in the past pays homage to us all and our own experiences of growing up. See it ,listen to it, cherish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spring Awakening","review":"I never received the item. Though I contacted the distributor twice, I have received no response.

The CD provided just what I needed and I am thrilled to finally see new and fresh work on Broadway. Pop musicians penning Broadway musicals don't have to produce trite pieces or ones that lack focus--we've been waiting for the right voice, and Duncan Sheik may be him.It is rare that I am haunted by a piece of theatre anymore, and I'm grateful for Spring Awakening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting concept for the stage","review":"The music is good, just takes some getting used to if your into more traditional musical theater. The themes are very adult, but the music is haunting. The phrasing is very different and the lyrics are more obtuse than I'm used to, But once you give it a chance, you will be singing these songs all day. I will be very interested in seeing this production live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another awesome Broadway Recording!!","review":"Spring Awakening is wonderful...the music coming from the hearts of youth struggle and agony, the entire cd grabs the attention of the listener!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This soundtrack is EXACTLY as the performers sounded on stage. I am absolutely in love with this & I listen to it every night. Totally recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a musical!","review":"I went to see this play in December, shortly after it had officially opened on Broadway, and I really enjoyed it. The content is pretty explicit, but the play and the music present quite an accurate picture of teen angst. And once you've been through it, it never quite goes away. The cd soothes the anxious teenager within me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Different for Broadway","review":"The score for \\"Spring Awakening\\" feels much more like a great pop/rock record than a traditional theatrical score. Duncan Sheik, best known for his hit \\"Barely Breathing\\", has composed a series of songs full of hamony and emotion. While the cast sounds terrific throughout, my only real complaint is that the voice similaries can make it difficult to distinguish which character is singing. Nevertheless, this score is terrific!Best tracks include:The Bitch of LivingMy JunkTouch MeThe Word Of Your BodyThe Dark I Know WellDon't Do Sadness/Blue WindWhisperingThe Song Of Purple Summer (my personal favorite)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The new face of musical theatre","review":"This is a wonderful recording of this superb new musical. Its success will now change the face of musical theatre and hopefully end the era of jukebox and made-by-corporate committee film-to-musical shows. It is fresh, original and has a wonderful book, score and lyrics. Its direction is gimmick-free, crisp and tight.While listening to the CD is no substitute for seeing the show, it stands beautifully on its own as an album of songs. I urge you to go out and see the show with its original cast. The replacement and tour casts that will follow will not be able to fully duplicate the magic of the original cast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries far too hard to be groundbreaking","review":"I didn't see the point of this show at all. They've taken a work written in Germany in the late 1800s about the sexual dysfunctions and struggles of German youths and set it to rock music and made it into a fairly graphic musical and from this we're supposed to be enlightened and amazed and know more about ourselves? Sorry, but this musical did not take us anywhere we have not been a million times over in the last century! We deal with this stuff every night on cable TV, on reality TV, in every school yard, in every town, in every home, in every cinema, in every young adult book, in every rap song, in every damn place you LOOK you see these same themes discussed and played out over and over and over! This was supposed to be innovative? I just don't think it worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"This is my first experience with Duncan Sheik and hopefully my last. I dont understand why this show is such a success, because this score is just awful. If you enjoy Broadway musicals recordings, I'd stay away from this one. If you are young and like rock music, you may like it. The number shown on the Tony Awards show didnt win me over either. Oh well, the Tony Awards arent infallible.....(Sound of Music over Gypsy? Two Gentlemen of Verona over Follies? PLEASE.) There isnt one song that stands on its own and it all grates on the ears. I did like Rent, which has a much better score, but not this. JUNK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Best musical? Um...","review":"I really don't think so. I've only listened to the Cd and seen online clips and honestly, I don't know what's so great about this musical. Yes, some of the songs are good but I don't know if I could sit through this show. It does nothing for me and I just don't see what's so great about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monotonous Garbage","review":"No one under the age of 25 is going to agree with me, but who cares. I think it's great they finally have a show about teens on Broadway, but to be this cliche', with so little if anything to say, uninteresting with a score poorly written is just a real pity. I suppose it's a start, but as far as speaking and expounding on youth, take me to HAIR any day over this."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a good show","review":"I do not see how anyone could like this show. It is totally unimaginative in its music and lyrics. A GOOD show causes one to go away humming the songs, this show does not do that. It is unmemorable. I admit, the singers are good. The story sounds interesting, from what I have read, which is why I reccomend reading the ORIGINAL PLAY instead, if you can find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!!","review":"I listen to this all the time! It was the most amazing play and the soundtrack is even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lea Michele's pre-Glee Hit","review":"Based on Jonathan Franzen's 1906 play, Duncan Sheik and Stephen Slater have created an original musical using the language and attitudes of our times. Lea Michele (in a pre-Glee starring stage role)and Jonathan Groff reprise their stage roles for this recording, bringing their characters to life. While it's not a traditional musical in the style of \\"Wicked\\". It will please anyone with an open mind and keen ear, as there are moments of true beauty to found in this score."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BROADWAY SHOW AND MUSIC","review":"I actually went to the musical on broadway in NYC on tues March 11 2008 it was a great show and the music is awesome something I never thought would be in a musical this also my first new york broadway show. IT was great if you get the chance go see it in new york city. SO I know the cd will be great as well"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it, really I do","review":"The hype around Spring Awakening grew fast and over the top. Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater have made a beautiful show possible but the fact that its trying to be new in an old fashioned way is a tad over rated. I like the music and lyrics but think the story might be slightly lacking. It's poetic without being overly sensitive which satisfies me greatly. However if you are Broadway Theatre person you might not necessarily enjoy the music and show. I find this show good for releasing some pent up anger and sadness but I feel as for a Broadway show its highly lacking. Although it is the show for this decade, I mean for the teens and young adults it is definitely not the new RENT."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good choose","review":"An interesting cd. I bought without seen the show and was actually a surprise. Mama, who bored me is really wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spring Awakennings? I don't think so!!!","review":"Having seen the musical of Spring Awakennings at the beginning of this year I would strongly reconsider purchasing this broadway cast recording. I am a theatre goer (at the age of 29) and have seen the majority of the lastest musicals for example, Grey Gardens, and The Pirate Queen. Anyway I was discusted with the musical of Spring Awakennings; why is it cool to show a couple simulating sex and watching a ploke pretending to toss off? constant swearing etc... - How sick is that!!!!... and you call this a musical worthy of nominations (of the year awards)! What is the world coming to! and what drugs are these so called critics taking?In my opinion buy something else with your money such as 'The Pirate Queen' which has no longer showing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great new musical","review":"I saw the cast performing on the Tony's and was blown away by the music. TV usually deadens live theater no matter how good it is, but when I saw the company performing and they still were dynamite over the airwaves, I knew this was something special. The CD does not disappoint. Only criticism is that some of the lyrics they sing in a few songs are not in the liner notes, and it's so good I wish I had every word in writing. Not suitable for playing if you've got young children in the car, but the profanity is not for shock value, it is justified in the text. Great new work."},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favorite album","review":"I love Rocket from the Crypt. I own six of their albums. Of them, this is my least favorite. Pretty simple.It's got some horribly recorded songs -- I get it; it contributes to a garage, spy rock aesthetic... one I don't find pleasant -- it's got some horribly written songs, and overall just sounds like a young band trying to find themselves.We're all very happy that they did eventually find themselves. So buy their other albums and don't get a bad first impression by purchasing this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Bottle is the best blues tune...","review":"If you hear these guys (also known as The Shafran-Klegseth Band) do One Bottle live you will die! This whole CD is ass kickin'. I'm glad they Amazon got a clue and put their stuff up. A MUST SEE live band. They're a five star band live and need to do a live CD (HINT!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is fantastic!","review":"Naturally, I found this book delicious. That is not to say erotic--in the usual sense. And for me, personally, so long bereft of my, how shall we say, membrane virile, I did _not_ find the book terribly stimulating. This is all beside the point and, to be frank, I would rather not mention the series of ill-fated operations that left me so awfully frigid. But even for the sexually intact this book, I would fain say, belongs rather on the shelf than athwart anything in the way of an extremity. Which is not to say the book is boring per se. It's not. In fact, I'd even recommend it. Certainly, though, the transvestite community--to which I belong--will continue to ardently oppose such shining examples of conventional or, worse, \\"literary\\" prurience. That said, I give the book a half-hearted, semi-limp thumbs-up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"clever, but doesn't quite get there","review":"Great inventive use of structure, dialogue; but the device gets old fast...playing the line between commercial mass-market titillation and serious literature is ultimately a failure-not even well-written erotica can save this novel in the long run."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vox Rocks","review":"They say if you're taking viagra and your erection lasts longer than four hours, you're supposed to consult a doctor. All I can say for this work of art is, If you're reading this book and your erection doesn't last four hours, you should seek immediate medical attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious and realistic!","review":"A man and a woman connect on a phone line service. They get erotic and explicit in their conversation. They refuse to hang up in case they lose the connection. Funny and sexy.If you have done any telephone dating, this book's for you. It is chock full of laughter and silliness but fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gen-X Neurotica","review":"Loved this book. It's an enjoyably quick read of neurotic erotica that reminds me of a Douglas Coupland novel. It's funny, smart, and effortlessly unpretentious. Very cleverly crafted. Plus, it turns you on.The plot involves a man and a woman in their late twenties who strike up a conversation on an adult partyline. They're drawn to each other's voices. Their neuroses are a perfect match. The conversation builds like sex builds. It's imaginative, funny, honest, revealing, shocking, innocent, jaded and sweet. There are laugh-out-loud moments that keep you reading. Then, in the last 30 pages, the masturbatory climax is realized, and we feel satisfied with the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"The unsexiest book about sex I've ever read","review":"The phone sex premise is intriguing, but I was sorely disappointed. Despite the kinky sex fantasies, I was amazed Nicholson Baker could turn them into something so unsexy. I found it downright tedious, over-intellectualized, and pretentious. As I read, I kept thinking, \\"Who talks like this?\\" I gave it two stars instead of one because, to be fair, Vox is well-written. Too bad the pretty prose is wasted on a snooze-worthy non-story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old White Men Don't Know What Erotic Fiction Is - DON'T BUY","review":"I thought that \\"House of Holes\\" was awful - but dang.

I kept reading hoping to find some redeeming value, but alas there was to be none. The dialog kept dragging along to no purpose that I could discern. In general a very unsatisfying read."},{"rating":"1","title":"a story that show the nothingness of modern fiction","review":"I think that being clever is not enough for being a goof writer. And Mr Baker is very clever. But, sometime, his dialouges seems bargained from the worst Beckett. Try again Nick."},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"best\\" book of Amazon Moonies","review":"Stephen King who on his worst day could write circles around Baker has accurately described this book as \\"miserable\\". This is perverted yuppie recreational reading, and its length barely qualifies it as a novel for anyone not afflicted with attention deficit disorder. Mr. Baker has opposed the computerization of libraries, which presumably means Amazon too, for which he should be applauded, unfortunately his activism does not make up for his inadequacies as a writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vox","review":"I read this book along with my book club as one of our Y2K selections. I must say that this was the poorest excuse for literature that I have ever read! I found it to have no redeeming qualities -- don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long-distance Connection","review":"I've been wanting to read another book by Nicholson Baker ever since I read--and loved--The Fermata. So keep that in mind. If you don't like Nicholson Baker, this book isn't going to change your mind.This one isn't as striking or profound as I found The Fermata, but an enjoyable read nonetheless. Still, I feel like he hadn't quite let loose yet. There is a bit of wordplay, creating new words (which, in a weird backwards way, redefine the meanings of the words they're replacing) for sex and body parts; however, it's not as deliciously fun and funny as it is in The Fermata.Vox is almost impossible to put down. A slim novel without chapters or page breaks, the conversation between two strangers on opposite coasts just flows--filled with random asides and strange erotic stories. Vox is a love letter to masturbation. This usually secret act is shared between two people and ultimately brings them (and maybe someday, THE WORLD) together temporarily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expecting eroticism, look somewhere else!","review":"This level of eroticism should not have spurned such controversy at its release. I was bored and quite dissatisfied when I finished the book. What made me keep reading was the hype, BUT like a lot of sexual experiences it ended in a fizzle instead of a flourish. Your own imagination would serve you better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book Monica gave Bill","review":"This is a fairly forgettable little book, but not unenjoyable while you're at it. It doesn't age very well, but will serve as a fine example of Fin de Si��cle American literature in the not too distant future, describing the anxieties, obsessions, moods and mores of the bubbling nineties. Okay, okay, it's just another Gen X novel, using phone sex dialogues as a narrative device.This book's main claim to fame however, is the fact that a copy of Vox was given by White House courtesan Monica Lewinsky to President Bill Clinton.For the record Bill returned the favour by giving her Leaves of Grass by Walt Whitman, a few trinkets and DNA samples galore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Bore.","review":"I absolutely wasted the money to purchase this book. I was excited for it, as it seemed interesting. I was severely let down. I honestly cannot even finish the book because it just doesn't catch my attention. It doesn't arouse the feelings it should and it's difficult to want to read more. Horrible book, horrible purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pox on Vox","review":"Based on other reviews, I was expecting to find this book psychologically penetrating and intense. Instead, the dialogue was overintellectualized and contrived. Sadly, this book centering on phone sex wasn't even mildly erotic -- I'd have to be lobotomized to achieve fantasies as boring as this couples'. This is the kind of dreck that overcomes nature (at least in men) -- it makes you fall asleep BEFORE orgasm!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Big Phony","review":"Give me a break. This was written by a guy? The man on the phone has no idea what chenille is, but three pages later, he's talking about chenille and pointelle like he was in the rag business.And the dialog is just too mannerly and contains too much information dumping. Might be a great book for high schoolers, but once you been around the Cancer, Capricorn, and the City of Night, this is just toooooo precious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly a mind numbing experiance","review":"After hearing about this book in the media I don't know how many times, I had to try it out for myself.I have never read such mind numbing tripe!

Actually, studying navel lint is more interesting. This is a silly, pretentious little book that is not sexy and will be forgotten totally. I'm still kicking myself for buying this."},{"rating":"2","title":"vox blurs the line between sex and sexiness","review":"nicholson baker wants to make sex as complicated as possible. By dividing the simplicity of actual sex from the seemingly endless boundaries of foreplay and anything sexual that is not actual sex, Baker emerged with Vox. The book is a story which unfolds like a ribbon through the dialogue of two people on a private chat sex phone line. And all the dialogue put together is a 165 page description of verbal intercourse. Vox has been made to be a statement about safe sex ( via phone), technological sex, and the line between literature and smut. Vox is a version of foreplay and a document of some of the thousands of ideas that can turn both the male and the female mind on. The mind is the sexiest organ, Vox proves it, and is a great read as well"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle and effective","review":"I use this product as a daily prevention for urinary tract infections and a mild diuretic.

Maybe this horrifies me because I just had to have mold remediation in my home... But it also upsets me because I do feel that it \\"teaches\\" children that being EXTREMELY messy at bathtime is ok. Sure there will be puddles, there are more toys on my bathroom than I care to mention - but they aren't covered in suds!!

The sound quality and PA system were great. The battery life then suddenly went down to nothing. Then I learned that the warranty is only for 90 days. The other issue is that it has an ipod charger but will not charge the Nano? I contacted the company and they acknowledged the problems but only claimed a 90 day warranty.

Since I received it, I've only used it 4 times. The 1st time it worked as described. The system was however plugged into the wall. The next 2 times it worked okay. There was some static at higher volumes when running on the battery. So we were not able to fully enjoy it because we couldnt set the volume to the level we required. The final time I used it, it only worked for 2-3 minutes before shutting off. We then tried to charge it and found that it wouldnt hold a charge. The battery in this unit is not of high quality. So we were forced to listen to it while plugged in, which defeats the purpose of why I bought it in the first place. Ive had it for exactly 1 year and 2 weeks, now the unit doesnt even work anymore.

What a joy it is to know that such a voice exists. I can hardly wait to buy some more of her cds. I don't think it can get much better than this, meaning her voice.The only draw back I have about this cd was the repertoire. It could have been better.

Inside those envelopes are her travel itinerary and tasks set before her by her now-deceased Aunt Peg. She has to open the envelopes in order, and can't open the next one until she's completed the previous task. Her envelopes take her from London to Edinburgh to Rome to Paris, and she makes several new and eclectic friends along the way, a rarity for the normally shy teenager. Her observations of the European sites are exciting both for readers who've seen them and those who haven't, and Ginny learns as much about her free-spirited aunt through her jouneys as she does about herself. Heart-warming and adventurous, funny and realistic (despite the unusual circumstances), 13 Little Blue Envelopes is a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Book For All Ages!","review":"I have to say that this book fasinated from the 1-12 letter.

Once the task in the letter is completed, Ginny is able to read the next one. The letters take Ginny to NYC, London, Scotland, Paris, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Italy, and the beaches of Greece. Throughout the trip, Ginny gains friendship, love, and family.I loved this story.

In the book 13 Little Blue Envelopes by Maureen Johnson, Ginny goes galavanting all over Europe, following the instructions of 13 little blue envelopes, written by her artistic but crazy Aunt Peg. Ginny comes to realize many new things about herself, her aunt, and life. She pushes herself to complete the tasks her Aunt assigns her, including finding an artist and being an anonymous donor by giving 500 euros to them. Suddenly taking off to go to Rome, with no questions asked. As the story unfolds she will meet new people, make many new friends, and find the reason she is there. I recommend 13 Little Blue Envelopes for anyone who is looking for a witty, heartfelt book."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"I liked this book because Ginny is sent all over Europe putting her trust in her dead Aunt Peg.

This album came back to haunt me in college when a classmate of mine was really into Wendy's music and wound up turning me on to the other albums as well. I'll never forget the deep conversations about the Walter/Wendy conspiracy and sitting down in music class and analyzing each and every movement of this record. i was so happy when it showed up in CD format a couple years ago along with extra tracks.

I've contacted the company concerning this after mine just came apart after only one week of having it. When I examined, it looked as though the hems of the ribbon was too thick and since the ribbon's so soft, the heavier weighting part just separated - so there were shredds of thread everywhere. I must say Sharp's wand is better than most as it's made of fiberglass instead of wood so it's more durable and it has a handy rubber grip.If you'd like to get a ribbon, I would suggest viewing Cannon Sports ribbons - the only downfall you'll find is that they only come in 14ft long and the only colors Cannon has is red and light blue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best solution in absence of an original soundtrack","review":"Nadja Salerno Sonneberg had this wonderful idea to record a replay of the original soundtrack of Humoresque.

The replacement is still working but makes strange clicking sounds sometimes so it may be on the way out too. One comment about other people saying that it leaks. It is solid metal inside, no seams, so it doesn't really leak. What happens sometimes is if you overfill it, the boiling water escapes through an opening inside (close to the very top). So this is not really a defect. This is the only electric kettle I know of that is all solid metal inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Kettle !!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I bought the Hamilton Beach Cool Touch Kettle at Target today for $29.95, and am very pleased.The lid is easily removed, but does not fall off when pouring, and the screen filter is an added plus. It has a large opening that allows easy cleaning of the inside. I did have a leaking problem just like someone else reported, but I learned that it was operator error. Overfilling will cause the kettle to leak through the overflow port at the top of the handle and direct hot water safely down through the bottom. I guess this is to protect those that don't read the directions.The maximum fill line in on the inside at the front, and I found this a little hard to see. I wish they had put the fill line at the back where water is added.This unit is QUICK!!! and makes very little noise.

It boiled and shut off fine, but every time we used it we had a towel nearby to mop up the spill.Judging from the other reviews, maybe we were just unlucky with this particular one, but we had to replace it after only three months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works for 2 days","review":"Bought this kettle at the Target.

Most people seem to be quoting the distorted newspaper articles that have appeared in the last few weeks. This book, based on Churchill's essay \\"Some People Push Back: On the Justice of Roosting Chickens,\\" is not an attempt to \\"excuse\\" the 9-11 attacks. Rather, it tries to figure out why they happened, and why Americans seem unable to understand why there's so much global anger directed our way. Using two detailed chronologies, Churchill recounts a long and sordid history of U.S. military assaults on other nations, millions of foreign civilians slaughted by our tax dollars, as well as countless violations of international law perpetrated by our government. Given this well-documented litany of abuse, Churchill's argument that some sort of response was--and is--inevitable makes perfect sense.

For instance the faculty committee evaluating his scholarship used words like \\"plagiarism\\", \\"mis-statement\\", \\"false reasoning\\", \\"propaganda\\", \\"mis-quoting sources\\", and so on, when they fired him.Being academics and professionals they could not use more layman-like speech such as \\"liar\\", \\"phony\\", and \\"bigot\\".

I also see a mother who delegates her prenatal responsibilities and blames her failures on those to whom she delegated her duties. The mother delegates the responsibility to some outsider. After 32 hours of instruction and a warning from the step father, she should realize that her son has a problem driving but gives him a car to drive without even driving with him once to see if he is up to the responsibility. What kind of lazy, socially irresponsible person is that.

Yes, this is a tough read, but in the end it is fulfilling and can help teach you a lot about yourself, regardless of any connection to autism.

He's not a Joe Satriani or Steve Vai or Eddie Van Halen type of guitar god. He doesn't do that kind of tasteless shredding or tapping. He plays with feeling and musicality, and that's why I think he is a guitar god. But first and foremost I think he is interested in being a composer. This is why on his \\"covers\\" album 'Have A Little Faith' we saw names like Aaron Copland, Charles Ives, Sonny Rollins and Stephen Foster, not Jimi Hendrix and Jimmy Page. So, if you think that his guitar parts on 'Nashville' should be consciously hard to play, I think you are totally missing the point. \\"Keep Your Eyes Open\\" is one of the most beautiful pieces I have ever heard, and other highlights include \\"Gimme A Holler\\", \\"We're Not From Around Here\\", \\"Shucks\\" and \\"Family\\".

It's definitely the weakest of the bunch, although a couple of the songs are OK. If you want the flamenco rhythms the Gipsy Kings are known for, I prefer Love and Liberte, but any of the other albums are better than this one. If you want unplugged sound, try Allegria; if you want the middle eastern-Moorish musical influence, Mosaique is far superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes you to Spain without the airfare!","review":"I am a diehard GK fan! I fell in love with them after hearing \\"Bamboleo\\". I think they are a fantastic group to introduce the world to Latin music. After hearing just one song, you will fall in love with the ancient gypsy and arabic sounds that are blended with classic instruments. The big plus is the voice of Nick Reyes who is sometimes hard and unstoppable, making you feel the pain of loss or the smooth sensuous voice that makes you feel the passion of love. Their music reflects the landscape of Spain and its history. I visited Spain in February and heard their music many times on the radio. When I want to remember my great time in Spain, I listen to the Gypsy Kings."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good.","review":"This book is not helpful and the pictures are not good.

There is not much copy to read, her \\"tips\\" are very generic or just off-the-mark (she says it's ok to buy termite-ridden antiques because \\"a simple commercially available spray\\" gets rid of termites - somehow I don't see many women attempting this), and the book is mostly photos.

There she meets many delightful people who try to help her find him. After she has a love affair with a younger man, she leaves to go back home.

Some conjecture and innuendo is tossed around a bit irresponsibly but overall one of the best if not the best work on Ben Bey. This has to be one of the first books about Ben Bey that mentions his hereditary extraction (Malian & Fulani). I didn't know upon Banneker's expiration his house and most of all his works were burned to ashes by his racist enemies. Depriving the world of a first hand look into his accomplishments.

They look like they could be scrap rubber from a pair of flipflops. They don't seem able to pick up anything, because the edges are way too thick and rubbery to grip anything as thin and delicate as a contact lens. I bought this not because I had a fear of using my fingers, but because I needed an alternative way of putting in my contacts in, in situations where my hands were not the cleanest. It's a huge disappointment and I wouldn't recommend purchasing it.

Maybe it is just me, but trying this 3-4 times on separate occasions didn't produce any benefit. I am better off trimming fingernails and just squeezing contact with fingers without touching eyeball if possible. Usually successful this way after 1-2 tries.

On his third day of wearing them, they seemed to \\"get stuck\\" on his eyes. We tried and tried different methods from people we knew. I tried to get them out. He was becomming increasingly frustrated. He kept trying to squeeze them with his fingers and kept pinching his eye. We ended up in the emergency room--but fortunately once he relaxed he got them out on his own. I bought this item because of that incident. It took him a couple of tries to get the angle right, but now he prefers this to sticking his finger in his eye. It grabs right onto the contact, doesn't pinch his eye, and gives him confidence.

It's soft, supple and makes it unnecessary to actually touch your eyeball with your finger. However, I only tried it a few times, but was never able to get the soft contact out of my eye with it. In all fairness, I only tried it for about 20 minutes, then just went back to my finger and finally was able to slide the contacts down and pull them out. As time goes by, I find it easier and easier to use my finger, which is somehing I thought I would never be able to do. What I need is a tool of some type to be able to tell if the contact is inside out.

Think twice before you make the seller $6 richer."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good for removing my lens without using my fingers directly","review":"The shipping was fast and I'm pleased with the tiny lens handler which comes in a very small holding case, smaller than a lipstick. It takes me a couple of tries to grip and pinch the lens off each of my eyes, I can't get it on the first try. I'm not sure if you can really get the lens off by doing it the first time, it seems to gradually loosen it from your eye every time you pinch the lens with it. You have to put the two grippers close to the center of the pupils in the middle of the lens, not outside the lens. This tool works much better than the other one I tried which was a treezer with silicon tips, which didn't work at all. I really like having it because I don't have to worry about my nails scraping my eyes anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless as far as I can tell","review":"This product seemed like a great idea, though when I tried to use it I couldn't get it to work for me...perhaps I wasn't persistent enough, but now I'm just fine with using my fingers to remove my contacts..."},{"rating":"1","title":"too soft and small","review":"In theory, the design is not bad, but because the silicone is so pliable and my contacts fit in my eyes like suction cups (even after drops - they do slide easily, just won't let go), I cannot get enough pressure to remove them easily. Also, you need to have your fingers so close to the ends of the tweezer-like end so that it does not bend (i.e. it is too pliable/soft and contorts) that you practically have to touch your eye. Therefore, it is NOT good for people with longer nails. It is also very small which wouldn't help if you have larger fingers. I have very small hands and fingers, and have cut my nails short and still have difficulty. Please see my product pictures. For reference, my ring finger is size 4. I hope this was helpful to you. I definitely would NOT recommend this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work for me at all","review":"I bought this product with the hope that I could get my soft contact lenses in and out of my eyes faster, but to my great disappointment, it doesn't work for me at all.

After taking two and a half hours to take them out one night I decided to break down and get this.

(Got over my fear of touching my eyes by just doing it once an hour with no contacts in)The only reason I can see someone using this if if they have long fingernails.

It's more accessible than some Philip Glass works, carrying very definite melodies and themes.The horror of the Tibetan tragedy is painted in dark musical strokes, contrasted with delicate bells and chimes which can only represent the implacable dignity of the Tibetan people.This score tells the sobering story in its own way, perhaps in a more emotionally compelling way, than does the film. Not to be missed. A true tour de force."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indescribable, but I will try","review":"What could be better than a tapestry of Glass and traditional Tibetan chants and music. The music from this film is so moving but stands on its own. It works cohesively and you wonder where the hour or so has gone so quickly. My mere words cannot describe the beauty of this CD, but to say that if you have interest in Philip Glass and/or Tibet and/or want to have something unique, then KUNDUN is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The audience for this is unclear.","review":"The music is too complicated for small children. My grand daughter likes to sing along with another CD we have. There is no singing along with this one. The singers have opera trained voices, that they use on a CD of nursery rhymes. A single singer instead of a chorus, in a folk song style would have been better. The orchestra is quite good. But by the time they get through embellishing the original song, it is often hard to recognize. There is more orchestra alone than orchestra plus chorus. A small group that played background for the singer would have been better. A classical music fan might like this CD. But nursery rhymes, maybe not so much.There are 65 minutes of music on this CD. Many of the nursery rhymes I have ever heard of and 5 that were new to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"unbearable interference noise","review":"The electrical interference I was hearing on my car stereo when I powered on this unit made this unit pretty much unuseable, will probably give it to someone who has power outlets further back in the car(van),I assume it will make a difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"A monster lineup","review":"I expected a lot of this album because of the names on the cover, and I have not really been disappointed.

Recently received the Grammy for Jazz Instrumental Individual/Group, and it certainly deserved it. Burton, Metheny, and Corea play off each other marvelously, weaving a hypnotic tapestry of music against a solid rhythm section which will delight the listener every time he or she plays this disc. These cats sound great, and the disc is solid from start to finish, no need for the \\"next track\\" button here. Add to shopping cart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheer Beauty","review":"This is definitely a worthy CD to purchase. Granted, this is not really a 'working' band, but rather 5 of the greatest living players on their respective instruments coming together to play. Therefore, I can understand some of the reviewers saying this is a jam session. It is. But Holy Cow can these guys play! Unlike most all-star line-ups that happen in the jazz industry, where the listener can tell that there is no rapport, this session sounds so fresh to my ears, and the general vibe is that all of the players are having FUN and really enjoying each other. It's like every player is having a field day with each solo, and everyone is totally grooving on each other.I can't think of too many other recent CD's that have given me that feeling.This one is really special."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pyle of @#$%","review":"Where to begin:The Amplifier has a sleek and eye pleasing exterior...that's the goodThe Bad: It has a built-in mp3 player which will \\"fetch\\" mp3's off a USB flash drive...stopped working after only a few months.After having the amplifier running for a few months (7 to be exact) the output is completely unintelligible.

It's an absolute favorite of mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too jazzy","review":"Sorry, but I was truly disappointed in what I expected to be the grand orchestra style of Rodgers & Hammerstein. What I got was a jazzed up version done by a piano and no other instrument. It truly sounded like I was in a hotel bar. While some may enjoy this style of music, I was looking for the old fashioned type of Rodgers & Hammerstein; you know, with violins, cellos, trumpets, drums, etc...the whole grand experience that fills your heart with joy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Delerue Sampler","review":"Contained on this disc are excerpts from scores that Georges Delerue composed for several films by director Francois Truffaut: Two English Girls, The Soft Skin, Such a Georgeous Kid Like Me, Love at 20 -- Antoine and Colette, The Woman Next Door, Shoot the Piano Player, Dayi for Night, The Last Metro, Jules and Jim, plus La valse de Francois T. It's a marvelous collection of themes by Delerue, who was much honored in his native France but to my mind never recognized as much as he should be in this country. As at least one other reviewer noted, hearing this music evokes memories of the films themselves -- for me, Jules and Jim in particular. My favorite selection, however, remains the Chorale from Day for Night, music that was also used in The Race for the Double Helix. For a tidy set of film music by Delerue, you really can't beat these magnificent performances by the London Sinfonietta under Hugh Wolff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgia Trip","review":"Helps you remember these great and atmospheric movies.

Highly Recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This is one of the few books out of several dozen I have ordered from amazon that have been disappointing. The reason is now obvious to me: most or all of the other reviews have been written by Ms. Pinskey's friends and contacts. The book itself is uninteresting, generally fairly obvious, and heavily biased towards the US market. I would have given it two stars, but I am sufficiently angry at the misuse of the review system to want to introduce some balance.

Most independent book publicists charge $2-5,000 a month and it usually takes six months or more just to lay the groundwork for an effective publicity campaign. You can do it yourself.This book covers the basics of promotion: media campaigns, media events, media kits, your contact file, how to pitch the media, using gimmicks to get attention, the art of the follow-up, interviews and a lot of inside advice.Raleigh Pinskey is a successful author, publisher, speaker and promoter with years of experience.As the author of 113 books (including revisions and foreign-language editions) and over 500 magazine articles, I highly recommend this book to authors and publishers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright colorful book that children will enjoy","review":"\\"On the Banks of the Amazon\\" takes the reader out for a day with two photographers as they travel along the edge of the Amazon River. They encounter howler monkeys, poison dart frogs, an anaconda, parrots, caiman and other animals. Detailed full-page illustrations keep a child's interest well and support the reading material. It is a well-done bilingual book written in English and Spanish for children about seven to ten years old. \\"On the Banks of the Amazon\\" is a recommended children's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's frank miller... what do you expect?","review":"Compelling, gritty, sexy & nasty.

The story is weak in that the relationships, the plot lines and detours, and the sex and violence are all very clumbsy and unfinished: reads like a painfully long pulp novel or a piece of art made to fulfill a contract. The illustrations are equally uninspired, very careless character designs and shoddy linework in general compared to other razor-sharp \\"Sin City\\" strips. The hallucination sequence near the end is for me the only memorable part of this whole thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong end to a great series","review":"Sin City was a little weak in the middle, especially in Book 6, but with this volume Frank Miller finishes with a bang.

It tells you about the environment in a scientific but understandable manner, and suggests ways you can make a difference. Understanding why grass does not hold much water, causing runoff and clogging our rivers with fertilizers, leading to algae growth, will give you a real impetus to plant a tree, shrub or decorative ground cover. You will never look at a large, green lawn with admiration again! This is just the beginning. I recommend this to all my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight up","review":"Sauer has written a great book focusing on the restoration and management of Eastern forests. She jumps right to the point chapter after chapter making the book packed full of helpful and educational insights. The only real problem that I have with the book is that it is very regional (eastern forests) and not comprehensive in that way. But if your focus is on the Eastern US region then I highly recommend this book. Very eye opening."},{"rating":"2","title":"A More Realistic View of a Saint","review":"The book Secrets of the Saints includes accounts of three saints in just under 400 pages, yet is an improvement over the usual page-length summaries in books on saintly lives. An early introduction to one of the saints, St. Therese Lisieux. referred to as The Little Flower, made me wonder whether she was one example to follow. Then, while reading a book by the monk Thomas Merton who traced his life from an atheistic background all the way to conversion to Roman Catholicism, he mentioned this author, Henri Gheon, as painting a picture of this young saint that took away the Pollyanna picture we can have of her. Gheon seemed to work from the saint's life story without any embellishment which some say her sister might have added after the Story of a Soul that Therese wrote. I suggest that ordering this 1944 publication is worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grover in fantasy land","review":"Grover panders to the American fantasy of the impossible: a high service government and low taxes. This can be done by exploding the national debt, precisely what has happened in the Reagan and W years. Reagan slashed taxes and within the eight years of his administration, the national debt doubled. W was foolish enough to cut taxes while fighting a war, the first American president to do something that stupid. As the dollar dives, the foolishness of low taxation should be obvious to all, but it isn't. OPEC debated in Nov 07 whether they should stop taking dollars in payment for oil--a sign of the times.As long as foreign governments, including China, are willing to buy our government bonds, high US national spending with low taxes will last. But nothing lasts forever. Interest rates will go up big time, buying a house will be prohibitively expensive for most, and few Americans will blame themselves for the fiscal profligacy of the people they elected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glib","review":"To the reviewer who wants to meet Grover, let me tell you that I have met him and he is utterly charmless, rude, and self-absorbed. He does not know how to listen, only to push ahead in his own views. And this book is like him. He does not engage arguments in a thoughtful and meaningful way, but belittles and labels opponents. This is not the place to find a reasoned argument."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid album. Even if you are not a fan of breakbeat.","review":"Breakbeat -for me- is a genre that is kind of hard to get into. IMO it is either not properly done or it sounds so inacessible that you can't get into it. It either is poorly mixed in sets or the tracks are cool but have no soul or any spirit within them. By that I mean, no ethereal vocals that can connect with a crowd of listeners or make you interested in the sound, let alone dance to it.So having said that, this cd is actually pretty good. I really like how it is put together. The tracks go well with each other, great fluidity in the sound and the tracks picked just keep on getting better and better.So this mix just keeps on getter better and better until it gets to the second last track by orbital, the remix by stereo 8. It seems like the whole mix is leading up to this amazing and powerful track. IMO this cd is worth getting just to hear this track alone.This cd has grown on me more and more. I really like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Family Entertainment","review":"We often listen to audiobooks on long trips and it's rare to find one that entertains the whole family - Preschoolers, school-age and Mom and Dad! This one did just that. It's an interesting story with great characters. The narrator was OUTSTANDING; one of the best I've ever listened to.

Loved it first time but lost it in a move. I was reminded of it when I watched 'The Motorcycle Diaries' a wonderfully evocative memory to Che Guevara's early life before he joined Castro in the Cuban revolution. Santaolalla wrote the soundtrack to the movie, which perfectly matched it, but I wanted to get the original CD once again. Haven't regretted it for a minute. Living in Texas it's good to hear that Armadillos are used for something more useful than just roadkill. That's what Santaolalla uses as the body of his guitar/mandoline type stringed instrument throughout the CD. The whole CD gives a feeling of space, size and airyness. Go buy it. PS he's been nominated for an Oscar for the music for 'Brokeback Mountain' this March. Let's hope that he still manages to produce CDs in their own right in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ronroco, a master plays this instrument infusively","review":"The music of Gustavo Santaolalla as played on the ronroco, a five dougle-stringed instrument of his Argentinian homeland is the most haunting, romantically sensuous creation I have listened to since I heard the soundtrack whilst viewing the movie \\"Phaedra\\" the music of which was composed by Mika Theodokorapolis (sp) and played by the lovely couple Ida Presti and Alexandre Lagoya. If you have a special someone in your life and wish to enjoy music during a quiet time together, this CD is a must. I bought eight of them to give to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Authentic folk virtuosity","review":"Gustavo Santaolalla evokes the plains and mountians of South America with his cascading melodies, as in Atacama. The simple \\"Coyita\\" waltz carries a heartbreakingly beautiful grace. This CD is at once a true indigenous recording and a very modern, minimalist work full of emotion and tonal textures. It has been beautifully recorded - resonant as a courtyard, as immediate as a live performance.Whenever I hear these simple and haunting songs, I remember each drive in my car when I listened to them. This is music of the senses and the soul - timeless and true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Good Band from England","review":"Kill II This is the most \\"famous\\" English metal Band with OMS and Earthtone 9.

Nearly from the beginning, the CD player was finicky, sometimes playing, sometimes not recognizing a CD (saying \\"no disc\\"). Well, it went from finicky to worse. The cover doesn't close tight enough to play the CD. We would have to hold firm pressure on the lid to get the CD started and then if we let go, it would often stop playing. Our son has sensitive sleep habits, and messing up his music, was enough to mess up his sleep - very frustrating!

I like to play CD's for him at nap time and again before bed. This one was so compact and had all the features I was looking for including repeat play. I've tried three different CD's now and it is real touchy. Sometimes it will play, other times it skips for the duration the first 2 songs then plays fine or quits playing altogether. I'm very disappointed with it as I had done my research on all the features and this one was perfect. I guess next time I'll do research on reveiws as well. I also found it to be noisy as another reviewer mentioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible display","review":"I received this model as a gift, and it functioned just fine and had the features I wanted (though I'm now aware many others have the weekday/weekend/7day setting, this one didn't). The only problem is with the display. I have the alarm clock across the room on the dresser to keep the snooze button addiction to a minimum. The display on this is a nice blue, but the background glows blue as well, and in the morning it is nearly impossible to read the time from across the room. This is definitely unacceptable, and it was promptly returned to the mega-mart I bought it at. Now I'm shopping around for a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"unreliable alarm","review":"This alarm clock started off being a good alarm. I have used it for about 6 months and it hasn't performed as well as when I first bought it. The cd is supposed to continue where you left off the day before on the alarm function...this no longer works, it starts at the first of the cd. Some mornings the alarm never goes off, this has happened about 3 times in the last 2 months and is embarrasing when I'm late to work! The battery life has been fine, my kids unplugged it and it still went off the next morning, so that feature works.Because of me being late to work multiple times I have to give this alarm a poor review, hopefully this saves you some time and embarrasment."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your time","review":"Ever since I bought this alarm clock one year ago, I've hated it. It's features work fine. But, when the lights are out, the dim setting for the backlight is so dim you can't see the time. The high backlight setting is so bright you don't want to face it - it's very bright. I've tried putting things over the time - sheer fabric or paper - but it's still too bright, and disturbs my sleep. (I'm not a picky sleeper.) Many other reviewers I have read say the same thing - they couldn't solve the too bright/too dim dilemma. After one year of frustration, I'm buying a new alarm clock. This is a redundant product.

The mixture of classical music with a dose of jazz on a Latin base produces an interesting result that is quite surprising at first. However, the more one hears, the more the result grows on the listener, just as at the live show where the audience, somewhat stunned at the outset, gave a standing ovation at the end.Overall, the m��lange is pleasant, chill listening to be appreciated by fans of any of the three styles of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensual, romantic, sophisticated,","review":"The music and perforamance are so sensually played and achingly beautiful, the hairs on my neck and arms stand up on end. Listen to the opening track and tell me this is not sensually intriguing. Yes, tango is a very sensual art form and this CD is great for those very intimate moments. Of course, sex aside, the music is nothing short of a miracle unto itself. That I was to discover this CD just last year meant I was without it for 7 years since it was released.

I usually prefer the more upbeat tunes and the swingers... \\"Knowing you\\" has far more of those then on John's previous disks. This disk also sounds much cleaner then other telarc recordings ( good production value )... Throw in a bunch of great guests like the virtuoso and terribly underrated clarinetist Ken Peplowski and Larry Goldings (organ) and you have a disk that's worth the cash done in a style that is all too scarce in this day and age of jazz that tends to over intellectualize."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixed bag","review":"Ok, I do enjoy Mr. Pizzarelli's music, his guitar playing is excellent and when he joins voice and guitar riffs, very nice.

(I have some that I bought a few years ago.) Both the inner and outer walls were solid glass. Now the outer wall has a little hole in the bottom that's covered by a thin piece of silicon about 1/4\\" in diameter. It's very easy to damage that little piece, and when you do the glass is useless -- water gets in between the inner and outer walls and doesn't dry out. Bodum's explanation for the hole is some mumbo-jumbo about temperature variations. I never had any problem with the glasses in their original configuration. Talk about solving a nonexistent problem!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If they tip, they break!","review":"These glasses are extremely fragile. When I was getting married, we registered for eight of these, hoping they would make great beer glasses. Unfortunately, they started breaking almost immediately. Within a year, we had none left!All the glasses were handwashed, and I wonder if that's the problem. In a sink full of dishes, even the slightest tip of the glass into anything else would break it. By my standards, that's extremely fragile. In contrast, the standard pint glasses we have from Target almost never break under the same circumstances.(And, to be fair, we have short Bodum glasses as well, and six of the eight are still with us after four years of marriage.

I also like drinks with ICE. You will be amazed at how long ice will last in these glassed before melting. So not only will these glasses keep drinks cold (without ice) like for beer but they seem to last forever for drinks (with ice) - like for soda or water. There is also zero condensation so no need for coasters to protect you tables (this alone can make these worth it). The outside of the glass remains dry and your hands remain dry so the glass remains clean.They are expensive and they are extremely FRAGILE (like other reviewers have said) and they will break.

My bodum glasses have lasted years--I have had my pavina 9 oz glasses for almost three years and I haven't lost one yet. I lose one or two canteen glasses a year due to my own negligence. Treat them with respect. If you don't drop ice in them, knock them against the counter or sink, or drop them on a hard surface, then they will be fine. After reading so many reviewers complaints about receiving broken glasses, I'm definitely not going to order any more from Amazon. I'm wondering if that's why so many people are having problems.

But, he is less worried about the THINGS, and more worried about his relationship with George. Also, in the side stories many of the characters make their presents, putting a lot of thought, effort and creativity into the process.

He did not look hard enough to find what is truly representative of the Coney of lore, because had he done so, it's still there, just difficult to unearth. The pictures of the parade just shows how far down Americas greatest playground has gone.

The chapter lengths are just right in that they are not too long, but also not lacking for detailed information. Each chapter also has a map that illustrates where the particular explorer travelled, which was extremely helpful. There are also 3 separate sections of illustrations and photos which helps give a visual picture of the explorers.Overall, this book is packed with information and is written in such a way that each chapter is told like a story and each story takes you back in time to a different era.

The bodies were found 240 miles away and were said to have been sweep under by an undercurrent. The chicken survived. That is not even the funniest of the stories they have in this book. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a good laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"So hilarious I laughed till my sides hurt.","review":"I bought this book for my teenage son for his birthday -- he is a big fan of the related http://www.darwinawards.com website. Before I wrapped it, I read the inside flap and was completely drawn in by the concept: namely, how fatally dumb people can be. Once I started reading the book I couldn't put it down. It is THAT funny. There are some cautionary tales, of a rather gruesome nature, that impulsive types (such as my son!) should take heed of. Perfect for teenagers, and the teenager in all of us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stories, stories, stories. And some weird insights.","review":"More than you might expect, this book is stuffed with stuff! It collates all the Darwin Awards emails you've ever gotten and more, labels 'em truth or fiction, and puts them right where you need them most -- on the toilet, on the train, in bed. I learned why farts are NOT deadly, why a polar bear swim IS, and what to do when you're being constricted by a snake (spew high-proof alcohol all over its maw.) Plus each chapter has a weird insight into what we might be evolving into, whether testosterone causes Darwins, and so on. One down side is that a few stories don't have references, and some are more macabre than funny. But still a must-have for anyone who thinks humans have a long way to evolve. This book proves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Painfully entertaining","review":"When taken in small doses the reader will find \\"The Darwin Awards\\" sometimes hilarious, sometimes unbelievable, but almost always entertaining. One real weakness of the book is that the reader has to sift through Northcutt's banal chapter introductions to get to the \\"good stuff\\". Many times the introductions are just needless fluff. We KNOW these people did amazingly dumb things or they wouldn't be in the book!That aside, the stories about the award winners definitely overcome Northcutt's limitations as an author. (Maybe she should have thought about just being the \\"editor\\".) The chapters are well constructed and cover just about every imaginable subject under the sun. Particularily good are the chapters on \\"Animal Adventures\\" and \\"Fire and Explosion\\". As you read the book you'll do a lot of head-shaking - how CAN people be this stupid sometimes?If you enjoy reading about the misfortunes of others or just need a good laugh now and then, give this book a try. 3 and 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"This was an incredibly funny book. It entertained my husband and I on a long car trip over the holidays. It's full of slapstick humor, as the title and description indicate. If you like the \\"stupid criminal file\\" stuff on the local news and other such \\"news of the weird\\" articles, you'll like this. If you don't like that stuff, you probably won't like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful - I used to be a Darwin fan.","review":"This book contains stories that in most cases are more pathetic than funny. And that's coming from a guy who used to be a big Darwin Awards fan. A typical story tells of an abusive boyfriend (guffaw) who goes to jail for beating his girlfriend (chortle). She begs the judge to release him because she can't afford the rent (hee hee). He kills her and burns her body (giggle), and then blows himself up trying to burn the house down. Haw Haw haw! If you like that you'll love the book.Most of the funnier stories are \\"Urban Legends\\", which is to say, fabrications. Even these aren't written with good comic sense. Worst by far is the revelation that the two best Darwin winners ever ( The twin dufuses at the Metalica concert and the home made Ford fairlane/Rocket sled), were made up. I would have been happier if I had not read the book and had my bubble burst. Actually I received a gift set of volumes 1 and 2. Didn't finish the first. Don't plan on reading the second."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distracting, but no more.","review":"Virtually everyone has already seen these accounts on the internet and in email. Having them all together is really not worthwhile. It turns out (as might be expected) that the really entertaining Darwin Awards are fictional, and while they're included, relegating them to \\"Urban Legends\\" takes a little wind out of the whole concept of the Award. With few exceptions, the book is filled out with less amusing accidents and mistakes. The author tries to add value with various debunking, a few bits of scientific trivia, and some tangential comments at the start of each chapter. On the whole, it's a distracting collection - quickly read, but quite forgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely funny","review":"I've been a fan of the Darwin Awards web site for a long time and was thrilled that Wendy Northcutt wrote a Darwin Awards book! She has a special way with words that makes all the stories seem even funnier. The book is hard to put down, a real page turner. Hope she writes another!! Great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"High in Potential... Low in Execution","review":"I have read many an email about a new Darwin Award winner and was really looking forward to this anthology of Darwin Award winners.But, a clunky writing style and an amateurish attempt by an apparent first time editor made this material hard to read in a 300 page book format. Add to that the rather low ratio of truly humorous stories and you have a poorly executed effort.The second star is for the content that IS truly humorous and will get you rolling every once in a while. This would make an okay bathroom book... but wait for paperback and the smaller price tag.>>>>>>><<<<<<<A Guide to my Book Rating System:1 star = The wood pulp would have been better utilized as toilet paper.2 stars = Don't bother, clean your bathroom instead.3 stars = Wasn't a waste of time, but it was time wasted.4 stars = Good book, but not life altering.5 stars = This book changed my world in at least some small way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"I must admit I misunderstood what this book was about. There isn't anything funny about people dying, regardless of the circumstances. The truth is, we're all \\"stupid\\". The only difference between us and them is that it cost them their lives, they will have no more tomorrows, and their families and freinds will have to deal with it. I tried to give it zero stars, but the system wouldn't let me.Besides, the author seriously seems to believe that man \\"evolved from apes\\", or that evolution is even possible. (think about it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"People are stupid. I don't need a book to tell me","review":"OK, hearing about one of the Darwin Award winners can be funny.But there's only so much stupidity I can take at once.My biggest problem with the book was that the WRITING wasn't funny. Too \\"just the facts\\" oriented to be entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny!","review":"Its a very hilarious book! I enjoy science and biology very much and know quite a bit of Evolution and Natural Selcetion, but who cares about the scientific irregularities in the book it was only made for our enjoyment and I strongly recommend buying this book if you want a good laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"check this out!","review":"This book is set around the stupidity of the human race. Its contents include short stories of stupid true things that people have done. The lesson to be learned is the strong survive. Everyone else that cannot contribute good and smartness to the human race is eliminated by their own acts of stupidity. I highly recommend this book to anyone that wants a laugh. It is a humorous and enjoyable book that many are sure to love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoiding Fate","review":"We are all one step from looking ridiculous, all one heartbeat from death. It may be that we are at some level superstitious, believing that if we can feel superior to others we can keep the evil fates at bay. The day I fell off a skateboard, my students laughed and laughed (a skateboard, in a straight skirt and heels!), but I could have broken my neck instead of my wrist, so I just missed being a candidate for this book. And there were other occasions too embarrasssing to recount. Probably most of those who find this book hilarious have had some near misses, maybe some they didn't even notice. I would hang with John Donne \\"Each man's death diminishes me because I am involved in mankind\\". Those who think these tales of folly leading to a bad end are funny may be safe for the moment, but they are at risk in the next moment themselves. This book does not make me laugh. This book makes me sad, sad for the untimely deceased, sad for the self-satisfied fools who think these tales are funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"As funny as a car wreck","review":"Stories of people killing themselves through carelessness is hardly an uplifting subject. What's required is a humorous slant to make an otherwise morbid subject entertaining. Unfortunately, this book lacks almost any trace of wit or insight and the treatment of its subjects is dry and even clinical. Don't get me wrong -- I'm all for laughing at the foibles and frailties (i.e., stupidity) of my fellow man. But pretty quickly into this book, you may find yourself wishing you had some Prozac. If you're the type of person who finds the obituaries section of your newspaper hilarious, you'll love this book. Otherwise you may want to pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mean-spirited","review":"This book is salt on the wounds of bereaved families. I don't think this book is a great book. I don't think there is kindness or humility in this book. You can decide on that. What I want to say is this book is salt on the wounds of bereaved families."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak but still freakishly compelling","review":"Okay, the Darwin Awards are a dubious notion at best, and this book reads like a collection of wildly divergent, unconnected brief tales which often -- but not always -- come to a morbid conclusion. Most have no more detail than a newspaper clipping, which is generally their source. As anything more than a way to pass the time, this collection is worthless.But as time-passers go, you could do a lot worse. I found myself barely able to put the book down as I scanned entries, hoping and expecting that the next tale would be more interesting than the stupid one I just read. I was rewarded just enough to keep me coming back for more. This book is in the tradition of those odd \\"Best worst and most unusual\\" and \\"Panati's beginnings/endings of things\\" that kept me up late nights during my early teen years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain unfunny.","review":"Humor is a totally subjective thing, of course. For instance, I love the Onion, the Simpsons, Buster Keaton, and \\"A Confederacy of Dunces.\\" If you're not familiar, I'll just let you know that that's quite a range. The Darwin Awards was not funny to me at all. There were some bizarre stories, but I couldn't help feeling that the book was supposed to be a humorous one, and it failed miserably. The stories are like clinically-told jokes, which just doesn't work. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money...........","review":"Buy the first edition of the Darwin Awards because it is hilarious and a page turner..............don't waste your money on this edition though. It's like the good \\"Darwinians\\" have all done themselves in and the author's scraping up stories to cash in on the \\"Award\\" trend. There are less than a half dozen 'tell around the water cooler' stories to share. Even at a used book price, it's not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"dark humor but gives you stories to talk about at parties","review":"At first I thought this book was going to be very funny. Or at least give me stories to share with my friends. The book even warns in the beginning not to read it like a regular book but rather to read a story here and there. So at first it was interesting to see how people do stupid things but after a while it got dark and depressing because everyone in the book must die of their stupidity to be eligiable for the book. The book was good in the way that it verified all stories so you know they are true. But this book is not for the faint at heart. This book would be great for that family member that we all have who has that dark cynical quirky sense of humor. Well I hope we all have one and I am not the only one who has one lol. It did give me some stories to tell at parties and social occasions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to see here.","review":"There's no way around it; this book presents the deaths of real people as entertainment. As other readers have noted, many of these stories just seem tragic, and the idea of millions of readers getting a good laugh out of the death of someone's son, someone's sister, somone's father, is disturbing.Second, the name \\"Darwin\\" Awards is catchy but a misnomer, and a bad one. A better name would be \\"social Darwinism\\", and even that is really a misuse of Darwin's name. Along with the phrase 'survival of the fittest', it has done a great deal to mislead people as to the meaning of evolution.You'd be better off watching reruns of \\"Jackass\\" than spending money on this book; at least everyone on that show survives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly horrid!","review":"This book not only showed how horrid and condescending an author can be, but how to make your reader SNORE. I felt that Wendy Northcutt's writing was trivial, and dull. She not only pushed her idea that fools should not be allowed to live through darwins discovery of natural selection. I'm still confused at how Wendy Northcutt survived as a writer, i had figured there would be natrual selection when it came to writers. Sadly her and her writing has not been killed off, yet. Not funny, and a book only to fill one with scorn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repugnant","review":"These stories succeed only in making officious fun of sad human error. It's a book to make the self important even more arrogant. This book is depressing and its readership equally discouraging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liz speaks out","review":"If there were a zero on your scale, I would have given The Darwin Awards a zero. One (1) is too generous. This book is a disgrace and reveals that the author is not highly evolved herself. Where's the compassion? Where's the love for others? Where is even a smidgen of human kindness in this book? Ignorance, even stupidity, are not funny. They are tragic. Misfortune is not funny. Nothing about this book was the least bit amusing. Northcutt should have waited a few years to write a book, should have given herself time to mature and evolve. She would have written a totally different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to do with natural selection","review":"It's amusing to read the assertion that conscientious objectors of the Darwin Awards just don't appreciate, or just can't handle the implications of science: these science-minded DA defenders apparently don't understand that a handful of random & accidental deaths have no effect on the fitness of a species.The Darwin Awards are a pseudo-scientific excuse for the callous to profit from the tragedies of the unfortunate by marketing to the smug and self-satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last - Someone with common sense","review":"After reading many of the books published by groups like \\"FARMS\\" who without prejudice invent outlandish and obsurd scenarios to support their theories, Phyllis has compiled a book that not only speaks to the heart through the spirit, but also supports her premises with fact and common sense. Each and every chapter of her book is based on the one fact we have ...THE BOOK OF MORMON. Nowhere does she fabricate ideas to support her own theories, but relies on scriptural references and architectural proof.

Needless to say, it was very disappointing to find that defective copies of the game are still on the market in Nov. and Dec. when the problem was discovered before May! The recall has been going on for so long ther was no direct link on the company's home page. You must web search to find the proper site and get recall instructions. We were instructed to ship just the game (defective game cartridge only) to the company. It took at least 4 weeks to receive a working game cartridge (which ironically arrived in just a waterproof envelope!) I would have given the game a higher star rating as my son says it is enjoyable, but a flaw that affected so many games should have been corrected (and the defective cartridges recalled from the distributors) long before the holidays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuban Piano","review":"Lots of latin, cuban style piano music.....similar to Bebos piano, if you like piano and good latin music for listening or dancing, this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Music.","review":"How wonderful that the man's artistry was recorded before it's gone forever. The album brought me back to my childhood home in Havana - all the songs that remind me of my parents and grandmother, now gone but not forgotten. The execution is flawless technically and yet has passion and soul and whimsy ; I was surprised to find myself listening to the Russian ballad \\"Black Eyes\\" in the middle of the typically Afro-Cuban \\"Mandinga\\" and had to listen to the piece a few times before I caught the rift between the two compositions.The album represents the best of the Cuban \\"big band\\" era and is a must for every lover of Cuban music. My Dad would have loved this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exhilerating - even if you don't know the story behind it.","review":"Ruben Gonzalez is a treasure of the music world. It's clear from his playing that music is more than a vocation or a passion for him - it's life. I have had a passion for Afro-Latin based music of the Caribbean/Colombia/Brazil/Panama/Central America zone for thirty years. During that time those in the know would invariably concede that Cuban music and Cuban musicians were the best. I had never found a way to evaluate these opinions. Now we have Ruben Gonzalez to hand us the proof."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare gift from a national treasure.","review":"This is a beautiful, lyrical, enchanting album that can be listened to on many levels.

But, to my disappointment the last time these men performed together was in 1998. Huge heartache for me. I did not know that each and everyone of them have released their own cd's. I ordered Ruben Gonzalez's cd because this man can play a piano like no other. I am sure Liberace had never met this man before and lucky for him he didn't he would of retired at an early age! Who knew that listening to piano cuban jazz could knock you out of your seat with hardly any words, now that is amazing. You will find your self taping your feet and shaking your shoulders!

The book was decent up until the first mention of homosexuality which caught me a bit by surprise as I saw no reference to this on the Amazon.com page or reviews- only 5 stars. I have no problem with homosexuality, however I don't enjoy reading about EVERY detail of the authors sexual encounters with other men. I continued reading until part two when the sexual descriptions became almost the entire story rather than with him dealing with his drinking problem. I then decided to skim through the book and see if it got any better, however the passages I read only became more graphic and came more often.

This book is a lot more enjoyable, and 'lite', but its candy for the brain. Again I just could not find Augusten likeable, almost vital for a memoir, and though he is significantly older in this book, he still seems to carry the same baggage with him. There is a certain cruelty when Augusten describes other people besides himself, so my sympathy for his plight diminished very quickly.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"cadavar of hype","review":"Please: 'brutally honest', 'twisted humor', 'witty anecdotes'? These heavy words so lightly thrown could not screw the potential consumer more royally. People, do not use these terms so loosely, and irresponsibly! All anecdotes are Not clever and witty.

I would recommend this to anyone who wants to delve deeper into what alcoholism truly is to someone with a very REAL drinking problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"How do you just live?","review":"In no time I finished this autobiographic book and I loved it. Burroughs' style of writing is very natural and prosaic. Every now and then he displays quite some insight in human condition and phylosophy. It seemed to me he has a strong and creative personality. Somehow though he 'likes' to be sedated and lonely. Is there a cause for becoming an alcoholic? Well, some he confesses, others are left behind or dont even exist. I was suprised this publicity agency where he works sends him to a rehabilitation centre to give him a chance to recover. I thought NYC is much more tough. While reading I visited Augusten's website. I found out he is dry now, and happy with his partner Dennis. That's a relief :-) I have seen a lot of drinking and using drugs in the gayscene myself. I guess for the same reasons as for straight people, to control the deep fears of failure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, raw follow-up to \\"Running with Scissors\\"","review":"I had to run out and buy this book the minute I finished \\"Running with Scissors\\", and I was not disappointed. After getting over the initial shock that Augusten had managed to land a six-figure, seemingly glamorous advertising job, I was sucked into the story of him realizing that he had a problem, and through the ups and downs of recovery. (The \\"Benadryl moment\\" was really breathtaking, imagine taking 10-15 Benadryl a day to avoid the effects of the alcohol you keep pouring into your body--and not realizing that's a problem!) I really felt the pain of his relationships, especially in the death of his best friend.I highly recommend this book, and I hope that wherever he is, Mr. Burroughs is continuing his journey of recovery, and that he constantly reminds himself of the obstacles he has overcome to get where he is today, and the bravery it took to bring his story to all of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Scissors, but still sharp!","review":"Not as nearly as good as Running with Scissors, but nonetheless a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book.","review":"This book is absolutely wonderful, it's interesting, well paced, funny and heartbreaking.I cried when I read this book.

He's tremendous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Augusten Burroughs stunning tale of addiction and recovery.","review":"For anyone who has experience with addiction, rehab or a loved one that's been through it this book is powerful, funny, heartbreaking and utterly believable. For those readers fortunate enough not to have traveled that road I suppose it would be like a city dweller reading a memoir written by an avid gardener. If you can't relate, you might not \\"get it\\". For the rest of us this is a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it over and over","review":"Witty, relevant, thoughtful, and one of the best books I have ever read. if you love a wicked sense of humor, you will love this book. Then read all the other books by this author. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Non-Fiction","review":"After a day of lawyering, I seek sharp, witty reading that allows me a break from the staid work day. \\"Dry\\" was a respite from my dull schedule and provided me some laughs before turning out the light. Since I have some experience with A.A., I could identify with the process he wrote about with such off-hand humor, and I really liked his alcoholic sarcasm."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Sometimes I feel like I have hives in my brain that I can't scratch...\\"","review":"I read RUNNING w/ SCISSORS not too long ago - and a friend passed along DRY. The book was fast - a well-paced fast, and for much of it, I had a very hard time putting it down. Burroughs' again sets his own tone - using the thick and painful material of which his life and esp. his childhood is comprised.His long (long) investigation of substance abuse - and the twist that makes all of this substance abuse come across as if it might just be everyone else's fault for not giving him the right foundation and coping mechanisms wore thin after a bit.Burroughs is at his best when he is getting on with the business of living. The inside journey at rehab, his relationship with a reformed crack addict and most especially, the HIV+ Pighead are indelible and incredibly revealing.Once again, I really appreciated his writing, his humor (dry, sarcastic, poignant), and his spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing story from a growing writer","review":"I'll admit I didn't like this book much immediately after I finished it, but so much of it has continued to haunt me that I've changed my opinion. I'm not a huge fan of confessionals, but this is one that is so competently done that it can't be overlooked.Dry is sort of Volume 2 of Burroughs' memoirs and tells the story of his struggle with alcoholism and a friend dying of AIDs (I'm hoping he writes a Volume 1 and a half to fill in the gaps between the two books). There's a lot of dark humor here, and a lot of plain old \\"dark\\". It's a completely different approach from the one he used in \\"Running with Scissors,\\" and a far more effective one. Although not as \\"entertaining\\" as his first book, it's also not as flippant or dismissable. He's taken on a huge challenge as a writer to examine some bleak periods and convey them in a way that will appeal to many readers. He mostly succeeds in a big way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astounding","review":"Augusten Burroughs never ceases to amaze. This is by far my favorite book of his. The writing is terrific, the story is captivating. I couldn't put it down. The characters are so real, and even if alcohol isn't you thing, you can identify something in your life that has taken over and relate.One of my favorite lines comes from a passage where he is describing an ex boyfriend of his. He says,\\"He's like this incredibly beautiful Van Gogh painting with slashes all through it. True, it's a Van Gogh. But look at those slashes.\\"That line made me identify with someone in my own life and helped me realize that sometimes we have to let people go because no matter how much we love them, we cannot make them whole. It actually helped me set aside someone I had been unable to leave behind.This book is a terrific read. Go out and pick it up. Don't get it from the library- bo buy it. You'll end up buying it anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really, really honest","review":"I am amazed at the brutal honesty that Augusten Burroughs possesses to write a second book on his painful past. He writes with such pathos and truth and humor that it feels like he is sitting next to you retelling his struggles. Dry is a testament to human strength and perserverance."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great read","review":"sometimes sad, sometimes funny. you will get wrapped up in dry, and ab's insights into his drinking problem. i had trouble putting this one down, and only wish he had more to tell us"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious.","review":"This was an extremely interesting book that made me laugh out loud more times than I could count.

You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fantastic.","review":"I was addicted to reading this book. Finished it in a week. This is Burroughs BEST work. I have heard that a movie is in the works, as long as it isn't as horrible as 'Running with Scissors' was, then I can't wait to see how they do that.I can relate to Augusten in his career choices, making this enjoyable for me to read. Also, its a good semi-continuation to 'Running with Scissors.' I feel bad for this guy, his life (what is completely true from his 'memoirs') seems to have been absolutely ridiculous, but it makes for a GREAT book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More disturbing and more rewarding than Running W Scissors","review":"The sequal to Running With Scissors is even more disturbing and more rewarding; a much more mature work and one that haunts you long after you finish reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent memoir (until the end...)","review":"Dry is the third book from Augusten Burroughs, following the novel Sellevision and the memoir Running With Scissors. Dry, like Running, is a memoir, this time of Burroughs's struggles with alcoholism and recovery.Burroughs's style is very funny - and most of the book is very funny, until the obligatory relapse and ensuing self-destructive behavior. I don't necessarily understand addiction, so I'm probably a little callous towards his challenges.I must admit that I enjoyed Running With Scissors more than Dry, but for my money, Sellevision was the funniest. I'm hoping that Burroughs will return to fiction at some point (I believe his next memoir is due in September)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book this Summer","review":"I took a lot of books with me to Bulgaria for this Summer vacation, I'm still here, and so far the best book I brought was Dry by Augusten Burroughs. After the first chapter I just have to smile because I was hoping this book would be as good as Running With Scissors. It's better. Thank goodness he didn't die in an alcoholic frenzy. I can't wait to read Magical Thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great writer, great laughs, great book!","review":"Alcohol abuse has always seemed to be handled with sadness in literature, film, music, etc, but for Burroughs - everything dark turns into dark humour.It's amazing that he can write about such a terrible time in his life with a smirk on his face. - He doesn't leave anything out, however humiliating (like coming home from rehab and finding hundreds of bottles of booze lying around that he hadn't noticed when he had been drinking!) scary (when he wakes up in an abandoned house in a bad part of town and has no idea where he is) Whilst Running with Scissors seemed to lag a bit in places, this will keep you hooked till the end.If you like reading about true life stories that will make you laugh, cry, laugh some more, feel sick, cringe, and laugh even MORE, then you'll totally dig this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"I started this book yesterday and read about 3/4 of it in one sitting. It's an interesting read - and the subject matter is a little less uncomfortable than \\"Running with Scissors\\".I can't help but compare this to \\"A Million Little Pieces\\", which also deals with someone going to rehab. I feel that James Frey's book was more upsetting but geniune. There were times that I had to put the book down because it was so graphic and heart rending.Anyway, \\"Dry\\" is a good read, and if you liked \\"Running with Scissors\\" or books in the vein a la David Sedaris, read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"more of a soap opera than a memoir about drying out...","review":"I don't understand all the raves for this book. I read and enjoyed \\"Running with Scissors\\" and the 1st half of \\"Dry\\" but let's face it, Augusten Burroughs is no David Sedaris. The descriptions of his adventures in rehab are entertaining but he seems to get back his sobriety a bit too handily. Also once he gets out of rehab, this is where the book totally lost me. If I wanted a romance novel about hooking up in NYC, I would have bought one. I mean come on, when he and Foster are cuddling - blech (and to quote Sienfeld \\"Not that there's anything wrong with that!\\"). One more thing, the guy definitely has a high opinion of himself. OK, Auggie, you make a lot of money, are really cute and have a great body. Now write something interesting for God's sake."},{"rating":"2","title":"I read this book as a child and loved it.","review":"This book was so great that my 4 sisters read it and we talked about it all the time. My nieces heard so much about it they have read it as well. We talked like the Huntoons and picked out their strange names to call ourselves. I've looked for it for years but I was spelling Stuart wrong so I couldn't find it on the library shelves. Now I can sign it out again and read it and relive my childhood. I also want to read more about the Melungeons."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst","review":"I'd rather give it negative 5 stars, but it seems I have to give it at least one. I had read a few reviews elsewhere, and this seemed like it might be an ok movie. Is it possible to get a refund? The acting was poor, as was the direction, the sets (did a child draw that \\"stained glass window\\"?), and especially the script. Pretending to be an indictment of the Christian Right and support for same-sex marriage, the plot was loaded with self-loathing, internalized homophobia, and unintended parody. It doesn't even work as camp, and there is certainly no irony. Must we be recommended these films just because they are gay-themed? How this even got distribution is beyond me. DO NOT BUY OR RENT OR BORROW OR ACCIDENTALLY VIEW THIS FILM. Unless of course, you don't really care how we are portrayed, just as long as we are portrayed."},{"rating":"1","title":"caringman42","review":"This is has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

It wasn't bad enough that the cinematography was not up to par, but the script is horrible. The dialogue between the characters seemed forced, and the situations they go through are more clich�� than real life; it stems around the director's/writer's/producer's/caterer's/whatever else he wanted to be in the movie's stereotypical views of homosexuality. The actors really seemed like they had just been picked up off the street, and given $50.00 to say some lines.

What is he about?!The film (and I use that term loosely) that follows is truly more than an embarrassment; it is an insult to gays, to Christians and to the noble profession of film-making. Shame on you, Mr. Mraovich! I hope to see your digital camera being auctioned off on E-Bay.If you want to stare at Jamie Brett Gabel, then it would be more satisfying to buy the back issue of Playgirl that he's featured in, than to watch him trip through this wretched mess.The only good news is that Sam Mraovich gets shot at the end...it's a shame that it wasn't during the opening credits."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll admit it...

This was a horrendous mistake because not only is he a terrible actor, but he is unattractive and makes it difficult to believe that the attractive Ben would wish to marry him. As for the plot, it starts out OK, but then gets sillier and sillier until the perfectly ridiculous end. Life is too short to waste time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"bend over arthur","review":"This movie is a one star movie, nothing more. And I don't think it pretends to be anything else. It's just a totally amateurish attempt at a gay themed movie. There are so many lapses of logic, so many stupid, unreal events, that it is quickly apparent this movie is made to laugh at. It would be incredulous to me to think the writer, director, producer, lead star (yes, all the same guy!) meant for this to be taken seriously. The distributors misled us, though, with the picture of the hot guy on the cover of the dvd, appealing to our prurient desires. The picture is the best thing about this product, and except for some unintended comedy, it's the only thing of value in this movie! It's all downhill after that.Kudos to all the other reviewers here on Amazon. I laughed my a** off at their many virulent comments, by far more entertaining than anything I saw in the film.

I was particularly interested in his handling of Tarleton...\\"the unrelenting conqueror shut his ears to the voice of supplication, as he had steeled his heart against the claims of mercy.\\" Like elsewhere in the book, you have to read all the lengthy footnotes for explanations of exactly what transpired.

Over the next couple of weeks as I used them portions of the 'lead' of 3 other pencils- after sharpening- fell out as well. In the end only 6 of the pencils last and worked as they should.At the same time I bought a set of their 'Prismacolor Thick Lead' pencils, and had an even worse time with these.

I LOVE this DVD. I tried Yoga to see what all the fuss was about and I found that I really liked the way it made my body feel. Being a Christian, though, I felt conflicted practicing a form of Hinduism. I thought I could just ignore that part of it and do the exercise, but I couldn't. It kept bothering me so I threw the DVD away and started searching for an alternative. I tried another \\"Christian Yoga\\" dvd and hated it... it was really cheesey, but I didn't give up and I next found WholyFit! The cuing and music are great, Laura's voice is soothing, the messages are uplifting and I find myself repeating them throughout the day. I hope they come out with a 2nd WholyFit DVD, however I've by no means mastered the top level of this one and I still love it after all these months. If there is ever a WholyFit workshop in my area, I will definitely go!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I had hoped for","review":"I was hoping to have some step by step instructions, starting out slowly and then gradually moving up to speed. Instead, these instructions moved along rather quickly from one position to the next, and the instructions were given in somewhat of a rapid monotone. It was like they already expected you to know what the positions were called and didn't need time to figure them out. I suppose if I had kept stopping and rewinding every few seconds I would have eventually gotten it, but it was a lot of bother. I eventually got a balance ball with instructions, and am much happier working out with that."},{"rating":"2","title":"No problems here","review":"This is the best looking and best sounding ELP dvd available.

First of all, the songs selection his faboulous, this is really THE best thing, they played things from different era, but focussing on their early materials. They nailed every songs perfectly. Maybe they are getting old, but they still give a fabulous show(i know its 1997, but i consider this today), Keith Emerson still masters his instruments, Greg Lake has a big and deep voice wich i found was different and Carl Palmer is still a machine with is drumm solo too.Only bad thing is the quality...it kinda suck, there is DTS and 5.1, but im having trouble finding a good sound(the drumm is bizarely recorded) and the video quality is rather cheap.But the show is so captivating that you soon forget those bad sides and you enjoy the performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"audio quality of this live recording is very clean, crisp and good low end. and videography is well done too..

These two albums could be sister albums. If you like Depeche Mode's Music for the Masses, then you will defintely love this album. Voices and Images offers the same high quailty gloom and musical enigma that most of Depeche Mode's albums contain. This is a must have by the very best Depeche Mode sound a like group that is around. My favorite track is Winner Takes Nothing. The music is so beautiful!

For example, I know many weather forecasters that I cannot trust their 24-hour forecast, let alone the 10-day ones they project. I highly doubt that they have applied any of these verification techniques to their forecasts.

You may know what Clapton did with Jack and Ginger (and it was brilliant) or what Hendrix did with Noel and Mitch (ditto), but this is something else again. This is a trio with a jazz flavor (Jim Keltner showing that a great drummer is a great drummer anywhere, as Ginger has in his later work) but plugged in and occasionally as intense and edgy as any rock work. If you don't know Frisell you're in for a treat.But be sure to listen to how the pieces are composed if you're at all interested in musical structure. There is a lot of fascinating harmonic and rhythmic experimentation going on here. But even as he pushes the envelope, Frisell stays grounded in song forms that are not too hard for the less adventurous listener. If you find avant-garde jazz too \\"out there\\" and you've heard Bill is \\"one of those\\", don't let it stop you. You will be pleasantly surprised. (Oh, and check out John Mclaughlin too, but more of that elsewhere.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily Accessible---but by no means is that a condemnation","review":"Having heard the post modernistic swirls of sound on Frisell's Before we were Born, and his more traditional accompanyment with Joe Lovano and Ginger Baker (Going back Home), I was sure what to expect when I picked up this CD. What makes Frisell one of the more interesting musicians of the modern era, is that like Miles, he is not afraid of taking stylistics chances.This is probably his most accessible recording to date. In a small setting like this, and striped of the pretension that occasionally marks his work, Frisell's ability to swing between, blues and jazz is astounding. This music is similar in tone to the best of Metheny's \\"highway\\" scope of feeling. If Coltrane, described by poet LeRoi Jones epitomized \\"the soul in turmoil\\", what does Frisell accomplish?

Never have been able to get into it really. Sometimes he just seems too vacant.Along comes this album, I buy it, and the opening bars are pretty ordinary Frisell. Then, as though he recognizes that the plodding beat ain't happneing, he rips into a bluesy solo. And I mean RIPS.After that - well - you'd have to say that the album is all over the place. But that's a good thing. No traps here. Just great music. Finally, a Frisell album that sits and waits to be played. To this point his music has been a curiosity that I kept giving a second chance too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical Portrayal of Images Unseen","review":"Gone, Just Like a Train, is an amazing display of Frisell's subtlety and imaginative composition/improvisation. These songs will seep into your mind and echo for a long time to come. Whether it be the colorful melodies of \\"Girl Asks Boy,\\" \\"The Wife and Kid,\\" or the sonic explosion of \\"Lookout for Hope,\\" this album reach you in ways you've yet to be reached. Frisell's playing, as always, is very subtle and takes several listenings to get a really good grasp of. Victor Kraus's playing is very modest and true to the music, thus making great melodic counterpoint with Frisell's playing. Jim Keltner really moves in this album. The snare delay and occasional reverse delay of the cymbals are tastefully placed throughout this album. I recommend this album for anyone who cares about music or life in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sarah's Choice","review":"The content of \\"Sarah's Choice\\" was very touching and made one think about right to life very hard.

Great movie for teenagers to watch, great lesson and I consider this an awesome choice they made and they could not have done anything else and they truly loved their child. Adoption is a great choice if you cannot take care of a child. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"All smiles for Sarah's choice","review":"This was a wonderful film with tremendous values. I appreciated the fact that it was family friendly and not corny. I did have a difficult time understanding what the actors were saying, as many of them had accents, so I put on the subtitles, which didn't bother my daughter or me, and that helped. If we had been watching this with a crowd, that might not have been an option, as some people find subtitles too distracting.All in all, Rebecca St. James did a fine job in this film. I did expect the visions or dreams to be a tad longer and more detailed, but once I accepted that, it was fine.I am thankful that this film was made. It conveys a wonderful, hopeful message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daisy's Life","review":"The best thing about this movie is a sled-ride through the snow with a child that may never be. The heart soars; the heart breaks.The worst thing about this movie is actually the title! You see, it's really less about Sarah's Choice, and more about Daisy's Life.This is a great movie, because it's more than a movie. It's a thought-piece, it's engaging, and it's entertaining; no mean feat! Those who have the eyes to see it, see it.You should see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding movie","review":"When I bought this product, I honestly didn't know what to expect. Being a big Rebecca St. James fan (for almost a decade now) helped me decide to purchase it, but I still wasn't sure how good it would be. I was pleasantly surprised...this movie blew me away.The biggest highlight of this film is the acting. There are amazing performances in this movie. From Brad Stine, to Andrea Logan White, to Stacy Keanan - to everyone else in between - the supporting cast does a great job. Yet the person who deserves the most accolades in this work is the leading lady Rebecca St. James. It is Rebecca that makes the movie excel. She delivers an onscreen presence, an emotional depth, and an acting ability that quite frankly I didn't know that she possessed!Get this movie, it is worth the money, and it is worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Made and Good Message","review":"I just watched Sarah's Choice on 1/11/10. It is well made and has quality actors. The storyline is based on a single career woman named Sarah who becomes pregnant unexpectant. She faces a decision of what to do with the child and the direction of her life. I have TV Guardian and it even did not have anything to cut out. This would be a good family film and is pro-life. God reveals Himself to her in a series of three dreams before she makes her decision about the child and her future. Great story on God's forgiveness and human forgiveness!"},{"rating":"1","title":"In a nutshell:","review":"RSJ is a pretty decent actress!The writing sucks.Let's demand excellence in our movies, guys!

The sound track is terrible, the characters aren't developed well, and the plot is unrealistic. I guess it's a must-see for the protesters outside of your city's abortion clinic. If you are one of those people, you will love it. Otherwise, you probably should not waste your time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple Joys of Pop Rock","review":"I stumbled across Acetone's self-titled album in a stack of promos a friend had from her days in college radio. I immediately fell in love with the album's dreamy, languid melodies, set to simple and wistful guitar (remiscent of Pink Floyd's less epic moments), overlaid with gentle, blue and sometimes quite lonely lyrics. The lead singer's voice (and his harmonic backups) remind me of Chet Baker's for its soft, untrained, elegant sweetness. Acetone brought me back to an appreciation of pop rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This is a great book for meditating on the mysteries of the Rosary.

The Rosary is one of the best ways to offer honor and glory to Jesus. This book makes clear that Catholics do NOT pray to Mary. She, being the first Christian, is a great model and intercessor. The author presents thorough responses to some of the compaints about the Rosary. This author quotes John Paul II the Great. The Rosary is not a rote response but one of prayerful meditation upon the life of our Lord.

When I started my diploma work doing molecular simulations of polymers, Gelins book was the first i had to read. and indeed it gives a good overview with very many references to standard literature. The book is diveded into twelve chapters starting with how polymer chains are built, how to consider the detailed interaction mechanisms and then going on to how specific polymeric properties, e.g. mechanical behaviour, scattering, conductivity ... can be and are simulated. The book suits best for people who want to get an introduction to the subject. For those already familiar with the principles of molecular modeling i'd suggest the book of Allen and Tildesley on \\"Computer Simulation of Liquids\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay's vital role in modern times","review":"The effect of clay on civilization goes far beyond pottery efforts: it's fostered the rise of world trace, the invention of writing, and the construction of cities.

CLAY: THE HISTORY AND EVOLUTION OF HUMANKIND'S RELATIONSHIP WITH EARTH'S MOST PRIMAL ELEMENT will appeal primarily to any involved in the arts but is also a highly recommended pick for social science and history classes: it provides a lively look on all the elements clay has been essential to fostering, from semiconductors to surgical equipment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied","review":"Book arrived promptly and in good condition.

I like it but not nearly as much as past albums such as tonight the stars revolt. This cd is just another transform except for one difference, worse songs, and worse music. Theyve turned into some type of petty punk band. What happened to the hardcore rocking that used to go on on their albums? Yes the cd is pretty good, but its not worth buying, and its definitely their worst. It makes me not want to go to their concert in detroit in sept. because im in fear that all they will play are these new songs. So, a word of advice, just download the album, I'm glad I did. If you want a real good new album that just came out, try Stone Sour: Come What(ever) May. They are still as good as ever if not 10x better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good change of pace for PM5K","review":"A tremendous follow up to 2003's somewhat bland Transform, PM5K really lets \`er rip on Destroy. Featuring many fast-paced, hard-edged songs full of intense guitars and savvy lyrics while steering clear of their funk-rap-rock roots, Destroy is PM5K's best album yet.What makes this album unique from its predecessors are not only the sound, which is more mature and energetic than before, but also the lyrical quality. No longer does Spider (Powerman 5000's lead singer ([and only original member]) sing about the woes of space travel; instead, he draws inspiration from politics, friendship, and even music itself.If you never liked PM5K, give \`em another try. This album is much different than you might expect. If you like Rancid, Velvet Revolver, The Misfits, Alice Cooper, The Clash, or other hard rock/punk bands, you're bound to like Destroy What You Enjoy.And the tambourine makes a few guest appearances - how can you say \\"no\\" to that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"They already did this without anyones help","review":"poor, poor pm5k.........their never gonna get it right.........with each new release, they seem to knock off another better band..........with this release, they try to be the misfits, and it doesnt work.........the only good osngs on this entire album are \\"wild world\\", and \\"murder\\" save your cash...download these two tracks and forget the rest"},{"rating":"1","title":"I saw it at the c.d. store and laughed at it...","review":"Boy this is the all time worst Powerman 5000 c.d. ever. period. I dealt with Transform when it came out as it was a lot different then tonight the stars revolt. Transform did have some heavier songs on it but was a bit more toward the punk rock side of things, nevertheless it wasn't an all out bad c.d. it was just a bit different. So unless you've gone soft like PM5K have and are not into the heavy music anymore you won't mind this c.d. at all. I don't know why they're even putting the name Powerman 5000 to disgrace when it's only one remaining member left. I hope Spider decides to call it quits when he sees how few copies of the c.d. move off the shelves. That's it I'm done with this review and Powerman 5000, although Tonight the stars revolt! will remain high up in my personal favorites collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"Wow, it's rare I actually toss an album in the garbage. It's that bad. I'll be the first to admit that Powerman 5K was never the best out there but I still love their 'Stars Revolt' album, it had character, it had inspiration, it wass enjoyable to listen to.

It contains too much useless information, while the important material is not particularly well written, presented, or organized; for example, the first 300 pages of physics is too often impenetrable and consistently overly theoretical, esp. the parts written by PhD's as opposed to MD's. The chapters are inconsistent in quality, varying from poor to very good. Although the book was supposedly printed in 1999, most of the references are 7-8 years old, the most recent being around 1995; this book is hardly state-of-the-art in its field. It is hard to believe that a book this expensive and in its 3rd edition could have so many typographical errors; did anyone proofread this book? The print is very small, the smallest I've ever seen in a top-of-the-line radiology reference work.

It is truly terrible to have a band of such talent fall through the cracks of success. In a style very much all their own, Neverland gives songs ranging from rocking and catchy to soulful and melodic. Every song on this gem of a CD is a great tune.Since I got mine new in '91, I have listened to the entire CD at least a few times each year, every year. If you are a fan of rock/glam/AOR music from the late '80s to early '90s, get yourself ahold of a copy of this ASAP.

Borders, spirals, celtic crosses and decorative initials are all presented, along with a number of Davis' full-page illustrations which illustrate nicely how to work celtic patterns into your own artistic designs.

They looked light weight (like the rest of the book) and nothing caught my eye.What's not in this book? Any useful information on making or cooking sausages. \\"Spice to taste\\". Never a useful hint on the typical ratio of spices for various sausages. What good is a sausage recipe without at least guidance on spicing?This book is only useful for answering questions like \\"What's in blood sausage?\\" and nothing in the way of \\"how do you ....\\".Basically it's not a cookbook - it's a coffee table book without pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"The not-so-great sausage book","review":"It's presumptuous for this book to call itself the \\"only complete guide\\" to sausage.

The second time I watched it, I knew what they were saying and it helped understand what was going on. I really love some of the characters. Ones that I thought were self-serving turned out to be very dear and warm-hearted. I feel that I have become accustomed to these movies being 600 plus minutes long. Any shorter is a disappointment.

I agree with some of the reviews that say that this story is a little too long. I haven't read the book but I did have to look up a synopsis of the book just to figure out what was going on halfway through it! If the book was just about Arthur & Little Dorritt and not so in-depth about the other characters, I would consider reading it but I really don't need anymore information on her father, sister, etc.I would definitely buy it again just because of my love for Matthew Macfayden but I don't think I will watch the entire thing again.

I finished watching it a night ago but am still in its thralls.The production has everything: great story, scriptwriting, acting, directing, scenery, costumes and relevance.So many things that Dickens protests against are still with us. The economic collapse that highlights the last part of the book brought about by a Bernie Madoff-like character is incredible, and, of course, the bureaucracy featured in the Department of Circumlocution has not changed.I feel that if Charles Dickens were alive today, he would be thrilled by this BBC program."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confused at the end","review":"We really enjoyed the production, until the end of the story. The attempt to pull the plot together, to explain all the secrets and relationships, failed. As Mrs. Clennam and the Frenchman went back and forth with revelations of the past, the whole thing got confused. We watched and rewatched it and still couldn't figure out why Little Dorrit and Arthur were connected.

Good job, BBC!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing beauty","review":"The first time I heard Djam Leelii, I was just mesmerized. I couldn't believe the beauty I was hearing. I quickly bought a copy and listened to it constantly for years. About half the songs are more upbeat and 'traditional,' then half - those mostly with acoustic guitars and occasional (and mellow) electrics - are darker with an understated drive that's quite compelling. And all get into a marvelous easy groove, some with percussion and some without. Baaba Maal's singing is powerful, gorgeous and heartfelt. The title track is just sublime. The three additional songs on this reissue are also excellent; their recording is a bit more direct, not quite as warm, but not far from the originally released tracks. If you love acoustic guitar music of any kind, or West African music, do yourself a wonderful favor by listening to this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CHUMS EYE GLASSES RETAINERS","review":"VERY GOOD PRODUCT.

Except that it died after only a couple of years of using it exclusively for travel. The new one is larger, taking up more space in my carry on, for no good reason. The lever for opening it up curves upward and is very stiff so it takes a great deal more effort to work the wand. I will use it for traveling to spots outside the US because I don't need a transformer, etc BUT I would never use it at home. Too much trouble. The wand, I think, is also larger around so the curls are not as tight as I would like. I would give it one star but Conair's looks worse with a very short handle. Not a lot of choices in the market. And I am waaay over the age of 13!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Braun Independent Cordless Curling Iron","review":"I just replaced my old model Braun Cordless, which I used regularly for yrs,with this new model and I LOVE IT! First of all it is a 7/8\\" diameter and the old one was 3/4\\" and this works better for my short to med length hair that I do not want curled too tightly. The wand is much tighter and I like that because my hair doesn't slip out. Overall, for a cordless I have to give a 5 rating as I have tried both the Conair (which doesn't get hot enough for me) and the Revlon Recgargeable which is purely a useless waste of money and doesn't work well at all! The only negative, if you want to call it that; is that the cartridges are a bit expensive but can be purchased online at a better price than I can find them locally. Price is a trade off for convenience in my opinion and I hope Braun will continue to bless us with these for a long time to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"curls great!","review":"I recently took this curling iron camping and love it! I would definitely buy it again. I'm not sure if the butane cartridges are going to last as long as they say. I used it for 8 days and it seems to be down by half???

Recognizing most of the names; Vanilla Ice, R.E.M., Wilson Phillips etc. I then came across \\"Natural Selection.\\" \\"What's this? I don't remember them.\\" So I plug in an old RCA dual tape player to start playing side A. Not bad, so I continue to clean.Now in the 90's I was more into birth of alternative music but perhaps for the sake of nostalgia, and an appreciation for the music over played on the radio I kept listening. At the end of the day the garage was almost clean and the tapes were quickly placed on eBay, but the songs remain stuck in my head."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for cataloguers","review":"I found this book to be an extremely useful text. The coverage is comprehensive, dealing with the principles of cataloguing, development of cataloguing codes, description and access, subject analysis and organization. It explains and simplifies the AACR2 rules. A very useful feature is the linking of the ISBD elements to the related MARC fields/subfields. In addition, I appreciate the visual clarification of the content and formatting rules that is provided by the abundant examples and figures depicting bibliographic records in card and MARC format. As a cataloguer and trainer, I keep a copy of this text along with the other tools which I consult regularly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Among Jonathan's best stuff","review":"I would put this up with The Modern Lovers self-titled debut, Rockin' and Romance, Jonathan Sings and I, Jonathan as some of Richman's finest and most memorable recordings. \\"Not Just A Plus One On The Guest List Anymore\\", \\"That Little Sleeper Car\\", and especially \\"Rock 'N' Roll Drummer Straight From The Hospy-Tel\\" are incredibly catchy fun. \\"French Style\\" is a terrific companion piece to the earlier \\"Give Paris One More Chance\\" (which he still performs live). This disc also includes more famous songs like \\"Lesbian Bar\\" and \\"Egyptian Reggae\\". Highly recommended! Two advices: see JR live as soon and as often as possible, and look for the Jonathan Sings! CD on eBay.

I am a cabinet maker , so I am not using it for repetative cutting, so I can't vouch for it along those lines, but it is light and handy. Of course the impact driver is top notch. Once you use an impact driver, you will never go back to a plain drill driver. The quick blade change on the sawzall is impressive. 1/2 inch drill works well. flashlite is good. Overall the quality is great.

The batteries charge fast and last a long time for most uses. Used the angle grinder with a diamond cup to take down some high spots on a concrete floor, and that used up batteries relatively quickly, but I probably should've been using a corded grinder, so I can't complain about that. This was my first impact screwgun, and it's a joy to use. Light and short and able to sink big screws with minimal torque on me. Noisy though, so ear protection is recommended when screwing with it. Drill-driver has so much torque you have to really watch out when using a holesaw so you don't end up looking like a pretzel. Either use low speed (of the 3 speeds) or switch over to screw mode and let the clutch slip when the bit bites too hard.

I've been a Makita fan for years when I was a contractor, bought this set for personal use. The tools are nice, solid, do what they're supposed to, but, I haven't been real impressed with how long the batteries last. 3 year warranty on tools, but 1 year on batteries and CHARGER. Well, the charger just went TU and Makita won't cover it. Great.My advice for what it's worth. Go to Home Depot and buy a set of Ridgid cordless tools....they're way less expensive and come with a LIFETIME WARRANTY including batteries and charger.

First of all, there is no sure bet on Wall Street. If this book claims you can make returns of 30% or more, why isn't everyone doing this? Why are there Billions and Billions in plain old CD and Money Market Accounts that are paying a maximum of 5-6%? The author is a psychologist and holds no degree in business, economics, or finance. She reminds me of Wade Cook who was a taxi driver who pushed his \\"rolling stock\\" trading in his books and seminars. At least this author has not shown up in late night infomercials (so far).Save your money and read it from the library. If you really want a good laugh buy it and read it as humor material. I enjoyed it as a fictional humor reading.Every \\"5 Star\\" rating left on this book are fake reviews. Check on the names of these fake reviewers and see how many other reviews they made on Amazon.

It is based on balance. As the author says, on some trades you will make money, and on some trades you will lose money. But all the while the dividends just keep rolling in. All you have to do is identify buying chances which the author tells you how to do. The rest is a matter of following the system. I have captured several dividends so far, and I also made some capital gains. The book provides benchmarks for valuing dividend paying stocks and overall market strategies which are also interesting. Some of the other stock books I have read were about how the author made money. This one is about how I can make money.

But the second book was *beyond* a disappointment for me. Almost every chapter starts with her discussing the first book - making it quite repetitive, and tiresome. The stories were not very funny and she really rambled on in this book. I nearly gave up on the book part way through (reason I'm giving it one star) but I have a policy about finishing something I've started.

The website is somewhat humorous as well, but if you are a SPQ fan, stop after reading the first book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par...","review":"Of course the only reason I read this book was because I enjoyed The Sweet Potato Queen's Book of Love. I was looking for more of the same light hearted humor. Unfortunately, this edition was a HUGE dissapointment. It felt like it was just a novel sized advertisemt for the first book. The passages were very hard to follow as they jumped from one topic to the next and then back again faster than you can blink an eye. This would not have been too hard to handle if the topics were in any way related, but they weren't. I will say that the chapter titles were entertaining and I did actually laugh out loud twice near the very end of the book, but what it took to get to those two laughs was a waste of my time.-One more thing, do no read this if you have not read the original book as there are so many references to SPQBOL that someone not familiar with it will be even more lost than I was, and I had actually read it less than a year ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Particular!","review":"Before I explain why I only gave the book 2 stars - let me say that I am a Wannabe Wannabe having marched in the 1st Million Queen March - and I enthusiastically anticipated the follow-up book. What a disappointment!I felt the book was only an enticement for those that have not read the first book to go and read it. There were far too many references to the first book - too many for someone that has read the first - but not enough for someone who has not. The first book was sassy and cute with just a little bit of crude thrown in - this one just a little too crude for this Wannabe.Advice from Jill Conner Browne herself - \\"Be particular\\" Read the first one over again instead of buying this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"As one who has experienced the SPQ's and their 'followers' in life and in person in Jackson, all I can say is that it is the home for the High School bullies who now drink to solve their problems.

It has priceless moments and for even greater enjoyment, listen to the audiobook read by the author. If you are offended by language or sexual comments, then steer clear.

The end is bittersweet, but life's laughter often comes from our experiences, both good and bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Self-empowering!","review":"This rating should be 4.5 stars - only .5 star lower than the first book. Reason being the many references to and clarifications of Browne's first book, \\"The Sweet Potato Queens' Book of Love.\\" This second book, however, is a wonderful continuation of the SPQs' epics and antics.Given the handbook-like advice of Jill Connor Browne and her cohorts the \\"Tammys\\", any red-blooded American woman will feel self-empowered and independent. Browne's writing style is comedic and highly entertaining, and causes the reader to laugh out loud... often. Beware, husbands watching sports nearby may feel threatened by her truths! I should mention that this is humor only a woman will understand and appreciate.Now I am anxiously awaiting book #3!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EL QUELITE","review":"I did not enjoy the movie as much as I thought I would.

Having penned the classic \\"Forever Young,(a mainstay at 80's highschool reunions) this album is for the classically inclined. One not need to listen for more than a few minutes through this CD to find Beethoven all over it. Marion Gold calls it a \\"space opera\\", so opera is how it should be heard. Each song bleeds into the next with wonderful relation to the following track. This is an album for those who enjoy studying music; the top 40 conoseur will find it boring and drab. If you want a musical challenge, give this album a chance. It certainly goes down as one of my favorite \\"desert island discs\\".By far the greatest recording Alphaville ever recorded!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It doesn't get better than this....","review":"However, I do have a hard time deciding which is better, Prostitute (1994) or AIU (1986). AIU brings back so many great memories and this album has one of their best songs with Dance With Me. This is kind of a \\"concept\\", rock opera album. I do like how lyrics from one song refer to lyrics in another song. This is an incredible album and if anyone is looking into Alphaville to see what they sound like, you will not be disappointed with AIU."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alphaville's Best","review":"While I enjoy all of Alphaville's cd's, this is definitely my favorite. The beautiful melodies and mysterious lyrics of songs like \\"Lassie Come Home\\" and \\"Carol Masters\\" are simultaneoulsy intriguing and satisfying. And there are plenty of up-tempo songs like \\"Jerusalem\\", \\"Dance with Me\\", and \\"Red Rose\\" that are plain synth-pop fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe the best album ever","review":"I bought this album many years ago and I still listen to it often.

Marian's voice is as good as ever.Don't dither - just buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Afternoons in Utopia ~ Alphaville","review":"Afternoons in Utopia being their second album is a very good album. However, Forever Young was such an amazing debute album that they were bound to create something less then and this exactly what happened. Songs like Afternoons in Utopia, and Dance With Me are very nice tracks. However, their first album spawned so many more hits. Yet this is a very good album filled with 80's music and the cover is so much better then the first album. I would rather have a photo of the band then some strange art that you can not make heads or tails our of. 4 Stars is not a slight and this is a well produced album with great lyrics, vocals, and beats that just does not meet the high standards of their debute album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it looks like","review":"I bought this thinking that it was as large as a bed, since it is pictured covering an entire bed.

Why??? She could have gone in so many excellent directions but she chose not to do that and she lost me before I got to the end. I kept pushing on, hoping for something better, but I stopped reading not long after the devil started visiting. A friend gave it to me \\"for keeps\\" but I definitely didn't keep it!

After reading the synopsis on the back cover, I was immediately intrigued and couldn't wait to read \\"Wild Orchids\\", which, turned out to be a tremendous disappointment. The beginning of the book was somewhat fascinating. The first person method of telling the story from both main characters' points of view was definitely interesting. Somewhere around the middle of the book, however, things just sort of fell apart - the plot dragged on and on, and the promise of a wonderful story that was evident in the early chapters, faded away to nothing.

For much of it I felt that Deveraux was struggling to fill the number of pages required by her editor or publisher, taking numerous paragraphs to define a character's state of mind and body in three or four slightly different ways when the fact is it had been quite clear in a couple of short sentences how the character was feeling at that time. The story never gripped me and if I hadn't been confined while nursing a loved one I probably would have skimmed the end and then put it in the pile to be donated to my local library. I found the ending to be unsatisfying not to mention bizarre and unbelievable. This book was a waste of my time and money and reaffirms my belief that some books make (and linger on) the list of best sellers for reasons other than their content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great character build up and not enough substance","review":"What a disappointment and cop out, you get these great characters of Ford, Jackie, Noble, Toodles, and Tessa and they all get thrown away for some lame story about the devil and the town of Cole Creek. The whole story felt rushed and for everything to be summed up in 20 pages at the end just does not cut it. We're left with a open ending I would have like a epilogue for closure. Normally I do enjoy Ms. Deveraux's books but the last few just seem like someone else is writing them. If you must read this take it out of the library or wait for it to come in paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this book get published?","review":"Probably one of the worst books I ever read. Actually, I couldn't even finish it-it was so bad. The story is written from the point of view of the two main characters, a man and a women.

I didnt think it was possible for her to write to me anyway a boring book. Sadly thats just what I found in Wild Orchid characters that left me indifferent, and bored. A story that left me indifferent, and bored. I dislike personally first person perspectives and tend to avoid them like a plague. But even for Ms Deveraux, I was willing to endure because I just knew she wouldnt let me down on the story, and being such a huge fan I kept psyching myself into believing it would get better.It didnt, not for me. Sadly like a victim of a car wreck I couldnt quite give up all hope either. I wish I had though. Lackluster story, coupled with characters one couldnt get interested in much less care about with an endng that sputtered and died add up to a book I cant say was one of Ms Deveraux's best and truthfully was quite disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have thoroughly enjoyed other books written by Jude Deveraux, but Wild Orchids was truly a disappointment. The attempted use of separate chapters written from each of the main characters point of view was boring and badly done. Each chapter reiterated the other for at least a page. I did think that the novel had an interesting & unique plot, but would suggest reading another Deveraux work before this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible end","review":"First I thought, I might give this book a try since it was half the price and although I quite liked the b��ginning and the author shows that she can touch your heart, the end was so very disappointing I still feel quite annoyed about how you could possibly find such a far-fetched outcome to the otherwise o.k. plot.

As others have pointed out, this is not a romance. This is more in the Stephen King genre than romance. Yeh, there is someone falling in love, but it is secondary to the character change and the character insights. I did not like it-I also don't like horror genre or vampire novels. If you like that sort, it is a well written story. But if you are looking for a romance, stick to her old stuff or another author."},{"rating":"1","title":"It wasn't even a good thriller.","review":"I started this book with the high hopes of reading another good Jude Deveraux book. I didn't like the main characters and felt that there was no chemistry between the two of them. I forced myself to finish the book. Prose was nonexistant, writing was sloppy and character development was poor. This was not Jude's best writing. I do not believe it would have been published if it weren't for her already successful writing career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story with lots of suspense","review":"This was the first Jude Deveraux book I have read. First, since reading this story, I've ordered 4 more of her books and can't wait to read even more!!!I definitely couldn't put this book down. I love a good mystery and every time I thought I had this one figured out, I was way off!! I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a good romance/suspense book!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Waste","review":"I have read (and liked) many of Ms. Devereaux's novels, but this one was a BIG disappointment.

I was very sorry I wasted my money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deveraux is no longer a Romance Author","review":"This newest offering from Deveraux has left me with no hope for another good classic Deveraux romance. While Ms. Deveraux seems to be toying with the dark side in her most recent novels, I have been seeking out other authors who can still supply me with what a good historical romance. (Kathleen Givens, anyone?) When I pick up a book in the romance section, I expect just that, romance.While I understand that Ms. Deveraux is branching out in her writing, I would ask that she please target these offerings to a new audience. I have every single Deveraux book. Wild Orchids will be my last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Story 4 Stars Romance 1 Star","review":"I have mixed feelings about this book.

When I put the book down, I found I was stunned instead. As others have said, this is not about romance; but, it is about love. Told in the first person, the story is NOT a formulaic story. No typical heroes or heroines here. The book is a journey into the heart and mind...it's like one of the Pulitzer novels that were spoofed by Jackie in the early dinner party setting. The book tugs at you....you'll find yourself fascinated, teary, happy, and thoughtful. A great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's happened to Miss Jude???","review":"I am an avid romance reader and split my time between Ms. Devereaux and Nora Roberts.

I have always looked forward to reading her books in the past and honestly, with the exception of \\"The Summerhouse\\", from \\"An Angel For Emily\\" on down have been quite disappointing.

The first half of the book was amazingly well written. The book alternates view points by chapter of the two characters points-of-view which is really interesting and makes the book even more fun to read. The first chapter will tug at your heart if you've ever lost someone dear to you. Ford is the most real character Deveraux's done. The relationship between Ford and Pat's dad is precious. If you are having trouble getting past the whole devil part of the story line, just jump in - you won't regret it. There is so much more to the story - I was a little dissapointed about this element too, when the rest of the story was so rich and real."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just kept saying oh my goodness!","review":"Ford, what a great name for a man, but Jake is the best.

Worse than that, the map now uses one symbol - a small square - for trailheads as well as any campground smaller than an RV park. You can no longer skim the map looking for triangles - they aren't there.

And, more galling, the package doesn't reflect this limitation.

The spanking, slapping, and pinching didn't make sense to me, and I didn't feel right doing it, but I didn't know how else to discipline. This book shows you how to discipline positively without all the hitting and yelling and bad feelings and attitudes. It is already working with my two year old son, and i feel so much better as a mom. I'm able to relax and enjoy my son instead of feeling constantly on edge thinking I have to scold him for every little thing he does.

I was disappointed to find myself reading the familiar blather about how babies should cry it out to learn \\"independence\\" and weaned at 12 months - This book mentions Erikson's theory of a baby learning trust vs. distrust, but then goes on to advocate cry it out - confused, to say the least. As far as the practical advice on toddlers goes, there was some but a lot of it was too general to be much help. This book's condescending tone toward the family bed and extended breastfeeding really annoyed me. Anyone who thinks these make a baby dependant and demanding ought to meet my daughter!

The discipline methods this book teaches work great, I get a much better response with positive discipline than with any negative or passive methods (yelling, demanding, time-outs, etc).

Although this book does give some helpful information that I feel you can use with older children, when it comes to the \\"target\\" age (up to age 3), it fails to meet up to my expectations. This book assumes that you can \\"reason\\" with your child by explaining things to him/her. I've never seen an eleven-month-old yet who could be dealt with in this way. If you're looking for suggestions for discipling the much younger child, you should probably try another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are true to Attachment Parenting ideals, this might not be for you","review":"I read (and unfortunately bought) this book ... and it does say you should not let your child sleep in your bed. It may not say you have to wean by 12 months, but it does suggest you look for weaning signs at that time ... AND THEN a paragraph or two later mentions that if you decide to breastfeed beyond this point you will have critics ... AND that some people breastfeed up to 6 or 8 years old.

Author if can't encourage extended nursing, shouldn't discourage it by giving ridiculous explanation like it can disrupt your babies sense of autonomy and misguide new mothers. Tons of research has been done on millions of benefits of nursing beyond one year, which were not even mentioned in the book. I don't recommend this book to anyone!

S. It confirms what so many of us who spent time there have come to understand. That the war - for all of us who participated - was totally beyond our control and comprehension. Young Kein's entire life changes from optimism and promise to hopelessness and futility. His relationship with his childhood sweetheart crumbles as the war progresses. She too is forever changed by the events portrayed in this period of over 10 years. This would not have been a readable, understandable story for me in the '70s but after close to 30 years since I was involved, it was very worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Writing but Deeply Depressing","review":"This book draws you into the horrors of the Vietnam War. All the characters come to life, but especially Kien, as you walk through his turbulent mind. The whole book was extremely well-written and descriptive.

This is not light reading, and should only be attempted by extremely mature readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Written","review":"I read this book while traveling in Vietnam, among many books about Vietnam and the war, and I must say it was my favorite.

A well reviewed biographical novel from the NVA side of the war seemed like a must read.Twice I have read good reviews for this book and twice I have tried to read it and twice I have found it unreadable.Maybe its just the translation, but I just could not get into this book. I found it almost a ramble and just too much of a stream of conciousness.I see here there are many positive reviews for the book. But I must say again two times I have tried to read it and two times I found it unreadable.Maybe the third times the charm?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-Rated","review":"Having read the rave reviews of this book I felt that I was doing myself an injustice by not picking up a copy. I particularly liked \\"The Quiet Amerian\\" (TQA) which has been similarly reviewed.My disappointment was palpable. Instead of being presented with a strong story that unfolds throughout the pages like in TQA, you get an incoherant rabble. I would press on with all the other faults of the book but I really don't think it warrants that much of my time.Be warned, if you don't like books that have no continuous storyline, then don't get this. The reviewers who think this book is a master-piece are just so full of their own self-importance that they cannot see child like writing when it sits in front of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book transcends culture","review":"This was a great novel. I read it in a unit that included Tim O'Brien's _Going Ater Cacciato_, and that combination was fantastic. I think of the title of this book as kind of a question, and the entire novel defines exactly what the sorrow of war is. Loss, of friendship, of love, of virginity, of innocence, of years of one's life. Although written from a foreign perspective, this can be understood no matter what the culture. War has a terrible effect on everyone, not only the men and women who fight, but also those who are left behind at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fundamental","review":"One of the major important film books of all times by a great writer.L��zaro SilvaTerceira, AzoresPortugal"},{"rating":"1","title":"PRINT TOO SMALL","review":"THE KINDLE BOOK FOR FOUNDATIONS OF GEOMETRY BY DAVID HILBERT HAS PRINT THAT IS VERY SMALL AND CAN NOTBE CHANGED USING THE Aa KEY.

There are some solid Junior Brown songs here, but there are also a few that are not what we're used to hearing from the master of the guit-steel. The effort is there but the target is not hit. Of Junior's four full-length CDs, this one ranks last. Here's hoping for a strong comeback next time in which Junior gets back to playing straight honky-tonk country is his own unique way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-Indulgent Garbage","review":"Having been a Junior Brown fan since 1991, I looked forward to his new release. Junior is a national treasure, and is arguably the greatest country musician alive today, maybe the best ever. However, I can promise you that this album will never be put in my CD player again. It is an insult to country music fans, and a waste of his talent. I don't object to Junior testing the limits with rock, rock and roll, and rockabilly, it's one of the things he does best. However, this effort belongs in the trash can. This album should have been titled \\"We Got Really Drunk One Night, Played Some Stupid Songs, And Somebody Left The Tape Recorder On\\". Don't waste your money on this one. Ernest Tubb wouldn't have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Junior Gets Just As Wild As He Wants To Be...","review":"I must take exception to the reviews complaining about Junior breaking away from \\"what he does best\\". What he does best is combine a fistful of traditional guitar/music styles in a most non-traditional way. His originality is such that he even had to invent the Guit-Steel to perform this soaring, poignant, blistering brew of licks in real time. It is an amazing thing to behold in a live performance.Although Junior has a fine sense of humor in his songs, his \\"short, concise & humorous\\" tunes are my least favorite. In fact, I would venture to say that he uses these vehicles to get himself in the door of recording companies & into the tighter-than-Dwight's-jeans confines of modern country radio.I say let the man do his thing & let us sit back & enjoy his genius. By the way, I would have paid $15.00 for \\"Stupid Blues\\" alone. Ever since I saw him perform it live, I knew I had to have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Junior did a fine job!","review":"I understand that this CD encompasses more musical styles than previous Junior Brown CDs, but that's the joy of listening to Junior. He is musically diverse, inventive, original, and hugely talented. Nobody does Texas honky-tonk music this well these days. And as for the rest of the songs, nobody even comes close. This is actually my favorite Junior Brown CD, and yes, I have seen him live as well.

Junior's love for the same is apparent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant music, born in the very depths of the ocean...","review":"One of the greatest albums to come out in the 20th century..and I've looked long and hard.

So I bought her one of these, (and now I have one too) and she loves it! You can also invert this one and use it like a regular desk dispenser. I'm aware that commercial places like UPS would use the other because they have the space and it probably puts tape on quicker than this one. But who needs fast at home when there's no hurry?

The detail of the photos is amazing and makes learning about this planet come alive.I am thrilled to see that Seymour Simon has written other books on our solar system, including a book for each planet.This book is the perfect combination of just the right amount of information, written well, and complimented by wonderful illustrations. A book of this caliber outshines all the other books I've seen, including those written for older age ranges, including the large volumes that attempt to cover all aspects of space.

The trouble started the year before when Lovejoy, in his usual financial troubles, lost his home.Now this year Lady Jane Feldsham is bankrupt & selling her mansion. She had always been untouchably rich and stable, a rudder to keep the gang steering on course. Now she is adrift & leaving the series.Add to that Eric's desire to leave and take over his uncle's pub, now some of the ingredients of a good stew have been left out.Beth was a nice addition, but not enough to fill in all of the gaps.I still liked the series, and this year has grown on me with repeat viewings, but the gang is not all here (and will not return)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Season five is a waste of money","review":"This is the destruction of a great series, they changed characters and have very poor scripts compared to the first four seasons. I did not like any of the episodes in this season, and I loved some of the episodes from previous seasons. The worst is they lost Lady Jane and tried to replaced her with several mediocre characters none of the actresses as good as Phyllis Logan. Her interaction and the sexual tension with Lovejoy were one of the central themes of the series. It looks like they thought Charlotte Cavendish could replace her, but none of the scripts really did anything with this character or developed more than an antagonistic relationship with Lovejoy.

A must see family movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful film, but somewhat lacking for me","review":"In the end, i enjoyed this film. However, i didn't enjoy it at all until the last ten minutes or so when the story finally came together. The child who is really the main character of the piece was just so irritating. His grandmother did EVERYTHING for him, and more, and only in the very last ten/fifteen minutes or so did he turn into a sweet boy who loved her.This really is a high quality film, except it felt very rushed towards the end. The story could have slowly unfolded into the child's gradual appreciation of his Grandmother, but instead it was quite sudden, and seemed like it was tied up in a quick little package, as if the viewer wouldn't be able to sit through a minute more.It's quite a good film with some very sweet parts (especially the end!), but if they added another 20 minutes or so to let the story unfold, i would have enjoyed it alot more. I'd suggest renting this before you buy it, if you haven't seen it before."},{"rating":"2","title":"RSL","review":"Beautifully filmed and acted, a touching story of a spoiled and over-indulged child, and his warm hearted, but mute grandmother.

That is way too dogmatic to be credible. Alot of repetition and retstatement of the same views.The lenght of a book and the densisty of a book is no indication of its quality .

That said, I must say, that when I began to listen to the c.d. I thought something was wrong with it. Who ever thought it cool to add that sound, of a running car in the background was way off base - it sounds awful(and left me feeling ripped off). Also, the production is just plain poor. The poetry reading, the bits from the movie, all have a tape recorded quality. And again, with that annoying running car sound, the soundtrack often sounds like we are listening to someone listening to the soundtrack while driving in a car and that, in turn, was recorded on a tape recorder. What gives?!! Neil's music stands on it's own and some bonehead loused it up! You'll have to work hard to get past all that crappy production to appreciate the haunting, awesome atmosphere of one of Neil's most artistic forays. I wouldn't buy it if I were you.

On the other hand, the music without the images is weak and not freestanding as it's recorded in this so called \\"sound track\\" CD. Even though Neil Young's expressionistic guitar playing from the film, still resonates as a powerful \\"image\\" in my memory, the CD falls way WAY short of the actual filmatic material. The film, as it is, with both image and sound IS almost perfect, almost great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice work, if you can get it....","review":"Yeah, the music fits the film like a glove, and so I guess it succeeds on that level. But, really, this is Neil Noodling for 60 minutes while a film about nothing essentially rolls on to the end.Imagine Jean Georges Vongerichten making potato latkes in Detroit. What a waste.Nothing else to say about it really. Nice job scoring a paycheck for this. \\"Philadelphia\\" it aint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I seldom write reviews so that should tell you something right off. I'm a big time Neil Young fan which explains why I bought this CD. So what's this cd like. Imagine you're in a room and someone is tuning their electric guitar. They may connect a few notes here and there. They might strum a few chords on occasion. But you're waiting for the music to begin. Then imagine someone sits down center stage and reads from a book. If you can imagine just this, you already know what this cd is like. Other than a reasonably nice selection in the middle of the cd, there is nothing music worthy on this cd and that one selection isn't worth your spending your hard earned money. So who should buy this CD? Well if you're into getting high and letting the music play in the background, go for it. If you're a Neil Young fanatic, like I am, and want to have every CD he ever made, yes buy it (but you don't have to listen to it). Otherwise, spend your money on Zuma or one of his other CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A load of rubbish from a great man !","review":"O come on ! He's been given a thumbs up just because he's The Neil Young ? It's just simply boring and un-inspiring.

That said, this recording is a masterpiece, as is the movie.The actual film soundtrack is excellent, but this CD is even better. That melodic phrase that repeats over and over in the movie is teased and tweaked over and over. It's only on the last track that we finally get the payoff for the ubiquitous movie lick.I love every part of the album and listen to it frequently. I'm getting married soon and will try to convince my fiancee to use one of the tracks in our processional.

Anyone who enjoyed this movie is not a shallow person so they will be able to create their own sea sounds in thought (or not) while listening.I don't mind some of the spoken word stuff but the car doors and car driving away- not good.And I also purchased the album with the idea that the first song from the movie would be on it. It is not.The film is MY FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME. The soundtrack gets 4 out of 5.They should re-release the album without any added effects, just Neil Young's guitar and organ music."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should've read these reviews before buying","review":"A frustrating and disappointing edition of what should've been a great soundtrack. There's some great guitar-playing here, I admit, but the main theme (as featured in the film) is missing, the automotive sound effects are a weird and irrelevant toss-in, and one poem would've been plenty. The biggest drag is that I bought this CD for one song, and for whatever reason \\"they\\" didn't see fit to include it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment!","review":"If you loved Neil Young's music in the movie \\"Dead Man,\\" there is a good chance you will be extremely disappointed by this CD.

Unfortunately, you don't really get to on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great soundtrack","review":"I saw the movie about a year ago, and loved it almost rigth away. Because of beeing a neil young fan I had heard of the movie before. The \\"noise\\" coming from Neil's guitar is the perfect soundtrack for the movie.For those who love the movie this is a great way to experience it all over. however there are some things that are worht knowing before getting your hands on a copy. First of all, the only piece of accecesible music in the movie appearing at the beginning and at the end of the movie, is not included on this album. To me this was disapointing at first, because I had looked forward to having this piece of music on cd. Also if you are a new neil fan, and haven't seen the movie this is not the best place to start.All in all the best way to fully understand this album is to see the film first.P.S This album contains the best 3am headphonemusic around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irrrrritating!!","review":"This is a true story.

I drifted away from the Lord for about a year and got myself involved in all kinds of sinful things. \\"Out of the blue\\" one day I received a free sample chapter of this book in the mail. Tired of living the way I was and experiencing the consequences of my disobedience, I opened my heart back up to God and worked the chapter. I soon bought the book and it really helped me to \\"re-bond\\" with my Father and I'm so grateful. This book is full of conviction (with hope) and godly wisdom. There are lots of personal stories in there, so you won't feel like you're the only one who has stumbled in your walk. There are also a lot of questions to help you do some prayerful soul-searching and personal application. This book is certainly not just for men, or women. It can easily be used by both. Be blessed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for women! Recommended without reservation.","review":"I used this study in a Sunday School class. It is absolutely solid and, if followed as written, will draw you to the bedrock issues of genuine personal revival. Nothing in the book indicates an orientation toward women. I would recommend doing it in a small group setting instead of Sunday School to allow for full discussion (90 minutes/lesson is suggested by the book). Some sort of accountability to ensure that you don't glide over uncomfortable questions would also be wise. The companion DVD is not necessary but could enhance. Overall: Outstanding!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Bible Study","review":"This study is written to help the reader recognize their need for a closer intimacy with God. I've only read and completed the first week in the lesson, but it penetrates the heart and reveals areas of sin and weakness, leading the reader to depend upon the Lord in every area of life. It is an excellent study for friends who want to draw nearer to God, experience accountablity to and with each other, forgiveness for others and self and all together know and live their own personal revival as God changes their hearts by His Spirit's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bible study ever!","review":"This is the best bible study I have ever done.

My mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only condemnation!","review":"As the leader of a small group, this study was one of the toughest to facilitate. The women assigned to my group perservered to the end but decidely believed this was, at times, condemning and without hope. It was extremely legalistic and the checklists did not show us anything but failure. Of course, we need to look at ourselves and where we need work but the list never led us to the hope in Christ and how we can be healed and whole because he gave his life for us! The stories were unrealistic and the family's responses were even more unrealistic. The chapter on sexual abuse was so difficult for some of us as she asked those abused to go to their abusers to forgive them for the negative feelings they had toward them. Really? When you feel in your spirit that the study is not of our Lord, we should stop it! I'm sure this author had good intentions but there was NO revival in our groups of over 70 people!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The path to revivak","review":"This is an excellent study which will walk you along the path toward a closer walk with God.

The video tapes enhance it for a small group."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Surprising Choice For A Nebula Award","review":"I bought this book because I had heard it won a Nebula award, but I should have been forwarned by the blurbs that were not from SF sources but rather from the Romance Novel set. This book had a number of major problems. 1) There are a number of major plot holes. The heroine make sacrifices becuase of the love of her country (of which she is queen) but the country and her knowledge of it are hardly developed at all. 2) I had a few laughs over the names of the 2 males in the triangle. Vyrl and Jax. Hmmm... 3) The naming of other characters after quantum states and terms in physics as also a bit of a stretch. 4)The central section of the book is tedious in the extreme, and I thought not terribly coherent or entertaining. Ultimately co-dependent pathologic relationships are a downer. In short if you are a SF fan that likes a logical story and interesting ideas, you may not find this the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious: I couldn't finish","review":"Like other reviewers, I got this because of the Nebula Award. I guess it was a bad year for \\"science fiction,\\" because this is a pretty bad book.There is a chance the plot becomes interesting after the first 150 pages or so, but the writing is so bad that I could not be bothered to find out. The writing is bad on many levels: the prose is wooden and contains many mistakes (such as poorly placed adverbs and the like); the characters are simply Harlequin Romance characters (though not with their depth) at a costume party; the \\"world building\\" is like a pre-teen's attempt at a hero comic book; and the dialogue unfailingly unrealistic.With so many other worthy books around (e.g.,The Sparrow, which I finished just before I picked this up), I cannot think of a single reason to recommend this book.I only gave it two stars because it was not (at least so far as I read) offensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating series","review":"I stumbled into the series with this book and was very pleasantly surprised by the author's thoughtful attention to detail and plot. Next I read Primary Inversion, which was excellent. I'm planning to read the rest as fast as I can find them.Don't be put off by the R-word other reviewers have bandied about. It seems women who write SF about women who have men in their lives are tarred with the romance keyword, but there is nothing formulaic or bodice ripping about Asaro's women or their stories. This is space opera and it's a lot of fun to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots Of sleeping, Lots Of Drinking, Not Much Quality Writing","review":"I ordered this book and suffered through it because it won the Nebula Award. If you enjoy good writing, in-depth characters, fascinating Science Fiction or Fantasy worlds I feel certain this book is not for you.

Never again will I assume a book is at the top of its genre because it is a Nebula winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soap opera hogwash","review":"I knew from looking at the book's cover that I could be in trouble, but I still had hope. This can't be classified as science fiction, but rather as only childish fantasy. To think of Isaac Asimov in comparison...

I did not expect to be so pleasantly surprised. Every chapter is a story in itself. Every story keeps you reading, keeps you turning the pages to see what happens next. It's not the most grammatically correct book on the market, but it's entertaining and it provides unique insight into several worlds and ways of life that most of us have no clue about. And, I really believe it has reawakened for me some sort of belief and faith in the possibilities for every child, regardless of life circumstances.

By its own author nonetheless!!!","review":"For all of you out there who have relied on \\"Babylon Mystery Religion\\" as your source to discredit the Catholic Church, first of all - shame on you!!!

In his follow-up work, he discredits and refutes \\"Babylon Mystery Religion\\" by acknowledging his relative inmaturity at the time and his reliance on a very unreliable source.Congratulations to him for prayerfully examining his flawed position. Works like \\"Babylon Mystery Religion\\" and \\"Roman Catholicism\\" by Loraine Boettner are prime examples of conjecture and shoddy journalism at its worst and bearing false witness at its best.You can read his own words on this matter at the webpage for his latest, and revised, book.

It was most influencial in my Christian development from a Catholic background [a devout one at that] when I first read it 18 years ago. Since then, I have read and studied many other references and books all pointing to the same conclusions that were found in \\"Babylon Mystery Religion\\". What is to be said of \\"Fox's Book of Martyrs\\" [of which I have a 1926 edition - which reads quite differently from modern versions], \\"Fifty Years in the Church of Rome\\", or \\"Smokescreens\\" just to name a few. There is a lot of other material available that validates what Ralph Woodrow initially presented in his book.

Read more by him","review":"This book seems quite shocking at first - until you find out that Ralph Woodrow recognized that the book/author (The Two Babylons/Alexander Hislop) that he based his 'research' on was faulty and the conclusions that he derived from this poor historian was even more faulty. So he took the time to prayerfully do REAL research himself and look into the topic.I'm glad he did.

There are no classic joints on the level of any of their hits when they were together and the reviewers here that say other wise are lying. It was boring and snoring from beginning to end and I was so rooting for him solo. I saw right off the bat the musical production was so off and I was dying for the funky grooves from his partner that are so absent from this release. No club bangers or any infectious hooks to find here. This effort just proves if it ain't broke don't fix it. These grooves sound very disturbed and he should never do another project without his partner. I don't even give this album one star. Terrible disc. Save your money. None of these tracks will be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"La Cuba Mia","review":"Have you ever watched a DVD then watched all the extras then watched the main programme again?

I'm very sorry, but to post this warning I had to give this movie a rating with stars because it would not let me post without a star rating--therefore, I only gave it one, but I do not know whether this particular movie is good or bad, I only wanted to post a warning about it not being the famous Bus Stop Movie starring Marilyn Monroe"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perspective","review":"Gates walks through the shoes of the common man, the one whom most of us turn our backs to. Gates is unapologetically real, and holds nothing back. He asks questions that pierce the walls of shame and ambiguity, going straight for the truth. Questions such as, 'honestly, do you think you'll make it?' suddenly shake the listener. You see the poker face of the interviewee slightly waver. It's a question that most of us must struggle with.Poignant questions like these make real the urgency and tragedy of the problems that so many underprivileged Americans face today. America Beyond the Color Line is Gates' walk through the country, an examination of the sources and needs of America's poverty; a search for answers that few of us are willing to do.Even today, no, perhaps even more so in today's economy do these problems burden the people.Extremely relevant.

This book is set out so that even anyone without any knowledge of Photoshop would be able to follow and learn from it..

It lacks the mathematical background (ie, linear operators, commutators, commutating operators, and other necessary mathematics). Oh, there's a couple of problems, but as far as I am concerned, I threw the money away. It has not helped me. I am a grad student, and I never studied operators, or commutators, and of course, no one else ever uses them except in QM. I still don't know how to use operators !!

This collection, recorded over three nights in July, 1976, shows the New York rock scene going in all different directions, while that same weekend the Heartbreakers and the Ramones were staging their own first British blitz of London. It's surprising how \\"radio-friendly\\" most of this music seems now. In the days of multi-platinum Peter Frampton and Fleetwood Mac, though, Manster's sped-up cover of the Yardbirds' \\"Over Under Sideways Down\\" was absolutely radical. Imagine that.

This is a rollicking set of songs that gets better with each listen...whether or not I'm sipping a Guinness. Standouts include \\"Best of Friends,\\" \\"Galway and Mayo\\" and, my personal favorite, \\"Carry Me Away\\" (a haunting ballad). For sheer toe-tapping pleasure, you can't beat \\"Heading for the Sunshine\\" and the neo-traditional \\"Joyce Country Ceili Band\\" (listen for the smile-inducing lyrics). Folks, this album proves that Irish music is so much more than \\"Danny Boy\\" and the Irish Tenors. I'll be sure to catch the Doctors the next time they're in the States."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not irish, but this album still rocks","review":"The Saw Doctors' latest release is an impressive amalgamation of the sights, sounds, and people of Galway and Mayo counties.

I loved the original line up with P. Fluid and Anthony Johnson. What ever happened to them? Anyways, this was supposed to be their 2nd breakout recording (Gumbo Millenium was the first). I was hurt when P., Anthony, Jeff and Joel all departed when they did. They do have a new cd coming soon with Tony Lewis pounding. Of course Jimi and Rick are present.

He falls into that same bad habit (which he did in his first book 'Waiting in Vain) of name-dropping. It's as if the author is trying to prove to you how much he's read and how good he is -- and any intelligent reader should reel back at his failed cleverness and say \\"No, Mr. Channer! No you aren't that good.\\" Not yet at least."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Ready to Read It Again..","review":"\\"Satisfy My Soul\\" is sensual as well as uplifting to the spirit. I found reaffirming truths thoughout this book.. The need for quiet in your life to retune and get in sync with the universe. For only when you are in tune can you become aware of your purpose in life. Belief is based on your personal relationship with God and is not defined by any one religion. While meant to be a fictional story, Carey raises questions we all should ask at some point in our lives - \\"Who do you love?\\" \\"What do you believe\\" \\"What do you think lies behind the curtain of this life\\" This book is a must read...I'm going to read it again!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HUH?!","review":"Either I read the book too quickly, or I read a different book than the 21 people who also wrote reviews of this book. I was confused from page 1 and it went downhill from there. I am a great fan of Mr. Channer's first novel, Waiting in Vain, as well as the short story he wrote for the anthology Got To Be Real. However, Satisfy My Soul just didn't do it for me as the previous works did. It took great effort for me not to return the book to Amazon.com for a refund. The love affair between Carey and Frances was too convoluted, as were Carey's attempts to work through his various issues. And as for the Christianity analyses/debates...I was completely lost. The latter part of the book seemed to sum up the entire novel (maybe I should have skipped ahead?), and the ending was pretty wild. I will revisit this book in a few months and see if I feel the same...I probably will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real men, real issues","review":"Satisfy My Soul does what few Caribbean novels have attempted. It examines the relationship between strong caring black men, through their love for their women. It depicts complex men who love, envy and admit to their own duplicity. It explores real human emotion outside the box, confronting everyday issues of loyalty, religion, sexuality and surrender. In short, the characters are believable and engaging. The language, poetry. At the very last moment Satisfy My Soul turns, giving the reader a glimpse of what it must mean to be more than human, less than devine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Not Satisfy My Soul","review":"I thought this book was going to be interesting from the title but I was really left disappointed after reading this. The author did not do a very good job keeping me entertained. I had no clue what was going on with the story because the author kept going back and forth with things that were not relevent to the story. Like describing things about African Gods after talking about what was going on with Carey and his best friend Kwabena or between Carey and the love interest Frances. If that was not so confusing I would have enjoyed the story more"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"Colin Channer has some talent as a writer. What hepossesses none of , is the ability to tell a fluidstory with believable characters and a conceivableplot.Satisfy My Soul is the tale of two warped individualswho find one another. Carey , the book's protagonist ,and Frances , his female companion. Through the courseof the story the reader is taken on a ride throughthe spiritually damaged worlds of these two characters.What unfolds is both pretentious and repugnent.It's been said that Art can either inspire or offendits recipient. The latter sums up my take on thisbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"A skillful blend of sexuality and spirituality","review":"Colin Channer gives a skillful blend of sexuality and spirituality. Who knew the two were so closely related? Amazing how he makes them become almost one and the same. This book was such a beautiful story, and touched me in ways I can't explain.

Colin Channer has established himself as a master in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, captivating, \\"train\\" reading novel.","review":"Colin captured the sensuality of loving someone with his descriptions of the love between Carey and Frances that made you want to fall in love a million times. Yet, he shows what a persons flaws can eventually do to them and the people they love. Karma...at it's best. Thank you Colin, you are truly a gifted writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whet My Appetite","review":"I seem to have read a different book than most of Channer's friends. Could it be that my copy had an incorrect cover?Overall, I believe with Satisfy My Soul, Channer's writing and descriptive prose have greatly improved over his last two endeavors. However, he falls waaay short on a storyline that captures one's attention. He has the potential to be a great literary writer. When he evolves, perhaps he'll captivate us with something more cerebral. It did not happen with Satisfy My Soul.I await the day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting... yet a bit of a dissapointment","review":"Mr. Channer is and will continue to be a great and poetic writer. Having said that, I must however express dissapointment in his latest novel. I was left with the impression that there were actually two books clashing into each other, one about African mysticism and the other about romance and betrayal. Don't misunderstand me, the two topics can definitely go hand and hand. However Mr. channer seems to have trouble blending them and they seemed to be too distinct and disjointed. It was as if he was writing two books and gave up on both of them, then tried to put them together into one book.Mr. Channer is a gifted and lyrical writer and I will continue to look for more work from him, I just think he dropped the ball on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"lost his soul recently to a tragic loss of friend or relativ","review":"This book was written by someone under stress.

The facts were misleading, because the author is trying to use its nationalistic point of view in order again to justify the separation of Azerbaijan from Iran.He fails to say that, the Azeri population is well mixed among Iranians. They are very well integrated in society, and they are vital to the function of Iranian society.He ignores all the facts, and fails to bring the future affects of what will happen if Azerbaijan is separated from Iran.I have one comment for my non-Iranian friend, dream on, you can leave Iran and all your Azeri friends can go and live in Turkey, but not even a single inch of Iran will be given to you non-Iranian, hate promoting separatists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cassette or audio cd should be a must for beginners","review":"Learning a new language is almost impossible without hearing the pronounciation of the words.

I picked it up and flipped through the pages, and something about the dialogue and tone of the author's voice caught me, so I figured what the heck?I am so glad I did - this book was one I found I could hardly put down. There were several times when the cleverness of the dialogue made me laugh out loud, and other times the descriptions of emotions made me want to weep. Being an artist myself (music and photography), I could thoroughly appreciate Norrie's struggle to be creative, how panicked she felt at the thought of that creativity deserting her and how obsessed she was once it got hold of her again.There may have been some loose ends here and there, but I'm not a book critic - I just know this particular story spoke to my heart in a way that hasn't been done in a long time, and I hope Ms. Traxler graces us with more books before too long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not hold up","review":"I loved the concept of the product but it cracked withen four uses, this product has nothing to do with the seller its the manufacturing of it.

This album seems to be a little more creative. Vulgar songs start and end the same except for a guitar solo. These songs are more like 'Mouth for War'.This is heavy, catchy music. I still don't think a band has done that as well as these guys since.'25 Years' is one of their best ever. Every song is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure trash Metal","review":"How can anybody give this album 5 stars? This is one of the worst albums I bought in the nineties.

They should have stuck with glam metal like they did for \\"Power Metal\\". That album rocked!

The best songs are \\"Strength Beyond Strength\\",Shedding Skin, Becoming, 5 minutes alone. Dimebag's best guitar playing yet. I've had this CD for about 4 years now and it still kicks from the day that I got it. Dimebag has been one of my main inspirations in my guitar playing. I would recommend this CD to anyone that listens to metal. I would give this CD 5,000 stars if I could. I do'nt think there's any other metal band out there that can top this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not there best,but a good cd","review":"I think Cow Boys From Hell is there best cd.But Far Beyond Driven is still kick ***.I would say the best song on this cd is Becoming.Other good songs are I'm Broken,Hard Lines&Sunken Cheeks,and the Black Sabbath cover Planet Caravan.Some songs seemed to be just thrown together,like they tryed to be to heavy.The whole cd sounds like it was rushed.I think this album might of been as good as C.F.H,if they just took there time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy","review":"This album varies from Pantears earlier works, replacing a more steady vocals done in the style of james hetfield into a more screaming sound. This takes alot of getting used to and I hated the album until i sat down and listened to it with lyrics. Dimebag Darrel and Vinnie Paul shine on this album having a mix of drums and guitar which is hard to beat. Very thrashing style at high speeds without the repitiveness of many thrash bands. The best word to describe this album is heavy. \\"strength beyodn strength\\" and \\"slaughtered\\" are pantera at their best lyrically and musically and should be cranked turned up high. The album ends with a cover of Black Sabbaths \\"planet caravan\\" which is done well. However it probaly led to hudnreds of people thinking that was Panteras sound since it was played on MTV. Get this album if you are a metal fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD ALBUM","review":"I had my douts about this cd at first, then I listened to more of it. I realised that this is a good album, but some songs I just don't catch on to right away so I gave it 4 stars compared to 5. My favorite songs on it are:STRENGTH BEYOND STRENGTH-good song, nice and heavyBECOMING-awesome song, nice guitar work and vocals5 MINUTES ALONE-another awesome song,not too much I can say about it but awesomeThe bottom line is, this album is pretty good. You wouldn't want to be lefd without it if your a pantera fan like most of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than stellar","review":"I have to second the other reviewers' comments regarding the quality of this pressing. For a 180g vinyl, I am far from blown away by the sound quality. I did experience the same skipping at the beginning of I'm Broken as the other reviewer mentioned, but I was able to almost completely alleviate that with some heavy cleaning with my record brush. However, as another reviewer stated, side D (Use My Third Arm, Throes of Rejection, Planet Caravan) is near unlistenable due to the amount of surface noise on the record. How no one realized this before pressing is incredible. Pretty big let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAAAAWWWWWNNNNNN.......................","review":"Nothing but a bunch of noise. I can imagine being in a prison and having this blasting out of another convict's stereo. Phil Anselmo seems to be trapped in a prison. He sounds like he is giving birth. Or having a limb amputed. I can imagine other great guitarists other than Dimebag."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what most would call good music","review":"This is not reccommended for anyone with an even remotely good taste in music. I say this because this is just noise. If you want heavy at least go with death metal because that is at least music. This album took no talent to make whatsoever in my opinion. I guess these other reviewers gave it such high marks because of their different mentality. Well i bought it here because i was curious to see how it sounded and it was for dirt cheap (to no surprize)."},{"rating":"1","title":"why?","review":"....I thought they were struggling on vulger but damn they shoulda stopped why they were ahead, doesnt even sound like metal to me... just some dweeb screaming trying to look cool.

Maybe if you are a teenager or a slow, or immature adult, you could get into this band, but otherwise I would recommend staying away. By the way, the lyrics are among the worst I have ever seen! I would advise Pantera to not included them next time. If lyrics, songwriting, and musicianship are not important to you then here is a band for you, but otherwise do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated, Overpraised, Overhyped, & Untalented.","review":"Critics everywhere love Pantera, calling the best and heaviest metal band ever. I don't see what's so good about them. Guitar mags hail Dime as one of the greatest and most talented guitarists on the planet. He certainly isn't. Not the worst, but not the best. After listening to Far Beyond Driven I realised there's nothing special about this band. All that screaming makes your ears bleed. The subject matter is terrible, offending about sex, religion, politics, and WAAAAYYY too much swearing, there's a reason why there's a Parental Advisory label on the cover. The drumming is just horrible! You'd think a 2nd-grader or an ape was at the drums. Rex's basslines sounded out of tune. And of course, there's Phil Anselmo. After listening to this CD you'd figure out what kind of person Phil is(a mean one). After listening to this CD, I've concluded that Pantera needs more practice. Don't buy Far Beyond Driven. It's a mess. Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pantera at its best","review":"If you like heavy metal, give this CD a try!

They flirt with death metal on SLAUGHTERED, industrial on GOOD FRIENDS AND A BOTTLE OF PILLS, and great old fashioned metal everywhere else. After all that, you need a song like PLANET CARAVAN to mellow out to. I like VULGAR better, but this is one HEAVY friggin' album. Makes anyone in today's market seem like a standard rock band."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the cornerstone metal albums.","review":"Considered by many to be the quintessential Pantera album, it's hard to argue that claim. Phil Anselmo is at his absolute screaming best on this album spitting out hate-filled, yet somehow catchy, chorus after chorus. This is also the album that cemented Dimebag Darrell as one of the greatest heavy metal guitarists of his, or any other generation. The songs \\"Strength Beyond Strength\\" and \\"5 Minutes Alone\\" are the highlights on an album full of them. This album can be described no other way than simply \\"the definition of heavy metal.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"RIP Dimebag Darrell","review":"Dimebag was and will always be one of my two favorite guitarists, along with Kirk Hammett. No matter what kind of music you listen to, you can't help but be inspired by his frenzied riffs and blazing solos.

My enthusiasm came to a grinding halt when I hit side 4. The sound became shrill and the surface noise was unbelievable for a limited edition 3000 count vinyl. It was like I had a totally different record. You think the quality control would be manageable for such limited quantities. Forget it! I have read on the internet about Cowboy's having some skipping issues on side 3 and I can tell you 1st hand that Vulgar is full of non-fill discoloration. Although that title seems to play decently. Avoid these Record Shop Day reissues at all cost. They are going to do them all over again anyway as anniversary editions and a defective pressing of 3 titles would give one cause to buy them all again, but I wont be giving the Rhino hogs any more cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"this album is ok","review":"What a dissapointment.....Man, when i first heard this i was like this is really bad, but after hearing it a couple of times it had some cool songs.

They were way better when Terry Gaze was their frontman though, I Am The Night is still their best album that album had great vocals and excellent guitar playing by Dimebag.I hateted when they decided to get this heavy, the guitar tone sounds way to much like a nu-metal band and the vocals are a disaster, I can't believe this was the same band that recordedPower Metal.

A few hours after purchasing I noticed all these negative reviews about them being fragile, and thought to my self \\"oh noes\\". A few days later mine arrived, and were in fact in a million little pieces in the box. I contacted the seller and he told me they were insured, so I took them to the post office, and they gave me a form, which I'm about 90% certain the *sender* was supposed to get. Overall, these glasses have just been a disappointment. Adding insult to injury, I was at Target yesterday, and right on the rack they had the set, for less than I payed, non broken. I suggest avoiding mail order with these!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Frahm and Mehldau are brilliant.","review":"Wow -- what a combo.

It's not dark, it's really a fun CD to listen to. I met the guitar player (Dirk) when I was promoting my old band, and we talked about Love On Ice. Dirk was a fun guy to be around, and really funny. You will hear that when you listen to this CD. This band would have been successful had they been backed by their label properly. It's too bad that they were never allowed to develop the sound that was on this record. This band could have put out a lot of really good music.

Fortunately, a few weatherbound days at basecamp on the way out provided the time for a second look. At more oxygen-rich elevations I was better able to follow its convoluted and repetitious style.

It was put into a box with only the plastic packing the mask was surrounded by (which is too small for the mask in the 1st place).

Before ordering it I wondered if it would be too big, and sadly it was. The fabric is comfortable on my skin but because of my high cheek bones, it presses on my eyes too much.

It's a black headband that sits like a normal headband on top of your head but has clear plastic strips that connect it near the ears to the mask. If you have dark hair you can probably figure a way to style your hair around it but if you have light hair the headband will be clearly visable. Otherwise the headband does allow it to rest comfortably on your face without any pressure. The inside is a soft black felt that is comfortable when it touches your skin. The eye holes are large enough that I could probably wear false eye lashes and they wouldn't touch it. And it came packaged very nicely so the feathers weren't crushed in shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous.","review":"This is even more beautiful in person than it is in the photo, the feathers are so pretty, with hints of color in them.

The standout track is the dynamtie \\"Light Comes From Within\\", its the only track I'm not embarrassed to play loud! Other than that, it is quite painful to the ears.

I was amazed at how well it worked, and how much fun it was! When you get the right music with the right pace, the synergy is incredibly energizing, and the system is simple, easy, and entertaining.

Watching your run data collect on the nice nike+ graphical interface is great fun!As stated by several here, nike+ shoes are not necessary. I put my shoe unit in an unused luggage tag and stuffed between my New Balance tongue and laces.Minor complaint: During workout, I can't fast-forward/reverse within songs that are playing (a minor complaint when one considers I am now running 2 miles daily!)Try the \\"PODRUNNER\\" podcast at iTunes to find free and extended workout mixes tailored to your desired beats-per-minute (BPM)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally not happy with mine!","review":"I tried calibrating it and it would not take b/c it said my distance did not equal what the sensor tracked.

I will try it again but it is frustrating and I got it as a Christmas gift and my husband threw away the box so I cannot return it.Edit..Okay, now it works but I am unable to change the number of stars in my review.I would give it 4 stars (losing a star for not working properly in the beginning)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great motivator! Outstanding product! A++","review":"Wow! I just finished my second 5k daily run with the Nike + iPod Sports Kit and now I can't imagine running without it ever again! It's so simple to use and provides so much information both during AND after each run. The Nike website that's linked to my iTunes program whenever I synch my iPod Nano is outstanding. It allows you to set personal goals, track your progress, and even to get your friends involved in a running contest. The Sports Kit could not have been easier to set up and yes, it does work with non-Nike+ shoes. I just stuck a small piece of velcro on the tracking device and sewed the other part onto the tongue of my running shoes under my shoe laces and it works perfectly. It is worth every penny and once you get it, you'll soon discover the many benefits of keeping track of your mileage, average time per mile/kilometer, and distance left to meet your goal for the run. Great job, Nike and Apple!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good gadget","review":"I purchased this product for my husband for Christmas. Be aware that you do have to have a particular model of Nike Shox to use this transmitter. That pair of shoes was about $100 (which is not bad, considering he runs 5-6 days a week).

It reports calories burned, distance travelled, and a few other things. Good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"short battery life","review":"I really liked this product. But I am also very disappointed by the sensor. I own two of this product. The first one worked excellent for 3 months then the sensor's battery run out. So I bought the second one. To save battery this time I turn the sensor off when the first time I am not using it, then it can't be turn on anymore.I only use it for 1 hour per day. When not running, I am not wearing it at all. The sensor suppose to last for 1000 hours, but 1 hour per day for 3 month (about 100 day)-is only about 100 running hours then the battery died.The second one shows me the poor quality of switch on the sensor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea--if it would work!","review":"Worked great--for 1 week. Now the iPod can't find/recognize the receiver unit, so the system won't work. The Apple website had a specific fix to try, but no luck.

I bought this for my partner, who doesn't fit well into Nike shoes, so he's continuing to use his favorite running shoes. He has the Marware sport suit for the sensor, which came highly recommended. Unfortunately, we haven't been able to get the calibration to work at all. Apparently, judging from all of the other messages from users, this is a known problem -- whether or not you're using the sport kit with a pair of Nike shoes.I think this is very much a beta product. Great idea, but just too buggy in its first version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea - Unreliable Product","review":"It's a great idea but unfortunately for me, the product has been unreliable and the whole experience has been frustrating.I purchased my Nike+ IPOD Sport Kit 2 weeks ago. On my first run, the IPOD didn't recognize the sensor. I took it back to the store and the salesperson got it to work right away. It then worked perfectly on my 2nd and 3rd runs. It was incredibly motivating and the Nike Online Log was just what I needed to keep track of things. However, on my third run the IPOD didn't recognize the receiver. I took it back and exchanged it for another kit. I went out for my run and now it didn't recognize the sensor! I got home and it worked - go figure. I'm going for a run this evening and we'll see how it goes. If it doesn't work, I give up.

I had the first one for over a year when the battery went out. That is when I found out you couldn't replace the battery. Bummer! You have to buy a new kit. I was impressed that the battery lasted so long but was disappointed that you can't replace it. I use the kit with the nano 5th generation. I also purchased the heart rate monitor that will link with the sport kit. It has been a very easy way to keep track of my running and gauge my progress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT work with the newest 6th Generation Nano","review":"I feel bad that money was wasted on this product. I have the new tiny square Nano, 6th generation. The directions to sync, begin run, stop run, set type of exercise, calories burned, distance covered etc. all require you to go to Nike + iPod on the Nano, then to SETTINGS. The new Nano does not have a SETTINGS field. I've been trying to figure out a way to start this thing, especially since I went out and bought the Nike+ shoes, which weren't cheap. The good news is that the built in pedometer in the Nano works with the Nike + iPod site, so at least it records how many steps I take each day. So if that's all you need, don't bother buying the Sport Kit or the shoes. The pedometer works with any shoes or none at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"It's now April 2010 and for over 6 months now, [...] has yet to get this ish together.

You're not able to search for your friends, sync your email contacts, you get errors when syncing in with facebook and twitter. It syncs fine from your ipod/iphone to itunes but once it gets sent to [...] is when you get screwed. I've been searching through all the threads and forums and they say they're working on it but over 6 months?

Thus I have a picture of how little or much concealer is needed.Now, remember those childhood hiding places? If you were anything like I was you sometimes forgot where they were.

Regarding the captions by his pictures that say \\"I'm not gay,\\" He doesn't seem to really like women, that I wonder.I also didn't like his disrespectful attitude toward our country's leaders.

Whatever happened between Clinton and Paula Jones, I think that the office of the president deserves some respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I used to like Drew Carey. I really did. But after beginning this book, my opinion of him began to fade. I was ashamed to have people know I was reading it, the language was that filthy. It was funny in places, I'll give him that. I just wish he, and most other comedians and humorists realized that it takes more talent to be clean and be funny. Anyone can tell a dirty joke. I don't recommend having this book anywhere near children, unless you want to answer alot of uncomfortable questions and have there perception of you drastically alterred. Sorry, Drew."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick reading ~ A no-brainer","review":"This book moves right along as well as jumps around. The crude jokes were expected, even the snide comments. He is as his TV character is, rude, crude and socially unacceptable. I don't think I'd be inclined to read this book again or buy another he wrote or endorsed. I do enjoy the TV show but all I can say is it took me 2 hours to read the book, the show is only 30 minutes...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Having a Drink with Drew","review":"Drew Carey is very direct and writes with a no-nonsense approach. He divulges behind the scenes info from his TV show, and shares some personal thoughts and history that might have been better left unwritten--but I'll give him credit for having guts. The jokes were not as funny as I was expecting, but Carey, like any drinking buddy, is not as funny as he thinks he is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drew was a Marine?","review":"Dirty jokes and beer is a lot funnier than the books my brother usually buys me for Christmas (Foucault's Pendulum, Everest).

After all that waiting this book didn't disappoint. The only time I put it down was to go to sleep at night. It is by far the best star written book I've read.The only part of the book I didn't like were the short stories at the end. This is not to say I didn't like the stories.

I had no clue that it would be like this and I loved it because it surprised me. I especially like the jokes that he put in front of every chapter and his stories that wrap up the book. In conclusion I would like to say that you must look at the title. If you don't like books containing foul language and dirty jokes well you might as well push the back button on your browser but ..... if you love dirty jokes and you wanna have a good laugh I recommend that you read Dirty Jokes and Beer : Stories of the Unrefined by Drew Carey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've ever read-Honestly","review":"I admire Drew's truthfulness, even though it does offend people. I got this book because I wanted to learn more about Drew and his feelings on many things like showbiz, tabloids, and other things stars deal with. However, he also suprised me by writing about \\"average guy\\" things like beer,gambling, big screen T.V.'s, Mardi Gras, and strip clubs. I am glad Drew didn't get too caught up in stardom and forget his average guy traits, and this book proves he didn't. If you are unsure if this book will offend you, read some of the short stories. Those would probably be the worst part of the book, vulgarity wise. I don't feel offended by them, because I know these things happen to people. I certainly don't think of Drew as a sleaze or something because he made up stories like these, I believe he just wanted to show people that stars do have problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money - the TV show's free and better","review":"The jokes are old, the text is depressing, and Mr Carey was painfully right when he said a ghost writer could have done a better job. Drew Carey spends a large part of the book's 237 pages ranting, raving, and occasionally whining about life. I'm not some blue-blooded snob, but I found his constant profanity to be gratuitous, unimaginative, and tiresome. It's like he's trying to make up for all the language the network censor never lets him put in the show. I LOVE the TV show, but I'm ashamed at myself for having read the entire book (I kept thinking to myself \\"It HAS to get better!\\" - it didn't).

But,when we get into his short stories I nearly gave up on him.I was hoping for the book to end so I could start to read a quality book.When the last page came upon,I was glad and hardly read it.If you are sure you need to read this book,check it out from the local library or borrow it from a friend.Do not waste your money.Yes I am a teen male,I enjoy reading \\"dirty jokes\\" and things but what Carey is writing about is rape and bull.Good Day..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blown Away","review":"About the Entertainment Weekly blurb above: The reviewer ALSO said that as she read the book she felt as if there was a gun at her head.

Drew Carey, a stand-up comic and star of his own TV show, writes mostly about sex, drinking, gambling, football and television. Four-letter words dominate this book, giving the book a definite adolescent, male tone. Carey makes note that the more offensive his material, the more popular he became. He also includes a sample of the negative reviews and letters he has received. Overall, this book has a very limited appeal and I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Drew Carey's audiotape, \\"Dirty Jokes and Beer\\" made me disenchanted with a guy who, his show lead me to believe, was a talented comedian.

As his Funny Bone commercials state, \\"funnier than you\\". The first half of the book is extremely funny then loses its momentum for the latter half. Drew lets you in to his human side, where a lot of other celebrities would shy away from such thinks making Drew even more likable knowing who he is and where he came from. I think his show was great and I think he knows that the joke and his star are not always going to be popular so enjoy it while you can. Drew, the every man's everyman. This book is not a laugh riot but a nice look a man that found his way to stardom by accident without any aspirations from childhood. It does make you laugh but it is not a jokebook. Remember that.

My problem in reading his story though was his seemingly shallow approach to his new found stardom. Where he may still have his down to earth personality and still value a dollar, he has reached a point in his life where he doesn't have to worry about rent, a mortgage and putting food on the table. He shouldn't use the theme in his book that he is still the typical guy when we all know this is the furthest from the truth.Overall it was funny and it made me chuckle in numerous sections. It was funny relaxed reading, yet too much on the personal side."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can judge THIS book by it's cover.","review":"my title here says it all.

I'm not crazy about the fact that the holes in the lid do not appear to have been deburred/ smoothed out after the manufacturing extrusion process. The barely detectable rough edges inside the holes have been great for mold to gain a foothold, and I've not yet been able to scrub the black away. In addition to fixing this, engineers at Hummzinger should try to true the screw and the feeder before packaging. My feeder leans because the screw hole seems to have been set in the plastic without leveling, allowing leakage of nectar (there's a 1/4 inch difference in nectar level from one side of the feeder to the other).

Here's why:1) It didn't get hair off our couch (or any other surface except for our cat, but I had another brush for that which worked fine), it just pushed it around. After several tries, the best you could do is sort of push the hair off the couch onto the floor to vacuum. It took 10x as long and just wasn't efficient. Maybe it was the couch fabric. It just didn't work for me.3) I thought, Hey, maybe I should try the brush wet.

The pace is consequently choppy, as bits and pieces are seemingly added as they occur to him, without plan. The space allotted to each topic is equally random. It is possible that these problems have their roots in his straining to be seen as a revisionist historian, tidying up the history of Appalachia for the tastes and prejudices of 21st-century readers. The choppiness allows for suspicious omissions or digressions. This makes him appear to be an unreliable, uncertain source of information about the region. The editing makes the book seem even more unreliable. Quotations are not cited, and what sort of editor lets through the use of \\"of course\\" multiple times on a single page?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Treacherous terrain","review":"There are books that have a way of keeping your attention, no matter what the topic.

Lots of different kinds of styles are featured here. Some of the styles are: big band, Doors tribute band, Elvis impersonator, B-52s cover band, opera, Beatles cover band, reggae and spoken word. But the highlight is the version of \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" by Rolf Harris. You may remember Harris from his novelty hit \\"Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport\\". Well, his version of \\"Stairway\\" is done in an arrangement similar to \\"Kangaroo\\", and is absolutely hilarious.

I hope they'll continue and republish all of them. I'd buy them again. Admiral's Bride is #7 in the series. If they don't... and if you can get your hands on this one, it's worth it. Although it's not absolutely necessary, I recommend reading Brockmann's \\"It Came Upon a Midnight Clear\\" (book #6 in the series) to get a bit more of the Admiral's history before reading this one.

If my husband is like Jake when He is 50ish I am going to lock him up in a cage! Kidding aside, I really enjoyed this book. The only part I didn't like was Jake obsessing with his dead wife,however...that did add alittle sexual tension between him and Zoe. I also likes Zoe's character, she was a strong woman who was not afraid to show or say her feelings, and she definitly knew what a catch her hero Jake was. Go for it girl!

It's just an afterthought to the romance.Sorry, not my type of book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Excellent book. The characterization was superb. Jake and Zoe were both very real characters, and the reader is left utterly convinced of their devotion to one another. I see no problem with their 20-year age difference; I think most of us are open-minded and mature enough to deal with that just fine. It really isn't a problem, nor should it be. The idea of the \\"forced\\" co-habitation and the cameras is interesting, oddly erotic and captivating, to say the least. I highly recommend this story. I read the entire thing in one night-- couldn't put it down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting story but.....","review":"Ms. Brockmann certainly knows how to write an interesting story but, her book lacks characterization. Zoe never seemed to get over the awe, she felt for Jake. One got the feeling that it was a surface love, rather than an enduring one. The age difference was always a problem in Jake's mind. And to be honest, it was always a problem in mine. Also, the story lacked sensuality. You expect it to be there because of their forced intimacy, and it's not. Categories alot of time, have too little of something in them; rather it be the plot, (this one was good), the romance itself, (just ok) or the sensuality.

It is readable, practical and inspiring. Perhaps the greatest virtue is that there is fresh thinking not available from other sources. Really difficult issues are faced in a way that is faithful to the Biblical text and at the same time is pastorally sensitive and helpful.

I was, strangely enough as a guy, the only one to disagree with what he felt. Then again, all his beliefs were accepted because of his wife, and not what he wanted.

Even if you are not a Melvins fan, you should at least give \\"Revolve\\" a chance. This CD is definitly worth the price (considering how cheap it is), even for someone who is just taking a chance on an unknown CD. These people were Kurt Cobain's inspiration. If they were good enough for Kurt, they are probably good enough for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great album.","review":"Melvins are going to be as good as you want them to be. It all depends on what mood you are in. Sure, some of their stuff gets boring at times but most of it is pretty damn good. I happen to think this one has a lot of their styles combined and makes for a good first intro to this grunge band turned insane. You get some of the heavy heavy stuff along with some of their creative moments. I am not one to sit around and describe each song so I think if you are interested in a band like this then here is a great place to start. They usually master their albums pretty well so no worries there. One of the great unknown bands of their time and they keep going too. Saw them live around their late 90s tours and they were still heavy and raw and played a song off this I believe. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good dose of lunatic rock intermixed with ambient music from Hell","review":"On the excellent \\"Stoner Witch\\" the Melvins churn through song after song with a dense primordial energy--think neutron star emissions--buffered with excursions into the darker recesses of imagination. The band is not content to lock in to one particular vibe and often zags when you thing they are about to zig.It took some guts to concoct this work, and it will take some fortitude to listen intently and loudly. Expect to do so alone if friends, like many of mine, cannot range far from the safe and sure when it comes to music. There's none of that to be found here.If you enjoy a good dose of lunatic rock, that is distorted guitars, sludge drenched bass, and map cap percussion, intermixed with ambient music from Hell, then Stone Witch awaits."},{"rating":"2","title":"listen to great sludge metal","review":"If you're not firmilar with sludge metal, this band defines that word.

I'm all for experimenting, but for God sakes know what works and what should stay in the can! The Melvins idea of experimenting is starting a song (if you can call it that) in one style, then ending it in a radically different tone, failing to fuse the two together. If you think it's great to crank up your speaker to hear this electronic noodling, then get blown away when they suddenly decide to play a metal riff...then buy this cd. To me this is old and sounds like the Melvins got into really bad King Crimson. This is not the Melvin's accessible, it's their most difficult. If you like heavy stuff, get Bullhead. Houdini is also very good, though the last song falls into the Stoner Witch mode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lyrics and the song titles are stupid!!!","review":"I'll admit the band is heavy and they have a decent groove but thats it!!

Kim Colletta is hardly your typical \\"bassist chick\\". J Robbins is a great lyricist. For those Jawbox fans that don't have this CD single, get it. Lil' Shaver is a shorter different take on the Big Shave. 68 is a much more different version than that which appears on \\"My Scrapbook of Fatal Accidents\\".

There are a few slow songs but their done much more tastefully than the last two albums (Stranger Than Fiction, Recipe for Hate.) The production is much simpler here, one of my major beefs with probably the last three albums (the effects given to Graffin's voice was a bit excessive.) However the tone is clean to the standards of this band so the melodies can really shine through. The new replacement guitarist for Mr. Brett, that guy from Minor Threat (Dag Nasty, and the awful Junkyard) did a fine job on this record and seemed to rejuvenate the band (if only for this album.)

My favorite character's are her creations-intelligent, human, far more intricate than norm-but these two just didn't add up. I felt sorry for them. The heroine had shown such promise in the beginning. What really bugged me, though, was there were periods of time when years pass and they didn't even see each other. It's just the next paragraph, and oh, they're together again. The plot twists were so offsetting and unbelievable.

One of my biggest pet peeves is Big Misunderstanding in a book. It's even more irritating because the Big Mis leads to long separation and a deep emotional scar to both Hero and Heroine. Had I known this from the beginning I definitely wouldn't have picked up this book. To think that all of this could have been prevented by a simple dialog between Hero and Heroine. Grrr..!!Add to that the hero's treatment to Heroine that really leaves me cold. Throughout the book, I can't see a single reason for the heroine to fall in love so deeply with the hero. When the book finally comes to an end (a rather simplified ending considering what they've been through), instead of the satisfied feeling I normally get after reading a happy ending in a romance novel, I feel sorry for the heroine for always being the one who gives and gives and gives in their relationship. Not a happy ending in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet.

The book does a great job making the states come alive, with lots of silly pictures of the states interacting with each other (i.e., Colorado referring to Idaho as \\"Mr. Potato-Head.\\") Kids learn where the states are & what is unique about the states while giggling over their escapades.

The title is very misleading. It gives way too much commomn sense that a school-yard child knows already. Nice cover, but that's all there is to it. Between the covers are things you already know. For instance: Always be nice to women, talk sexy to them (yeah, okay! try that if you don't have the looks to back it up) and many silly things women would laugh at. Save your money, and move on. This will only hurt your chances, plus your wallet if you shell out money for this. I was annoyed and pi**ed that there was so little here.

I got this spool for a job I'm doing replacing some older wire. I got a lot more than I actually need, but if you are like me I hate having to wait to do a project so I got extra (future projects). 500ft /$46 seems fair for the quality and next time I can just go grab the spool and do a job when I feel inspired.The wire is flat, but like some other reviews pointed out it is much more fat than your typical audio wire. This wire will hide very well along a door sill or at the bottom of white molding. If you match this product up with Banana plugs you are good to go............the sound quality is very good.

I don't have it in the walls, so buying a 3/4 in U hook made hanging these wires a cinch and they look really good.Not completely concealed, but don't look tacky.It lays flat and wide, so easy to stack the wires for the full length of the room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superflat - very flexible","review":"This cable is indeed superflat and works great under the carpet and around the woodwork..Looks a little light on copper at first sight - but once you cut it you can actually see that there is quite a bit of material inside these wires.

In addition there is a middle section of PVC with no copper inside which I used as a spot for the nails instead of using clams. This cable is very flexible. Great product - great price !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"I love these. They are awesome. They produce good sound. While not in use they hang around your neck. One thing that keeps them from being a 5 star is that the ear peices that go in the ear are a tad big. The size doesn't allow the closest fit but they don't seem to fall out so I guess it doesn't make much diference.Another thing that kept it from getting a 5 was that the adjustable strap slipped after wearing it for awhile.

Yes, I'm a little older (40ish), but active in my job and on my feet all day with no problems. I bought these insoles, hoping to get some use out of my new crummy running shoes. I paid for one day shipping, they arrived the next day and what a difference. I replaced the 1/8 inch insoles in my shoes with these, and was able to run 3 miles without stopping! My feet are \\"normal\\", not high arches or anything. I will definitely spend more research time and money on my next pair of running shoes.

I ended up ordering another pair from Amazon since the price and shipping are great. The only downside, the dr. recommended only these cross trainers bc of their added heel protection but these are a little too bulky for dress shoes.

After looking at the bottom of the insoles I realized why both things were happening.First, the insoles are unbalanced. In other words, the bottom of the insoles are not one flat piece but rather a couple of raised ridges. Unfortunately, the company was not smart enough to put enough ridges near the arch part of the insole and a result the insoles are uneven. In short, your foot will turn inwards as a result of the uneveniness of the insole and your arches will ache.As far as why the insoles make a squeaking noise, it stems from the same problem. Since the bottom of the insoles are not one flat piece and just a few raised ridges, air gets trapped in between the ridges so it creates air pockets. As soon as you walk it forces the air out of the air pockets which creates a \\"gas-like\\" noise, which is quite annoying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic inserts","review":"these inserts are amazing. they are very comfortable and support my foot exactly how it needs to be supported in my boots. i can be on these all day and my feet will still be very comfortable. i highly recommend them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It","review":"I would rate this higher than Superfeet.At half the price of Superfeet, you can't go wrong.However, Amazon did not carry all the sizes - what do you do if you are a man who wears 9 1/2 size shoes?:s"},{"rating":"1","title":"Product changed & NOT FOR THE GOOD!","review":"I have worn these Spenco Cross Trainer inserts for years; but this time when I ordered new ones, I was disappointed.

This extends up over the yellow section and creates a hump under your foot. I had to try to peel this section off. I had purchased three pairs and this was very trying. The Spenco Company should have left a good product along.

I had worn through the inserts of my work shoes so bought a set of these Spenco inserts at a local shoe store paying close to $30. They were so uncomfortable! The arch was in the wrong location and the contoured heel was too narrow. Though I had to shorten the length of the inserts to fit into my shoes the proximity of the arch to the heel and the narrow heel seem made for a smaller foot. According to the size chart on the box they should have tended to be too large, not too small, since my foot size was at the low end of the range specified on the box.I had to suffer through one day at work with them on and was in such misery when I got home that I angrily threw them into the trash.

Good try Oakenfold but stick with the white labels. this reminds me of someone, did Pete Tong put you up to this? This mixs is for people that like big tunes put on one mix or people experiencing trance for the first time. cheers! hopefully David ralph does a better job on \\"Tranceport 2\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Electronica Genres 101","review":"Still confused about what is considered trance versus house versus techno music? What about the difference between trance and progressive trance? Have a listen to the suitably named album, Tranceport. Unaltered trance in its purest form mixed by (argueably) the genre's most infamous DJ, Paul Oakenfold.Not a favorite genre of mine, but beloved by many others. I don't mind trance that is mixed into an eclectic set or presented with a little more contrast than what is offered on this album. The first volume of Northern Exposure by Sasha & John Digweed (released the same year) is the kind of dreamy trance that I enjoy. The trance tracks featured on Transport are very old sounding. A steady organ-tone throughout, cresendo drum rolls and a very cheesy narrative track about being spiritually connected with Earth (\\"Gamemaster\\" by Lost Tribe) to top it all off.A timeless classic for some. Electronica's equivalent to Rock's 1980's for me.2/5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be afraid!!!","review":"This is introduction to trance, not good music at all. Instead of this album buy oakenfolds oslo compliation. Its the only good music he has done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"#1 trance album","review":"when i was introduced to trance this is the cd that sold me. in my mind this is the best trance cd ever created. paul oakenfold is a turntable genius. seeing him live is also one of the best things you can do for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"His BEST yet! A MUST have for YOUR electronica collection!","review":"An AWESOME compilation of trance sounds and melodies. It's infectious. If you buy this, you'll want to own all of Oakenfold's albums...it's what I did. =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you don't own it, it's like you're missing a 6th sense","review":"\\"people who listen to trance with religious-like fervor\\"???? Well who wouldn't if you could listen to candy like this all night? This is a must-listen album. No party is complete with a little Oakenfold to get people in the mood."},{"rating":"2","title":"In one word \\" Ecstacy\\"","review":"This type of music is new to me, but it is diffently something I think will be big in the future. I love the beats and sounds, its even better the louder you play it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely beautiful!","review":"I can't put into words how much I love this album. This is definitely trance at its best. All the tracks are soothing yet very danceable. Whether you're in the mood to just lay back and relax or get up and dance, just put on this cd. So what are you waitin for? Go out and get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow is the word!","review":"This has got to be one of the best cd's to get if you want to get introduced to progressive trance music. It's so soft but at the same time, wonderful to dance to. It can pick you up if you are in the mood to dance, or if you are weary, it can put you in a trance or make you fall asleep. Stephen"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything a Trance CD Should Have","review":"Oakie has always been a fantastic DJ...I have a few of his live mixes (I highly recommend the Essential mix 99 from Miami mix, if you can get your hands on it) There's a down slow groove and rhythm to tranceport that I haven't really found in any other of Oakie's work. This album represents everything that a Trance CD should be...it has a welcoming, friendly beat that is worthy of listening to time and time again. Unlike the oh-so-common screaming violent music that so many people are listening to, Oakenfold provides a comforting escape from it with positive upbeat (although not TOO happy...) music. He easily gains my respect for his ambient, elite style of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"This is my first trance CD. It is an album designed for an introduction to trance, and I can see how people could bash it for being \\"commercial\\". But for new people like me, It's worth a purchase. I listen to it alot now, but I wouldn't say it's perfect. Some of the tracks are just not that good, but the good ones far outweigh the bad ones. I also don't like some of the vocals as they just ruin the song (but I guess that will never change) as in the last minutes of El Nino. Overall it is a very good CD, great for anyone new to the scene. But don't expect a album to end all albums. 4.5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this album","review":"This is the Trance album. When any of my friends want to know \\"what trance is\\" and I want to talk to them again, I hand them Tranceport. I can't tell you how many trance fans this album has made by my hand alone. I don't need to say anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Get Enough","review":"This is by far the best trance album I've ever heard. Noone does it better than Paul Oakenfold. This cd is a landmark trance cd filled with really cool melodies and everything is layered perfectly. If you're a trance fan, this cd is a MUST for your collection. If you're just getting into trance and techno, this will be one of the best albums of this type of music you'll ever find. And for anyone who just likes to kick back and listen to nice melodic lines and/or get up and dance to somethin, this is the cd for you. A must have for anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely one of the best","review":"This is one of the first cd's I purchased when first getting into Trance.. and it is definitely STILL one of the best I've found. Definitely in my top 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tranceport","review":"Tranceport 1 is perhaps a classic in the making. Oaky once again proves his grandmaster skills on this excellent compilation. Track 3 Rendezvous, is perhaps the best music when riding in a car going 90 mph, with the wind in your hair, its pure freedom. \\"Baila con Ritmo\\" , sets a party mood, and the best track, Gamemaster, is a trance fireworks, going deep inside your soul. This album is truly a must have"},{"rating":"2","title":"From Twilo to Shadow Lounge...","review":"Paul...Paul...our man in Trance once again tranceports us from the dancefloor to a \\"wide open space\\" with the classic hypnotic tunes mixed on this album.

This was the album that started it all for me as far as dance music goes. I've always loved the opening and closing tracks, they're so awesome. Very good track selection throughout though. \\"A voyage into trance\\" is another very good p. o. mix. I like it's darker, edgier tone alot. I've become more of a Sasha fan and I hate Oakenfold's new stuff, but \\"tranceport\\" always be special."},{"rating":"2","title":"ECSTACY","review":"Well, kids, this is as good as it gets for paul okenfold, and believe me you, it's all any raver ever needs. Paul uses incredible breakdowns to slow the mix in order to bring it back and blow it up like no other dj can. i used to think that sasha and john digweed were all that and a bag of chips. then i heard paul okenfold's tranceport"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely one of Oakenfold's best.","review":"While relatively new to the entire techno/trance music scene, I still have listened to quite a few of the more popular CD's out there. At first, I have been selecting most of my music from the Amazon Customer ratings and I find that they are generally on the money. After listening to most of Oakenfold's CD's, I must say that this is definitely by far one of his best in comparison to his other CD's which also got good ratings (Another World, Global Underground New York, etc.) There is not a bad song on it and for the money, I would definitely recommend this CD. It is a definite keeper and a must for anyone who enjoys this sort of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"ESSENTIAL","review":"This compilation is classic. I owe my fascination with trance music to this cd. It's been one of my favorites since I began listening to this type of music, and now it's all i listen to. Great track selection. This cd is essential to any trance/techno/dance aficionado, or for anyone who likes a good beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than I expected","review":"With a title like Tranceport, I imagined it'd be another me-too disc. Not so. Some great, innovative tracks that didn't bog me down with boring beats. If you're hardcore into trance, might not be the best album, but I'm still getting into it and I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GO!","review":"This album is like an icey cold brew on a hot day! Very refreshing! Its GO from the first trak all the way to the very sweet end. If you like to dance this is the album for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be sure you know what you get","review":"1. This is simply a remix album;2. There are far more creative remixers around (Reload, Aphex Twin);3. These songs are rigidly 4/4, based on the most predictable chord progressions; and4. They could have been written 10 years ago.My advice is: buy this CD if you need some background music for your weekly workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"We should all expect more from Oakenfold then the usual summary of big-time hits that he has put out. His mixes are haphazard and rough with only song selection at an acceptable level. Keep looking, this isn't worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I never understand.....","review":"How people can get into this style of trance music. The entire CD is just chedder flavored, with \\"Gamemaster\\" topping it off. I was somewhat ill leading up to the track, but simply laughed at that point. Personally, I've never been one to enjoy the \\"now I see the light\\" style of progressive trance, and this is what Tranceport is about. Certainly not a Sasha or Digweed, and not anywhere near the quality of a Christopher Lawrence. If you like this style of trance, check out Lawrence's Empire release. It's light, even for him, and just isn't nearly as cheesy. I purchased Tranceport simply because I hadn't heard a lot of Oakenfold, and I'm willing to listen to a few of his other releases, but if it's more of the same, people need to find a new trance dj to worship."},{"rating":"2","title":"#1 in my CD collection","review":"I just got this CD a couple of weeks ago, and like with all Trance CD's you have to hear it a couple of times before you can catch all the little things that make it special or can make it a let down...This Performance by Oakey is definately one of my favorites smooth as glass and never lets you go. The track sellection is second to none and the crossovers are so Patiently mixed that its hard to believe it was done by human hands. The only fault I see with this CD is that it wasn't long enough ....Paul do us all a favor and make tranceprt 3 a box set. I cant wait to get my G.U. 2 Oakey is definitely the Best out there! Even though we all tend to have our favorite tracks trust me when I say just leave it to the master. The best thing you can do is just pop it in your player and let him do the work strait from track 1 through 11...... If you don't have this CD, get it and if you do enjoy..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oakenfold is DJ supreme!","review":"Here's a disc that will inspire you. It will move you (in more ways than one). This CD will make even the most die hard criminal beg for a Furby to cuddle up to every night. I love this album, hands down. Each track is a journey into the world of trance and his razor sharp mixing from one song to the next is crafted to perfection. The most remarkable tracks are Energy 52's \\"Cafe Del Mar\\", Paul van Dyk's \\"Words\\" (one of my all time favourite songs), and Agnelli + Nelson's \\"El Nino.\\"Overall, I think this album will appeal anyone who truly loves electronic music. If you are a BT, Sasha, or John Digweed fan (like me), this album is for you. The tracks on this album are candy to one's ear. For myself, a trance lover, this album is one of my all time favourites. I highly recommend this album to anyone (even country fans.....well, maybe not)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The one that started my addiction","review":"This is the first Oakey CD I ever purchased. Heck, it's the first trance CD I ever purchased. Now I can't satiate my desire for this music fast enough. Even with all the new CDs I buy, I rarely find one that has the same effect on me as this one did. A must buy, especially for someone new to trance."},{"rating":"2","title":"different oakenfold cd","review":"I love this cd, its slightly different than great wall, another world, or others. This cd has much less voice-overs. Overall the cd is awesome and you should all get it to further your knowledge of Paul Oakenfold, even if it risks paying for one cd instead of going for quantity and buying a 2 cd set."},{"rating":"2","title":"From The Start Till The End..Excellent...","review":"All what you have to do is put the Cd..and press Play...No need to skip Any Tracks...The starting is beautiful...and the ending makes you want to play it again...My favorate tracks:1.

He is way played out. It is time for people to understand that there are much more talented Dj's out there than Paul. I bought this CD when I was first getting into Electronica, and I absolutly loved it, I still do. But I feel that I have graduated from this sound. It just doesn't keep my attention any more. Don't get me wrong, there are two or three classics on this disk that everybody should hear. I am just saying that I'm sick of hearing about Paul Oakenfold. . ....Anyway, like I said, buy the cd there are definitly songs you need to hear."}]`),N={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],x={key:0},W={key:1};function C(a,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(o(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(o(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",W,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",x,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const j=d(N,[["render",C],["__scopeId","data-v-b65c2706"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/2.md","filePath":"quotes/2.md"}'),H={name:"quotes/2.md"},F=Object.assign(H,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(j)]))}});export{L as __pageData,F as default};
