I can understand people maybe liking Load for what it is, something different, but how hackneyed is calling leftover tracks, \\"RELOAD\\". I guess after Load Bob Rock wasn't able to pinch anything else from them so he said, \\"All right guys lets just re-tool the crap from the last one.\\" I'm sure they didn't put up a fight, they're rich now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"This was one of the first albums I bought that I was dissapointed with. Load was better, and as back in Metallica albums you go, it gets better. \\"Fuel\\" is a fun song to listen and to play on guitar, but the rest is better left to rest. 'The Memory remains\\" has some nice bluesy riffs, but it's more of a Creed song than a Metallica song. As the album goes by, you will the deception too. Soft rock fans will find this an interesting offer from Metallica with songs as \\"The Unforgiven II\\", not bad at all, in fact, very interesting to listen to. Highlights: \\"Fuel\\" not metal, but regardless a great tune. Lows: monothony of the rest of the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the inspiration?","review":"Another uninspired group of songs thrown together. Sure, the CD is slightly heavier than Load, but first off, not much, and still, no more inspiration. Fuel is a great way to start off the album, just like Load, they started it off hard, but let it dive. Starting with The Memory remains it's just more songs just simply put together with nothing behind them, Unforgiven 2 is a slap in the face to the origional song. It doesn't get better until Fixxxer at the very end of the CD, just more weak attempts at putting something out."},{"rating":"1","title":"wat the hell","review":"how could u come up with crazy names like master of puppets,ride the lightning, ...and justice for alland come up with a name like re-load they really badly ran out of ideasfuel is the only half descent song on it"},{"rating":"2","title":"True Fans Listen to the worth","review":"While yes, the better albums for Metallica remains Kill em ALl and the 80's thrash, the newer bluesier sound takes theband AND its listeners back to the band's youth. In my opinion, Metallica isn't gone, some of the new tracks from ST. Anger have alreadyt shown us that, its just that LOAD and RELOAD were albums meant to take us to and show us into the youth and feelings of the band, how they expressed there feelings when all there was, was the blues and southern rock. To those who claim that LOAD and RELOAD were filler albums, I say that you need to reevaluate your fanship and learn that softer isn't always \\"not heavy metal\\" it's attitude that counts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Words are meaningless","review":"By now everyone actually knows what Metallica used to be, and what they turned out into in the 90s.

It's so easy for you to dog something great when you've probably never picked up an instrument in your life!

Yikes. And the problem is, most songs here are like that: great potential, no payoff.And other times, the band's just recycling stuff from the Black Album and \\"Load.\\" \\"Unforgiven II?\\" Pwaahahahahahahahahahahahaaha. I rest my case.This is sad. Break out the black clothing, it's time to begin mourning a band's artistic death."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dissapointment","review":"Metallica disappointed me and I believe most of their fans with this album.

How unfortunate they ever released this."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"Metallica has reached a low on this album that is only surpassed by St. Anger. Most of the songs are uninspired and monotonous. There are really only 3 good songs on the album (Fuel, The Memory Remains, The Unforgiven II) but even they are not typical Metallica songs from their trash days or even Load days. Above all what is up with The Unforgiven II? It sounds much like Unforgiven from the Black Album and has no apparent reason for being made. Another complaint is that the recording quality is subpar. Fuel seems to start off really weakly as do some of the other songs. And yet another complaint is the complete abandonment of powerful guitar rifts, instead we're left with 4 minute songs that exhibit a minimal of Metallica's legendary talent. I miss the true Metallica."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tastes like foot soup","review":"Sweet Jebus, do yourself a favor and listen to just about anything else: old Metallica, Led Zeppelin, King Crimson, John Coltrane, the Beatles, Wendy Carlos...Load is moderately okay once a year or so, but Reload is magnificent garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"wasn't load bad enough?","review":"i guess they didn't think so, and decided to release an even worse version of it. \\"gimme fuel, gimme fire, gimme that which i desire\\", what heppened to the meaningful, well-thought out, articulate lyrics of the metallica i knew and loved? these guys seriously could just not pull it together again. do not buy this cd. if you want good metallica, get one of the three great ones: ride the lightning, master of puppets, or and justice for all."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album !!","review":"Every song sounds the same and it is Metallica's most uninspired work they've done, other than St. Anger.

For instance, Populica, Commercialica, or I-Want-Grammy-Againica. Don't cheat your old fan with your name anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"A(nother) Load of Inferior Material","review":"Well, Metallica and Bob Rock have done it again - the sound of this album is incredible, it's just too bad the songs aren't of equal quality. \\"Fuel\\" and \\"Devil's Dance\\" do have the energy and toughness that hearken back to Metallica's glory days when they were a relative unknown, worshipped by an army of unwavering fans who found the band by word of moutch and bootleg tapes of their scorching live performances. Much has changed and so has the music (no small thanks to MTV - the exploiters of all good things musical, and some not so), thankfully Metallica hasn't resorted to the AC/DC-Judas Priest tactic of pumping out the same songs redressed every couple of years. The fact that they have been able to vary their sound and stay successful is a tribute to their talent. However, ReLoad and Load will sit on the shelf gathering dust while I listen to Master of Puppets."},{"rating":"2","title":"not as good as the metallica of the 80s ;","review":"The main theme of the 80s was the \\"we dont give a s___\\" attitude and the lyrics of death which made them famous. In Reload, this is not very evident. It shows a change in their music, beginning with Load. Although they are good rock albums, they are nothing like the Metallica of old. Now with shorter hair and a whole new concept on rock, they are completely new people.

Yes, man, Metallica and Hansom !!!! But the problem is that the guys of Hanson think that Metallica isn't heavy enough to play with them. Just to end, if you liked 'Load' buy 'Reload', you will love it.

With the exception of songs like Fuel and The Memory Remains, Reload is a boring, lackluster album. And what's with Unforgiven II? Who makes a sequel to a song??? I respect the band's wishes to evolve and change their musical style, but in the process, they're on the verge of losing fans like me who appreciated them for such raw and speedy metal symphonies as can be found on their first four albums, which mark music at its most awesome and furious. Still, you have to acknowledge their musical talent, which manages to showcase itself on Reload (as it has every one of their albums). My greatest wish is for Metallica's next album to be a return to the speed metal and ultra-heavy guitar crunches that made the mainstream take notice of them in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst excuse for a metal album","review":"This is the worst excuse for a metal album I have ever heard in my life.It is because of this album,and Load that Metallica is no longer my favorite band.If you haven't heard it yet,don't even listen to it because it will make you loose a lot of respect for Metallica."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star cause i can't give any lower","review":"Well, the lead single from this album says it all THE MEORY REMAINS"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a Load of MY LOAD!","review":"This album seems to be the product of Metallica's on-goign battle with mid-life crisis.

However it contains none of the few positives that are found on that album. Even though I strongly disliked 'Load' at first, it eventually grew on me, but this sub-par sequel has no hope of doing so.As a long time Metallica fan, I took a chance and bought this disc to give it a serious listen and give it a chance.

Having been a fan since the Kill 'Em All days, and being one who daily laments the lack of truly inventive, heavy bands on the scene today, I find ReLoad a simple waste of money. I have no problem with a band changing as they grow older, mature, and broaden their horizons. What I do have a problem with is Metallica used to be so uncompromising. They wrote and played with a fury and passion that quite literally shaped a new generation of metal. To hear them now is to hear just another hard rock band floundering through radio-ready pablum. More power to them if they reach a new generation of fans, but the Metallica of today finds itself awash in a sea of Filter, Alice in Chains, and Tool with little to distinguish it.

Howard Marshall's commentary on the Epistles of John has much to commend it to the pastor, Bible teacher, or scholar.

I've been reading sci-fi/fantasy for 25 years. During this time, I have grown to appreciate more literary works. Calde does in fact contain well written, at times transcendant passages, but the story itself is ludicrously overwrought and complex. Wolfe forgets that a good story, regardless of whether it is pulp or artistry, must entertain the reader. Calde was technically proficient, but cold and lifeless. After being mildly disappointed with the first two books, I have continued to read on, hoping that Wolfe's style would click with me.

The production has nothing of the shimmering quality of their Debut, it sounds clunky and heavy, and it is not helped by the unmemorable songs; like other people said in their reviews, I m hard pressed to find even one song that I like.I wish Iris all the success in the world, they have the potential to be an amazing band, and an important one to boot, but this direction just seems wrong- they went from being really special and unique to \\"just another synthrock band\\" in the space of an album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good !","review":"I think people should buy it.

Prodigious research, immense stamina, the work took almost ten years to complete. A largely unknown classic. See also George Steiner's 'In Blue Beard's Castle', Sean Desmond Healy's 'Boredom self and Culture', and other texts on what Schopenhauer called 'the malady of the modern age'.As a PhD researcher on the topic I feel myself to be following in the footsteps of the master.

Stanley 's History goes back extremely far (100 years to be exact) Stanley doesnt realise he is going to encounter an exciting adventure.

My favorite line in the whole book is \\"I can fix that\\" which Sam says to Kate whenever something is broken,including her heart.

I must say I was hugely let down by this book and I'm dumbfounded by how many literary awards it has received. The writing style is fairly straightforward with cardboard cutout villains up against a motley assortment of kids at some type of correctional facility in the desert.

The mythology about the Yelnats past was terribly unbelievable. There was nothing fun about the story. Just a bunch of kids in the middle of nowhere. The attempted humor was a fail.In these types of stories, it's sometimes typical for the bad guys to get their comeuppance. However, the villains in this story didn't get enough justice to be enjoyable. Plus, the ending was a bit too unrealistic.Also, the hanging out and eating a gazillion onions in the heat? Or Sploosh? Both recipes for a massive case of the runs and dehydration, not to mention blisters and pain from eating so many onions.Lastly, the writing was incredibly dry. Don't understand why this book was so popular. It must be because of the other stories he wrote, which were supposed to be excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the cover I wanted","review":"I'm ticked because I really specifically wanted the Holes Movie-Tie In cover.

On one level it's a character story, about a wrongly condemmed boy named Stanley Yelnats and his experience at Camp Green Lake. (A dry, waterless nothing.)But the other (and best) part is the sub-plots. There is indeed a mystery aspect to the story, and it's brought to light by making jumps into the past. So at times, it tells two stories and they come brilliantly together in the end. If you don't get what I mean, well it's hard to explain! Read the book and find out the secrets.Bottom Line?: A MUST READ!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"READ READ READ READ READ READ READ READ READ !!!!!!!!!","review":"The book is Holes. It is funny.

The downside of the book though is there are many characters which make the book confusing because you don't know who they're talking about at many parts.

For almost the entire story, the maincharacter is in a prison work camp or is nearly dying of thirst in thedesert. Even the happy ending is told in an almost joyless way.Though marketed as a children's book, the story contains serious adult themes, including the lynching of a black man. Other themes are very politically correct -- none of the inmates at the prison camp have committed a serious crime; authority figures are corrupt and stupid; and lawyers (ugh!) will save the day in the end (see, I told you it was a joyless ending).

This is the kind of book to read with your kids--so they don't miss anything, and so they can work through some of the scarier portions.I appreciate a story that deals so eloquently with the arid hearts of the racially prejudiced without soapboxing. Stanley is a fine everyboy whose courage ends up suiting him well. Perhaps my only (slim) complaint is the jumps in tone. Some portions play off as goofy that the transition back into the hard, hot land of Camp Green Lake is shocking. Or perhaps that's the point--you can't always remain in the fairy tale, even in a fairy tale.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"So unlike what I read when I was a kid","review":"I liked this quite a bit better than The Giver, but I've been assured I missed some symbolism or something in that book. Holes is full of sidetracks, little stories that don't seem related, and the whole thing becomes a bit of a riddle. The good guys win, mostly, and history repeats itself in the most lovely way, and there's a lot of grownups being very, very mean, which is always fun to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"My students will remember this story when they are adults.","review":"I teach middle school English, and I spend day in and day out drilling them about punctuation and the parts of speech.

After reading this book I as well had some mixed feelings, I either enjoyed some parts or I disliked parts but most of all I liked ther parts.

At Camp Greenlake he has to dig a hole five feet high and wide. While he is there he meets many new people and finds a new friend. As Stanley keeps having more bad luck you come to learn his family's past.

My low-income minority students were captivated by Stanley and cheered when I would pick up the book to read. I even had one child offer me a dollar just to keep reading.(I kept reading, but didn't take the dollar!) This is a book that reminds me of Maniac Magee.

It is such a wonderful experience to share a beautifully written book."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Opinion of Holes","review":"Holes is a book in which everything is a circle or is the shape of a circle. It is challenging in its own way. It forces the reader to make conclusions by foreshadowing events. The way this book is written shows thought, effort, and many revisions. Using flashbacks to foreshadow events is a brilliant method and definitely worth considering using in your own writing. This book is about a boy named Stanley Yelnats. Notice \\"Stanley\\" backwards makes \\"Yelnats.\\" He is cursed with bad luck, just like the rest of his ancestors. He is accused of a crime he didn't commit, and is forced to go to Camp Green Lake Juvenile Correctional Facility. Here, he must dig a hole 5 ft deep and five ft wide in every direction everyday for 18 months, including Saturdays and Sundays. After much work and toil, he finally leaves Camp Green Lake. This book is very good and is undoubtedly one of the best books I've ever read. I recommend it to people from the age of 12 and up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holes","review":"I loved this book.

A decade later I enjoy the book just as much as I did on that first read. A great adventure with an unlikely hero who has to face difficult internal and external struggles. There are dark moments as some other reviewers have noted, but they aren't gratuitous and serve to heighten the tension and further the story.

I somewhat enjoyed the book as I was reading it, but afterwards I thought \\"Why did I read this?\\" For young readers, I reccomend more INTELLIGENT reading. Not books about some treasure that you KNOW the good guy is going to win. Watch the movie, instead, which is in theaters now. It is a lot better than the book. The book is also unrealistic. How can someone live off of peaches that have been sitting in a boat for one hundred years and only just barf? Wouldn't it be a lot more serious? And American justice is much better than that stated. Camp Greenlake would never exist in this country. I felt that I was reading a book that happened in a foreign Communist movie. So if you're going to waste [money] plus shipping on your book ..., don't! Waste that same amout of money for a movie ticket.

At the camp, there are campers,counselors and a Warden. The book goes back in time to give the readers more background information.

The book had valuable messages and was entertaining too.The Habit of Mind, intellectual perseverance was shown in this book. Whatever hard obstacles were thrown at the main character Stanley Yelnats, he pushed through them. He never gave up and he persevered.

He told the judge tha he had never been to camp."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST BOOK EVER!","review":"The book I read was called Holes. I think think the movie made more sense to me than the book.It was a great book.The setting was described enough for me to understand that Stanley got hit with a pair of shoes and was sent on a bus to Camp Green Lake. In the book Stanley was fat. It doesn't seem believable to me that a fat kid could carry Zero up a mountain.Zero is a kid at camp. He is short and his real name is Hector.Stanley is heavy and poor.In the plot everything tied together. Like,the peaches from Ms.Katherine to Sam was what the sploosh was that Zero found in the boat.I think that the theme was the curse. The curse caused the whole book. Madam Zeroni casted that curese on Stanley's no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealin-great-grandfather.Most of the things that happened were caused by the curse. That which made the book and movie very good.

Not his whole family but the men and the boys. All because an old ancester promised an old lady he would carry her up the mountain to drink from the spring, but he didn't and the old lady put a curse on every man in Stanley's family. The best part of the book was when Zero ran away and then stole the water truck to go find him but he ran it into a hole that they had dug. He had to get out and run away.

Sachar would keep going back and forth in the book. Sachar would talk about this generation then talk about something else and then go back to the same generation.

Everyday they dig holes looking for a treasure.My favorite part in book is when Zero, Stanley's friend runs away and Stanley finds him. They dig hole at night when no one is around. They find the treasure but get caught by the warden. Some things happen to the boys, poisonous yellow spotted lizard, they have no water and nothing to eat but onions.I would recommend this book because it is very adventurous, and easy to read. I had a lot of fun reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Curse","review":"The book HOLES, by Louis Sachar, is a really good book. It's an easy read fiction story to where it's intriguing to people of all ages. A young boy named Stanley Yelnats, got accused for something he didn't do, and got sent to a place called Camp Green Lake. There his punishment is to dig holes...but why would digging holes be a punishment? While at Camp Green Lake Stanley is able to figure out and put things together about his family history. While there, Stanley is able to lift the curse that was put on his great-great-grandfather. You'll have to read the book to find out why there was a curse in the first place, why Stanley got sent to Camp Green Lake, and why they dig holes for punishment, etc. There is also a movie about the book HOLES."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holes, an inside scoope","review":"Holes by Louis Sachar, also a movie now, is story about a \\"troubled youth\\" named Stanley. Stanley is accused of stealing and is convicted. Stanley is shipped off to Camp Green Lake. Little did he know this camp wasn't a summer camp, and it wasn't even on the lake. In fact it is in the middle of a desert. The camp's whole idea was to take little bad boys and make them dig a whole lot of holes. The entire time Stanley's bad fortune gets blamed on his \\"no good pig stealing great-grandfather.\\" The book teaches us that even though sometimes you have bad days, hang in there and it will look better later. Sachar does a great job at keeping you reading and focused. The book is also short and easy to read. This doesn't tell you all about the book holes, so now your going have to read the book for your self."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holes","review":"I loved this book. It was probably the best book I have ever read. It is about a young boy who gets acused of doing a crime he didn't do. He gets to choose to go to jail or Camp Green Lake for 18 months. He chooses Camp Green Lake where he has to dig a large hole everyday. While he's at the camp he makes alot of new friends and goes through alot of adentures. When I was reading it I had to force myself to quit reading because I was really in to it. I think that it deserved its Newberry Metal. I would recommend it to anyone who loves adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOLES STUDENT REVIEW","review":"Holes by Louis Sachar is a good book about two boys in a camp. I thought the book was better then the movie. It really gives you exciment and passion. Stanely and Zero are the two main characters. This book is about teaching kids not to steal and when we were reading this book we couldn't take our eyes off of it. This book was sad and good at the same time if you love this author like we do. Usually we really dont read Loius Sachar books, but he took us away. It wasn't that good at the beginning but once you get into it gets better. This book got the John NewBerry medal for most distinguished and contribution book we ever read. If we loved it you will want to share it with a family member or a friend. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Holes is a very well-written book!","review":"Louis Sachar waas the author of a very well-written book. A kid named Stanley Yelnats was convicted of stealing a famous baseball player's shoes that were supposed to go to charity for money. My favorite part of the book was when they had to dig holes that were five feet deep and five feet long. I really recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well-deserved Newberry","review":"My teacher read this book to my class and me. All of us thoroughly enjoyed the book and were constantly begging her to read more of it. I especially liked it because it referred to Stanley Yelnat's ancestory (there were things from the past that were important in Stanley Yelnak's time)and every thing in the book connected to each other and was related in some way. In the book there was always suspense and mystery, and you never knew what was going to come up next. I think people of all ages should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"captures readers from 9 to 61","review":"Grandpa, that's me, bought this book for my 9 year old Grandson. I read it first, then my wife, then my Grandson & finally his mother. We all thought it was great and enjoyed an intergenerational discussion of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most unsual but compelling story plots I've ever read","review":"Stanley Yelnats is always at the wrong place at the wrong time. His family has a streak of bad luck because of his great great grandfather. He chose to go to Camp Green Lake instead of jail (as any kid would), but comes to find out that there is no lake and there is nothing green for miles. Every single day he has to dig a hole 5 feet deep and 5 feet in diameter on the burnt, rough, desert sand. Stanley tries to make friends with the other kids there but its just as tough as digging holes. But the kids start to realize that not only are they digging holes to build character, but also to maybe locate something for their headmaster. This book has a very odd plot to it but is so hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Children both young and old will like Holes. I loved the blend of humor, and mystery. I have read alot of books but Holes is up there in the top 5, once you pick it up you never want to put it down .Take it from me, I spent 5 hours laying on a couch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holes","review":"holes is a fiction book about a boy named stanley yelnats. stanley was walking home one day when he found a pair of shoes, the shoes were stolen from a homeless shelter earlier that day. the police found him with them and sent him to camp greelake, stanley thought the camp would be like a summer camp he never had the chance to go to as a kid not knowing he would have to dig holes in the middle of the desert. while at camp greenlake he meets a little boy named zero, they become real good friends and decide to help eachother to make the days easier. stanley has no idea that zero is about to change is whole life. overall the book was very interesting, I like to read books about adventures and holes was perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nice little book but hardly worth the hoopla","review":"I bought this book as a gift for a young relative who had finished all the Harry Potter books, and decided to read it myself first. It was interesting, but I kept waiting to get \\"hooked\\" into the book and it never happened. I thought the plot was interesting, but slight. It was not a bad little book, but I would still take Harry Potter any day. I could hardly put down the Harry Potter books but this one I had to keep forcing myself to pick up."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I have read!","review":"A great book! I loved the mystery.

There is nothing much to say except to read this book and see how you liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny but many strange happenings","review":"You can tell that this is written by Louis Sachar because it uses Louis's funny ways. You never know what's going to happen in a Camp Green Lake in which you just dig holes. The couselors beleive this experience will turn these kids around.It's called Camp Green Lake but there's no lake. Hope you enjoyed the book too!! It was Terrific."},{"rating":"2","title":"I never laughed so hard--it's simply hilarious","review":"The book \\"Ugh\\" written by Arthur Yorinks and illustrated by Richard Egielski was one of the funniest books that I have ever read. It kind of reminded me of \\"Cinderella\\" but it had its own sense of pre-historic mystic and plot. I truly hoped that the author will be inspired to tell us a little bit more about \\"Ugh.\\" Perhaps a sequel would be nice . . . Either way this book is great. I never laughed so hard-- its simply hilarious!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing, mysterious Green Child","review":"I was drawn to read The Green Child because I had heard it was an intriguing fantasy piece. The book is unique - in structure and style - I've read nothing quite like it. The structure made the novel a bit difficult to follow at first, but once the tale begins, you cannot escape Read's crafty storytelling. And the third act is a mind-blower! I appreciated Read's ability to tell his fantasy story concisely. The story captures dream-like imagery, structure, and motifs masterfully.I have read that the story is allegorical, but not being a political historian or philosopher, that angle was lost on me. Thank goodness Read was successful writing on multiple levels.I have given 5 copies of this book out to friends and family who I know would enjoy the prose and the tale itself. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys unusual, unpredictable, and fantastical writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The green child","review":"This was a gift to my daughter who is pregnant.

However, I assure you, I don't need any bias to tell you this is one of the best metal albums ever to come out, and certainly this young band's best.This album is by no means made from an established recipe, like some bands do. This is a band which evolves from album to album. The vocals are more aggressive, the keyboards more emphasized, and the solos more complicated than in their previous (and excellent) albums, Something Wild and Hatebreeder. The songs are catchier, and the sound more accessible, but they have by no means gone commercial.

It is very light reading and more suited to the young reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and worth reading","review":"At first I was skeptical about the book. It is obviously ghostwritten. However, the ghostwriter is talented, his style a synthesis of Hemingway and Mickey Spillane. And Audie Murphy has a great and heroic tale to tell. Murphy's war is a lot different than say Eisenhower's and Patton's. Murphy became a master at small unit infantry tactics. He was one of the men. Ike and Patton were masters of strategy and were not really part of the men. What Murphy's story also illuminates is it is often just pure chance whether a soldier survives a war. Two pals of his were wounded in the right spots. Another had his heart pierced by a small shell fragment. Another buddy trusted a group of Germans faking a surrender and received a chest full of German lead for his trouble. For all those who liked the fictional \\"Battle Cry\\", you will like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"This is one of the corniest and poorly written books I have ever read. With GI Joe conversations and mentality, it boasts about American superiority in everything. The book doesn't even really describe Murphy himself, since the descriptions seem to focus on secondary characters. And how does Murphy know how many soldiers he incapacitated? What, did he carve notches in his gun? REAL soldiers aren't proud of how many people they killed. Anybody can pin a whole bunch of medals on somebody; they don't have to deserve it. Those medals could have gone to soldiers who really deserved them. This book is a joke. If you want REAL heroism, check out Ghost Soldiers or The Forgotten Soldier. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"I am an ex-soldier of 13 years service with the Australian Army. I have seen active service and read many soldiers�?accounts of war. This book is truly awful. Poorly written (which is his editor’s fault), it attempts to glorify himself and war and includes a seemingly endless list of clumsily used clichés in an attempt to make the reader care about the characters, and fails miserably. The book aside, a hero - in the true sense of the word - Audie Murphy is not, a successful killer �?absolutely, a sociopath �?extremely likely. If you want to read a truly exceptional book written by a surviving soldier of WWII, then throw this book away and read Slaughterhouse 5, by Kurt Vonnegut."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a boring book","review":"I was looking for something to get me motivated. I've read many biographies and autobiographies and found them fascinating. This particular one is rather difficult to get in to primarily because of the Q and A style it was written in."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a man can endure.","review":"\\"To Hell and Back\\" is an amazing account of Audie Murphy's real-life military service during WWII. As far as the writing style it definitely lacks flare and, at some points, you feel as though you need to put it down for a while just to take a break the from the abuse of English grammar. However, this man's heroics and peril he endured during the course of his service is so compelling that it far overshadows any literative misgivings. To think that the man (almost boy actually) came back and was able to be even somewhat normal is nothing short of a miracle. It's not only worth the money but should also be required reading by every high school history student in this country. This is what it means to be free and what price we sometimes may have to pay in oreder to stay that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Story of a real hero","review":"This autobiographical account of Murphy's exploits in the European theater during World War II chronicles his numerous heroic efforts, which earned him more medals in that war than any other Americn soldier.

The cameramen thought they were making a pop music video hit, and they mostly shot from the ceiling. Except for T.M. Sridevi, all other dancers can be better employed as scarecrows. By the way, on jayqworld there are online video fragments from this DVD, in case you want to preview it, and the details of the contents. In this DVD, I liked the fragment where Kitappa Pillai was watching the early Sudharani's students in Thanjavur. It is a pity that the best of Sudharani's dancers have grown out of shape, and she does not have anyone else as good as T.M. Sridevi. All in all, Sudharani Raghupathy's concept of this DVD is quite scholarly.

Unfortunately her singing skills are..almost a zero. Please, please, please do NOT compare her with Mariah Carey or Whitney Houston - that's very insulting to those 2 very very talented and skilled singers (Mariah also writes awesome songs which I suppose Brandy can only dream of doing.). So Brandy is lucky. She got some people to write good songs for her. And obviously those people already took her singing skills into consideration - all the songs in the CD are very easy to sing. But even then Brandy still had quite difficulty with the slightly difficult notes. I can't begin to imagine how it'd sound like without the music. That's why in many songs you can barely hear what she's singing. I like the last song \\"everything I do..\\". But I think Bryan Adams performed it much better than she did. The reason I like it is only because it's a good song."},{"rating":"2","title":"SAD","review":"I ACTUALLY FOUND THIS CD SAD. THIS WAS ONE OF THE SADDEST CDS I HAD.

Oh yeah by the way you people at Amazon.com need to get a 0 star rating option cuz there some really stupid \\"singers\\" out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down!","review":"She has such a monotonous voice that you cannot understand what she is saying half the time. Also, she can't speak English. She mispronounces words all over the place, including on \\"Have You Ever?\\". And for a final laugh, \\"The Boy Is Mine\\" is one of the lamest songs ever written. Some singers can get away with this because they have looks, but Brandy looks a Mongoloid child. Skip it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"where's the rest of her voice?","review":"She is ok but you cannot hear her. Speak up!!! All of her songs sound the same and it gets very tired. It sounds like her voice is dying out and fading. She may sing from the heart but monica sings from her soul. I hope she finds the rest of her voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sophomore CD Is A-OK With Me","review":"Brandy's \\"Never Say Never\\" was a pleasant surprise for me. I enjoyed her debut CD immensely and was apprehensive about buying her second. It was money well spent. The first 8 tracks are great; tracks 9, 14, 16 could have been left off (although the vocals are fine, I just wasn't feeling these songs). I especially like the smooth transition from track 4 to 5. A more mature Brandy I can truly appreciate!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"this is a great cd. my favorite songs are: have you ever, truthfully, and everything I do, I do it for you, but every single one except for \\"top of the world\\" is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's worth every penny you spend on it","review":"This is such a good CD! Every song on it is so good. I fell in love with Brandy's voice when I heard \\"The Boy is Mine.\\" Some of my favorite songs are \\"Have You Ever,\\" \\"One Voice,\\" and \\"Never Say Never.\\" I think that this would make a great Christmas present for anyone who likes good music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I think this record is really awsome!!!!!","review":"I have listen to all of brandy's work since 94 and it just keep gettin better and better.This record helps me through my bad relationships and the good ones I think brandy will always have a hit record reguardless who she works with it's just of being so talented by looking in them eyes here is one young ladt the world anit finish with yet!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is over the top and rising!","review":"This cd was really awesome, I really thought it was awesome and inspiring! Brandy has a catchy spirit and is so pretty. My only complaint is that she didn't put \\"The Boy is Mine\\" on it. Oh well! I loved it any ways!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BRANDY GOT IT....!","review":"I've got the brandy, record;never say never, and I loved it, that girl is too great. Here in the Netherlands the people think she is much better than Monica,by singing and looks..! The last cd was very cool (means great in the dutch language) I think it was a bit softy, but that makes her a good singer, and actor.My friends and i love also the show; Moisha.A brandy fan from the Netherlands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a cd you listen to over, and over, and over again!!!!!","review":"There is not much to say about this cd, the only thing I can think of is excellent.

All in all I really liked this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE BRANDY!!!!!!","review":"BRANDY,is awesome!!!!!! she is so cool!

This album brings back memories. This album is a pleasure to listen from beginning to the end. This album sounds like a young lady taking control of her art and her life with a melodic force unparalleled in contemporary pop-R&B.; Never Say Never is a document from the soul of a young woman on the move,figuring out the winding roads of romance, the sure-footed initial steps to independence,the exhilaration and freedom of her own soaring vocals. This album has been certified 5x Platinum.Remember,this was 1998."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good CD from Brandy","review":"This is the best soul CD I've heard for a long time.

It is a good cd and she has all the credit that she deserves to for all this hard work on it. She is just great. She has a wonderful voice and she sings very well too with Monica. My two fav songs are The Boy is Mine and On Top of The World with mase which by the way I find very cute!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS CD IS ALL DAT AND A BAG OF CHIPS","review":"THIS CD IS DA BOMB. SHE REALLY KNOWS HOW TO MAKE MUSIC. YOU GO GIRL!! I LIKE ALL HER SONGS. MAKES ME WANT TO GET UP AND DANCE. I CAN LISTEN TO HER CD FOR HOURS AND NOT GET TIRED OF IT.

YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS ONE."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a little less than perfect","review":"Even though Brandy's cd has great songs,but they just don't add up to 5 stars so I gave it 4 stars.But I still like this cd very much.I have to listen to it a lot to decide my rate for this cd.But as I said before, I still like this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"sophomore slump","review":"Brandy, what happened? This so-called sweet singer now drew to materialistic America. And the song with, Mase. Just horrible! Someone give me a bucket to throw up in. Monica is ten times better than Brandy. My dog can sing better tunes! Brandy, you've lost it."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE !?!!!","review":"This album has some of the best beats I have heard in a while. The base and accoustic guitar chops are among the best. A skillfully crafted set of tunes that only have one problem with them. They are monotonous and boring!! Ok, the secret is now out. Brandy really cannot sing for the life of her. Her attempts to hide this fact behind crafty pop beats and solo guitar performances falls just a little short of a total faluire. I have never had this happend before, but I really wished I had not bought this album. Brandy failed to purely hit any of the notes in her song, but she has cleverly developed a style that dosen't require much singing ability at all. This album is a very poor follow-up to a otherwise good debut for a youngster. She shows little maturity in her vocals and has an annoying from the throat singing style that shreeks of monotony.STAT AWAY FROM THIS ONE GUYS!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brandy the actress- Yes, Brandy the singer -NO!","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love to see a woman (young lady) do her thing in a respectful manner but Brandy's sophomore album sounds like it should have been her debut album. I would think that hittng the scene with her first album as hard as she did and then blowing up with her hit TV show, she would have been banging on her latest album. I'm sorry to say but if her competition gets with the right producers and promoters Brandy will be out the singing buisness quick! She can't keep depending her good looks to get her by, because like her or not, she can not sing so her songs/music needs to be able to divert that attention somewhere else and they're not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what happen after the first record?","review":"the songs are to predictable and her voice has lost what little edge it had.and what's up with doing everything i do i do for you? it was weak when bryan adams did it and it is weaker now.and the most overrated song the boy is mine from last year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bland and unoriginal plus horrible vocals","review":"Brandy wasnt bringing anything new to the MI when she released this album back in 1998. Its got some ok songs but could have been better. But then again she was only 19 and this was here sophomore album. What makes the CD worse is her bad vocals. Can u understand what shes saying in 'the boy is mine'? She should have took more singing lessons but then again that wont help if u just cant sing. Actually I dont see how she got a record deal in the first place but anyways. Save your money and buy mya's CD instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is going on with your NOSE?","review":"Your nose is so FLAT that I have a hard time finding it. Your music is AWEFUL and your personality is LIttle, Just like your NOSE NOSE NOSE NOSE"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good music","review":"Brandy sounds like no one else. In this sophomore effort, we glimpse a promise of an outstanding performer. Playing this CD so many years later, I give it five stars because its a project that so far has held up the test of time. Highly Recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best CD of It's Time","review":"When Never Say Never came out, all of my peers were listening to it. Not only that but adults and children had an ear for it as well. Never Say Never is probably the best CD that she has ever or ever will make. All of her songs were something that someone could relate to. It was some serious lyrical genius work put into this album. Brandy showed how talented she could be, not to say her future projects were not just as good. More so that this CD was the begining of something great. I think Brandy proved that she will be a powerful force to be reckoned with in R&B even if it is to get into production or song writing, Im sure we will always hear something from this lady."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album","review":"I've loved Brandy since her debut album when I first heard the single Best Friend. She expands even more creatively on this album, thanks to the help of Rodney Jerkins, I'm a big fan of his work. This album defined summer 1998 for me and is absolutely a timeless classic filled with r&b/hip hop gems that have stood the test of time. The Boy is Mine was a beautiful song and duet with Monica which was a huge hit, and the rest of the music is so amazing and so fresh and was ahead of it's time during its release. Definitely recommended for your collection if you love r&b/hip hop music or are a fan of Rodney Jerkins work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sorrows and heartache goodbye....","review":"This is one fantastic album. Brandy's sultry, wonderous voice soothes the soul, and strikes the heart. There are some absolutely amazing songs on this album. My fav's include The Boy is Mine, Almost Doesn't Count, Top of the World, Truthfully, Have you Ever?, One Voice, Tomorrow, and I Do It For You... which is pretty much half the album. And the rest is great as well. Brandy does a beautiful ballad, and there are enough of this album to keep me happy. I don't think you could possibly go wrong with this album, and it's gotta be one of my best buys this year. Get it, and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!!!!!!!","review":"This is her best album ever and will always will be. The mixing is excellent. Her vocals are more mature and has feeling that her 3rd album doesn't have (aside from \\"Nothing\\") but that's a different story. Every song is meshed with her soulful vocals and relaxing music that makes want to continuously listen to this album from 1 to 16. I love the fact that many of her songs run together to give that feeling of a story told by Brandy on a music album. If you're thinking about getting an album by Brandy, buy this one, if you're into real R&B. Full Moon is techno feeling. Her 1st album sounded popish. This is a keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Brandy's Never Say Never is fabulous. Her voice is wonderful, and she has really matured over the years. My favorite songs were Angel In Disguise, and Learn the Hard Way."},{"rating":"2","title":"The reason why I love music.","review":"When I was 11 years old listing to the radio a lot coming from school on the radio I herd this song oh the song that made me feel so emotional inside a song that oh geesh love. I herd \\"Have You Ever\\" on the radio man I was in love with the song. A few moths later my mom got it for my birthday. I ran upstars for the radio and listed to it and enjoyed it. I recommened this album to and Brandy fan and every person who loves R&B. Best of the 90's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album...","review":"This is brandys third best album. Afrodisiac & Full Moon being the first 2. Well this album has great production. The calloborations are very highlightive.Best Songs:Angel In DisguiseThe Boy is Mine (shows that brandy is better than monica.lol)Learn The Hard WayAlmost Doesn't CountTop of The World (great collaboration with mase)U Don't Know Me (this beat drives me crazy i love it)Never Say NeverHave You Ever (beautifully written)HappyTommorow (a ballad to cry for)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect too much, that way you won't be disappointed.","review":"Brandy Norwood has definitely matured. Sadly, her second album does not reflect this. The better songs are at the beginning of the CD. Sure, there are some catchy dance mixes and heart-warming ballads. But the overall mood of the CD induces the after-breakup feel. Her vocal talent has been compared to the soulful Monica Arnold. THERE IS NO COMPARISON. Monica's sultry voice is much more pleasant than the anemic cries of the Cover Girl/star of MOESHA. Die-hard fans are not being discouraged from investing in this CD, however you wouldn't feel as disappointed if you would just borrow your neighbor's."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS CD IS AWESOME!","review":"Brandy is one of today's most talented artists in the R&B industry; singing, writing and producing. (Not to mention Moesha!) But this album is HOT! I love every song on it, which is totally cool! And to all who doubt Brandy, NEVER SAY NEVER!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brandy did not disappoint.","review":"Brandy still has what it takes. This CD was wonderful from beginning to end just like her debut. This is a must-have for all r&b listeners."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Great CD","review":"Brandy's CD is really good. The music is very relaxing. I like the way the background singers add to the songs. This is a good CD to add to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The music on this CD has a wonderful upbeat tempo.","review":"This CD will give you a wonderful feeling inside. It really shows you that there is great music artists out there.

I would recommend this seller to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking Vocals","review":"Just bought this cd a few days ago and I have to say, IT ROCKS!!! Brandy's voice is pure, sweet and breathtaking. Especially on the songs Have You Ever, One Voice and (Everything I Do) I Do It For You). This cd is constantly playing in my cd player, I highly reccomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"this cd is cool","review":"this cd is aight. personally i like the 1st one better. but some songs are aight,but too many are slow songs. overall this a ok cd"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST SINGER EVER","review":"Brandy is so much better then Monica, that they shouldn't even be compared. I just went to her concert last night, and it was AWESOME. She is a VERY talented person, and will be very secessful in her life."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOULFULL DIVA","review":"BRANDY IS BACK AND BETTER THEN EVER.

SHE IS SURELY ONE OF THE GREATES ARTIST OF THE DECADE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brandy is tight","review":"I think Brandy is so tight. Her songs are off the hook. Her braids are always stylin'.

All I can say is KEEP DOING YO THANG."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a very good album with top music","review":"Brandy is still very young. It's amazing what she already have done in her young life.

Go on with this Brandy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think the new CD is great.","review":"Brandy's new CD is the best one ever. I like the way she included Monica in,\\"That boy is mine.\\" I think they should do more duets together a lot more often. Way to bring the n****z out in check girl!! Two thumbs up on that video!!! P.S. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the first album","review":"The single, On top of the World is slamming. The music is very moving. Makes me want to party."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brandy's Best CD....so far","review":"No doubt, this is Brandy's BEST CD ever. This cd still gets played by me and others I know. Granted, Brandy is not the strongest vocalist but she does have a tone and a style of singing that will knock anybody out. Beyonce could learn a thing or two from Brandy on how to CONTROL your vocals. The best songs on this cd are \\"Angel In Disguise\\", \\"Almost Doesn't Count\\", \\"Never Say Never\\" and \\"Tommorrow\\". She even does a fine job on Bryan Adam's classic \\"(Everything I Do) I Do It For You\\". I hope Brandy's new cd is better than this one. If not, I will continue to play this one/"},{"rating":"2","title":"BRANDY'S NEW JOINT IS THE SURPRISE OF THE SEASON!","review":"Despite the fact that her voice lacks the maturity and soulfulness of Monica, the material on this album is far better than the bubblegum stuff on the last album. \\"Top of the World\\" feat. Bad Boy's Mason Betha and \\"Happy\\" both crank. Slow jams like \\"Learn the hard Way\\" and \\"Put that on Everything\\" reveal that Brandy can handle more mature writing. For the most part, this album was produced by the Darkchild team who is responsible for Mary J. Blige's \\"I Can Love You\\" and \\"Share My World\\". Don't sleep on Brandy this time, it's was well worth my thirteen dollars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the hype??","review":"Brandy is not that great of a singer to be crowned 'diva'.Not by a LONG SHOT!! she is an average singer AT BEST, and if the music & production weren't good, this Cd would be in the bargain bin NOW.Some of the songs are Ok, but you get tired of Brandy's voice cracking & not holding notes.I prefer Monica and Faith for the 'future of R&B' over Brandy and Mary J.Blige.Brandy, your tired smile will only carry your career SO far.Please go back to TV, and get a new hairdo!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this CD!","review":"I had this CD back in the 90s; when I was in middle school. I haven't been able to find it anywhere and then I looked it up on amazon and boom there it was! This is a must have for any true brandy fan and even if you're not it's still a very good CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her best (so far).","review":"This is a classic and unbeaten by many of the fake R&B (female) artists out there. It was as if she was singing from the depths. She has a voice and talent that is lacking in music nowadays. Hopefully her next album, out on 12.9.2008, will do her justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album, 1 of my favorites!!!!","review":"This album takes you on a roller coaster! Many of the songs are beautifully written and tug at the heart strings! There are also great beats. This is one of my all time favorites!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW..this album takes me back!!!","review":"In my opinion it is NOT one bad song on this cd,i love em all.This has to be her best album!It feels good to just put this cd in and let it play!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Say Never. Right.","review":"I really don't care for this. I bought it, thinking I'd love it cuz I loved her first CD. I only like \\"The Boy is Mine\\" (cuz Monica's in it) and \\"Sittin' on top of the World\\". Don't waste your money. (By the way, I really hat that song \\"Have You Ever\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHE CAN'T SING!!!!!","review":"First of all, I don't understand how she got this far in the first place. It must be who you know and how much money you got. I found it totally disrespectful that she would even compare her coarse congested voice to that of Whitney Houston's. For the love of humanity, stop singing. Big ups to her song writers and music producers who managed to at least allow you to enjoy the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd makes me wanna hurl","review":"It sounds like there's something stuck in her throat. I don't think she could ever compare with any of the really talented artists. The only way she made it this far is because she has connection with other people and alot of money. I know she can afford to get a new hair style. I heard she is pregnant."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is horrible, and T Murder says so...","review":"My pops, T Murder whopped me upside the head when he heard I had this CD. He told me I needed to get down with L.L. Cool J. That is where it's at. Come on, do you see a song on here that even comes close to Milky Cereal? I belive you don't , and T Murder says so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ooh, this could be better!!!","review":"I like the song(s) One Voice & The Boy is Mine. That's it. She really can't sing, even though she thinks she can. Also, all the songs sound the same. You really can't tell when she switches tracks. And, the introductions are pathetic, at best!!! If you like the song \\"The Boy is Mine\\", I would strongly recomend the purchase of Monica's album instead. It's MUCH better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does she stay?!?!?!","review":"Brandy's new album, doesnt even compete with Monica's \\"THe Boy is Mine\\", who proved that the boy is hers. Brandy's nasal, stuffed nose vocals needs strengthning and a lot of work. We all know who is the real star of the family and that is her brother Ray-J. If Brandy would stay away from the entertainment idustry for the whole year of 1999, it would do the world some good."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S GREEEEEAAAAAT","review":"I like THE BOY IS MINE. GO BRANDY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! okay it's true,I need a sycyatrist"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's GREAT!!","review":"To Brandy, I think that yours cd \\"Never-Say -Never\\" is a very nice one, and I really like all of them. Most of all my favorite song is Put That On Everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with your day-job (acting)!!","review":"Brandy, I don't mean to hate on you boo,but you haft to know in order for you to sing there has to be a vocal range something to compensate this album as a whole. I think the \\"RADIO READY\\" (Top of the World, Angel in Desguise) tracks are just that radio ready, you show no emotion or issues in your songs. On the other hand your acting ability is amazing I support every thing you do in that respect. In your first album you really took the door of the henge. I wanna be down and broken-hearted were my favorites. But I think that Monica is a more GOD-Given talent than you are and that should be evident even though you are marketed better than Monica."},{"rating":"1","title":"it is alright","review":"I am not a Brandy fan but, I am not goin to bad mouth her. I think you should but Monica's album instead. This is alright but, it is not as real life and meaningful as Monica's CD. But it was not as bad as I thought it would be. Bye it if you want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brandy Does It Again!!!","review":"I just picked up the new Brandy cd, Never Say Never. And i must say i am plesantly surprised at Brandy's latest musical offering. I will admit in the beginning i listened to the project with a critical ear. But the music is good through the whole cd. her lyrics have mutured with her also.The only problem i have with it,is she does not open her mouth to sing on a regular basis, like she does on songs like Have you ever,One voice, and the emotionally ballad, Tomorrow. Her producers Rodney and Fred Jerkins really deserve a lot of credit for the music, If nothing else this will go down as one of their best musical projects. As much as I respect Monica, her cd lacks the consistant flow of good tracks that the Jerkin's brothers have done for Brandy.even though Brandy's voice is not as talented as Monica's,Brandy work's with what she has."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to write home about","review":"I believe that we would be able to enjoy Brandy's music better if we were able to hear what she's saying. Her voice is still pretty, but I couldn't understand the lyrics, so I got frustrated because when I spend money to hear a CD, I expect to understand what you're talking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD was one of her bests","review":"Brandy is a great singer,and she is the best.This CD just proves how great she is.brandy said in a interview that i was watching'' Most people said when I started that I wouldn't make it in the music business.''But if you ask me this CD and many others have said a diffrent phrase.This CD if you ask me was the greatest CD she has made.But of course we can't forget the others that were in it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd rather Brandy than Monica.","review":"Brandy is a great singer and I really love her CD. My favorite song is \\"One Voice\\". I hope she continues singing. Monica can sing, but she doesn't sing from the heart like Brandy does. Good Luck to her and I hope she has great success in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"PUT THAT ON EVERYTHING!!!","review":"I can truly say Brandy is my girl. \\"Never Say Never\\" is one of the best CDs I've bought. Anytime you can listen to an album from the first to last track without skipping around, you know you got a banging cd. And I can't say I like it just because it's Brandy, I mean I am really feeling her songs. The words are so real to me, and when I sing the lyrics I feel like I'm singing about my love life experiences. Ladies if you have ever messed with a half-stepping guy, \\"Almost Doesn't Count\\" is the truth from the first to last words of the song. The beats used in Angel in Disguise, You Don't Know Me, Never Say Never and Learn the Hard Way are so nice that you have to give her hitmaking team big props. I think every girl can relate to \\"Have You Ever\\" and \\"Put That On Everything\\" is my song!!! Go buy this album, you WILL get your money's worth, and you can PUT THAT ON EVERYTHING."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never S-A-Y Never!","review":"OMG! I really love Brandy's album \\"Never S-A-Y Never\\". I can't believe that after 11 years from its lunch I was able to buy it. Thank you Brandy for such an amazing album. It's a classic. My favourite songs are:1. Almost Doesn't Count2. The Boy is Mine (Duet with Monica)3. Have You Ever?4. Top of the World Feat. Mase5.

A great game if you are able to lift yourself out of a hack and slash mentality."},{"rating":"2","title":"What if Aliens were demons?","review":"The notion that any visitors from outerspace that may show up, may be demons is not unique. Many Christians--especially evangelicals--have posited this view for decades. Robert Don Hughes is the first I have seen to take the view and weave it into an entertaining spiritual sci-fi thriller. He gives us time travel, a teen from a truly dysfunctional family, the tension of lost love ones (yes, Dorothy ALWAYS wants to go home!), and some very creative approaches as to how demons operate--sort of like most human governments.At times the interplay between characters, and the inner musings of the protaganist seem a bit stiff. Nevertheless, this is an intelligent and unique approach to the theory that UFOs are evil supernatural beings.Bottom-line: This book is well worth the bargain price that used-book vendors are selling it for here. Buy and enjoy--I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book abducted me","review":"I was really amazed to see this book, and it's sequel, the Eternity Gene, were written by my professor from seminary.

No CD with book, but you don't need one since code is as advertized, for idiots.

After years of enduring boring illustrations of folks in proper \\"biblical\\" clothes calmly standing by as animals filed silently onto a rectangular ark, the story was made completely new to me by this lovely book. Nothing here is typical.There's a sense of urgency to the paintings, and the dark clouds lower as the family, bundled in Eastern European-looking clothes, hurries onto the boat. In one painting, the wind whips around unicorn galloping by. A faun hurries through the rain, looking for shelter. It's unexpected little details like these that make Zwerger's art so dear, and make the story of Noah's ark not just one of those old tales, but something alive and intriguing."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNA LARGA ESPERA PERO VALIO L A PENA.","review":"Sigo a juan carlos desde moenia hasta hoy y tengo que confesarlo excelente que son los dos albumes de morbo el primero llamadomorbo rompio a mi criterio con los esquemas de la musica rock sipodria llamar o rock electronico recuerdo que juan carlos deciaque queria agregar nuevos sonidos a la musica que normalmentehacia (no solamente teclados)con la adicion de bateria,guitarra y bajo lo logro 100% para este album ahora si no creen miren loque opinan las otras personas del primer album asi que compraloy te digo lo van a disfrutar.de este nuevo electroguitarpop largo el nombre igual que la espera pero 100% tambien solamentehay que escuchar este encanto esta de lo mejor y gracias a diosque el y yamil rezc estan juntos trabanjo son un duo a mi opinion de lo mejor.asi que compren este album tambien y los que no han salido porque siempre seran mejores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"These straps are junk.

Not only did they leave in more clips of Japanese music, which was disappointing not to hear, but there were very little cuts. One thing that Pioneer confuses me about is the fact that they take out a scene where Serena spanks Rini to wake her up, yet the violent scenes remained. Sheesh, are they looking for more reasons to get people to buy their DVD?Anyways, this story had a good plot, and I was glad to see Terri Hawkes return as Sailor Moon before she had to leave on pregnancy. I hope to see you soon in the upcoming episodes, Terri!As for the new additions, Diana's voice didn't bother me that much, just a little bit too high pitched. But this movie had a good plot, and had a good finish, too!So, for those who absolutely hate the dub, I think you should stop wasting your time trying to find bad reviews for this movie. This movie was awesome, and I can't wait to get my hands on the sub!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I actually think it's better than Hearts in Ice!","review":"This movie is better than Hearts in Ice!!! It is now my favorite Sailor Moon movie. 1 thing: If you scroll down the movie case (on this website) It'll say it's PG-13!!!! It's not rated! On the back it said it's recommended for ages 5 and up (I doubt it because when I saw Sailor Moon Pegasus collection #3, Fish-Eye(part of the Amazon Trio)was in a dressing room with this ugly guy and the suit she was wearing had needles in it so she tore it off (YUCK!!!)!!!!) The only bad part I see in this movie for little kids is when that one lady made Mini Moon go into the dream hole and she was naked (YUCK!!!)!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than it's been credited","review":"I've noticed a lot of these reviews on SMSuperS saying that this movie isn't so great. Their entitled to their opinions, but so am I and I don't think they took a close enough lok at this movie. Yes, the plot is a little childish, but it can keep everyone interested, especially if you're a Chibi-Usa fan. The comment about being an adult from Sailor Neptune, is definately one, only older audiences would get (it's pretty funny, you'll like it). It does have all the Senshi except Saturn, and the starlights, and the animation is great, much better than the previous two movies. True, SMS was the best movie, but they are all fantastic, well thought out, and humorous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Good As Others....","review":"Well, what can I say? This movie isn't terrible, its just no where near as good as any of the other Sailor Moon movies are. Also making this movie worse than it already was, were the American VAs. I enjoyed Terri Hawkes as Sailormoon, and the inner senshi's voices were alright. However, the outer senshi's voices were terrible. Michiru's voice was DEEPER than Haruka's?! And Sestuna's voice totally lacked ANY expression whatsoever, and was quite annoying. Other than that, it was a cute movie that I think younger kids would enjoy. If you are able, buy the subtitled version. Trust me, it is trully amazing what having good VAs can do for a movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh wow!","review":"Did you know that SailorMoon is one of the most popular anime in Japan? Japanese animation artists take a lot of time drawing and making effects and graphics for these movies. They also dubbed the original versions just so that people who don't understand Japanese can see them. However some people in the United States don't understand some of the stuff they show and they call it perverted. Well, I can tell you that there is practically nothing in this movie that will make you jump to these conclusions. This movie is pure entertainment as far as movies go for me. It's nothing that a firsttime viewer couldn't understand, and it's appropriate for basically anyone over the age of 10. It's a great story about the Black Dream Hole trying to capture innocent dreamers so that they can have dreams that are just what they want. If you're a total sailormoon fan, then you can't miss out on this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A So-So Movie","review":"While not the best Dubbed anime I've seen, I have to give this movie a four because it has splendid animation, and an interesting plot. Not much character developement (for two reasons: one, how much developement can one expect from an hour-long movie, and, two, the director probably assumed you had followed the series), and, if you haven't seen this in the subtitled version, this video is a definate buy. If you HAVE seen the sudtitled one, or if you are an older view and can read fairly quickly, I would recommend the subbed version. This version is a bit dissapointing when it comes to the slight change in the story (Lita's recollection of the three o'clock fairy/Monday). Over all, however, this movie is a fairly decent piece of anime, and is good for hard-core collectors and newbies alike"},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay movie, not as good as R and S though.","review":"It's got a werird plot but I just like seeing all the new attacks, transformations, and the other 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good........","review":"This movie was great!

If you aren't sure, don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't fall into the \\"Black Dream Hole\\"","review":"I am very sorry for my poor rating that I give this movie, but in my opinion, it is the worst of all three Sailor Moon movies. Most importantly of all, Black Dream Hole doesn't even come close to comparing with Sailor Moon R-Promise of the Rose.First of all, the beginning is a little stale, and the plotline wasn't thought out very well.I also didn't like Rini's voice in the dub, (which was different from the series), and it was irritating me throughout the entire movie.Another thing I wasn't fond of was the relationship between Rini and the fairy-boy that she met, Peruru. I'm a Helios-Rini fan myself and it was frustrating that Rini already discovered a new infatuation...There are many, many other things that I found wrong with this movie, but I'll make a long list short and say that you should definitely not see this movie, no matter how big of a Sailor Moon fan you are..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"This was the worst Sailor Moon movie I've ever seen. The plot needed alot of work. They need better charictor's. And didn't the acting seem a little bad after all the better acting job's they did with the last movie's? I won't be buying the dubbed version of this movie because if Pionear can mess up the best of the movies (Sailor Moon R) they will make a mistake with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"it was pretty bad","review":"they say its aimed at kids, theres bad words in it! the captions arre hard to read"},{"rating":"1","title":"This moive bits","review":"This moive bits majorly. I hate it, of corse Mini Moon is one of my least favorite characthers, & that is who is moive is all about. Mini Moon this & Mini Moon that. Also I hate the voices they gave the outers. Uranus is high & squeaky, the total oppisite to the t.v. show. The plot line was ok, but the way the did it was bad. It was all Mini Moon. They chould have given some of the otheer Sailors more imortant roles. I just hate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"sigh........","review":"Another messed up sailormoon movie. This wasn't the best but the dub will be worse. The true Sailormoon will be lost and dub will take over. Usagi will fade away and Serena, the retarded valley girl, will take over. Horrible lines willl be added, and cute lines will be left out. We'll here the awful voices, and messed attacks. Get the subtitled version and keep the TRUE sailormoon living."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitty's reveiw","review":"this vidio was very good.It was just about as good as the subtitled addition.It's very close to a strang version of the pidepipper.

It is better than Sailor Moon S: Hearts in Ice, but not as good as Sailor Moon R: Promise of the Rose. I would definatly recomend buying it or borrowing it from someone you know!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Sailor Moon fans, especially the younger Ones","review":"In the American version, Rini *really* would drive me nuts, no matter how cute she looked. She was just a brat. In this movie, however, you see a LOT of her sweetness and redeeming features. Especially how much she actually loves Serena, even though she tries to hide it a lot. Anyway...with Rini being the central character here this movie is more for little kids, especially since I felt that there were some plot gaps which Sailor Moon R and S didn't make - they were much more smooth. I also felt that you needed to know more of the original anime in order to understand this movie. Otherwise, when Neptune, Pluto and Uranus show up with their scanty parts (I wish they had gotten more screen time and lines) you have NO CLUE who they are. Possibly the worst movie for people in America to get, since we haven't gotten Cartoon Network to air the rest of the Sailor Moon series as of yet, so we've never gotten to know Neptune, Pluto and Uranus."},{"rating":"2","title":"My First Sailor Moon Movie Ever...","review":"I just rented this movie from the local video store and I sat down and watched it. It was the first Sailor Moon movie I'd ever seen-and I think I will be renting the other ones too. One day I went to my cousin's house and we went to a Graphics site on the internet. My cousin(Who hates Sailor Moon) heard the song playing on the site, and he said it sounded like Sailor Moon. Then and there I remembered the show. It had been so long that I had seen it that I forgot all about it. I really like the theme song to the popular tv show so I eventually got hooked to it. I started drawing pictures of Sailor Moon a lot and I just reanted the movie to see what it was about. I would recomend this movie to kids 7 and up because sometimes I think that little kids might not understand the concept and plot of the movie. It can be confusing, but now that I watched it it seemed babyish. But this movie is still very fun to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every time U see this movie you just got to have a cookie!","review":"This movie is very funny you must see it and I like that the anime is more colorful than in the R or S movie this movie is not the best of the 3 but it had its moments I wish Uranus and Neptune had more lines and that the movie was a littel longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"What happened here! the subbed was so good! Everyline was changed in the dub. And the best parts were cut. This movie was brought down to a kindergarden level. the subbed version was a lot darker, and cool. three o'clock monday was originally three o'clock ferry. Get the japanese version. C'mon, the japanese created it. With out it, there would be no Sailormoon! Watch Naoko Takeuchi work, not Pioneer's cut up work. This movie was so chezzy dubbed! Diana's voice sounds like an old lady, when in the japanese version, she has a cute voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"SMSuperS - DVD version","review":"Well, this is the last of the salior moon movies to be released and I must say that I am impressed. The DVD features kept getting better and better with its offerings.There are some things I liked and things that I didn't like. The one thing that almost threw me off was the original voice actors coming on this DVD. Having become accustomed to the new dubbed voices on SMS the TV series, was a welcomed comfort.Still hated the shrill voice of Pluto and the high voice of Uranus, but given this was made last year, I can take some comfort in saying that the dubbed voices in the series got a little better.This is the best version that is out there. For purists who can't stand dubbed voices, here's the subbed version. For those who love dubbed voices, here's the dubbed version on the same DVD. Plus you get to compare the two.So, buy the DVD version."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most AWESOME OF THEM ALL!","review":"I just luvved it! This Sailormoon movie was the best one out of all the Super S movies and the shows! It really touched me to see the sensitivaty of all the Sailor scouts towards Reni and Sailor Moon!

With adorable characters and good storyline, as well as having everyone's favorite Senshi, I would highly recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sailor Moon R was better....","review":"Eh.. Me and my friends saw it and it was ok... there was no real plot (well there was, but it was pretty pointless) It's kind of like Little Nemo...in some weird way. The best part was probably when the outers came to help the inners. and when Chibi Usa gives Perutu a kiss at the end :) that was cute. Perutu or whatever has cool wings at the end! (is it just me or does he kind of resemble Helios in his human form?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great movie","review":"This movie is usually dubbed the worst, but I like it...it's quite kawaii and it has one of those plots that makes you think. The Queen wants to make everyone asleep so the world will be perfect and everyone will have beutiful dreams. It comes down to a question of ethics. I also luv the song \\"Sangi no Youse\\" I've actually learned how to play it on my saxaphone and I march around playing it with my friends acting like hypontised kids. I've taught like half my band to play it too...(I have no life)"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"for christmas i asked for the subtitled version of the sailormoon super S movie... but i ended up getting the dub. i already have the R and S movie in subtitles and I have seen all of sailor stars in subtitles... now i have not even seen the japanese version of this movie and i know that it must be sooo much better than the english. for one, noticeable cuts were in the english... rini( chibiusa) wakes up just from sailormoon holding her. i am pretty sure they cut something from that part. and when the sailor senshi lose their powers suddenly they just disappear from the movie? plus the same old music kept repeating over and over and that ruins everything... plus the japanese intro was replaced by a lame english opening. i have to admit the dubbing was ok even though they changed all the conversations, i wouldn't have minded the dub if they left in the original japanese BGM, the intro and the scenes they cut out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freaking Hilarious!","review":"Being a SM fan for 2 years, I decided to buy this movie subtitled instead of waiting for it to be dubbed, having been annoyed with the series dubbing. That was a good choice on my part, because it is just so funny! There is this one part(not a spoiler, just funny!) where Usagi is sleeping, but she is hanging off of her bad drooling. She is dreaming about Mamo-chan, and all of a sudden this ridiculous laugh escapses her mouth and she says something along the lines of--Mamo-chan, do you love me?--Then Diana yells in her ear a couple times to wake her up, and she falls off the bed wailing! I got a kick out of that. THe story is really cute, and you get to see Pluot, Uranus, and Neptune. And a very cute faerie.Chibi-Moon is so cute in this one too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Dubbed Movie","review":"I really liked the dub for this movie even though sailor mini moon is a bit retarded for the english world i still think they should've kept chibi moon. The music is good and the voices are a bit awkward for the outer senshi. But overall a great movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kawaii! Can't get that song outta my head!","review":"Okay, this is the only Sailor Moon movie I've seen, and a lot of people say it's the worst, but I absolutly adore it! I haven't actually seen Pioneer's version(I borrowed my friend's old old one), but if it's anything like their other translations, it's wonderful! The 3'O Clock Fairy song is downright infectious and all the grumps who shudder as it plays need to remember childhood a bit better. ^_- The appereance of Pluto, Uranus, and Neptune literally made me fall out of my chair(it was the first time seeing them on tape!), and squeal with delight. I'm not sure if Pioneer translated the breif humor between Neptune and Uranus, but if they did.. parents shouldn't worry. I'm almost certain it would go over most children's heads. All in all, this movie kept me laughing as the jokes just kept coming. Anyone familiar with only the DiC dub should definatly get this-and the other two-Sailor Moon movies. Everything(especially the voices) is so much better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sailor Moon reigns supreme over ALL anime!","review":"This movie was incredible! The animation is even better than the series (which has great animation to begin with), the subtitles are good (you can read them), and IT'S SAILOR MOON!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes!","review":"Words of warning to all Sailor Moon fans; do not watch the subtitled edition of this movie before watching this one! Truly, DiC has hacked this story apart. I bought the S-T'ed one first, since I really wanted to see this, and I absolutely loved it. For Christmas this year, I recieved the dubbed version of it, and I nearly died while watching! So much is lost in the translation! They cut out a part where Usagi spanks Chibi-Usa, (she raises her hand to hit her, and magically she awakens), and the baking part in the beginning just didn't make sense anymore. Do yourself a favor and get the S-T'ed one, not the dubbed. Unless, of course, you collect them like me and/or just want to hurl dull objects at your TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sailor moon rocks!!","review":"This video was great, I absolutely loved it! Sailor moon is great and even better in the version it was originally presented! Because of the age of the average veiwer a lot of the story line was changed, and you get the benefit of seeing it as it was made in this great movie. Rini falls in love again <It makes all those who saw the super S series on tv wonder what ever happened to pegasus> with a great ending scene! And my personal favorite line in the whole movie when Serena gives her future husband, Derien, her cookies... \\"Eh, Kookie-ka?\\" (what cookies?). This movie makes a great addition for any sailor moon collector."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peruru looks like Helios!","review":"I recently bought this movie and I think it's pretty cool. The fact that Peruru looks like Helios (from the manga) is kinda disturbing. Even so, I really like this movie and since I don't have access to watching the japanese Sailor Moon episdoes, it was my first time seeing the outer senshi \\"in action\\". I suggest that if you've got the money, buy this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected!","review":"After reading all the reviews, I can say I wasn't looking forward to viewing this movie. The third of the movies, it may not be as tear jerking or have such a deep plot or good fighting scenes. but one thing this one does have is humor. A lot of it. And Sailor Moon humor is something I live for. It does have one crude little joke from Neptune to Uranus, which is utterly hilarious if you know that whole story. If you are looking for the same thing you got in the other movies, a better plot or fighting sequence, this may not be for you. but if you like a bit of everything and a surplus of funny jokes, this is the way. It includes all the senshi, even Diana (Luna and Artemis's daughter from the future), except Hotaru (Sailor Saturn) and Chibichibi. I really liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"this vidio was great! everyone should get it! the BEST attacks are in this vidio. if you haven't seen this one your crazy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for seasoned fans","review":"This movie really tries to emphasize on relationships and understandings between characters more than the tv episodes. Emotional coaster ride, but a great one at that. Word of warning for the parents out there; Neptune and Uranus are casted to be life partners. It may not be obvious in the movie, but in the tv series Sailor Moon S, this is very evident, and the movie assumes that one knows of their past histories. Other than that little disclaimer there, it's definitely one to watch :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink Sugary Goodness!","review":"This is a REALLY CUTE movie! The animation is gorgeous! Much better than both the R movie and S movie combined! But why didn't Super Sailor Chibimoon use Twinkle Yell? I guess it was because Helios wasn't there anymore. And the Outer Senshi are in it! :D Well, everyone except Saturn. But I don't suggest this movie to anyone under the age of 10 or 11. Also, don't get this movie unless you've seen more than just the DiC dubbed version.

I have seen all three and I really can't choose which one I like the best, they're all wonderful. I love all the little scenes of the Senshi (scouts) as children, as well as the little baking cookies scene in the beginning. Lots of scenes with my fave senshi, Makoto (Lita). I recommend this, as well as the R and S movies, wholeheartedly. Go and get them!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sailor Moon SuperS is Majorly Cool!","review":"In this movie Chibi-Usa meets a 3-O'Clock fairy and finds out that she really liked him.

Chibi-Usa Meets Peruru a fairy and becomes friends with him. It features a few outer senshi such as Sailor Pluto, Sailor Neptune, AND Sailor Uranus. Sailor Moon and Sailor Chibi-Moon use their transformation together and it is really cool.

Of course, there is an English version, but the dialogue and voices are so screwed up I can't stand to watch it for more than 5 seconds.

She gives a lot of support to Serena. But this movie does focus mainly around her, which makes it interesting because we can see more of her than usual, but makes it less because we don't want to see something about a 5 year old kid. And it is kid-based, with pide-piper theme and all, but it's still good. Usagi's (Serena, by the time you finish watching all three, you'll be calling them by their real names too!) is very emotional in this one with Chibi-Usa (Rini) and we finally get to see the Outer Senshi/Scouts! (You see'em in the S movie, too!) But it does lack Saturn, the one I want to see the most. But it's so moving, this movie, and we also get to see the Scouts in their \\"Super\\" forms and their new powers, which are good. Get this movie if you want to see the Sailors in their new forms, and the Outer Scouts, too.

A picture is worth a thousand words, no ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost","review":"I was immediately turned off by the writing style used by the author, the unexplained jargon, and the constantly shifting references to places with geologic features of interest.

I am thrilled with the material on James Hutton which inspired me to explore some of Hegel's Encyclopedia on Geology to find elements of Hutton's work there. Not only did Hutton inspire Darwin, as McPhee says that Darwin says, but I am now going to explore further how Hutton might have influenced the Germans -- I have to check Goethe next. (If any one has already done this sort of exploration let me know!) I also really enjoyed page 88 since for some reason I felt as I read the page that I knew it by heart already!

I've used her suggested questions verbatim in counseling sessions and in groups, and have seen the lights come on when someone discovers that they have been acting from fears and beliefs that they weren't even aware of. The \\"miracle,\\" of this method is, they don't just gain insight, but that they are able to move forward in new and more fulfilling ways immediately.

Again, another band from long days past (that thanks to the Internet) I've been able to access at least some of their vintage works. Tunes here that I got the most out of were \\"Witchwood\\", the indepth \\"Thirty Days\\", \\"The Hangman And The Papist\\", \\"Cannondale\\" and \\"In Amongst The Roses\\". I've heard a couple of patrons comment that this CD reissue does, in fact do the 'original' lp a lot of justice. I consider The Strawbs to be like - part British progressive, part art rock. What mainly led me to this CD was the fact that I discovered this was Rick Wakeman's pre-Yes band. A good pick."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine and classic recording","review":"I first heard of the Strawbs some 12 years ago, but was never able to find their recordings until the release of the \\"Halcyon Days\\" anthology; listening to it, I found my appetite for this band's music whetted with a vengeance. As soon as I knew that A&M had reissued their LPs from 1970-75 on CD, I knew that this would have to be one of those that I purchased. And I'm happy to say I did not regret the decision to do so; \\"Witchwood\\" is a classic from start to finish. The title cut is a haunting cautionary tale that features Rick Wakeman on clarinet (!), \\"The Hangman and the Papist\\" an angry diatribe against religious persecution that never fails to bring tears to my eyes, and \\"Thirty Days\\" a fine, breezy little piece featuring sitar that has stayed with me since hearing the CD.

The story is like a bad romance novel - very predictable and stereotypical. I didn't really like any of the characters, and the author seemed to be trying too hard to squeeze in too much stuff - the wonders and selflessness of volunteering, the Hollywood scene, and way too many mental health troubles. Sheesh. I had hopes as I neared the end that something might happen to wrap everything up, but no. It would have been more surprising and interesting if the reporter hadn't fallen in love with the celebrity, or if something had come of the chief of staff's shenanigans.

Set in the '50s, she is unfairly judged by her friends and neighbors, who can't accept her sense of responsibility for this gentle, young man. The drifter takes an interest in the older son, and all kinds of rumors fly around about his past life as a promising big-leaguer, who suddenly disappeared one day. When her youngest son is diagnosed with a life-threatening illness, the drifter and his companion dog take the boy on a flight of fantasy, and he is suddenly cured. The ending is a sad life lesson that I won't give away, other than stating that we should always keep our hearts and our minds open to all possibilities -- even when we become jaded with life as adults. Great melodramatic romance with a plot and a moral at the end; a must-see if you are a Swayze fan or just a hopeless romantic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Family Entertainment","review":"Finally, a film that can be enjoyed with the entire family present.

Stone Raiders is the best Hill record of them all; they have developed such a dope style over the years, and this is so apparent in the songs on this cd.CH has always been about the hardcore style, and they have added the rock element to the mix in recent years. However, the production is still hip hop as is B Real's flow, and that to me is keeping it real but adding another phat element to the package. These guys just can't make a bad song.The whole album flows from one track to the next...not something you can say about many groups out there.

Don't get the VHS edition if you're looking for a good quality picture. I only tolerate EP from tapes I record myself off of TV, not when I pay money expecting professional quality footage.

I think that, having read Mary Renault's The Persian Boy, it will be hard for me to really enjoy any narrative retelling of Alexander's conquests. That said, this is a great attempt, I'm not surprised that it was an international bestseller, but...a lot of the major issues were avoided or brushed over: Alexander's bisexuality, the murder of his father, the speculation over the cause of his death, etc. I would highly recommend this trilogy for someone interested in ancient history, but a well-researched biography would certainly be of more use to a scholar.

Plus a whole host of other excellent material.Sure, it could be claimed that some of this would of worked better as a visual release, after all seeing Graham Chapman wrestle himself is far funnier than just hearing John Cleese commentate on it, but as an early live document of this hugely influential comedy troupe it's hard to find too many major faults with this, and given it is the earliest official live recording it has some historical value as well.One of my rare full five stars.

(This is my fourth set of king-sized. I've worn out two sets over the past five years; I paid close to $100 for each of those sets at one of the big box linen stores. So, I bought a replacement set a month ago and decided, at this price, it would be criminal not to buy another one.) They are sooooooooooo soft and cozy. If you live in the south, they are an excellent substitute for flannel sheets which I have found to be far too warm. For those in colder climates, these are excellent for the in-between times when flannel is too heavy and regular woven sheets are too light. These sheets wear well; I do suggest you dry them on low heat for about an hour to avoid excess shrinkage. If you have an oversized mattress, you may want to reinforce the seams on the fitted bottom sheet.

I've always been under the impression that all-cotton sheets were less likely to pill. Does this not apply to jersey sheets, or are these just bad sheets? I have to wonder now that I'm starting to see them at discount outlet stores for even less than what I paid during Amazon's Friday Sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'S NOT THAT SOFT","review":"This sheet set is described as like a \\"t-shirt and slightly stretchy.\\" It's true, but I don't know if that's a good thing.

I figured that after the course - bingo, I could go out into the forest and identify everything. Not. I have been unable to identify a single tree. I do admit that my initial expectation was a terribly naive idea, and that as a novice tree identifier I need additional assistance, practice, and time to understand the subtlety of terms, and to learn how to effectively utilize the keys provided. After I get a little better at this I may return and update the review. But buyer beware - it is not a trivial process to use these keys effectively especially to identify tall trees whose bud scars may not be reachable. And as others have pointed out information about bark would have been a definite plus if it had been included."},{"rating":"1","title":"needs photos","review":"I've been very happy with other Peterson field guides, but this book doesn't have any photographs.

I also ordered Dear Prince Charming and have only gotten a quarter of the way into it, it has been sitting unread for ten days; which is totally unlike me since I love to read. I would recommend borrowing this book from a friend if instead of purchasing it. Save yourself a few hard earned dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative & Boring","review":"Kauffman borrows the premise of SEX IN THE CITY, with Tanzy a sex columnist representing Carrie, who has a similar cast of friends she confides in at regular intervals. Seems a steal, lack of her own ideas, and the book is just dull. The conflict is between independent Tanzy and a private investigator hired as her bodyguard--how many times has this situation been milked in contemporary romance? She likes men who are \\"wolves\\" hot sexually and easily disposable [don't a lot of women wish for this some of the time?] and the PI, a real wolf, of course, wearing sheep's clothing to avoid involvement with the man-eating Tanzy. The rest of the book is He Said, She Said, in which they blather about why she can't go for a sheep, he can't go for the tough and promiscuous Tanzy. Each time they say the same things over and over. Ho hum. Waste of paper and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful prose","review":"I had thought this would be a nice light summer read, but I could barely get through it, and ended up wishing I hadn't wasted my time. As other reviewers have mentioned, the story was totally implausible (the mystery aspect in particular), which I could have overlooked if the writing weren't so cringe-inducingly awful. This could have been a fun read if it had some good editing. If you don't mind repeatedly being hit over the head with the story points, repetitive language (lots of \\"fierce\\" looks), and trite one-liners (at least two characters were suffering from \\"MSS: Martha Stewart Syndrome\\"), this might be the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Going on my keeper shelf","review":"Ms. Kauffman just keeps getting better and better. This is a book for all of those who feel like they should be reading Bridget Jones type stuff, but want a good old romance. I found Tanzy to be a well-developed character, flaws and all, and Riley was just great as a wolf in sheep's clothing. The secondary characters spice up the tale without distracting from Tanzy and Riley. I'm really looking forward to more books by Donna Kauffman!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible ending","review":"The main character was cool, the romance was ok, but the suspense plot climax where the identity of the stalker is revealed was predictable, pathetic and small minded. Even a bit bigoted. I can't believe Janet Evanovich blurbed this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kauffman delivers again","review":"Great, hot sexy fun. Donna Kauffman is a find. I'm off to order Cinderella Rules ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brace your inner wolf!","review":"Tanzy (where do they come up with these names??) is a columnist of an on-live sex advice column. She is cynical and categorizes men into two groups - wolves and sheep's. She is a love \`em and leave \`em gal - more like a guy, and finds that she is only attracted to fellow wolves. She has contempt for those that want the happily ever after, and thus manages to attract the attention of a stalker named SoulM8te.When her elderly aunt asks her to housesit, she comes face to face with a sheep that she actually finds herself drawn to. Riley Parrish is no ordinary sheep - more like a wolf in sheep's clothing. He was hired by auntie to protect her and investigate the stalker, and decides the ultimate way to do so is to hide behind a disguise.Full of humorous situations and plenty of innuendo to keep you attention, this one is a great read, and you will find yourself getting caught up in Tanzy's rollercoaster ride as she opens herself up to new possibilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm in 75 pages and already can't stand the guy","review":"I came downstairs to my computer in the wee hours to see if any Amazon reviewers say this book is going to get better. The Riley guy seems boring as s**t, and I'm already thinking he's a dweeb. Now that I've read the other reviews, I think I'll skip ahead and see where the heck this thing is going. If anywhere.Glad I flushed almost seven bucks down the toidee."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck, could not even get through to the end!","review":"I had struggled through 276 pages, and i finally just had to put it down, i did not like any of the characters, i did not care about the stalker, i did not care if Tanzy got hurt, kidnapped or anything! It was painful! i kept hoping it would turn out okay, but it was just terrible. I never put a book down without getting to the end, but in this case, i could not take any more of them! Very dissapointed in this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh. Easy to put down","review":"I am not one to leave books unfinished, so I plowed ahead with this one, but it would have been easy to walk away from this \\"Sex in the City\\" meets \\"Nancy Drew\\" groaner at any point in this thin plot. It very much reminded me of the dinky paperbacks I loved as a preteen, where the heroine always had an adventure of some sort and then reluctantly fell for the last guy she would have expected. The book borrows heavily from the character set-up of Sex in the City (although projecting the supporting characters down the altar) without the finesse -- I lost track of how many times the phrase \\"multiple orgasm\\" is used (the pursuit of which might be considered the theme of the book). If you want fluff, you'd be better off in front of the tube. If you want a thoughful, sexy, well-paced novel: you'll have to keep looking. How I wish I had!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun easy book","review":"Although The Big Bad Wolf Tells All is not what a would call a literary novel, it was a fun and easy book to read that would be perfect for a day at the beach.Tanzy never needed a man to make her feel safe and secure and she certainly never wanted to be in a relationship but life has unexpected surprises.When Tanzy is threatened by an obsessed fan, she goes to live in her aunts house where unknown to her, is her body guard, Riley. To Tanzy, Riley is a sheep meaning that he is the marrying kind of man but she sees glimpses of a wolf. The type of man that is good for one thing, and one thing only and its not marriage. While Riley is protecting Tanzy, the attracting is undeniable and the sparks start to fly.Smart and sexy are the two best words to descrive this book. Get a copy and just have some fun for an afternoon or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baaah-d (I apologize)","review":"Seemed like a cute enough idea for a book, but the implementation falls flat. Tanzy is pretty unlikeable as a character. If I read another book where the main character is a (supposedly) incredibly successful writer, I think I'll choke. I wasn't emotionally involved enough with Tanzy to care if her stalker got ahold of her or not, and I didn't care whether or not she got her happy ending with flip/flop sheep/wolf Riley Parrish.And how did Aunt Millicent even know someone was e-mail stalking Tanzy to begin with? I never got that, and Millicent as a character was merely stock. It was all quite weak.Donna Kauffman also relied heavily on the use of phrases like \\"damn if he wasn't...\\" and \\"she was damn fine.\\" It seemed there was a \\"damn\\" on every page in this book. I think a writer with more than a few books to her credit could find some better modifiers."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the film that you've seen advertised","review":"Buyer beware: this is NOT the film that you've seen advertised on television (synopsis: \\"An author travels to Barcelona to see his estranged brother and dying father, where he learns that his life is plagued by events that occur at 11:11\\", taken from IMDB).This is a low-budget, direct-to-video, ripoff hoping to trick people by using an almost identical film title and releasing it very shortly before the other film. notice this film uses slashes \\"/\\" between the numbers: 11/11/11. The other film (the cinema release) uses dashes \\"-\\" between the numbers: 11-11-11.This sort of dishonesty is appalling, and Amazon should at least be upfront about the fact that this is a direct-to-video release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't be much worse","review":"Wow, I've sat through some stinkers before, but dang, this was lame.

This is a low-budget knock-off that my husband rented from Redbox because he thought it was something else. Trickster moviemakers.Letting go of the fact that this movie is basically hoodwinking the public into renting or buying something that they're not... This movie is a stinker. Judging completely on its own merits, it's fair to say that this movie HAS NO MERITS.It does feature the 11:11 phenomenon as well as some 9/11 conspiracy theories, but mostly it's a no-budget movie that isn't worth watching or reviewing. The acting is completely pathetic. Directing and writing aren't any better. The premise is ridiculous and whatever potential may have existed in the script has been choked to death.It's not scary, it's not clever, it's not even cool in the way that overly cheesy horror movies can be.

To be perfectly blunt, I no longer really blame them for releasing an unending putrid stream of cinematic atrocities. They must make money from some gullible sap out there.

That is, why clutter up a nice piece of equipment like this with selected drink recipes? It would have looked nicer if it only included measurements. Though, the measurements are marginally useful.Here is why you might want to buy this shaker over the shakers with integral tops that you are looking at:- You can mix drinks with a hearty shake due to the increased capacity that the tumbler portion gives you. This chills a drink faster. Depending on the ingredients, it can make them frothier.- The rubber seal fits well. It does not leak. It is much easier to separate than a metal shaker with a metal top.- You can strain the ice without the need of a strainer. (Hold the shaker horizontally and slightly separate the two halves.)- The tumbler fits inside the metal bottom for convenient storage.- It came in a nice case. Thus, it is a good choice for a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Markings disappear in short order","review":"I'll be brief: I like this shaker because of the quality heavy-duty glass and nice stainless steel; I HATE it because the markings are rapidly fading away. I bought this specifically because it was graduated in ounces (hard to find for some reason), but as another reviewer mentioned, it will be clear glass soon enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Water-Soluble Markings - Interesting Concept","review":"Pros: Features a heavy-duty glass (not plastic, as one reviewer noted) cup, and well-fitting rubber ring. Fill this with ingredients and ice, shake, and you're set, with no worries about leaking.Cons: The volume markings (in ounces) on the glass disappear after 4-5 washings. Unlike standard measuring cups, where the markings are etched into the glass and then filled with a permanent paint, the markings here are cheaply applied. As you're mixing a drink and notice your palm has turned black, you'll know the markings are disappearing, and you'll soon have a clear glass cup.Overall: Even without markings, you can still use this to mix drinks. You'll just have to measure the liquids with your shot glass. But hey, one of the reasons for buying this is having the convenience of pouring directly into the cup and measuring as you go, saving time and trouble. The shoddy manufacturing choice makes this one very poor value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cruzan","review":"The shaker works great, tight seal but after several cleanings the printed design on the outside of the glass came off."},{"rating":"2","title":"everyday pan","review":"This is the only place that I could find this pan, I looked everyplace locally that I could think of.

He's passionate, but the whole book is anchored and earthed by a desire to communicate the essence of astrology's worth and potential. It's a book that explains, but never patronises. It asks searching questions, but doesn't claim to have all the answers. The man is full of passsion for his subject, and humble with it, and he's a damn good writer.

I will say that Levi has mastered the use of descriptive language to very accurately portray the plight of the peasants; however he offers little compassion for the peasants and at times writes of them in a condescending manner. Perhaps his condescension is a true portrayal of class differences back then, however I could not identify in the least bit with Levi. Nor could I identify with the peasants, because there was absolutely no character development in this book. Levi wrote a descriptive novel -- he told things like he saw them, but without passion and intrigue. I found this novel to be very dry and mostly uninteresting. A college professor or older person may disagree, but from my standpoint this book had little to offer except that it was a good look at a different part of the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving..different","review":"Truly a moving and a unique book. The setting is the narrowest of venues, an almost forgotten village in southern Italy, during the 1930's.

The tunes are primarily Jazz/R&B/Disco feel along with a couple R&B Bossa Novas. The musicians are sensational (Eric Gale, Steve Gadd, Bernard Purdie, Brecker Brothers to name a few). Ron Carter lays down solid basic tracks but fumbles through solos on the electric bass. The backup musicians are superb and really carry everything.

Potential buyers should be forewarned, however, that song texts are only offered in English translations not their (usually) German originals. Doubtless this choice was made to limit the size of the book, but it also prevents it from being quite as helpful a guide as it might have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far From Comprehensive","review":"This book at first glance can appear pretty voluminous, it has a considerable heft to it, that being said it's pretty thin throughout. If you simply want translations of all the lyrics look no farther, if you're looking for detailed biographical and technical analysis however, you'll likely find this book disappointing. I was excited to look through this one when I first picked it up, and had a fair number of songs I was eager to learn more about, but I was somewhat let down when I found the book offered only a few sentences or a brief paragraph of criticism for some of my favorites. I suppose you can't blame the writer for his brevity considering the subject matter, but I wanted something more and overall didn't find this work particularly essential."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for my child","review":"While I appreciated the whimsical drawings in this book, the message contained within I found shallow, bordering on offensive, and inappropriate for my daughter.

She was self-loathing enough to have doctors work her body over, now she she's self-loathing enough to tell you about it. She doesn't feel sympathy for other \\"patients\\"--she merely feels pity for herself. Finally, what this book is really about is Glitz. Naming Hollywood names. Hollywood wives.

Just who is Koshchei the Immortal? A demon? How does he 'spot' Yelena the Beautiful? Through a window? It's as if he was so keen to illustrate all these characters that he just had to cram them in, but the storyline suffers. The fire bird itself gets pretty short shrift because there is so much to fit in.Anyway, never mind.

Honestly, a little bit of the soul of the band was lost in the process, but this record still sounds great. It has some of their best work, Let Me Go, which is probably their best known song in the US thanks to KROQ play. Temptation is their biggest UK hit and thanks to guest vocalist Carol Kenyon sounds nothing like the rest of the album. This album also has some of my favorite lesser known songs like Who Will Stop the Rain and The Best Kept Secret.With this album the band moved firmly away from the technopop/synthpop that the Human League had embraced and into UK Soul/Funk/RnB.

Another reason I didn't find it as good was and is on the cover of the DVD box. The fact that this lady reporter was involved when she had no experience (or little or none) and that so much time was spent on her ineptitude was really irritating. And again, why she is on the cover of the box is really aggrivating since she was such a small part of the show, or should have been and because she was pretty much shown to be a fraud who got on the show just simply for the story and to be on the show.

That does make it a minor inconvenience to use, but overall the time I use to shave (once taking into account the time to slather on the shaving cream before and aftershave afterwards) is less than before.

This was a replacement for one that lasted 10 years, before it became difficult to find replacement foil/cutter. This new shaver gives a great shave, as good as my last shaver, but the battery will not hold a charge for more than one shave, which means that I must plug it in every night in order to shave the next day. If I forget - no shave that day. I didn't think this would be that bad, so I didn't return the shaver (which is a pain), but this defect has proven to be a major annoyance. I am very disappointed in this product, not what I have come to expect from Remington. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unchargeable","review":"I ordered this shaver as a replacement for my husband's 20 year old Remington that had worn out.

However, from the first time I used this razor, the charge only lasts about 20-30 seconds. In that amount of time, I can't really accomplish much. This purchase was a complete waste of money and now I am stuck using the old razor I was attempting to replace. Now I am faced with starting from scratch. BUYERS REMORSE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed With Battery Life","review":"My Braun recently died on me after serving me well for a number of years. My wife went out and bought the Remington and while I have no qualms about the shave itself (it does a decent job) the battery life is downright horrible. Does not hold a charge for very long and the most disappointing thing is that there is no visual indicator that it is low on charge nor can you shave while it is plugged in! Going back to Braun. You pay more but I find you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as described","review":"This product was described as \\"worldwide voltage\\".

The points, sequences and methods of applying pressure are very effective. I have had some great results using these techniques. It does take some time initially to decipher where they all are. Some descriptions are kind of cryptic and the it seems that occasionally the drawings do not match exactly to the picture in content and order. But if you work off the descriptions only you can figure out where the points are on your body. Once you know where they are, you're all set. This book is very powerful, but could use some editing and a new edition to make it more accessible for those not so in tune with their bodies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful. Is this supposed to be a comedy?","review":"No laughs here. Just the cringe-worthy sight of 50-something Alec Baldwin trying to romance a 21-year-old character. It's not that it's creepy. It's just that there is no chemistry whatsoever. Neither lead is likeable in any way. If this is a date movie, it's enough to encourage singlehood. If it's a comedy, someone forgot the laughs. So what is it? A bomb."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies I have ever seen","review":"This movie called \\"Suburban Girl\\" is the worst... Alec is a stud regardless but... he plays a very pervy guy! Sarah Michelle Gellar is horrible also the romantic movie is not that romantic just creepy. it's like watching my dad (49) and my step mom (33) make out!!!! it's nasty and disturbing. skip it. burn.

NOT romantic. zero chemistry and depressing!","review":"From the beginning i just kept thinking ew... this is creepy and sick and he just looks WAY too old her for (and not in a hot wow, hes george clooney, old but good looking kind of way... in a EW, he could be her father [esp since there is SO little chemistry between them]). Not funny. slightly depressing and VERY VERY slow. ** i fell asleep during it** LOVE SMG, but not this movie! stay away!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surburban Girl is Adorable","review":"Sarah Michelle Gellar's and Alec Baldwin's banter and chemistry are believable and very entertaining. The dialogue is witty and sexy. You cheer for both of these characters to find themselves and benefit from being involved. The casting is perfect. The soundtrack is a blast. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Alec and Sarah together. Reminds me of Autumn in New York!","review":"I have to say I loved this film. This is not your average love story about two young people going through a relationship. Neither is this movie about two older people trying to get out of a rut. Instead, it's two people trying to find themselves through each other. This movie reminds me a lot about Autumn in New York, which is a movie I love and has a much sadder ending. You have to lose the whole \\"it's creepy, he just wants them young\\" attitude. The truth is society does embrace and want \\"young\\". Just look at all the teen and tween idols. you have to see it as two people in their element going through life.With all that said, I always liked Alec Baldwin. He just seemed the type that is funny and can effortlessly sweep me off of my feet. Sarah plays her character very well and you see the progression from her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hope Melissa Bank got paid well for this!","review":"I loved the book and the screenplay did not disappoint, but was deeply disappointed by the casting of Ms. Gellar, who did her best but just could not pull off this character, who is more Carrie Bradshaw than Buffy. To begin with, they dressed her in clothes a la Nancy Botwin in Weeds which are worn by women who look sensual in them (as does Mary Louise Parker), while SMG just looks like a 30 year-old dressing like a 50 year-old (who claims to be only 22 years old!) Then, she is just not convincing as someone who reads all day and fights for authors. The overall effect of the sets, costumes and locations paired to this script and Buffy WAS creepy, as so many other reviewers said. I just hope Melissa Banks made some money off of it, it certainly wasn't her fault."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starring Buffy the Vampire Slayer","review":"I admit it. I watched Suburban Girl because of Sarah Michelle Gellar. What can I say? I love my Buffy. This movie is based on the short stories in The Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing by Melissa Bank. This further increased my interest, as I've seen the book, but never picked it up. (The movie has nothing to do with actual hunting or fishing, FYI.) Gellar is Brett Eisenberg, an editor, trying to work her way up at a NY publishing company, who meets Archie Knox (Alec Baldwin), a much older veteran of the publishing world. Romance ensues and real life tragedies interrupt, making both take watch of their lives. The funniest part about this movie was my boyfriend walking in and wondering who matched up Baldwin as Gellar's father. Uh, they are supposed to be a couple, yeah, so not believable. If you really love either of them, watch it, other than that save your time and watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer instead. We will all be much happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Ending","review":"Suburban Girl overall was ok. It is not a movie that I would personally watch again. Part of it could have been my timing. In the movie Sarah Michelle Gellar's Character's father passes away. I watched it the day before Father's Day and my father passed a few years ago. When I first rented this movie I was under the impression that it was a romantic comedy as well. There was kind of a melancholy feel throughout the whole movie. Another thing that displeased me was the way that a relationship between an older man and younger woman was betrayed. In this movie it made it seem as though that type of relationship was pretty much doomed from the beginning and that is not always the case, granted this is a movie and not real life as well.It is an ok movie to watch but don't do it on a rainy day."},{"rating":"1","title":"booooring","review":"First I did not last the entire movieit was just too boring and slow movingI would have only given 1 star but I am surethere are worse movies out there so I was generous"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised","review":"I didn't expect much as I don't like S. Gellar (but I've never actually seen her in anything) but I like Alec Baldwin in everything and I really liked this movie....very light stuff but very entertaining story and good acting...music and visuals of NYC...and Gellar was actually pleasant to watch...see it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Ado About Nothing","review":"Sarah plays a book editor who sets her sights on dating the CEO of a publishing company. And that's pretty much the whole story. The problem with this film is that it has no drama. Most of the first hour is just about the two people dating. The last half hour of the film was a little slow and meandering, before it attempts to put a happy ending on this rather dull and pointless story. I was disappointed and now I know why the film went straight to DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic, not to be missed by any serious student of prayer.","review":"This slim volume covering the nature of prayer is more than mere lecture or one person's ideas.

It is a simple format, directly presented for all to use as a tool to a richer prayer life.

Once and awhile I like to read something that is 2-3 generations old because I feel sometimes we get in spiritual ruts in our time and we get group think.

Outside of Boston sports teams, he knows very little about the topics he discusses but tries to pretend that he's a sports know-it-all. Instead of providing a true fan's perspective, his site and writings are more of a personal forum for him to bash the sports individuals or teams that he doesn't like. Every now and then, he cracks a great analogy. But as everyone knows, sifting through a lot of waste to find a nugget of gold just isn't worth it. If you really want to hear annoying rantings of an uneducated sports fan, why would you waste your time reading this book when you can at least pretend to be social and talk to the fans at your local bar (or message forum)?"},{"rating":"1","title":"generic and unoriginal","review":"this guy is one of the few writers who writes pretty much what the average person, myself included, says on a daily basis to his/her friends or anybody that will listen. this makes his work irrelevant since there really is no point in buying a book or magazine to the read same thing that your buddies say to you all day long. I guess at first it is kind of cool to realize that someone gets paid to write the same thoughts that everyone else has for free, but this novelty gets played out by the second chapter and by then you are reminded the reason that books are supposed to be published: to offer readers insightful and compelling commentary of interest. this book offers neither.go sox"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you read his online column, you can skip this book!","review":"I'm not a fan of the Red Sox, rather, I'm a fan of the Sports Guy & baseball in general. I read Simmons' online columns regularly, & therefore was looking forward to this book. I have to say I was disappointed -- I enjoy his writing style & sense of humor, but this book seemed all to familiar to regular readers of his columns. Therefore I'd say this book is worth a read for diehard Red Sox fans and/or those who don't regularly read Simmons online....otherwise, skip it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The joy is in the footnotes","review":"As a religious reader of Simmons' stuff online, I was sketpical about buying this book. The extensive footnotes, however, which contain added jokes, exponential material and goofy asides made it more than worthwhile. The fun of this collection wasn't so much in reading the articles again, but in learning what the author thought about them as time passed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for Red Sox Fans","review":"Those familiar will Bill Simmons' column on ESPN know that his writing style is highly entertaining and unique. Not a traditional sportswriter Bill writes from the viewpoint of the fan, putting in writing what everyone else is thinking. The book compiles all his Red Sox related columns over a 5 year period, leading up to their first World Series Championship in 86 years. Its fun to relive the emotions of being a fan in those years, and the steps the team made to get to the pinnacle of the sport. While the columns aren't anything new, the footnotes that are added offer a unique perspective into what Simmons was thinking or explanations for jokes he refers to in previous columns. The footnotes really bring his columns to another level. The book is a very easy and entertaining read. Personally its my old standby for long flights, because it never fails to make me laugh out loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are a loyal reader do not buy this book","review":"I am a huge Simmons fan, but there is no point in buying this book if you have already read all these columns.

If you have not read all of Simmons work go ahead and buy the book beacause Simmons is very enjoyable to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither Nostalgic Nor Original","review":"I read Simmons' ESPN articles quite frequently, and I must say that his book was a boring read. Yeah, there are a few laughs here and there, but it's more like \\"Ha...I heard that one before.\\" I would highly recommend that if you're going to read this non-entertaining book just out of curiosity that you just take a few minutes to sit down in a bookstore, read a few pages, forget that you just wasted your precious time, and move on with your life.

Somebody has an agenda or an axe to grind with The Sports Guy. If you ask me some people are simply jealous of Simmons' success, which is really the ultimate complement for a writer. ANYWAY, this is an enjoyable compilation of all of Simmons' articles Re: The Sawx, over the past five years, culminating in the '04 Championship Season. Yes, if you read the Sports Guy regularly you have probably already read most of the material in the book but these articles are eminently rereadable and Simmons has added some new material as well as some great new jokes with the footnotes. If you take it for what it is, an easy, quick, light read, then you will enjoy it immensely. If you're looking for the next great American Sports Novel (is there such a thing?) you might be disapointed. Great for the toilet and the commute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps you've read this before...","review":"Bill Simmons cleans out his hard drive and calls it a day and now a book. (Sorry, it had to be said). Anyone who has read the Boston Sports Guy could have just saved his articles and added their own commentary.Bill is a very talented and original writer but I would have rather read something that is new. I know he has a new daughter and we all need to make a buck, so I can't blame him.The columns are as a good as it gets about the Sox and sports, but you may have read this before.I wish the title was a better one. First, there are a few more important things that I would like to see happen in my life than a baseball team who could care less about me (except my wallet) win a World Series. Second, the title is a complete rip-off from 1994 when a fan had made that sign at Madison Square Garden after the NY Rangers won the Stanley Cup.

I think I was a bit disappointed because I had already read many of these articles on ESPN's website, and was hoping for something more. Though I still enjoyed his writing, as a book - it was disjointed and a little less enjoyable. I wish he had either written an entirely new book, or at least connected the dots a little better.

The footnotes include antidotes and the explanation of inside jokes that clearly bring these old columns a new twist.

Saddest part of the whole story is that he's happy with only one world series title, even though his team has been completely dominated by the Yankees for pretty much his entire life (eg: 26 World Series titles for the Yankees to just 3 for his team.) Since the author bases happiness on his team's success, it would therefore make sense he should only be happy if his team ever came close to matching the dominance of the Yankees on the field. Given the rate of his team's titles (approx. one every 86 years) this obviously can't happen in the author's lifetime. Therefore, the premise of the book (for the author to die in peace because of his baseball team)and hence, the whole story is completely idiotic (which, ironically fits very nicely, given his team's self-titled nickname)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very enjoyable read","review":"Bill Simmons does a great job of bringing sports and pop culture together. I am not a Red Sox fan, but it I found myself becoming more and more intrigued with Red Sox fans as I continued through the book. Since I am in my early thirties I really enjoyed the pop culture references as I have seen most of the movies and TV shows that were referenced. I even found myself laughing out loud on the train while reading some of them. I only became a Bill Simmons fan a short time ago so I had not seen these columns before.

It worked well enough, but lugging a corded mouse to all my classes, along with multiple textbooks, other computer accessories, and other sundry items was beyond maddening. Then I got the Logitech Cordless Optical Mouse for Notebooks. The shape, though not as good as Logitech's MX510 wired mouse, is excellent, as wireless notebook mice go. I'm not a big fan of those miniscule optical wireless mice not much larger than a real, squealing mouse. They give me hand cramps like you wouldn't believe. Anyway, this mouse is an excellent choice, and the only fault that I can find with it is remembering to switch off the mouse after I use it, but I'm beginning to get used to it, lest I give the battery industry that much more revenue."},{"rating":"1","title":"very uncomfortable!!!","review":"I have a siliver one.

I have to say that I am not a big fan of \\"wireless\\" mouse made by Logitech-not yet at least. This particular model is heavy with two AA batteries and considerably less accurate than wired mouse. Furthermore, the USB receiver of this mouse is a bit bulky and blocks the adjacent USB port of my Dell laptop. Instead of this model, I strongly recommend Logitech Notebook Optical Mouse Plus (931073-0403)--small wired mouse. I am happy with this light and accurate wired mouse with sleek USB connector that never blocks the other USB port.

Nicely weighted, solid buttons round off the package.The cordless reception is excellent (up to 10 feet away) and tracks beautifully. The neoprene case is of good quality and fits the mouse and dongle near perfect.

It eventually turned out that there was a missing USB adapter for the wireless mouse to even run. I feel that this order was very futile for even being up on Amazon.com. However, the brand name and mouse itself are very quality and I know this as I had purchased one from Amazon in the past. I hope I can get my shipment corrected and I hope that this seller realizes the mouse is useless without the USB.

Why it never took off is anybody's guess, but \\"Feuer Und Flamme\\" (Fire and Flame)and \\"Irgendwie, Irgendwo, Irgendwann\\" (Anyplace, Anywhere, Anytime), were the two biggest hits in Germany, and in my opinion the whole CD is hit material. \\"Haus Der Drei Sonnen\\" (House of the Three Sons), \\"Gestern Nacht\\" (Last Night), and the irresistable \\"Das Alte Lied\\" (The Alter Song) cannot be ingnored. One thing I've always admired about NENA is the band's ability to sample other cultures. There's a bit of Latin influence, some African, and it's real catchy.

I purchased this book with high expectations and am very glad that I only paid half price for it. I don't believe that it was skill that took Mr. Viesturs up all of those \\"8000ers\\" WITHOUT SUPPLEMENTAL OXYGEN (as he reminds the reader countless times throughout the book) but was, instead, a massively inflated ego that allowed him to virtually float upward through thin air."},{"rating":"1","title":"mountains, not mommy","review":"mountaineering books and videos are purchased to hear and see about the climbs, with views and techniques discussed. not to hear about viestur's mommy worries while he traipses all over the world. yeah, yeah, he's careful because he loves his wife and family. yeah, yeah, he worries about them while he is gone. but he still goes. and still makes a business out of danger, not his veterinarian diploma. this guy has spent most of his young life in one of the most selfish pursuits on the planet, and i suspect had a great time doing so. now he tells us that the whole time he was eaten up with regard for his family?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Exploits","review":"Ed Viesturs is America's most famous and successful mountaineer and this work is a fascinating and often entertaining account of his exploits. His Himalayan climbing adventures, while exciting, seem foolishly dangerous to a non-climber. The book is dedicated to three of his climbing friends who are no longer around to read it. They are far from the only ones mentioned who died while climbing. One cannot help but wonder what drives individuals to take on such extraordinary risks; one has to be a bit crazy, it seems. Viesturs himself comes off as a hard-charging, highly motivated, but likeable fellow. He proves sensitive and helpful to colleagues in trouble. Unfortunately, his modesty errodes in the book's last chapter when he falls into some bragging about what an inspiration he has been to others. Nonetheless, a fine and interesting read overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read/Great Story","review":"You don't have to have climbed an 8000 meter peak (or even want to) to really enjoy reading Ed Viesturs' account of his quest to become the first American to ascend all 14 peaks without oxygen.

He tells of his views of the media, of which he is one. I found I didn't agree with every word, not because he is incorrect, but that his summations and/or conclusions don't mirror mine in all cases.

Judging from the reviews, most didn't like the style, format or content of the book so they responded with personal attacks on the author. It seems to me that those people believe that thinking is reserved only for the elite. I agree that not all of Stossel's conclusions are valid. Some based on simplistic evaluation of the data but others are right on the mark.A number of years ago, I was in conversation with a friend who was an investor in Broadway shows. He had just received a new script for a musical that he described as \\"nave, amateurish, lacking character development and has music that could have been written by a monkey.\\" He passed on the show.

I must also say that even a lot of conservatives will not like his book when you look at his social flaws on things like polygamy and prostitutes.

Any claims of \\"objectivity\\" can be put to rest by the fact he gets awards from right-wing groups, and is given a platform at fringe right-wing corporate-funded groups like the Cato Institute and Townhall.com.

Rich people are good because they're obviously better than poor people. People shouldn't be so dumb. If people weren't so dumb, John and the hair over his lip wouldn't have to stage cute photographs for covers of books that are written to explain why John is so smart and so many people are so dumb.

The facts are there, but mainly those to support Mr. Stossel's points-of-view--balanced reporting, Bill O'Reilly style. It's perfectly American, inlcuding the misleading title, advertising for which Mr. Stossel should be hoisted on his own petard by one of his consumer advocate colleagues.When it comes to the 1st amendment, put me at the front of the line.

I hope someone will start digging in his backyard because there are a lot of unearthed \\"truths\\" about Mr. Stossel that would surely divide the followers of the anger epidemic he is a part of.

It's that good! By the same token, if you're a Stosselesque libertarian, you might be surprised to learn that this isn't necessarily a passive affirmation of what you already know to be true.True, there are the obligatory smackdowns of global warming and secondhand smoke. But the reader may be surprised at the sections on child discipline and hypnosis.

With guys like this, good Libertarians are getting a bad image !P.S.: Why doesn't Stossel talk about legalizing hemp and bringing in hemp oil that could replace petroleum and in the process end America's hostile-held dependence on foreign oil?

I guess I shouldn't be surprised that a TV news anchor puts flashy words on a book with little substance. Heck he got me to buy it. I'm writing this so that other people don't waste the $15 on it, too.For example, he tries to convince the public that the price of gas is actually cheap compared to everything else. He compares it to the price of bottled water.

If, however, you enjoy logical arguments, or good writing, stay away from this book.In addition to sloppy arguments, he again falls into the trap that he did in his first book. He quotes sources, but he condenses quotes and doesn't give attribution to his sources. That pretty well guarantees that you won't be able to see where he got his quotes, and in which context he got them.He makes some good arguments and some terrible ones. His problem seems to be that he thinks he is a libertarian, when in fact, I don't think he knows exactly what he believes in.

It is also an interesting read because it will make you pause and think twice and will make you reflect on certain points in life.This is not your new age personal development program that's filled with promises. This book is not an inspirational book... it is a personal development book. It is not hyped up with creating you a glamorous future, but it is more like a blueprint for self growth, self development and self improvement that can help you to build a desirable future.This is a great book to add to your library collections.

The film is actually an interesting blend of tearjerker, subtle adult sex comedy and what used to be referred to as (forgive me) \\"heartwarming family drama\\" (but without the schmaltz). Think a Scottish \\"Terms of Endearment\\", with more believable characters and less mugging from the actors. The Danish director and her mostly Scottish cast does an impressive job of delivering a fairly large number of characters but still managing to make us care about what happens to all of them; the type of skilled ensemble work that puts this one in the Mike Leigh/Atom Egoyan league. Highly recommended. P.S. For the sake of those who have not seen this film yet, shame on all the reviewers trumpeting major \\"spoilers\\" in the first paragraph of thier reviews!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"This was misrepresented as a guide similar to those in the Peterson's Field Guide series.

As for those who wish there were color photos, I don't know. This is really for people who spot or photograph and really are looking at external visual cues to differentiate between locomotives.

I currently read about 100 books a year (and particularly enjoy mafia/underworld stories) but this one lacked...well...just about everything. The plot, though largely well-conceived, was interrupted incessantly with meaningless flashbacks. Otherwise powerful scenes became limp with annoying character daydreaming. Not only was there an abundance of typos (probably publisher's error) but the strange use of italics and punctuation frequently distracted this reader. And pacing was irregular: the novel's sense of \\"time\\" varied from paragraph to paragraph; the story bumped along. But perhaps the biggest disappointment was the writing itself. I found no voice in the book. Instead, choppy phrases and trite descriptions (\\"Mama's tired eyes lingered and drank the shared love her men demonstrated for one another\\") left me searching for writing skills. So I wasted a little time. Big deal. I learn something every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good book","review":"Reading for pleasure allows a person not to worry about facts, figures or other distracting information. All you need do is sink into the story and enjoy yourself. If it's a good one, time passes quickly. I started \\"The Pact With Bruno\\", remember noticing that I was on page fifteen, then in the blink of an eye, it seemed, I had finished the book. That's how good it is; better I think than the first Doug Carlson novel.

The Feed constantly delivers news, information, music, and so on based on how you feel, what you want, and more.I can't help but think about how we're inundated with so much information on a daily basis, and how much of it I choose to voluntarily consume...

They all recover okay except for Violet she has a problem her feed is messing up her body. Will she make it?

Sadly the rest of the book makes you wish you hadn't ever picked it up. The problem is you learn to love the characters, even with their flaws but they never get better.

The way he displayed the future was very thought provoking and disturbing. But, the characters, I thought, were SO shallow and annoying sometimes I couldn't stand it.Plus, the way in which the book was written was sometimes impossible to understand.

Case in point - FEED. Was probably going for creative and unique ... ended up with annoying and slow.

The planet they are on is Earth. On Earth life is crazed, people have almost no oxygen, the cities are in the sky because the floor is cover in a never ending fur of roaches, and the sea is a swamp of toxic acid. There is one thing to look up for, the feed. The feed is a chip in your head that is every electronic thing you could have in your house, but in your head. But there is a scary side to this madder, is they are run by huge companies that own almost every thing because of a failing u.s economy, even what you learn and know. Find out more on feed at you near by library, and you never know it might just happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting premise not quite fulfilled.","review":"\\"Feed\\" is full of fascinating ideas, but it's hampered by a less-than-compelling story and an arbitrary, unsatisfying ending. The key relationship -- a love story between two teenagers -- is unsupported. The story is set in a foreign time, but its characters are cliches. We've seen them in a hundred After School Specials. There's the beautiful, troubled outsider and her father, a quirky, suffering genius. There's also a set of self-absorbed, ineffectual parents straight out of Rebel Without A Cause. The points Anderson makes about consumerism are heavy-handed and too sparse for a work of this length. If the author had distilled \\"Feed\\" into a short story, it might well be a classic of both science fiction and the coming-of-age genre characterized by Catcher in the Rye."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is like totally like meg bad Dude.","review":"Anderson took a bunch of teenaged idioTs that speak with like no Conviction? and set them in like the future? with like advertising chips in their like brains that are called feeds.

The grammar in the book was horrendous! Half the time I couldn't understand what was happening, or being said because of it. Not to mention that the author was question mark happy and seemed to put them everywhere and in places that made no sense whatsoever. The book had great potential, but frankly I have no idea how in the world it got published. I would have put down a zero star, or a half but they didn't have that as an option.

I cried."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth your dollar","review":"The book Feed is an excellent science fiction book that I would recommend to anyone who likes books about the future. This book is about when 78% of people are connected to Feeds. Feeds are implanted in your brain that control everything even how you see, talk, walk, and hear. The book starts out with a bunch of teenage students going to the Moon on spring break. The moon was boring until they met Violet. She wanted to know what normal people normally do, so they took her to a rock concert. At the rock concert their Feeds get a bug, so they have to go to the hospital. The hospital was so much fun! They had never had more fun in their lives! They were almost sad when they were told their Feeds were fixed, but it was quickly forgotten when they got the conveniences their Feeds provided them. Later on in the book Violet and Titus become boyfriend and girlfriend. The story goes on to tell about their daily lives.

This alone made it difficult to get through. It made the future of our people seem pathetic and meaningless. No one can decide how to be unique without the \\"Feed\\". The older generation was able to remember some things of what it was like before, but they were the stupid ones. As I said, I get that this was a YA book, but if this is what our YA readers want and are able to relate to, we are in serious trouble and maybe M.T. Anderson is right on target!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Feed","review":"This book takes place in the very near future and takes us through a life with no thinking, only computers.

Anderson does what the best writers of dystopian fiction do: he takes elements of our world and distorts them only slightly; we recognize ourselves and where we're headed and see that our feet are already on the path. A sharp attack on the mindless purchasing of everything, Anderson's novel makes you want to unplug yourselves from your own Feed -- the television, the Internet, Ebay -- and go anywhere EXCEPT a mall. Frightening and chilling."},{"rating":"2","title":"FEED","review":"This book is an unexpected pleasure to read.

It's short and un-intimidating. The vocabulary develops naturally, incrementally with the story lines, in a way that builds confidence. 'Children's book' is an apt description of the characters and situations, but it doesn't cloy for an adult learning the language. The illustrations are a pleasure and useful because they support the text. Unfortunately this is a very pricey introduction to French at just less than sixty pages.

One of the singers is Jayney Klimek, formerly of the Other Ones (not the Grateful Dead Other Ones, the OTHER Other Ones, the ones who did \\"We Are What We Are\\" and \\"Holiday\\"). The songs are drab middle-of-the-road efforts.

I quote, \\"wearing sexy clothing is a normal adolescent behavior\\". Some daughters might be all the better for allowing boys to ogle them, but mine better keep the receipt.I say no thank you to most of the advice given in this book.

The presentation is completely unclear, there is no motivation and the math is treated in a ridiculusly simplified way.According to SLP, to prove a theorem, all you need to do is make assumptions - no need to motivate why you make them - that would be overkill, rather leave it to the reder to motivate (as an annoying exercise).I dream of the day a Mas-Collel of macro economics comes around and writes a comprehensive macro book.

An exercise in rigorous hand-waving. Rigor without mortis. Anybody who wants to become a mathematical economist would be better off by taking real math courses first. On the other hand, the Economics content is rather prosaic as is tradition in the Minnesota-Chicago school. There are a great many math and probability books out there that are more interesting, not to mention those that are more concerned about empirically relevant Economics. If you think Real Business Cycle models are mathematically rigorous and empirically relevant, well, this piece should become your Bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"You better read something else","review":"This is among the worst books I've seen in economics. I suggest you read something else in maths such as dynamic programming, stochastic dynamic programming, measure theory to get the neccessary tools instead of reading this book. By studying these serious books in maths, you get the foundations. The arguments do not flow. To much exercises are left for the readers. The explanations are bad and too terse. The references are really bad and creat a lot of diffculties for you to keep track. This book teachs you many thing you can find in Sargent's three books: Dynamic macroeconomics, recursive macroeocnomics and macro theory. But I found those books are much,much more entertaining and systematic. Forget about this book.

The intrigue, and details of the court and the Borgias. All good elements of storytelling.It was written in the 1940s, but it deserves to read again.

Then they just go downhill from there. I think ol stevie boy is runnin out of ideas. I see why this title is selling for so cheap on here (I bought the Audio CD).

I forced myself to read 275 pages, hoping it would get better, but i realized that i really no longer cared what happened and i put the book down, never to be picked up again. The story just keeps repeating itself, a \\"lightquake\\" takes place, something is ejected out of the trunk, no one really knows what that something is, what it's purpose is, or where it came from, and you never discover the answers to any of these questions.

Of course not, and \\"From a Buick 8\\" is no exception. Don't let the title fool you, this is no \\"Christine\\" wanna-be.

No one can capture the nuances of a character better or faster than King.The first 300 pages drag but only if you want a quick summer read. If you like total development of the people and the plot, it's great. The last 150 pages are the best IMO.

Ocassionally an oversized bookwork wiggles out and they freak! Then they go back to teach classes all day haunted by what they have seen. Sounds pretty weak doesn't it? Just swap in a Buick and some state troopers and you have the the terribly weak premise of this novel.The ONE IDEA that constitutes this book can only be drawn out so far (flashing \\"portal car\\" plops out creatures that decompose ASAP--troopers gawk in amazement!). At some point it all needs to MEAN something, which, in the end, it doesn't. There is always room for a novel that makes the absence of answers its strong point, but this book simply pushes that pretense too far.If you want to be creeped out by the inexplicable I recommend that you read books by the author that obviously influenced King's trunk-born creations--H.P. Lovecraft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best...a little bit boring.","review":"I've read them all, so I know what I'm talking about. This book was not up to par with any of King's other books (nearly eclipsing Gerald's Game as his worst novel ever). It was kind of interesting at times, but I was (hopelessly) waiting for this book to \\"really get going\\". It never did. It was an OK read, definetely not a \\"page turner\\", and, all in all, one that I could have done without. If you want to read some great King novels, start with IT, The Stand, Pet Semetary, or, just about anything else King has written.

I am a big fan of Stephen King, however this book is his worst work. There is far too much description of things that have nothing to do with the story. I found myself skimming over pages just to hurry the story along. It is an easy book to put down, unlike most of his work that keeps you on edge and turning the pages.I would not recommend this book to a King fan.

The story is more of a series of stories all reflecting upon a rather dull, old, Buick which, frankly, isn't scary. The flat plot gradually leads to vapid climax and finally an ending which cannot even satiate the reader's longing to discover some information about the curiously entriging Buick. Instead of suspence and terror, King points out the human proclivity to inquire about the unknown and question questions that cannot be answered. This leaves the reader unsatified upon closing the book because he/she is without any knowledge explaing the Buick's strange behavior; only the fact that it was their natural desire to question something that could not be answered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steve: We still wanna love ya, but...","review":"As a diehard SK fan, I wanted to believe that The Master could still do it after all these years.

He fashioned this book to incorporate all the essential elements of proper characterization. He forgot to breathe life into the characters inhabiting this unremarkable town in Pennsylvania. That's too bad for the readers and I really don't think Stephen gives a flip about us anyway. This book is nothing more than a stop gap throw away between \\"worlds\\" in his \\"Gunslinger\\" series.

In reading it, I found that King had come up with an interesting premise - a car - but not a car - maybe a portal to another universe might be more like it.King tells the story using flashback techniques - and you have to be really observant in reading to have even a wild guess at how this story ends.If you are not familiar with King's other books, this isn't the one to start your experience.

While the dialogue does stress that life is uncertain and that there are not always answers, a 300+ page read should leave a paying reader with something more than a waste of time. Coming from one of our generations premier writers, this serves as a double dissapointment. Mr. King would have been well advised to keep his roadside demons behind closed pages not unleashed to a paying public...what a betrayal of trust. It will be a long time before I not only consider reading another S. King book, it will be a long time before I can count him among the great authors of our day after pulling a stunt like releasing this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The joke is on me","review":"Stephen King's writing style is not in question. So this book isn't based on the same scale as other writers. This book is King vs. King-if that makes sense. Anyway, From a Buick 8, sounds like a story that Mr. King worked on while half dozing on the back porch. The plot is questionable at best, because I'm of the opinion that plot means that we're building TOWARD something. That is not the case in this book. King hyjacked my money for this (an audiobook price tag-which is a lot of money) and laughed all the way to the bank. Overall, DON'T BOTHER. Go out to your own back porch and watch the grass grow. Trust me, it will be more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't finish it","review":"I'm a growing fan of Stephen King having read Needful Things, The Tommy Knockers, Dreamcatcher, The Dead Zone and Misery just to name a few but I honestly couldn't finish this book which is actually sort of sad because its pretty short considering what King writes. But this book lags despite its short length making it feel like an accomplishment when you reach the 100 page mark. King has nice characters, but I was really only mildly interested in the plot. Its one of the few King books that I honestly wouldn't recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Stephen King","review":"This book is def one of his. Very much a horror book, but lots of pondering moments and never dull with him. I truly felt I could smell the car and felt just like I was there, as in The Stand I did as well. Wonderful book!!! I hope he does decide to write more and not stop writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"From author Joy Lee Rutter (A Disturbing Presence)","review":"Where were the moviemakers when this one came out? \\"From a Buick 8\\" made me feel as though I was right there, in Pennsylvania, sitting near Shed B, drinking iced tea (I could almost taste it) and listening to Sandy tell his deceased comrade's son about the mysterious vintage car parked a few feet away. The book may seem a little slow at first, but it moves along nicely and the end is not a disappointment.There's something different about this book, from most of his others. Its setting is not in Maine. Althought I am a New Englander, I was not disappointed. His research into the area and his anecdote at the very end, which explains his choice of setting, made it quite interesting indeed. Don't miss this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Stephen King book ever","review":"Save your money. Either get this book from the library or if you absolutely must have it, visit your favorite used book store and pick it up for a buck fifty. It started off well enough; a stanger pulls into service station with a classic buick and promptly disappears. The Pennsylvania state police take possession of the car and park it out in back of their station in an unused shed. From then on, the plot plods along, never really getting into the classic King writing we have come to expect. I kept telling myself \\"just wait, something big is just around the corner\\", but it never materialized. Suddenly I found myself three quarters of the way thru this book, still waiting for the shoe to drop, but it never did. Don't waste your time or money on this clunker. I gave it one star only because Amazon would't let me give it zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good At All","review":"I love Stephen King.....at least I used to. I have read a lot of King's works and loved most all of them. But, recently it seems that his novels are starting out well and captivating the reader, but by midway through it leaves you wondering why you are reading this. This book is no exception. It doesn't hold the reader enough to make them want to finish the book. Unlike King's earlier works that the reader simply cannot put down or the reader has ngihtmares about! This is not one of those books.If you are reading King for the first time...DO NOT read this one. Try Dolores Claiborne, Carrie, or Everything's Eventual instead. The last is the best sample of true King works.I gave it 2 stars, but if it weren't King writing it would have gotten less than 1.

I feel bad for saying this because King is a favorite writer of mine but this was JUST AWFUL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and interesting metaphor","review":"Stephen King reflects on life, age, the passage of time and those who get swallowed up by circumstances along the way, some of their own creation, some are random... and some from what looks like a vintage Buick Roadmaster.

It's too bad those people can't see that the story is in fact not about the supernatural stuff at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A car story, loved it. creepy.","review":"I wish it could have been longer, but it was fantastic.

King gets most of his ideas from his own life. He was traveling up I-95, I think, headed to Maine when he pulled over for gas and had a near life changing experience behind the gas station.

Oh no, it doesn't move like a bullet! Oh no, there isn't a horrific slaughter every 22 pages!... King's lyrical, moving account of a group of highway patrol officers and their long acquaintance with an elemental mystery of the universe is exactly the kind of thing I want from Big Steve after all these years. Yeah, PET SEMATARY's still the most frightening novel in human history, and yeah, THE SHINING is the one they'll be teaching in classrooms 50 years from now. But FROM A BUICK 8 is a nice addition to the library of mature, life-affirming tales King has been delivering for the past decade or so. I for one hope his retirement plans aren't gonna last... but this ain't a bad one to go out on (so long as the DARK TOWER conclusion follows soon, as promised!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"My Favorite Writer out of Gas","review":"Hard to resist all the car references \\"out of gas \\" \\"wreck\\".

Sorry Steve , guess it is time to retire -maybe a few years off ,will refresh your enormous talent . This is one of the most tedious books ,I ever finished [only finished because it was written by Stephen King].Is full of adjectives and page fillers ala Dean Koonce ,but is pretty dull stuff.

Sorry, SK, but you must have written this one in a coma."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring - doesn't go anywhere","review":"Not a great book - I like a lot of King's works, but this one is pretty bad.

I was very disappointed in this book. If you're just getting to know Mr. King, please read the older books first and avoid this one at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I've really enjoyed many of Stephen King's books and, when he's on, he's probably the best at mixing suspense and terror in a story. I really believe he has a gift very few authors in this genre have.That said, Buick 8 just dragged on, never really going anywhere. I normally knock off about 100-150 pages a day when reading his other novels. This one took me about 2 weeks and it was a chore the whole time.I look to King to spook me at night, not give me the warm and fuzzies. It was pretty clear he wanted to go in a different direction with his writing but he should stick with what he's best at. I go to my CPA becuase he's the best at doing my taxes. He doesnt change my oil or rotate my tires.Mr. King, get back to scaring the bejeezus outta me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"What is this book about?

As a lifelong and devoted King fan, I eagerly purchased the book when I saw it on the bargain cart at Barnes & Noble (oh, the better things I could have done with that $5), and dug in.\\"From A Buick 8\\" is a fine example that shows being a \\"name\\" in literature will get your worst ideas published. I bet if Steve were to write a longwinded novel about his favorite cheeseburger it would get released to rave reviews. This is a major waste of any reader's time. I have always loved the way King's stories made me jump at shadows and rethink whether or not there was a monster under my bed. That was definately not found here. I got so bored with the book it ended up on the shelf in the bathroom, read only when I was taking a... bath.Ignore this book. If you receive it as a gift, return it for something better, like any of the Dark Tower series."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a Buick 8","review":"I enjoyed this book like no other.

All the possibilities and questions you come to while reading are thoroughly explored."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT FROM A GREAT WRITER","review":"There was a time when you knew you were going to get a great story because the name Stephen King was printed on the dust jacket. But those books are few and far between. I can't recommend this book to anyone. I stick with SK because I hope to get another SALEM'S LOT, GREEN MILE, or MISERY. Every once in a while SK will sneak up on you and deliver a gem, but he's been shooting blanks for a long time. I'm getting really tired of waiting and reading and being sorely disappointed. Only King's great prose carry you through this mercifully short novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"All that I can say is that this was the worst Stephen King book that I have ever read.

I know that he can do better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!","review":"Long winded, not well written, lacks a story line that is somewhat believable, no real character developement, repeats itself in places, ending about as exciting as a root canal! Don't waste your time or money on this one!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring waste of money","review":"I didn't think I would ever finish this book. It was very slow, boring reading because nothing ever really seemed to happen. I thought something exciting was finally going to happen around page 300, but even that was a letdown. I would not recommend this to any fan of the old Stephen King books. I read that Stephen King is going to quit writing books and I can see why. I haven't liked any of his later books; has he run out of decent ideas? It seems his books sell because of his name alone; definitely not by their content. I won't bother with his next one-if there is one."},{"rating":"1","title":"An exercise in writing and nothing more...","review":"If this book were not written by Stephen King nobody would read it except his creative writing instructor. Skill in characterization, metaphor and dialog plus an unusual narrative structure don't add up to anything more than an experiment gone wrong. It probably should never have been published. 2 STARS for skill in composition, nothing for story or motivation."},{"rating":"1","title":"back to reality, please","review":"King needs and editor who can look him in the eye and tell him when a book isn't worth the millions people are about to shell out for it.

Zero rating.","review":"I think before this even came out, people were saying, \\"What? Another book centered around a car?!\\" But, you still have to have an open mind; it could have been good for all we knew ... right? Wrong. The first 100 pages of this book will put you to sleep, going on and on about the backstory of how this car from another world, found it's way into the lives of some very boring state troopers. If you don't fall asleep buy then, the rest is equally, if not more boring and time spent when you could have been reading some authors that WILL scare you, and write more complex in the process: Clive Barker is the first to come to mind, even The Manhattan Hunt Club, by John Saul was better than this. Also check out, Bentley Little for a good scare. pass this one up. I love King's old stuff, this has got to go. Sorry, Stephen.

Awful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"His worst book ever","review":"Having been a longtime fan of Stephen King, I was greatly disappointed in 'From A Buick 8'. The story was almost non-existent, the characters were poorly developed and there was no climax to speak of. I had to force myself to continue plodding through this excuse for a novel. In the end, I wish I hadn't. It's a shame this is his last free-standing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I have read most of King's books. I can honestly say that this is the most boring book I have read by him. I haven't even finished it and I find myself feeling like I have homework whenever I pick it up (I have a thing about finishing any book I start). I also keep finding myself skipping paragraphs because they are soooo wordy (for lack of a better adjective :o)).I hope he does better in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Along For The Ride","review":"At first glance, one might want to compare King's latest novel as a cross between 'Christine' and 'The Tommyknockers', with a little of the old B horror film 'The Car' thrown in for good measure. But 'From A Buick 8' is much more than it appears to be. King, while still a master at keeping the nerve-wracking tension, suspense, and chills at high volume, delves deep into the characters emotions; from their endless fascination and curiousity, terror and courage, and their struggle with seemingless endless questions with too few answers. King, proves once again that he is still the Master of the Macabre, while running the gauntlet of human emotions admist a mysterious and alien terror, for one of his very best, intriguing, and page turning novels to date...

Potter Author/Poet"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzz","review":"I've read everything Stephen King's published, and if it has come down to mediocre stuff like this then it is probably best that the rumors are true and Mr. King isn't going to write any more stand alone novels. It's sad in a way...like Michael Jordan getting to the point where he is no longer able to hold a basketball.I'm looking forward to the last Dark Tower books (which have been his strongest recent stuff and excellent - including the short story in his recent collection of short essays), but I have to say that for a dyed (or is it \\"died\\"?) in the wool Stephen King fan the current book is better suited to putting you to sleep at night than keeping you up turning pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining ride","review":"Once again Mr King has managed to chill us all with this easy paced novel of a rather suspicious car which arrives quite unceremoniously and \\"lives\\" out its \\"life\\" in a shed at the back of a local police authority. There is weaves its spell over the police officers who work there, and this tale is told to the teenage son of one of these officers, now deceased.This is a chilling book rather than terrifying. Mr King takes great care to show how the car has woven its spell, but that the people involved still manage to have what passed for normal every day lives. The wonderful part of this book is in the detail - you can really see the car which is not quite right, and you can imagine the world that it opens a door to. The visitors that come from that world occasionally keep up the interest and the \\"horror\\" aspect.But ultimately it is a tale of how we are all drawn to things that we know in our rational selves that we should leave well enough alone, and it is done very, very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting ultimately disappointing book.","review":"In a nutshell this book is basically about a group of close knit police officers whose lives are disrupted by a mysterious car that every so often turns the air cold and spits out some strange dead creatures.Admitedly unique with likable characters but the problem is the thing is more odd than scary.Another problem is that most of the book is made up of the recollections of different characters so very little seems to happen.Fortunately King has decided to write again and hopefully in Cell he'll have a more compelling tale to tell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read","review":"Loved it! Couldn't put it down. Totally fun read. Its the suspense more than the horror that gets to you on this one (although there is lots of yuck factor). King's deceptively easy writing style breezes you right through a story that actually has quite a bit of depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice concept, but no substance","review":"I hate to agree with some of the other critics who say this book is too long and boring, but... it is.I was able to hang in .. happily.. for the first 200 pages or so... but it gets old rather quickly. Most of the book is just a constant stream-of-conscience recollection of this evil Buick in a garage, and there are layers and layers of smarmy, state-troopers-are-a-family mentality. Which is all fine and dandy, but it's just not what one would expect from a Stephen King book.King is a wonderfully talented author, of course, but-- unless you have a particular interest in state troopers, Pennsylvania, or vintage Buicks, I'd pass on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to STANDARDS","review":"First, let me state I am a HUGE Stephen King fan. I own most of his books and read/reread/rereread them time and again. But I was sorely disappointed with From A Buick 8. There were times when I wanted to just put it down and move on. It did not have have the gripping storyline I have come to expect. It did not have characters I was really interested in. It did not have compelling dialogue and was more of a standard kind of story with some science fiction added in. I have read Stephen's comments as regards this book and he is right. I am not sure if it was done to satisfy a contract or to fill in the gap while finishing the Dark Tower series. In any event I am sure it is not a book I will be picking up again any time soon.

As someone who has read and re-read every King book, I was relieved that this hastily slung together rehashing of familiar King territory will be his \\"last.\\" Then again, King can shine in certain places and his amazing ability to bring you inside a character's consciousness almost makes it worth it to suffer through.

It has no plot...no intrigue...no Heart...nothing to capture the imagination, and send us off on one of the imaginary journeys he is so capable of creating.A word of advice to Mr. King.

The mid-song rythmn changes, like in \\"the messengers\\" are ingenious and keep the music fresh today. \\"With the Quickness\\" is an eclectic mix of grunge (before grunge), vernon reid-esq solos, thrash-metal and, of course, punk. This album was a nice blend of fast, ripping tracks (e.g. \\"sheba\\") and slowed-down, heavy-chevy tracks (e.g.\\"w/da quickness\\"). Bb's lyrics were wonderful then, because the airwaves were dominated by flakey stuff lacking substance and, today, these lyrics still have depth to them, taking the listener on a metaphysical and concrete journey keeping true to reggae by interspersing religion and charged political opinions throughout the album.

One of the reasons is because it is so boring. It does help you get a good idea of what life was like in the medieval times though. Out of the 297 pages, there about five times when I got really interested. The rest of the time, I felt like I was going to fall asleep. Although I am a very avid reader, I am only 14 years old, so an older reader might enjoy this book a little more.

If you play an instrument, you need this CD. The way these guys play changed the course of my musical life. These guys made me realize that there is a higher plane of musicianship that doesn't get ANY airplay. Brand X is an acquired taste. Too complex and busy for the faint-hearted. Each player is a monster. Most people have no idea how good Phil Collins is on drums. This CD is a clinic for any players out there, no matter what instrument you play. All the BrandX stuff is like this, but this live album is special. You won't believe its live, and you won't believe how unknown it is once you've expierienced it. Guaranteed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delivering The Goods Live","review":"Definite proof that Brand-X could deliver the goods in a live setting. This disc was taped at several different shows, thus the drumming split between Phil Collins and Kenwood Dennard.Overall, I like Collins drumming far better on these tracks, where he lays into it with relentless passion yet doesn't overplay, whereas, Kenwood Dennard goes so overboard at times you almost think the songs could blow apart. But despite that, there's still lots of cool stuff happening here, like the ominous \\"Nightmare Patrol\\" featuring a great fretless solo from Percy and a melody line that will give you nightmares for days. \\"Melaga Virgen\\" gets the thrashing of its life, and \\"Euthenasia Waltz\\" grows some fangs as well. There are also two band improvisations, of which \\"Isis Mourning\\" is the more successful. With some more work afterwards, this actually could've turned into a very rich composition. \\"Ish\\" has its moments but can't seem to find its legs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this product!

Sadly I had to stop the Primal Defense and the next day my rash was half gone. I don't know what they put in it, but I'm apparently allergic to it. I've never had a reaction to probiotics like that.

It actually says \\"vegetarian, gluten-free\\" on the label, so it looks safe. But there's also this tiny asterisk on the nutrition percentages label that says, \\"The culture medium for probiotics is dairy; bacterial proteases utilize WHEAT, dairy, and soy. Culture mediums are generally consumed during the fermentation process.\\"Not good enough, Primal Defense. Fix that label ASAP.

I've been using Primal defence for about 3 years. I have suffered all my life with constipation,,pain so bad I have actually passed out. Since finding Primal defence I have been a normal human being. Two months ago when the cost went up and with Christmas coming I decided not to buy due to the cost. I am now reordering due to the severe pain. I can't live without it.

I look forward to reading Mr. Reston's forthcoming book on the bloody Muslim conquests of the Middle East, northern Africa, the Iberian Peninsula, Turkey and the Balkans, and their forcible conversion of millions throughout those lands, which were once predominantly Christian.

Too confusing for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Binchy, but not at her best","review":"The Irish storyteller describes the residents of a small town in interesting detail, with all their shortcomings and quirks. The difficulty with this book is that there are so many characters, it can be confusing. Binchy, after introducing most of them in the first part of the book, then spends a chapter on each one but it is easy to get lost. This tale seems more loosely connected than most of the author's wonderful stories. It's not a bad read, but definitely not her best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Binchy loves her characters and so will you","review":"If I had to specify one criterion which I use to decide whether I will like a piece of fiction, it is this: It must have characters that I care about. The best books have characters that I actually love, at least as long as I'm reading the book. Binchy, more than any writer of my acquaintance, LOVES her characters. Even those who are a bit irresponsible, even those who are weak, are portrayed with sympathy and understanding. \\"The Copper Beech\\" is vintage Binchy, populated with characters who are smart and not-so-smart, weak and strong, rigidly ethical and on the make. But we come to accept all of them as part of our cozy and deeply satisfying world. Besides being a terrific read, \\"The Copper Beech\\" will cause you to be a bit less judgmental of your fellow man, at least for awhile.Stan (wonteach@cei.net)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Binchy's best efforts","review":"I found this a disappointment from one of my favorite authors. The character development was sketchy and the simultaneous stories told separately hard to follow and ultimately unfulfilling.

The first story about Maddy was wonderful and it even made me cry, something books rarely make me do. I couldn't wait to read the next stories. They must be as great. Maura started out good but it tried to hard to pull at your heart and I didn't really like it. Then there was Eddie and that was SOOO good! It made me laugh and make me really happy. Then from there it went down. All it was were scandalous love affairs and just boredom. I kept waiting for the next Maddy or Eddie but it just didn't happen. Nora Kelly was alright, but the rest were just awful. Now I don't think much of Maeve Binchy. Such a shame since she can obviously write well like in those two chapters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, to be Irish!","review":"The Copper Beech isn't a book for those looking for alot of fast paced action. Instead it's the kind of book that is slow paced and one you don't want to have end. Maeve Binchy has once again written a book that takes the reader to Ireland and introduces you to a town called Shancarrig, and the huge copper beech tree which watches over the town's school. Each character is explored, many from the time they were born, until they reach adulthood. The children at the school are often poor, such as Maura, who has grown up with an alcoholic father, but manages to make a good life for herself and her son, Michael, who is born with Down's Syndrome. And Maddie Ross, the school teacher, who has a secret love with the town's young priest. I listened to this on Recorded Books audio and the narrator had a beautiful Irish accent which just enhanced the story. I enjoyed every minute of it, as I have all of Maeve Binchy's other stories. A must for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel-Good Book","review":"This book is just like a soothing balm, about hopes, dreams, friendship and love.

Those seemed to address both the ups and downs of life. The Copper Beech seems more focused on the despairs. It is not poorly written, just a bit of a downer. Definitely not something to read if you are pregnant, as I am at the moment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedestrian","review":"I had never read Binchy and was not expecting much, since she regularly appears on bestseller lists. The entire plot can be summarized by the last chapter in which all of the characters lives are resolved into happy, rewarding ones with a wave of Binchy's word processor. Conflicts are resolved offstage, probably because she cannot write about anything more intense than a walk in the woods. Married couples are rewarded with precisely 3 children by the book's end and self-sacrificing types, like Maura, who is a thief and blackmailer, are given the town's love and sympathy. The world Binchy is writing about never existed; she completely ignores the challenges of historical setting and character development for the pablum of pop fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good vignettes","review":"This vignette-style novel presents the lives of eight people who carved their names, as children, in the copper beech tree in the small Irish town of Shancarrig.It was an interesting way to present these people's lives and the reader saw the life of the town through each person's eyes as well. We see that often, not all is as it appears, that those who seem to have it made really don't. Binchey allows us to see the daily struggles that occur in each person's life. The storylines criss-cross throughout the book and present a fairly complete picture of the years during which the stories occur and of the characters.While not as sweet as some of Binchey's other books, I still felt that I got to know and care about the well-developed characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"??????","review":"This book exposes the faults and failures of the government's case against James Earl Ray as glaringly as television exposed the faults in the state's case against O.J.

(Perhaps that is why his lawyers were co-erced into pleading the case.) In the \\"Murkin Conspiracy\\" every piece of evidence, motive, and opportunity is laid out and examined.

I never knew about the man's background (hey I saw his ribbons on his chest) until I caught a History Channel episode, where a reporter described him as \\"a Southern Country Gentleman,\\" indeed. He never raised his voice, never swore (yeah USMC go figure), and had a command presence that was palpable. There was never any doubt who was in command. Fire is not about Major Thompson, per se.

My comparisons are to V-Rally 2 which is also available for playstation. It appears that the physics of car motion in CM2 are slightly more realisting to VR2 and the crashes/damage is more realistic. In straight Rally mode, where it's you against the clock, CM2 has the edge. Where CM2 really loses is in it's arcade mode where you can race against others head to head. The car lacks any \\"feeling\\" and slides around too much. This is where VR2 is much better. VR2 has a \\"Trophy\\" mode which retains the realistic characteristics available in rally mode but allows you to race head to head with others.The Verdict: If you are interested in realistic Rally Mode with damage, etc, racing solo on track against other drivers' times, CM2 is the way to go. If you do a lot of racing with buddies, or like racing against other cars on track, VR2 is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best rally game out there, hands down.","review":"Without any doubt, this is probably one of the best rally games out there.The graphics are unbeatable for the Playstation and are eye-popping. All of the details on Colin's and the other cars are very accurate.The gameplay is exceptional. CMR2 now features Arcade mode for an extra option than just Rally mode. The track selection in Arcade mode ranges in difficulty, and a few secret tracks will also become available after winning championships.Rally mode is even better than the first CMR with a very wide selection of rallies with the same 9 stages for each rally.Basically, there aren't any serious drawbacks. The control will be loose because it's a rally car. And in the WRC, there is no such thing as a racing line. So everything's about sliding.Without any doubt, It's definitely a must-buy and makes a great gift to an international motorsports fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best auto racing games there is","review":"This has to be one of the best auto racing games out.

It's too bad they never achieved mainstream popularity and made it big, because I would have loved to hear what they would have come out with next. Oh, and song 4 from this album starts off amazingly like \\"Enter Sandman\\", but it was released 2 years before Metallica's \\"black\\" album, so you can judge their talent level for yourself! A definite recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lunch Lessons- Not A Cookbook","review":"I guess I was thinking the was more of a cookbook, but instead it IS a Lesson, or more like a lecture on lunch programs.Good if you are interested in the subject, but only offers very minimum recipes and NO Pictures.

I was trying to be frugal and get some less expensive bar tape. The carbon texture is a bit shiny and I worried that it might be slick in the rain, but it felt fine when wet. On the bike, this bar tape works as well as any other.After a couple of months I needed to remove it for some cable maintenance. Well, that is when I found this tape not to be such a great deal. The adhesive on the underside of the tape is strong and when removing the tape, it tore apart, leaving only a strip of material on the bar where the adhesive backing was.After picking, peeling, and using some adhesive remover, I was finally able to remove the rest of the tape. I still have 2 packs of bar tape that will go unused. Anyone out there who needs to rewrap their bars and would not need to rewrap them again for a while, this might be the tape for you. Hey maybe I'll send you a pack. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Cause","review":"I agree with Cyndi Lauper's comment in the new Rollingstone magazine--that this song \\"sounds like a Pepsi commercial.\\" Billy Joel also agreed. Both Cyndi and Billy lent their voices to an excellent cause that night along with 45 other stars, that helped to save thousands of starving people in Africa. So even it wasn't the best song ever written, it certainly did a lot of good. Some of the outtakes are a lot of fun. And this was a history making moment that will probably never be repeated again, and one that will be forever remembered as \\"check your egos at the door.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great condition","review":"I bought this for my mom and had it shipped directly to her and it arrived in a timely fashion and was in great condition.

All the homes in this book are built on false premises of consumerist culture. There is no attempt to make the houses affordable or challenging the notion of domestic living.

What was that strange thing that woke me up that afternoon telling me to buy this CD???...I still find it creepy.Anyway, I've only gotten through 15 songs of this 30 track CD {basically because I can't stop listening CD #1 long enough to hear CD #2}, and I'm convinced that J.

His music is so diverse, it can pump you up, or put you to sleep. His music bares meaning with melodic soothing and symphonic harmony, and can you carry your thoughts and mind to any time frame you desire.

He's one of the guitar Gods that plays instrumental rock like no one else on this planet. This set justifies my statement. I own ALL of his albums, and even though this is just a compilation of his best songs, I'm still buying this one for my collection, and it includes 2 bonus songs!From fast rock to slow & soft melodies, Satriani's got them all covered. Let him take you on a journey starting with \\"Surfing with the Alien\\" followed by \\"Satch Boogie.\\"Then follows with \\"Always with me, Always with You\\" to calm down the pace a little bit and give you an idea of his talent.From those who enjoy rock to those that enjoy good instrumental music, this set has it all.You'll enjoy this set from start to end.

If you're an Ash fan you will happily add this to your collection. If not yet an Ash fan, this disk shows 2 stages of one of rocks enduring legends. Wishbone Ash never stumbles live.

It had none of the emotional content of 'kids' and the it was not as serene nor dramatic as 'kids' either.It's ok to make these street films but you must move on and do other things...they all become the same movie after a time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid and Interesting","review":"Directed by Larry Clark (Kids) - a relatively honest portrayal of a group of 7 latino skateboarders from south central L.A., who really just want to be left alone to skate and be kids, without the politics of the circumstances around them. They decide to go skate in Beverly Hills, where they think they will be left alone, but the harrassment and tragedy continue. Out of the original 7 kids, 2 are lost (one arrested and one shot). The kids are not actors and play themselves, which I never would have known had I not read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh, really bad","review":"Anyone who would give this more than three stars either knows the director or is on drugs. This is at least in the top ten worst movies I've ever seen. And I like the director's other movies. But its a little much when he's zooming in on a young boy's butt while he's skateboarding. Its a good movie if you want to look at shirtless little boys. Anyone who grew up skating or into punk rock will find parallels to their own life here, but that doesn't make it a good movie. All of the guys are very dull. The plot is poorly executed. And I guess the movie tries to make some point about class struggle??? Overall, it's just a dumb movie. I doubt this guy's movies make money anymore... so he must be rich or just know people. He is probably the guy who fell down the stairs in the Beverly Hills Mansion (For those who've struggled through actually seeing the film). Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever...","review":"There are exactly two funny reasons to fast forward thru the teen-boy crazed director's latest Wassup Rockers... and both involve the B-movie/cartoon style deaths of a couple of icky-campy-celebs in tacky-bev-hills. Just don't expect much else, certainly none in the area of the \\"usual\\". Mr. Clark should put that \\"artistic\\" horndog energy towards a 21Cen film that OUT does the original Penthouse-produced Caligula...god knows the news is full of stories about teen wolfpacks wrecking havok & partying non-stop.If anyone could pull in major celebs and mix in \\"real\\" porn, he's the guy 4 the job. Terry Richardson could co-direct and Tom Ford could produce...now that would be a HOOT and a sureFIRE hit! We kinda need something back on screen to WAKE everyone up...and make them SMILE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very engaging movie, real, imperfect but great.","review":"This movie was a lot of fun. It had me hooked from the beginning. Latino skater kids from \\"the ghetto\\" generally just doing what they feel like. Great characters, acting and scenes. Over the top at times, but still excellent. Will watch again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Moments","review":"This movie's pretty funny, I guess it appealed to me because I went through many similar situations and the kids in the film are funny to watch as they go through their adventure in order to skate in Beverly Hills. \\"We from the ghetto!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells","review":"This product is poisonous. I can say that is not true for all of them, my friend bought the same mat, and it was OK. My theory is that someone returned the mat, and they spray it with poison for re-sale. Anyways, my mat smells so bad, it stunk up a 2000 sq ft yoga room, and I had to leave. The poison foamed up when I swet onto it. This is very different from the rubbery smell that is normal.Don't buy it! It could poison you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice mat","review":"The mat is really cute, and does not slip at all. The only thing I don't like is that it is a little too long and it would be nice if it was slightly thicker."},{"rating":"1","title":"there is such a thing as too sticky","review":"This mat may have a design flow, or perhaps it was rolled up before paint on the cute paisley pattern dried up. Layers were stuck together and it was hard to unroll. In the process, the paisly design ripped bits of the bottom side of the mat. I suppose it's still functional, but my brand new mat looks pretty awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Satisfied","review":"I just got the mat and went to unroll it but it is stuck together, expecially where the paisley patterns are so that when I unrolled it chinks of the mat came off. Very poor quality and I'm unsaitsfied. I would not recommend getting this mat."},{"rating":"2","title":"the print sticks...","review":"I think this mat is pretty but I had the same problem as others that when I first unrolled the mat, the ink from the paisley stuck to the mat and I had to rip little chunks out of the mat to get it unrolled. I thought it was just my bad luck to get this, but it seems others have had the same problem.otherwise, it seems to work fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slippery mat! Useless","review":"I bought this mat recently, nothing wrong with the packaging.However, when I went to use it - it slips!!! Not on the ground, but the hands.

Ever since I've owned the video (when I was about 12) I've watched it hundreds of times. I am now a freshman in college and it is still a great inspiration for me. I have watched it so many times that I have it memorized. The acting is good, the originality of the storyline is good, and the ending is a total tear-jerker. I don't think I would have even reached college without the inspiration of this movie, never give up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the special features?","review":"Although I read the book this movie is based on and loved the film when it was released by Disney back in 1991, I was very disappointed that it didn't have any of the Special Features that warrant a DVD release. There wasn't any footage of how Disney used special effects to make it look like those horses were jumping off a 40-foot platform. There wasn't any interviews of actress Gabrielle Anwar nor any mention that the real Sonora Webster was impressed with how this actress accurately portrayed her. I would have rather bought the VHS and saved myself money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild Hearts Truly Can't Be Broken","review":"i LOVE this movie...i watched it in my us history class and it has lessons to do with history and real life. it takes place during the great depression and it shows people who have disabilities that they can do anything and it shows everyone how to be courageous. this is one of my favorite movies plus al is very handsome...=)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the movie---bummed that this item was incorrect for my dvd player","review":"Ok, I admit---it may have been my error, but if you are advertising something that is only compatible for players in certain areas of the world.

I grew up in the rural west and really thought Sanora's life was magical. The movie is based on real life events, and that always made Sonora's tale all the more fascinating.Now that I'm a mother and looking for inspiring, wholesome movies to add to our family collection, I'm really grateful for productions like this one. This movie still entertains me as an adult, and I know it will help teach my kids, that with a lot of hard work, they can accomplish anything they set their mind to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic family movie!","review":"I love this movie!

Well I fell in love with this emotional and inspiring movie. It became my all time favorite movie... I made my Dad rent it over and over again. Now as an adult I still can't get enough of it, I enjoy it everytime I watch it. The fact that it was based on a true story really gets me everytime. If you haven't seen this movie then you are missing out big time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"I gave this 4 stars because the movie popped out of its clip and was bouncing again within the box.

It's absolutely inspiring and has a beautiful love story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Lead Actress & Inspiring Story","review":"My VHS copy is so good of this I never got around to buying the DVD, but I will because it's worth it.That's because this a nice, old-fashioned film and Gabrielle Anwar as \\"Sonora Webster\\" was a pleasure to watch. I'm sorry she never developed into a major star, although she's stayed busy in her acting career.This is a based-on-a true story and if a woman really performed diving horse acts while blind, well, that IS incredible. It makes this film certainly an inspiring story.I enjoyed looking at the recreation of the Atlantic City Boardwalk during its heyday. Overall, the colors could have been better in this film, however. There was too much brown, but it's not a major problem.The story is the man thing here and in that aspect, it's a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"inspiring, emotional, and AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I saw this movie at school one day and fell in love with it.

I wasn't able to watch it until about a month after I got it and then when I did, it turned out to be counterfeit. It won't play on any of my DVD players, including my PS2. It keeps coming up with a message saying that the disc cannot be played because of \\"regional restrictions\\". I am very disappointed because I waited forever and then wasn't able to watch it.

Sadly enough i have read that horses jumping in tanks of water from 40 foot above is something that did actually happen and that this movie was made recently after it ended. Disney supported in other words the abuse of animals and injury inflicted upon both animals and humans alike. There was supposedly a horse that an owner of a diving horse took to jump into the ocean instead of a pool. This horse looked toward shore but instead went to the sea instead of land.People went out in boats to get but it just turned it head took one last look at the sea and ducked its head into the water for good rather than to go back to the abusive job it had before and the tormenting it faced"},{"rating":"2","title":"A story that will touch your heart forever!","review":"I love this movie more than words can say. I was such a sweet story, you can't help but love it. Gabrielle Anware did a fantastick job of portraying Sanora, who joins a diving show. It is heart-breaking when she looses her sight, but it fills you with hope when her dreams come true."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY! WHY! WHY! WHY!","review":"I guess I really should be saying thanks to Disney for saving me money this month by not having to buy a movie I was so excited for instead of complaining, but its just so disappointing. Why can all of the recent crap that's been in movie theaters and on TV get decent DVD releases, but when it comes time to put a classic-type film out for the general public that Disney has the intelligence of one its most beloved characters - Dopey! Can anyone give me a reason - even a bad one - why this wasn't at least released in both widescreen (as it was made and shown in theatrically) as well as the inferior full screen. I have a Hi-Def 16x9 television and movies released in the 1.33:1 aspect ratio certainly don't fill up my screen.

Sure, no skipping or halts. However, even hooked up to an HDTV via HDMI, the resolution was terrible, and tons of shadowboxing, ghosting, and pixelation. And I don't know if it was how the movie was shot, but the lighting and backdrop colors were HORRIBLE. Either the scenes were too bright or the skies were some weird, bright pastel color.This is the first and last time I bother doing a VOD rental. I'll stick to renting the actual disc. Glad I didn't pay a thing for it as I had a promotional credit.OBTW, the movie was okay - still say Prisoner of Azkaban was the absolute best. Not exactly a fun diversion - I think I chuckled once or twice. It was all dread, sorrow, anger, and angst the rest of the time. The big problem with splitting it up in to two movies - it's all lead up, no resolution. Makes you think they should only charge half the price?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money","review":"The lighting levels in virtually every scene are so dim that you would be far better off to simply re-read the book. Paying to look at a video that consists of a totally black screen for two thirds of a 2 1/2 run time is utterly ridiculous.I am ticked off at this.

Boring, non-involving and poorly acted. Note to the actors: staring off into the distance with a perpetually concerned expression does not qualify as good acting! Nor does a dark, moody atmosphere qualify for a mature movie. I'm tired of this grossly misguided philosophy that \\"dark\\" somehow equals \\"mature\\" or \\"adult\\". Anything but a mature work, HPATDH plays as if it were written by an untalented teenager, with no sense of pacing, character, or where to place emphasis.The movie also suffers from a severe case of tonal inconsistency, mixing bad comedy with eye-rolling melodrama. And should I mention the effects? No, let's be nice. Let's just say I have the strong suspicion that most of the budget ended up in the actor's pockets.I am amazed at how easily people are amused by this over-blown kiddie matinee.Don't like my review?

How dumb of me to not know this when ordering on-line. Even if you bought in personyou would have to open the case up to see this.

However, it looks like they cut corners on the special effects. There are numerous scenes where it looks like the cgi isn't composited properly. The colors don't resolve very well on the screen and it looks like the copy is muddy or murky. I'm told it plays like this in the theater as well so it's not the dvd copy, which I thought at first, but for some reason they skimped on the cgi. Which seems odd. It plays like a cheap b-movie on late night television. What a shame.

This is without a doubt one of the worst movie transfers I have ever seen. HORRIBLE!!! I bought the 2 disc special edition DVD first. My initial thought was that Warner Bros had purposefully sabotaged the DVD quality in order to provoke people into investing in BluRay, which would then reveal the true potential of quality. So I returned the 2 disc special edition DVD for the DVD/BluRay combo. Alas! The BluRay was just as horrible. I know it's hard to wait, but I would really encourage people to NOT let Warner Bros make a profit on such a shoddy product: reject this release.

Sure, we watch it because we love the books and characters and yes I will see part II for the same reason, but this movie is not well done.

Around 1/4 way through, I ceased caring about Harry Potter and the whole confusing mess and stuck it out for another 1/3 until I gave up and went to bed. I fast-forwarded through the rest of it this afternoon while my wife secluded herself so she could watch it later. I felt the same way about the books as the series progressed, so it's not surprising. It's also got the darkest (literally) cinematography and lighting I've ever seen on film.

It would have been helpful if the product description had made this clear. And, after downloading the digital copy for hours, it would not play on my ZEN.

In part, this one seems like a prelude to the next movie, rather than an independent chapter in the series.

I believe that a movie should be it own creature, best suited to its medium, and not be slavishly bound to the source material. Clearly, these movies have been made to please the readers of the books. That makes a ton of money, but not necessarily the best movies possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Great for long trips in the car. Works on U.S. PSP's.

The special effects are impressive and the acting is right on the mark. Especially well-played is the part played by Helena Bonham Carter as she plays the demented and crazy wizard Bellatrix Lestrange. As a fantasy movie it is splendid; as an adaptation of the book it is quite good. Clocking in at 140 minutes it feels a bit short and I wish they could release an extended version of the film.

However, this is the worst one, mainly because it looks like most of it was filmed in the dark and it is very difficult to see the action going on through most of the film. You can still have dark overtones and still have a few lights on so you can see what's going on. Don't these directors review them before they say \\"print\\"?

Awful.","review":"It must be possible these days to feed a text into a machine which transfers words directly to images because, unlike the previous films, Deathly Hallows Part 1 almost resembles the first half of the novel exactly. This unfortunately does not work in the film's favor, precisely because the trend of the last few films was to dispense with a great deal of material from the books (and consequently improve upon them) in favor of giving us films which were incoherent as a series but which, for the most part, stood well on their own aesthetically. And while this more impressionistic style of film-making didn't sit well with the Harry Potter purists, cinematically it was very respectable. Now, however, the filmmakers have decided to give the purists what they want . . . to the detriment of the film, not least because Deathly Hallows the novel was such a mess to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"Poor visual quality, poor sound quality, poorly done story line.

Being a \\"part 1\\" there is a lot more exposition than the last 4 films: These characters have grown up and changed, the audience needs to catch up with the Harry,Ronald, Hermoine trio before that final conflict. The screenwriter, as always, did a marvelous job of capturing the feel of the book and compressing it into length of this film.The dvd/blu-ray itself is just fine.

In a \\"Complete Movie Collection\\" with all the other films, and 3. Possibly as an \\"Extended Edition\\" combined with Part 2.

The quality is so bad I was actually wondering if I might have somehow received a bootleg DVD -- until I remembered that I had ordered straight from Amazon. Even the legalistic warnings at the beginning and end are fuzzy and grainy.I too have to conclude this was intentional, and feel cheated and disrespected by the studio.

As I watching this DVD, it started skipping, just a little at first and then so badly that I had to skip entire scenes...

The world is falling apart and Voldemort is getting set at his wizarding world take over. This movie in particular seems to put Harry and crew in more adult situations. Rather than getting punched by Malfoy, the penalty for failure in this movie is death. I really liked this movie. The only problem I had was a very adult sequence where Ron imagines Harry and Hermione together. They are not clothed when this happens. You don't see any nudity, but we are a far cry away from when the actors seemed like they were in 5th grade.I still recommend this movie and will be seeing the last on in the theaters in about a month!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice movie!","review":"Well there's not much to say, the movie is great and the price was awesome $15 for the dvd, digital copy and blu ray + features, so basically it's a lot of content for such a great price.

Anything longer, and you have to cut a lot out.This movie is very true to the first half of the book, and I'm delighted that they managed to cram in as much as they did.It's all at least as well done as the rest of the series, in other words, superlative, and I'm very happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faster than a speeding bullet!!!","review":"Good thing, I read the Deathly Hallows in the book.

The first hour is very disjointed, everyone is around but I couldn't figure out why. It is obvious this is just a lead-in to make a two part conclusion of the series. It would have been better to combine Parts 1 & 2 and edit them to make one feature length movie to end the series. You have to have it if you have the rest of the series and the producers know it.

He never learns any emotional self control, and everyone is keeping secrets from everyone else. This movie developed slowly and then crept along at a snail's pace. You simply want to slap the characters and say \\"Get on with it!\\".

The first six movies, though, are enjoyable. For the most part, they are a nice mix of tension and comedic relief. However, when the Deathly Hallows Part I credits started to roll, my first reaction was: That's it!? The tension throughout the movie was constant and high. About midway through the film when our heroes were beset once again with trouble, it thought \\"ho, hum, there's another set back.\\" Because of the consistent level of tension, I had no sense that the film was even coming to an end, and was taken quite by surprise at the suddenness of the ending. It held no dramatic effect whatsoever for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark and disappointing","review":"Not your usual Harry Potter movie. Many scenes were dark and hard to see.

However, upon watching the blu ray, I discovered that there were quite a few scenes missing. I was VERY disappointed. Why did they remove scenes??? Now, I have to try the find the real version & buy it all over again. What a rip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This movie follows the book really well. Before it came to theaters, I was wondering, \\"Where are they going to cut this movie in half?\\" The ending did seem a little abrupt, but I thought it was a good place to end it. I laughed, I cried (Yes, I literally balled my eyes out in the theater. So did my mom, and she's never read the books or watched the previous movies). She said that it was a little hard to follow because she hadn't read or seen Harry Potter before, but there's not much they can do to backtrack and explain everything or else you'd end up with a movie that's 10 hours long. I'd recommend catching up before watching it, but it definitely doesn't disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Overrated","review":"So dark that you can't see the movie--must be the computer generation uses no light so the first 40 minutes of the movie are so dark that you can't see it. I'm sure it would be good if it wasn't in total darkness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie - terrible transfer.","review":"I purchased this movie after seeing it in theatres and it is clearly a masterpiece of film makingHowever, in the Blu-Ray transfer there's an abboration in the anamorphic lens used to make the transfer that causes the image to be non-square and a light bar to appear running down the left side of the image, approximately 20% of the way into the image, that appears and disappears approximately every fifteen minutes. On any sort of good viewing equipment this is noticable and highly distracting.The audio, on the other hand, is a superb mix, possibly one of the best I've ever heard, with more detail than was available in the theatrical release thanks to the additional bandwidth available on a Blu-Ray disc compared to the DD/DTS/SDDS tracks on the film print.Overall, although this is a great film, this review only receives two stars because for such a major release Warner Brothers should have double checked the digital transfer from film, and it's clear that they didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry potter!","review":"Good show.

The description was a little vague giving no other description other than \\"Blu-ray\\", but the price was consistent with other Blu-ray + DVD + digital copy combo packages I have purchased through Amazon and so I placed my order for this \\"Deluxe\\" combo set.

There's some dropped stuff (Harry not in disguise at the wedding), some unlikely continutity problems caused by the Cuaron films (look, the Burrow arose from the ashes !)but especially relative to HP6, this follows the story well without amy \\"helpful\\" additions.The biggest disappointment in the deleted scenes is the cuts of scenes with the Dursleys. the scene in the movie (Vernon staring at Harry staring at Vernon) would have ben much more powerful with the inclusion of the scenes with Dudley and Mrs. Dursley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the extras for DVD users?","review":"I am a huge Harry Potter fan and pre-ordered the single DVD version of the movie. When I realized that there were no extras on it I actually considered buying the 3-disc blu-ray DVD combo pack, but apparently you can't watch the extras on DVD. What's up Warner Bros?

If you liked the Harry Potter movies, then you should like this movie. My complaint is that the movie was obviously not filmed in 3D. The conversion from 2D to 3D has added some depth to many of the scenes, but there are no scenes where anything jumps off the screen at you. I have Avatar, Green Lantern, Mysterious Island 2, and Journey to the Center of the Earth all in 3D and those movies have numerous excellent scenes where 3D effects are amazing. There are times in them that makes one want to duck or blink one's eyes. There are no such scenes in this 3D version of Deathly Hallows 1.

This rating is only for the DVD itself- I though the film itself was one of the best (and definitely the most loyal) Potter film to date. But why are there no options for special features for DVD buyers? I was looking forward to purchasing a special edition two disc DVD loaded with special features for a fan like me, only to realize the only feature was additional scenes. No behind the scenes footage. No preview for the upcoming movie. No-that's only for people with a Blu Ray player. You think with the economy the way it is WB would realize many people can't afford higher priced products like a Blu Ray player, and it's unfair to make all the good features exclusive to that disc. It didn't make me want to buy a player-it just made me mad. If they do this for the final film I will be sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not 1-star because of the film...","review":"...it's because this is the lousiest transfer of film-to-DVD that I have ever purchased.

Not even the 'stop' button worked. Adding insult to injury, the movie froze part way in, and my DVD player has to be rebooted, forcing us to watch the trailers again.

Harry is nothing more then hype in this movie and is dragged around being saved by the whole good guy gang thru this whole Lobsterfest. Please give Harry some kind of power how can he be a hero of any sort when he can't wipe his own bum. How this painful excuse for a Harry Potter film gets a A- rating is beyond me. This movie should have been one hour long, but oh no we have to pad this snoozefest out to make two long and very boring sleep aids (maybe part two will have more action). This film would make my list of biggest disappointments for 2010, so if you have not seen this film I would wait for a cheap rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most disappointing of the series","review":"Being very familiar with the books (and with hope that the movie would try to follow the excellent story) I was very disappointed with this production. All the creativity and artistry was sheared away; leaving an almost actionless, abysmal rendition. Deathly hallows describes the ability of director David Yates. If this production was a Hogwarts end-of-year feast, in the main it would be very tasteless and dry. Steve Kloves, the screenwriter, is to disappointing as emo-folks are to sad. I wasted sixty-five bucks on part 1 (I thought it would be a good family activity) but the franchise won't get another dime. I'll probably donate this same amount to the suicide crisis center in my city because I am sure those who endure part 2 may be calling said hotline. It was horrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boo","review":"Most hyped up and also the most disappointing of all the movies so far.

What I do, is I think of them as two separate story lines, because, with the exception of the fifth in my opinion, the movies themselves are fantastic. The effects are good, and when I read the books now, I can't help but imagine these actors saying some of the lines. The last movie will be the end of an era, because it is hard to argue how astonishing this series is and what it has become.

Previously, the wand fights were a little slow and nothing you hadn't seen before. In this film, the wand fights are unexpected and like something from a shoot out in a cops and robbers film.The performances are excellent, and the quality of the film as a whole is very good.

The third watching attempt was a few days past 30 days and it would stick with no option to get to the movie. The DVD version plays just fine. After a little struggle, Amazon made a one time exception and replaced it. Now, after receiving it and deciding to watch it again I am encountering the same thing. This time I am SOL.

It's not a children's movie, even though younger kids will be drawn to it by the earlier productions in the series. My suggestion is to gauge whether a kid is ready for it by requiring that they read the book first. If they can get through the monstrously-sized novel, after reading the other Potter novels, then they're probably able to understand the events than unfold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expired code with Disk.

Much is left out of the movie, but I know that from seeing it in the theater rather than watching the DVD. The standard DVD is so dark that the screen is completely black in many places, with only voices rather than picture. Watching this DVD is kind of like listening to a very abridged audio book. And no, it is not my DVD player. I tried the DVD (two at this point) in another DVD player and on my MacBook with the same results.

The next one did the same thing. I have seen other reviews indicating the same problem. The picture is very grainy and pixielated. This is extremely noticeable and seriously distracting during the movie. This is apparently caused by the transition from film to digital. Warner Brothers should seriously fix this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie and it looked fine on Roku","review":"I read some of the complaints about the video quality, but we had no problem watching the movie through a DSL connection.

Any seller doubling, tripling, quadrupling, or as I see currently sextupling the price, should be ashamed of themselves. But if you're a buyer considering paying this amount for it, shame on yourself. You can watch the extras on you tube and they're not much to look at. Some day I'll end up with blu ray probably. I bought the combo pack when WB refused to make this a wide regular dvd release.

The butterflies get stuck in the elephant \\"nose\\" due to static eletricity. Even when I cut the nose to half it's original size and got it to kind of work my 3 year old got so bored with it really easily.

The concept is great, but it just can't do what it is supposed to do. There is not enough power in the fan to blow the butterflies through the nose like it should. They come out one at a time over a 3 minute period (except the ones that never end up coming out!) We're both really flusterated after only a few minutes. Not to mention that this toy is not for use on carpet. The little button doesn't want to stay pushed down. If they would make this toy in a better quality, it would be nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible toy","review":"I can't get this toy to work. This toy won't get the butterflies out. You can lose the butterflies eisily. My brother isn't having fun with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"I bought this toy for my 3 & 6 year old daughters because on the TV commercials it looked so cute and lots of fun with all the butterflies blowing out all over. Both my daughters begged for it and so Santa left it under the tree for them and they were so excited and couldn't wait to play with it Christmas morning. Well the toy is cute looking, but that's about as far as it goes. The fan just doesn't have enough power to blow the butterflies out other than maybe 5 or 6 of them. The rest just twirl around at the very bottom. We tried what the instructions say in case of that happening and it still didn't help! Even tried putting another set of brand new batteries in, but still nothing! Definately not worth the money as it's nothing like the TV advertises! Will be returning this toy for a refund!"},{"rating":"1","title":"no fun","review":"My daughter wanted this so bad for her 4th birthday, it was such a disappointment. The butterflies barely come out of the trunk! Not at all like they show it. My kids had more fun playing with the nets!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a HUGE disappointment and WASTE of $$","review":"This was a HUGE disappointment. I thought it would be an ideal gift for my son, but I've spent more money than I like to think about just to keep fresh batteries in it. As soon as the batteries start to wear down (which is pretty quickly), the fan slows down and the butterflies become stuck in the trunk. I'm sure my almost-four-year-old would give it five stars for fun if it always worked when he wanted to play with it, but because of this game, I've begun to ration my batteries. As other reviewers mentioned, there needs to be a lot more butterflies included. This could be a great game for kids if the manufacturers made a few changes, but as it is, I recommend that parents save their money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The butterflies refuse to come out!!!","review":"I was so excited to buy this for my three year old daughter. I figured it would reinforce counting and colors as well as eye hand coordination. When we started playing, the butterflies took forever to shoot out. I opened it and mixed them around as the instructions stated but still only one or two popped out. The rest kept blowing around on the bottom. Very disappointing. After a while my daughter said \\"all done Mommy\\". She was bored standing there waiting for the butterflies. I dont blame her, I was bored myself. The fan worked fine and the trunk fully extended & I put fresh batteries so Im not really sure what went wrong. Its such a nice idea but Im sad to say its a lemon of a game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work correctly","review":"Bought it for my 2 year old and 4 year old neice and the fan is not strong enough to blow out the butterflies even with new batteries and we also cut off a couple of inches from the top and it didn't help. The girls finally took the trunk off and would place the butterflies in and turn it on and watch them blow around. A waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money. you will spend oodles on batteries","review":"The first game we ordered blew out about 2 of the butterflies in 60 seconds. brand new \\"radio shack\\" batteries. sent it back for a replacement as this is nothing like the commercial. The second one did not blow out any butterflies. I thought, maybe, I got bad batteries. Put in another new pair of batteries, this time an expensive name brand set. It then worked better, however, my 3, 6, and 8 yr. olds got bored waiting for the butterflies to blow out. I thought what would happen when these brand new batteries are not brand new? This replacement elefun is going back also. Great idea but needs some work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun..and great for adults too","review":"My 4 year old daughter really likes this game. I agree with others that more butterflies would be nice and you do spend alot of time picking up the butterflies and setting up for a new game. It would be nice if each game lasted longer, but my daughter didn't seem to mind. We just kept playing A LOT of games in a row. It's very easy to set up for a new game and it's fun for adults to play along because catching the butterflies isn't as easy as you may think. We had alot of laughs and alot of running around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun","review":"My son asked for this game for his 4th birthday. When he got it he was so excited. We have played this game so many times since his birthday party. He loves it. He loves catching the butterflies in his net and than count them. This game is fun for the whole family to play."},{"rating":"1","title":"wouldn't recommend it","review":"I wouldn't recommmend this game. The butterflies will not fly out even after following the instructions. It seems that the motor is not strong enough. I can't say that more butterflies would be any better seeing how the ones it comes with can't make it past the base. If I hold the base firmly to the ground, it works somewhat better. I foresee a trip to the refund counter with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Effort","review":"This toy looked like a great buy when I saw it on TV. Santa left it under the tree and we thought it would be a great family game. Of course, it does not work at all like it says. The butterflies do not come out of the elephant, except for maybe 5 (out of 30). We tried and tried to fix the problem with no success. Their is not enough fan power to blow them out the top. It says they should all come out in about 2 minutes, but when they don't we gave up. I do not recomment buying this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a stronger motor","review":"I was very disappointed. I saw the commercial and thought this game would be great for my children (ages 3 and 6).We set it up and it actually worked great once (the butterflies shot out fast), however ever since that one time it seems the motor is not strong enough. The button on the bottom is not level with the actual bottom of the elephant, so even if it sits on a hard surface, the motor is still not strong enough to shoot out butterflies fast. It seems to take about 2 minutes to shoot out 1, meanwhile the kids have already lost interest.It is a shame because the game looks like a great deal of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"lots of fun!!","review":"I bought this game for my daughter when she was 2 and at a little over 3 she still loves it. When my nephew and neice come over, who are 5 & 6 they love it also. They laugh the entire time they play it! I think it could be made a little more fun if they were to add music to the game when it its turned on, especially when it is played with just two players. I actually found that the batteries seem to last quite a while, we do have a little trouble with some butterflies getting stuck halfway up the trunk, but the kids are more than excited to tap the trunk and get the rest out-almost adds to the suspense. We love it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"terriable","review":"This was the most waste of money I have ever spent. The butterflies don't even come out of the basket. The never make it up the trunk. They just fly around in the basket. I would never recommend this game to anyone.This was a real shame because it really looked cute on TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fluff those butterflies!!!!!!!!","review":"I initially gave this a bad review. My son got this for his birthday and we had the problem with the butterflies not coming out. I saw one reviewer mentioned to fluff them. I ignored that thinking it was not going to do anything. It made ALL the difference!!!!! Take the butterflies and poke the wings until they bend in the opposite direction (like you are turning a sock inside out). The wings will kindof make a cup shape instead of the flat circles. I can not believe how much of a difference that has made. Now of course it works too well. All the butterflies come out in less than 30 seconds. I would much rather have them all come out at once than 2 in 5 minutes. We have played that game at least 20 times already and my son has been just as excited about catching those butterflies the last time as the first time it worked correctly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looked like fun, but...the explosion of fun never came","review":"This toy was greatly anticipated at my dd 3rd birthday party! All the kids gathered 'round, clamoring to be the first ones to have their turn (4 nets), finally I turned it on! We waited in great expectation, and waited, and waited - finally, a butterfly popped out! We were on our way to super-duper-elefun - but then, nothing happened. That is pretty much the story of this toy. After 20 minutes, and about 7 butterflies, all the kids had dwindled away and left in boredom and I reboxed this toy and returned it. Worst of all, I still hear about how badly she wants the thing everytime the commercial comes on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great premise with little promise","review":"The idea of catching butterflies greatly apealed to my 4 year old since she is an avid lover of insects, but the game fell seriously short of my expectations. I agree with other reviewers who cannot get this toy to work effectively even with fresh batteries. My daughter tried for 30 minutes to get it to work, and was thrilled when one or two butterflies would finally flitter out of the elephant trunk. For the money this toy needs some serious modifications to make it a more reliable unit, and therefore worth spending my hard earned money. Also my child has better things to do than wait on a poorly designed game to work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's be creative","review":"We bought this game for our 4 and 2 year old, but our 7 year old enjoys is as well. It's great for hand and eye coordination and it is educational. When all of the butterflies are out we (4 and 2 yr old) count them as we put them back in and for my 7 year old - a lesson in math: How many butterflies are there? If you caught 10 and Anna caught 3 how many are on the floor.We haven't run across the problem with batteries and the bending of the wings works perfectly, but more butterflies would be nice. Maybe that will be our next craft project:)And I can't wait to test the nets for real butterfly catching."},{"rating":"1","title":"elephun game","review":"i thought my kids would love this toy, they are 2&5 years old.but the air that comes out when the game is turned on, isnt strong enough to shoot the butterflies out very well, and we did buy new batteries for this.out of all the butterflies only about 6 will actually make it out of the trunk for the kids to catch.sounds like a fun game, but i would not recommend this toy to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Help the Butterflies fly","review":"It is true that the butterflies do tend to get stuck in the trunk, so I cut them in half so they are just circles, now they don't get tangled with each other and hung up in the trunk."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISSAPPOINTED","review":"My mom bought THREE of these, the others did not work right.. you have to wait a long time for the butterflies to come out of the trunk.. it is a little dissappointing because it they do not come out. The fan is not strong enought to push the butterflies out. At the end my mom returned all of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as fun as it sounds","review":"I think the idea of this toy is great. There are multiple problems, however. First of all, be prepared to spend a lot of money on batteries, because it uses them up incredibly quick. Second, the fun to work ratio is about 10 seconds to three minutes. The butterflies fly out so quick that you'll find yourself setting it up again before you even realized that it had started. Also, my kids are 5 and 3 and very rarely were they able to actually catch a butterfly in their net. Third, it seems to have a design flaw in that I had to trim the trunk by about 30% in order for the motor to have enough strength to shoot all the butterflies out. Fourth, the nets themselves are very cheaply made and had to be \\"fixed\\" way too many times. Overall, I would say this toy was a little bit of fun, a whole lot of work, and way too much money wasted. We received ours as a Christmas present in 2003, and it's going out with the trash this week, November 2004."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON\\"T WASTE YOUR MONEY","review":"I bought this toy for my four year old daughter and 2 1/2 year old twin daughters, For what this game cost it should have been made more durable. This game is made so cheap that the nets break easy and the butterflies are made of paper. My kids were so excited to play this and once we set it up, they lost interest fast. the trunk is to long and weak so it doesn't really work that great. I think if they made it so it plugged in rather then using batteries it would have had more power. it looks a lot more fun on tv that is for sure. It is just a toy that will be packed away and not used any more. I will be writing to the company and telling them how unhappy I was with their product."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR QUALITY","review":"I am mother of two kids one 7 and 3 1/2. They asked Santa to bring this for Christmas. I was very disappointed right from the start with the poor quality of the fan. It does not have enough power after 3 or 4 rounds of playing. The kids had a lot of fun at first but were upset when the butterflies would not come out anymore. Of course this was returned much to the upsetment and disapointment of the kids. My sister-in-law also bought this for her kids same age as mine for Chirstmas and will be returning it also because of same complaints!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"return it!","review":"I agree, what a cute game. My 3 year old daughter loved the game. Squeals with delight when she is playing it. However, what a disappointment! We played the game for a maximum of 40 minutes before the batteries gave out. We also found alot of the butterflies do not blow out the trunk. I think this will be a return!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only worked for 1 day","review":"My kids had been asking for this game forever! I finally decided to buy it and was very disappointed. The fan didn't work for very long. I even changed the batteries a couple of times. The butterflies had trouble making it to the top of the elephants trunk. More irritating then fun! It just sits in the closet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy About ELEFUN!","review":"I bought ELEFUN for my son this past Christmas and I am really disappointed. The \\"butterflies\\" that are supposed to come out of the snout don't come out. The fan that pushes them up is not strong enough; they just sit at the bottom. What a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, but only with new batteries each time!","review":"This game is cute, silly, and perfect for toddlers. The bad news is that the butterflies only blow out if the batteries are brand new. After two or three rounds, the fan slows and no longer blows out the butterflies well, sending out maybe one or two every couple of minutes. When the batteries are first put in, it's a lot of fun. Half an hour later, it's no fun at all. I am returning this game. There are plenty of other cute. silly toddler games out there which do not require fresh batteries every day, such as Crocodile Dentist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short on fun","review":"My son received this as a gift. First, we had to help our child get the trunk to stand up so the things would blow out. Second, it worked a few times and then seemed to lose it's \\"umph\\". So, I changed the batteries. That didn't help, though. Pretty soon the fan stopped working enough to blow the pieces out of the trunk. My child was so disappointed I had to start \\"manually\\" throwing the pieces in the air so he could catch them with the net. This toy quickly was \\"out of sight-out of mind\\" and into the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply Made","review":"My 3 year old received this as a gift and loved it...the first couple times. By the 3rd or 4th time it was played, the tall sleeve (elephant's nose) had a split seam causing the fan to lose its force and the butterflies were no longer blowing out the top. Very disappointing. We tried to fix it and ultimately threw it away! It's a great idea; it just needs to be made of stronger material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful toy","review":"My son got this for his 3rd birthday. I was nervous because the reviews are so iffy, but I love it. The happy squeals my son makes when the butterflies come out make it so worth it. It really keeps his attention too, he'll play for over a half hour and beg for more. The adults all like it too, it's just a fun little game. I like how easy it is for him too, so there is no frustration while playing. It's not educational, but not every game needs to teach something."},{"rating":"1","title":"fun when it works","review":"I found an ELEFUN game at a garage sale about 6 years ago and had never heard of it before. My boys played and played with it. It seemed to eat up the batteries rather qickly but they absolutly loved it. After a couple of years the fan stopped working, but to our delight they started advertising it on tv so we bought a new one. The newer model was a real disappointment. The fan never really worked and the butterflies came out about one per minute if you hold the trunk open and tap the side- not what any of us had in mind. Sad that they haven't quite got it right yet- very fun when it worked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting Game!","review":"I got this out for playgroup the other day and the kids had a blast with it. You turn it on the trunk goes up every child gets a net and when the air blows the butterflies come flying out...The kids practically fall over each other trying to catch the butterflies. Not a game I would try to let younger children play with older children for that reason. The little ones might get hurt. I let the 2yrs and up group play it. The only complaint I would have is I wish the on/off switch was not a switch and was button instead so the younger 2-3yr olds can start it and stop it as they wish. The trunk is also difficult to screw on and off because the game is so quick an adult has to sit there turn it off take the trunk off let the kids put the butterflys back in, screw the trunk back on straighten the trunk and turn it back on just so you can do it all over again in 5secs. I would prefer it were more child friendly so the kids can do that themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great idea, but it doesn't work!","review":"This is a very cute idea for a toy, and my young child was charmed as we took it out of the box. After we assembled the nets and inserted the batteries, we turned it on and just...waited. Two butterflies came out, and the rest just swirled around inside the base of the toy.

Notice how it seemed to work the first few times, then the butterflies just stopped coming out?

Oh well...it was a good idea anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUTTERFLIES DO NOT COME OUT","review":"LOOKS LIKE A PRETTY FUN GAME...IF THE BUTTERFLIES WOULD COME OUT.

Within the first few seconds, about half of the butterflies come out. It is actually fun, and, as one of the other reviewers said, it is harder to catch the butterflies than it looks. After that half comes out, we just sit there and wait. The butterflies don't come out. I've tried shaking the elephant to \\"unstick\\" some of the butterflies. That may produce an additional 1-2 butterflies..nothing more. I may try cutting the trunk to see if that helps.

Unfortunately it works very poorly. The air pressure to hold the trunk up is terrible. My 5 year old is of course too short to stand the trunk up herself, so I am constantly up and down standing the trunk up during her game play.The butterflies shoot out in a big poof when its first started, a child can only catch one at a time. Then after the first initial poof one single butterfly will shoot out about every 5 minutes. My daughter has literally went to her room to play or do something else and says \\"Mommy call me when another butterfly is ready to come out\\"And with these large delays in butterflies, you are left to believe they are all out and you can begin another round over again, but then you open it up to put the other butterflies back only to find that over half of the butterflies are still inside.I definitely would not reccomend this game to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun, simple game that encourages hand eye cordination","review":"I got this for my daughter when she was almost three. This is always a game we can pull out when we want to have some fun and be silly for awhile. Yes, sometimes the butterflies get stuck, but just tap on the trunk and they come right out. Our original trunk did rip and after being disappointed twice with the replacement trunk that I ordered, I bought a new game when it was on sale. It was worth it! I have given this game as a gift as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"This game would have been more fun if there were about 100 more butterflies.

Which kid wouldn't love it! However this toy is awful. The butterflys get stuck easily in the body. The trunk never fully extends so at times the butterflies get trapped. The motor is no where near powerful enough to blow out the butterflies. I could put up with having to refill it every couple of minutes and replace the batteries often if it worked, but it doesn't. It just becomes frustrating and the kids get disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shaking my head...","review":"I bought this several years ago when it first came out, it was in the trash a couple weeks later... The game doesn't let the butterflies come out consistantly. I found myself sitting with my then 2 year old unfolding butterflies because that is the only way I could get a few to fly out for her. She enjoyed it but I just couldn't stand it anymore! For the couple of butterflies that would pop out and the 10 minutes it took to unfold them all and then trying to keep the nets on the net handle this was too much of a hassle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Elefun is a real fun game to play.My little daughter Sammy loves it, it is one of her most loved toys.

You have to manually lift the trunk each time and she is not nearly tall enough to do it. The butterflies fly out in less than 20 seconds. They come out almost all at the same time. It's nearly impossible to catch more than one or two. Then you have to turn it off, take off the head, gather the buttflies and put them in, turn it on, lift the trunk and repeat the whole process! I'm taking it back tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isn't a fun toy","review":"This toy was giving a review on a parents website as being good for a children with special needs. I disagree.

They would just land on the carpet and there was no need to use the enclosed nets to catch the butterflies. Needless to say, my 5 yr old daughter was very upset that it would not work and we took it back for a full refund.Sadly, I would not recommend this game to anyone as it does not work as advertised on tv. The power of the fan in the elephant's trunk is not enough to get the butterflies shooting out of the trunk as shown on tv."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SO ELEFUN!!!","review":"(...) I bought this game to use at my daughter's 6th birthday party. BIG mistake! Luckily I put new batteries in the game and tested it with my other daughter(age 5) before the party. The fan is NOT strong enough to blow the paper thin butterflies up the elephant's trunk. The trunk does not stay inflated all the way. I found that I had to hold it up and open in order to let one lonely butterfly finally fly up the trunk after a few minutes. I am a pretty patient person, however, I did not think the same would be true for a group of 5 and 6 year olds. Even my daughter told me to take it back to the store. I took her advice and returned it! Very disappointing! The picture on the box is very disceiving!

I read the \\"troubleshooting\\" portion of the directions which state, \\"stir the butterflies up if they don't come out\\", but that doesn't help. After the first 5 butterflies come out, the rest remain inside. Not too much fun. My kids were dissapointed, and so am I!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A better idea","review":"Give your child a spoon or a net and set a bowl of rocks in front of them. Wait until the law of gravity expires and the rocks lift out of the bowl. Then catch the rocks.You would probably have more fun doing that than waiting for the butterflies to come out of the elephants trunk. It's a nice idea, and would be fun if it worked. It needs a higher powered fan because it just doesn't lift the butterflies out. We get maybe 3 or 4 butterflies out. As the box suggests \\"if the butterflies get stuck in the trunk, turn the machine off and the game is over.\\" Wow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ele-LAME","review":"This sure looked fun on TV...my daughter wanted it so badly, so we went to a department store, it all up, and yes, the first 3 SECONDS were fun, after that, it was just us, staring at each other, waiting for the rest of the butterflies to come out. Only about 17-20 of the entire 30 butterflies come out, and having played it about 12 times already, never have the whole 30 come out. So the game ends faster, you have to shut it off, take it apart, reload. I would love to take it back,but my daughter still doesn't have that sense of \\"getting what you pay for\\", so we'll have to settle for that fun 3 seconds.

Well, he was thrilled and has been playing with it almost daily for several weeks now. He and his brother (4) love to run around catching the butterflies. It is too cold to bring it outside just yet but I don't mind them playing it indoors because there is nothing in the game that can do any damage. Some of his friends have come over and they all enjoy it , whether they are the very active type or the more quite type.

My 3 1/2 year old son loves trying to catch the butterflies! It's great for teaching hand-eye coordination and social skills. I think this is an excellent teaching tool! The butterflies are made of thin plastic-like material and are easily made from tissue paper if lost. The trunk needs gentle guidance to fully inflate and is somewhat delicate, but holds up well with care. Easy to fill again (my son does it himself) and great for playing alone, or with 3 other friends!

It turned out to be very hard to catch the butterflies for them and their cousins, which frustrated them and took away from their enjoyment of the toy ( you know how children love to win!). Also, the elephant's trunk constantly gets clogged, and this requires CONSTANT help from the parents. On a positive note, if that doesn't detract you, it is educational for a child's hand-eye coordination skills. For our family, it became more hassle than fun, and we gave it to charity."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good !

I tried to return Elefun to Toys R Us, but I was told that since it was an electronic item, I could only exchange it for the same item (What, exactly, makes it electronic? Just because it uses batteries??). The new Elefun didn't work any better than the old one and my daughter hasn't touched it since. Don't waste your money, and especially don't waste it at Toys R us.

The batteries in our Elefun work, you can hear the fan, the trunk is straight but alas the butterflies dont come out. We have had this toy 6 months and my son told me to sell it at a garage sale but nobody bought it. When you take the top off the fan is exposed and little fingers can get down there so be careful.

The game is over in less than 2 minutes, and then mom or dad must get involved to re-load the elephant. My daughter and her friends love it. They're all around 4-5. Also, you have to make absolutely sure that the elephant's trunk extends all the way up in the air in order for the butterflies to fly out. The kids are all too short to do this, so guess who has to help? In addition, the motor seems to be going bad on this second one; I don't think it will last.

There must be 3 dozen, and the directions indicate that they should all be out in about 2 minutes - after about 5 minutes, and only two butterflys, my kids got really frustrated and started crying. One would naturally suspect weak batteries, but I was using a brand new package of Energizers. I changed them anyway, just to be sure - no luck.

It's a great concept -- if it actually worked the way it's supposed to. She actually has fun with it when we can get the stupid butterflies to come out. The instructions claim they designed it so the majority of the butterflies would come out within two minutes. Well, as I write this, the thing has been running for five minutes straight and has shot out exactly six of the 25 butterflies inside. I can hear the rest swirling around in there, doing nothing. Milton Bradley needs to up the power of the fan and include more butterflies. Also, the nets need to be deeper.

Thank goodness I opened the game and put it together to see how it works. I was completely disappointed because the fan power was only enough to send one or two butterflies out of the trunk at a time, (with lots of time between)if at all. The fan power was not nearly enough to send a burst of butterflies out of the trunk as shown in the pictures on the product box. I feel this product was misrepresented and I would have been embarrassed if my niece had opened it for her birthday.

And there seems to be a lot more than 52!The concept is cool. The elephant is to blow these little butterflies out of its trunk and into the air [insert booger jokes here]. The box implies that they will lazily float down and give kids plenty of chances to catch them with nets.The problem is, the butterflies drop like rocks. My girls think this game is a \\"clean up\\" game, which is not far from the truth.Leaves lots of annoying clutter for both kids and parents to pick up. Looks like a party game.

They are so excited when one makes it into their nets, if one doesn't they race to scoop them off of the floor to put them back in. I wouldn't cut the trunk, after the first burst of butterflies there are more that come out 1-2 at a time. I haven't changed the batteries yet so we will see how much it eats the batteries.

It's challenging enough for the older kids to catch the falling butterflies and easy enough for the little ones to gather them up off the floor. We've had great times with this game and it's quick enough that those with short attention spans can finish the game without upsetting the rest who still want to play.

This game is a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please save yourself the 20.00!","review":"This is the poorest excuse for a toy I have ever seen. The commercial shows a continous fountain of butterflies overflowing from the elefant's trunk. The reality is you are given barely a handful of these butterflies (very thin, plastic/paper texture) Once you put them in and turn the game on (really just a very low low volume fan) The butterflies barely trickle out and they are all gone in about 10 seconds. The butterflies are so few and far between that my husband and I can barely catch them, let alone our daughter. It takes longer to put your net down, gather up the butterflies, but them in the elephant, put the nose back on, straighten the trunk and then flip the switch than it takes for the butterflies to come flying out. It is much more of a nuisance than it is fun. I wish I would have saved the box and receipt for return.

But now that she'd seven, she has pretty much lost interest, so mind the age of your intended recipient.As for the complaints others have made about this game, mine didn't have any trouble keeping the button that turns the fan off down. There was also no trouble with the trunk staying open, after the initial unfolding, and I didn't need to cut it. I also don't open the trunk and expose the fan, I just put the butterflies back in the trunk and massage them down. That makes each game last a bit longer, which is good for us old people who need a breather in between rounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was returned","review":"This was asked for by our three boys 7,4,1,( a game they can all enjoy together), and was a big disapointment.

Hopefully the company will improve this game soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Idea- really poor toy.","review":"The concept behind this toy is fantastic but needs a lot of work.

Most of the time there are about half a dozen butterflies that just refuse to come out, they just spin inside the bottom of the trunk. Not one single time have all of them popped out. It's definitely not a game you can just send your kids off to play. Plan on holding up the trunk and taking it off to reload every time.

Meanwhile I had screaming toddlers(unable to understand the problem) waiting and waiting for the butterflies to come out. I had to sit and keep taking the trunk off to stir the butterflies up. I thought maybe I had just gotten a \\"bad\\" one but turns out a few of my friends purchased this item after me for their children as well and had the same problem. So overall I was very disappointed with this game and I think it should be pulled from the shelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't buy this game","review":"My 5 year old twin daughters received this game as a gift. I would not waste my money on it.First of all, the butterflies shoot out way too fast. The game is over before little ones can even get their nets ready. Then an adult has to pull the elephant's trunk off and put all the butterflies back in. (It's a little too difficult for kids to do.)So unless you want to be really involved in putting the butterflies back in over and over this is not a game to buy for little ones. Although my girls like to play it, I think it's a pain!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This toy stinks.","review":"Don't waste your money. It's cute in idea, but so disappointing in reality. There are so many better toys than this to spend your money on. I'm taking mine back today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overall - A total waste of time and $","review":"I bought this game for my 2 and 4 yr old sons. It's cute, but time consuming for the parent.It takes about 2 minutes for all the butterflies to be airborn, and be caught or hit the floor, ending the game and the fun. It takes roughly 3 minutes to disassemble the toy, reload the butterflies and reassemble it, so they can play again. With the whining to \\"hurry\\" it will feel more like 10 minutes.Summary: You will be reloading butterflies in this toy every 2-3 minutes until your child/ren get/s bored or you make them quit playing because have other things to do besides reloading the butterflies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"We bought this toy for our two and three year old. The trunk would not go up and becuase of that the butterflys would not do the same. We returned it the same day."},{"rating":"1","title":"made my son cry","review":"I bought this for my 2.5 yr old for Easter. IT would not work the first few times. We had to open it up and fluff all the wings. Then a few come out but not even half. My son kept sreaming for them to come out. After 30 minutes of trying to get it to work he was in tears and I felt terrible. It is such a great idea for a game with little rules for young kids. It just needs a stronger blower. I am taking tis one back!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea, Poor Construction","review":"This is a great idea for a toy but the construction is so poor that it creates more frustration than it promotes education. Naturally, the commercial shows the toy working properly but reality is that the motor is so weak (understandably so for safety reasons) the butterflies do not float easily out of the Elefun's trunk - there is a lot of shaking and moving around of the Elefun just to release the butterflies and then the butterflies come out all at once and the game is over. Unfortunately, we bought this toy when it first came out and payed the full $[...] for it - not worth it. You can still teach your kids colors with the butterflies and those who are creative and can think up other games to play with the components."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for mixed age groups.","review":"We bought this game last Christmas for our 3 and 5 year old. It takes a while for the butterflies to come out and then they all sort of come out together. They are so slow that our 5 year old just held his net up at the top of the \\"trunk\\" while his much shorter brother was very frustrated not getting any come down to his level. We gave it to charity after a few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun for the first five minutes!","review":"Great concept but the game eats batteries faster than our dog eats steak! Would be really awesome if it had a more powerful motor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor purchase","review":"Toy was purchased for my three year old daughter. I thought the game would be great for play dates but quickly proved to be a poor purchase. The fan operates well on fresh batteries but quickly runs down the batteries thereofore leaving many butterflies at the bottom. When you do replace the batteries the butterflies come out too fast for the children to catch them. It becomes a struggle of keeping batteries, butterflies moving and children happy. After three rounds of catching butterflies my daughter and her friends become bored and ask what else does the elephant do? To the consignment store this game will go."},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea, bad execution","review":"In addition to all the previous complaints (poor fan, not enough/too heavy butterflies, trunk too long, battery hog) I'll add one more: the nets are poorly constructed, the fabric snags on everything (including winter dry skin!) and the loops break like breadsticks. Not at all suited to active, excited children. A burst of butterflies and adrenaline and then little else. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO SHORT, NOT MUCH FUN","review":"What I do not like was the distribution of the bows. They blew out rather quickly and it does not allow much time to have everyone of the 4 kids to enjoy the fun. You have to turn off the game to load the bows after only a minute of game which is so inconvenient. You can tip it to stop the fan (which is great security feature) but still have to load more bows rather quickly. It does not hold my child's attention after one or two rounds which is a total of one minute. I would not recommend buying this game unless it is at the absolute lowest price. And even then... I would have you consider it carefully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"This toy looked like alot of fun----BUT it sucks---The trunk never inflates all the way---I even cut some of it off---and it eats batteries like MAD--and unless you have a new battery it has no 'umpf' to shoot the butterflies out...My kids did like the concept--but they cried because it never worked right..SO if you have lots of money to waste on batteries and like to see your child dissapointed then by all means buy this game--if not STAY AWAY...even at buy one get one free,it is a waste of money--TRUST ME"},{"rating":"2","title":"lots of fun","review":"My son saw the commercial and wanted this too. But we love it. My 1 year old plays with it too. She sits on the floor and catches all the ones we miss. The games goes by fast, but part of the fun is putting it back together and playing again. My 3 year old can play this by himself with his cousins that are his age. It does eat batteries though. Rechargable batteries is a great idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it for us","review":"We just bought this game so I can't speak to the battery issue. The trunk does need a little help to roll all the way out but it stays once it is out. It only takes a few seconds to collect the butterflies and refill the elephant. I have played this game elsewhere with a low battery and the butterflies are slower to come out or get stuck inside. My three year old son and his 5 year old cousins like this game. They usually last for about 5 rounds before they are done. Not much holds my sons attention for longer than that anyway. It seems like the novelty would wear off quickly for older kids but it is fun for the little ones. I would buy this again. If it burns batteries I will have to get rechargeables for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Game for little kids","review":"My son loves this game. We did have to cut the nose down a little bit, and the butterflies do come out fast, but for a 2 year old, picking them up is almost as fun as trying to catch them. Lots of laughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"JEFF ABBOT GOES HOLLYWOOD","review":"This book works as a script. The plotting is tight. The twists keep you turning the pages. It continues Abbot's obsession with missing mothers and mysterious fathers all bound together by the love of a son. Abbott is consistent. Once again, he has a character \\"tent his cheek\\". You can see the movie. Redford as the father. A cameo by Sarandon as the mother. Some flashbacks. Toby Maguire as the protagonist. For consistent chemistry, lets toss in Ms. Dunst as the love interest. And that is the problem. Jeff Abbott knows better. And writes better. Where is the thought and the heart that has made my Judge Whit Mosely my favorite jurist? Where are the characters, the people, good and bad, with whom Mr. Abott has taken our imaginations in his past efforts? Gone to Hollywood it appears. That is not necessarily a bad thing. It is a let down for this reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough...","review":"you'll say, at some point before the end, when you realize it's not going to get better, and Whit Mosley isn't around.

Amazon should add another star. PANIC is the best book I've read this year. A thinking person's thriller. It's been said that you can't tell the players without a scorecard. In this case the players are easy to track but constantly marking beside their names good guy, bad guy no, no bad guy, good guy - was a delightful exercise.Exciting twists in the storyline that surprise and delight the reader but does not stretch credulity.

He traces his life from Beaumont, Texas through the boom of Louisiana oil and politics in the 70's and his move to the national scene. Every step of the way Strother effectively serves his clients and produces winning campaigns. If you are a potential candidate or aspiring political operative, buy this bood, now.

Strother's career began when there was still some innocence in campaigning, and winds up during the frustrating years of ego-driven hacks whose self-importance overshadows their candidates, to the detriment of government. Ray Strother's genuinity was formed the old-fashioned way: he grew up poor and learned to appreciate other people.Strother's tales of Southern political skirmishes will entertain. He's a smooth storyteller who should write more, now that he's out of the maelstrom of the Washington kill-or-be-killed consultant circuit.Caveat: I am a Republican, and although Strother's life has been spent around Democrats, his tales are compelling across the board."},{"rating":"1","title":"Practically WORTHLESS","review":"What My Dog Does: A Journal for Dogs (And the People They Own) (Potter Style) (Diary)is what you're looking for when it comes to all the silly and fun details that you would want to record....this book here that I am reviewing is so stupid...the last 10 pages are completely blank and it has pages for holidays that i've never even heard of or that most people dont celebrate....it was so ....strange...I DO NOT have any IDEA HOW IN THE WORLD this book won so many awards (as they claim) I will be using the other book mentioned above...it's way cuter, longer, meaningful.....unless you're a 'prize breeder' and the sophisticated of them all and have no personality.....then it may suit you...so SAVE YOUR MONEY!!

A lot of the re-telling is the same script as earlier in the series, however, the production values are MUCH better. The sets are dimly lit with candles lending flavor to what we have seen before. Jonathan Frid is allowed to stretch his performance and the few episodes back in time are classic. Even with a substitute Victoria, the shows are excellent. Thayer David is a personal favorite as Ben Stokes.Also, David Henesy is surprisingly evil, being controlled by the ghost of Quentin. Can't wait for the next set!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!

As you can see, I gave this CD a five, so I obviously think what they're doing is working. But a lot of my good friends getting into this stuff prefer to listen to just one emcee. Usually when there's a emcee \\"party\\" on the mic, the lyrics are less real and more...gangsta or just rapping about crazy stuff. Basically this album stays far away from that.

I bought the \\"dual\\" version, that supposedly shoots out two balls. It does shoot out two balls of water but instead of shooting out at the distance needed to compete with a Super Soaker, it gently lobs two small balls of water about 13 feet (this figure assumes you were aiming at a person's foot, there is no way you could hit a torso from 13 feet away with this silly thing). It did make me laugh, even though my shirt was soaked because you have to hold it against your body to fire it and it leaks like a hyperactive Pomeranian. I would never, in a million years, bring this thing into battle. My advice is to stick with the good 'ol Super Soakers. Let me know when the Waterball Launcher becomes pressurized and can hit a target a hundred feet away."},{"rating":"1","title":"neat technology, horrible squirt gun","review":"I got one of these after reading about how it creates a \\"ball\\" of water to fling out.Overall its neat that it can create the ball of water, but the range is horrible (if lucky you get 10 feet), it does not aim well, and leaks alot.Overall, for the money I would buy several cheap squirt guns at the dollar store, or a super soaker over this."},{"rating":"2","title":"What are you people talking about!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This water gun is great you people can't get it to maximum range because you don't have any skill and your angle is way of!

My son was very disipionted after he found this toy dos'nt work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This toy is a piece of garbage.When you fire one of these \\"waterballs\\", even if you hold the toy exactly how they say it, it only travels a maximum ten feet. Secondly, the balls of water are only the size of a quarter, not even. Third, when you pull back the large uncomfortable lever to launch a waterball, it makes a large vibration noise, with a volume level as high as a table falling from the sky to the ground. Last, it leaks all over the place! There are two holes on the bottom of the launcher driven right through the plastic that have plastic ties in them to hold the waterball launcher to the packaging. When you cut the ties to remove the waterball launcher from the packaging, the holes are still there, and when you fire a waterball, it leaks ALL over the place through those holes. I mean, you lose a half a tank just firing three waterballs. It leaked ALL over my shirt and pants, to my shoes, creating a massive puddle in my driveway.My advice to you; buy a Super Soaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neat, but nothing in a fight","review":"I thought this was fun for the first day I had it, but even then it was not as good as I expected. The waterball (more like a water marble) is only a centimeter in diameter. Don't be fooled by the size of the opening. It is also very noisy. I thought (after I saw the range and size of the waterball) it might be good for close range attcks. You can shoot fairly rapidly, but if your opponent had any water gun at all, they would beat you. It has a good water capacity and does not leak, but it is difficult to fill up and doesn't stand a chance in a fight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak!","review":"Nice concept.

So when the toy store near where I work got some in I figured I'd go and give them a whirl. After work I got it all loaded up and found a reasonable target 20 feet away and started firing. I failed to hit the target by about 5 feet. I was pretty disapointed. The review I had read made them sound so great and yet they failed to perform to the same level as a Super Soaker, it's most obvious competitor. The waterball projectiles are small, about half the size of a regular M&M. It would take a lot of pumping to soak someone with one of this guys. The design has a lot of potential though."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT['S BAD]","review":"Okay, so it shoots small \\"Balls\\" of water. It goes MAYBE 15 feet usually SEVEN!!! And also you might as well be throwing a pea at the person because that's about the size of the water.

Also, in any normal water gun fight...Well let's just say this, imagine you had a pistol and the other guy had a...Nuclear war-head!!!!!!Now if you want a real water gun go for one that has distance and a lot of ammo.

But, on the ads, the ball was about 2.5 inches thick. while the real one is about a centimeter thick. Frankly, this gun stinks. It can barely shoot up a 9-stair staircase! I would not buy this. I gave the fun a 1 because can shoot about 9 feet, and it's more of a squirt of water than a ball. I gave it 3 stars because it explained how they used science and surface tension to pack it into a ball, but it doesn't! I gave it a 2 on durability because it doesn't fall apart all of a sudden, but it leaks like mad. Don't buy it if you're life depended on it.

I read a bad review of the book and almost didn't buy it. I am so glad I did! It is a wonderful conclusion to the series. In this book it appears that all the characters have changed from the first two but in the end it all makes sense. This fantasy book is a quick read and leaves the reader delighted with the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wolf Queen","review":"I like this book even less than Wolf Star. Wolf Tower was okay, I guess. In both books, Wolf Star and Wolf Queen, it got a little tiring that Claidi just had to keep searching for Argul, On and on and on, throughout most of the book. And when she finally DOES find him, why can't she just marry him, so they can just stop getting separated from each other. And the ending was pretty bad too. I really, really, really don't reccommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lee Should Have Stopped With Book One","review":"Although the first book in the Claidi Journals, Wolf Tower, is one of my favorites, I was deeply dissapointed in the rest of the series. Especially Wolf Queen. I can't imagine why Tanithe Lee chose to continue on with two more books after Wolf Tower. It's one of the best books I've ever read, it's well written, and had a conclusion after chapters of suspense. There was absolutely no point in digging up the story and completely twisting it around. The second book was bad enough, but the third was horrible. While well written, Wolf Queen completely clashed with the first two books. It reworked all the characters and seemed to make changes in the plot merely for the sake of change rather then the story. I strongly suggest you stop after book one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Put Down","review":"When I was about 11 I read Wolf Tower, and I have to say it was and still is one of my favorites.

I remember after that I checked on the internet for the third one coming out because the second leaves you hanging in the air. The day Wolf Queen came out I went and bought it. This book definitly gives a bad name to the other books. Everything basically turns out to be a lie except for Argul.

That however is a live version, this one is of demo quality but definitely a studio version. As for \\"Blue,\\" it's definitely a demo, but, still worthwhile. All in all, if you're a huge Pumpkin's fan and you must have everything, this is worth your time, if you're just curious about the band, I would start with their major releases and go from there.

In the mean time, Daughter's first love is nearby at his summer home spending the last few days with his dying brother. The outcome of Daughter's & estranged boyfriend's relationship is predictable, too.I gave this book 2 stars because of the heartfelt storyline between the two brothers. But overall, I felt the characters were right out of Soap Opera Digest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time to read it","review":"A waste of time. I figured out the plot very early - the same romantic novel with new names and new places. No depth to the characters. Inaccuracies. My first and last book by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Although I liked the subject matter, the story of a troubled mother-daughter relationship, I found the story a little too drawn out, full of clichés, sappy at times & too predictable. The mother character is not sufficiently realistic to be convincing. I have read Hannah's other novel, \\"On Mystic Lake\\", which was the best fiction I had read in years - so I was disappointed with \\"Summer Island\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...","review":"This was a fast read, but not a great one. This is definitely my least favorite book of hers. Her writing makes me think she belongs in inspirational fiction with the way she slips God in, but at the same time, I don't quite understand how she ended up in literary fiction. I think this book really suffered from the lack of a plot and some REALLY stupid phrases (\\"pit-bull-mean\\"?!)... I mean come on, bad enough the first time she used it, but twice in one book in reference to different people, from two different P.O.V.s... not to mention it is an uneducated, stupid remark that really bothered me, especially when she is considered to be such a \\"sensitive\\" writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long-winded","review":"The main story... if you can dig it out is good and sad. But when you read and read and you don't read anything at all the story gets boring. This book could be written with many less pages to make it a good and fast paced story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer Island","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. It feels like Kristin Hannah is writing right to you in all of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy follow-up to \\"Ten-Speed\\"","review":"While not as good as its predecessor, \\"Headfirst into Everything\\" is jam packed with the teenage angst that makes Canadian indie pop do darn popular. The guitar is a little heavier than in \\"Ten Speed\\", the lyrics just as good and the vocals are as good as it gets. This is a welcome relief from such lyrically challenged bands like Eve6 and the GooGoo Dolls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice picture book...","review":"...but not very useful for anything else. Monster Garage's How to Customize Damn Near Anything is nothing more than the best bits from the other three books in the series: Fabricate, Weld and Paint. But if you consider that the oher three books aren't up to par, the \\"best bits\\" do not amount to much. It's not even of interest to Monster Garage fans as, like the other three books, there is nary a mention of Monster Garage or Jesse James."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst Bible Story Book I've ever read.","review":"I would not recommend this book to anybody.I found the stories to be much too in depth for a small child with a vivid imagination - especially the story about \\"Abraham and His Family.\\" The wording is not complicated, but I thought that the stories were a little over exaggerated in some areas and a little to explicit for a three year old.The illustrations are beautiful, but do not compensate for the poor storytelling. I feel that there are much better products out there such as the Alice in Bibleland series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isolated incident.","review":"I had a horrible experience with the skywalker trampoline. We had it for about two weeks. From march 24th when we set it up, until April 5th. If you live in a windy area, for the love of your trampoline, stake it down. Ours was lifted and turned into a giant sail and landed on our neighbor's car. No damage to the car, THANK GOD. It landed with the enclosure on the bottom, so the padded bars cushioned the impact. We brought it back and never bothered with it again. The kids were devastated because they had such a great time. This is an isolated incident, if I lived on property with less wind-vortex monstrosities coming through, I'd get another one. It was just a really upsetting experience. Oh, the 'T' bar that is oh-so-strong broke right in two. The bars aren't any stronger than anything else that's made of aluminum. It was a mangled mess!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Old-fashioned Horror Fun!","review":"I went into this flick expecting run-of-the-mill low budget fare and came out exceedingly surprised! This is not your standard horror movie of today. The movie harkens back to an earlier form... it really is a traditional monster movie with all the delight that entails. The \\"Bog Creatures\\" in question are Medieval Danish Vikings who have been preserved as mummies in a peat-bog. When some American Archeology students begin to dig up the bog they awaken an ancient conflict... Now, doesn't that sound like a delicious plotline?! The characters are great. The students are a band of misfits and they are lead by a wacko professor who shares a rather - shall we say \\"odd\\"? - relationship with his prodigy sister. This is truly an engaging film, steeped in horror tradition yet packing plenty of surprises and \\"treats\\" for the viewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad movie","review":"I watched this movie because Courtney Henggler (Sheldon's twin sister on Big Bang Theory) is in it.Probably doesn't tell anybody that she was in it...bad movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delightful Show About a Holiday That I Never Remember","review":"Shalom Sesame \\"Grover Plants a Tree\\" does a wonderful job teaching kids about nature. Similar to the other Shalom Sesames, the original Sesame Street characters appear in the show. Unlike the other Shalom Sesames, this episode is more about nature than a Jewish holiday, which in this case is Tu B'Shevat. In this episode, a little girl and her grandfather plant a tree in Turkey, kids make birdfeeders and learn about recycling, and Debra Messing does a cute skit about nature's meaning. The show features the Hebrew letter tet and reviews a few Hebrew numbers. Kids find the cartoon skit at the end of the episode hilarious. The skit shows a little boy who plants a tree and then pulls a cloud over the tree to water it and then pulls the sun over the tree to give the tree light. I highly recommend this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"I LOVE THIS GAME!! i've played every horse game out there since the first barbie one, and this ranks amoung the best. it really makes you feel like you're at a riding school. you get to pick your daily scheduele at the beginning of each week, and the game is challenging, not impossible.

Also you have to go outside and into another building to get the key to the library. I actually learned this from somebody else's review!!You have to go to the library and read the \\"extended or collected stuff\\" in order to learn it.I thought this game was great. Out of my 8 or so other horsey games this was one of my favorites, although I didn't really like the drop-off ending. It would have been nice if you could have continued just for fun afterwards, but the game just ends after the last competition (which took me 4 trys!!)Other than that it was a lot of fun and I liked how it was mostly all about horses but there were some parts that werent. I am a totally horse-obsessed girl, but I am also a teenager and so I found the perfect kind of game for me!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Waste","review":"This is the absolute worst game I ever purchased. It would not load properly onto my computer and I was not able to type a name for my horse or my player. As soon as it hit \\"a\\" it put 17 letter \\"a\\"s in. I am returning this game! It sucks! Do not waste your money, buy something better!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Game","review":"Graphics were horrible and story line was boring to the point that you cannot even focus to play the rest of the game.

Its by far the best offering as far as value goes, Four album length concerts on two discs for less than 20 bucks? its a steal.But more importantly, You wont find another set of concerts where the band is as passionate and into the music. Not to mention the crowd knows every word of each song. This dvd is for Fans and new comers, I honestly can't think of a better way to be introduced to the music than to watch this dvd. I fully recommend this to anyone who enjoys Great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for New Fans","review":"I picked up this two-DVD set and have been really enjoying it. It's perfect for a new fan of C&C because it includes live versions of just about their entire body of work for a very cheap price. The video quality is fantastic and the performances are great. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional.","review":"This is an exceptional book. The relationship between Monk and Hester has deepened and Ms. Perry enables the reader to feel that relationship. There is a sense of place that makes part of Victorian London, excellent plotting and wonderful characters including strong secondary characters. But most of all, you feel the threat and courage of the characters when placed in an overwhelming situation. I've been a fan of Ms. Perry since her first book but had to warm up to the Monk series. This book not only convinced me about the series but I believe this is the best book she's written to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to the usual high standards","review":"The thrilling mystery story that we have come to expect from Anne Perry takes a new twist in this book. Perhaps inspired by true events in 1898 Vienna, where three persons died of plague, this is not so much a story of crime but of survival.Unfortunately other qualitites that we have also come to expect from this author, like sound research and verisimilitude, are absent here. There are glaring gaps in logic, occasional sloppy proofing, and, at least as I understand the nature of plague, serious factual mistakes. This is too bad, since the story could have been a fitting installment in the quest of the protagonists for social improvement in mid-19th century London.As it is, the book gave me the impression that perhaps Anne Perry has currently too many irons in the fire and no longer spends enough time on the kind of careful work that characterized her earlier novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of her element","review":"The author is obviously as out of her element as Inspector Monk, and clearly has little knowledge of the ships, seafaring, nautical quarantine requirements, etc. of the 1860's. Her characters are hardly believable: Sutton, the rat exterminator and Dr. Crow are perhaps the worst examples, but not the only ones. Would a proper young lady be picked up in a cab without a chaperon to go to a function? Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Yet","review":"I've read all the William Monk series up to this one, and while some have been superior to others, this is the most affecting yet. her descriptions of the surroundings, atmosphere and characters of Dickensian London are superb, the plot pulls you right along, and the social problems are admirably dealt with. The end was perhaps a little drawn-out, but I got all choked up anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Death in the Port of London","review":"Anne Perry's latest historical thriller takes her struggling sleuth to the London docks. Back in the mid 18th century, London was a thriving port with barges, sailing ships and local water traffic all crowding the world's busiest river.The docklands are their own world as detective Monk discovers when he's hired to locate elephant tusks stolen from a recent arrival from Africa. Shipping is a high-risk, high reward business where only the tough survive. And Monk may not be tough enough.This time the hardy Thames watermen are facing a foe far more dangerous than any of them have ever met. When a young prostitute dies of the dreaded black plague, it's Monk's wife, Hester, who is faced with handling the crisis. And she turns out to be more than tough enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"an engrossing mystery","review":"Out of necessity, Monk takes up an investigative crime assignment involving the theft of African ivory. Sounds straightforward enough, but there's more to the story, including of course the typical ingredients--murder, cover-up, and false identity. Gripping storylines, sprinkled with good relevent social commentary. Overall, full of action and mystery. Anne Perry's books are always to be recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up to Standards","review":"This book was extremely disappointing - not the usual caliber of work this author produces. The story was disjointed and filled with absurd coincidences. The characters were caricatures, and their behavior illogical. The only saving point were the descriptions of daily life on the waterfront in this period of English history. I would generally recommend this author, but not this particular story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crossover !","review":"If you're in search of the perfect balance between heavy metal and punk-rock/hardcore, 'Eye for an eye' is what you need! Just believe me, this is an amazing \\"heavy metal\\" album with a typical hardcore spirit (Frontman Eric Eycke is great in it). Take a look to the first song and you'll see what I mean... Really outstanding. To me, it's just as if 'Black Sabbath' decided to sound like 'Black Flag'... Probably one of the most important hardcore album of the early eighties. One should consider \\"Eye for an eye\\" as their \\"kill'em all\\" album... No less than that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disgusting........","review":"I already wrote a review a few years a go...which is still posted, but I must now say that I am even more disgusted by the price that is being asked for this disc:Places like ValleyCD should be shut down for pricing a bands CD for over 200 dollars...going against exactly what the music stood for at the time!!!What's even more sad is the fact that there is going to be someone who would actually spend that much on the disc!!! I remember buying this tape in the 80's for around 4 or 5 dollars...Stop feeding into capitalistic scumbags by purchasing amazing music that stood for freedom of self without opression for what most of the individuals who listened to the music could not afford in the first place!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ScumRock","review":"F23King brilliant record it's so intense to me this record sounds like the first Grindcore album ever made it's got churchy guitars fast drum beats doomey sounding bass and low growling vocals all the characteristics of a Grindcore record stuff there later work this album and Animosity are there best recordings ever they shouldn't of changed there style they should of made more of these kind of albums"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too punk","review":"Too punk for my taste. Just like the other early COC albuns this sounds like punk instead of metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent story","review":"In the future the humans are not top dog. There is an alien race that controls most of the known areas of space and believes that all other races are there to serve them. Humans get by because this other race sees itself as \\"too noble\\" to be mere traders/merchants, so that's the role that humans have to fulfill. In this story a young Sioux is sent to one of the planets controlled by this other race to join a trading post there. The aliens of the world are kept in slavery by the wearing of collars that can stun, punish or kill them. The Sioux discovers accidently that the world would be a perfect place for horses and that the natives, much like the Native American's have a true affinity for horses. The trials and tribulations of getting the horses, helping the natives and keeping himself alive all make for a very enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"High expectations, dashed","review":"After having previously seen Sallah Shabati and HaShoter Azulai, both directed by Kishon, I was hoping this movie would deliver more of the same. While true it does feature Topol as the main character, in this role I simply cannot get to like the person he portrays. This may be due to some of the cultural and generational differences between my time and that of the movie, but I had no such complaints with the other two movies mentioned.I found the plot to be jumpy, and that's when it can be followed at all. I couldn't make it through the first viewing without having my attention waver and finding myself bored and annoyed. It is as if a collection of 3 minute skits were compiled into a full length movie, with little discernible character growth or plot hinges.To sum up, unless you happen to have a cult fascination with any of the creators of this movie, I would recommend keeping a distance and trying your luck with other offerings."},{"rating":"1","title":"teaches bad behavior","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this DVD. I wish I had previewed it before letting my 3yr old watch this. Although they make an attempt at teaching some lessons they leave quite a few out and show that bad behavior is permissible. The Susie Q character is reckless and inconsiderate of others yet she rarely gets admonished for her behavior. Not to mention the spaghetti slurping. We can no longer eat spaghetti as my dd always tries to slurp it like she saw on the video. Pass this one up. There are plenty of better ones out there like Sesame Street, Big Bear in the Blue House, Wiggles, anything from PBS."},{"rating":"2","title":"b-day gift","review":"This was a gift for my nephew who was very excited about it.

I have yet to see that segment in the dvd's and I really don't want to watch either of these a second time. I know they are not meant for me to watch, but they are pretty much pointless and mind numbing and my kids will not be watching them. Do not waste your money. Stick to the Wiggles and Little Bear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good.","review":"Good story but not the best acting. That may be a bit harsh, but I was not unable to get up and go put my laundry in the dryer. Further, upon return, missing that few minutes was not important in any wany. No need to rewind,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even finish it","review":"I was fooled into renting it by a \\"more like this\\" search and the 4 star rating... if only my Roku showed that the four stars was based on only 3 reviews -- there should be a minimum threshold.I tried to watch the trailer before renting, but the trailer is just a few minutes of the movie -- impossible to figure out anything.The movie is wholly unbelievable with a maniac murdering Russian gang. It could have been interesting in dealing with this different type of criminal and mob.There is no character development and so nothing enduring about the \\"good guys\\" either, so it was hard to care what was happening. The movie would also have been more interesting if the law was a third character.I really tried to finish watching it -- even fast-forwarding to the action scenes, but no scene hooked me in, and I gave up after a car chase where the good guys modify plastiques and turn them back on the mob."},{"rating":"1","title":"Texture disappointing","review":"I've bought Laura Ashley sheets for years because of their looks and soft smooth texture.

I assumed from the age group I was getting normal size stuff since my daughter is six. I could cover the pons up with my hands. The baton is also short but not as dissapointing. It is plastic that will bend and not return to shape, but is heavy enough. The megaphone is rediculous. About the size of a 7-11 big gulp. I didn't bother returning it because I would have paid about the same for shipping as I would have gotten back. If you are going to use it as a cute display for decorating, it might be sufficient, but the color on the display is not necessarily the color you will receive."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Room Schoolhouses","review":"Beautiful photographs and simple evocative text.

Mom didn't want to play (\\"I don't know anything\\"), but she quickly found out she knew more than she thought. Fun categories and surprises gallore with who can answer them. Easy to set up. Does require one player to be the host. Hint: If the host can't read the \\"answers\\" on the card when it is inserted in the holder, press the card against the face of the blue plastic holder from the back to more easily see the words.

The questions and categories are hard to see through the blue vynil screen.

Her previous book, The Wounded Sky, was a great read, but somewhat cerebral. This book is less cerebral and more action oriented. It has the Enterprise operating deep within enemy territory in an uneasy alliance with a Romulan commander-general to achieve a common objective. If you are looking for adventure, Action, Intrigue, Treachery, and Space Battles, My Enemy, My Ally has them all, and Ms. Duane will satisfy your thirst with her easy to read writing style.I should point out that this review is of the Kindle Edition of this book. This edition was nearly free of conversion errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow...completely fantastic from beginning to end","review":"this is right up there with blackfire, covenant of the crown, and yesterday's son as my favorite trek books..I wasn't too fond of The Wounded Sky so I was skeptical comming into this one, but I'm glad I didn't judge it on my dislike of Diane Duane's previous work. If I had I would have missed a totally great read.This is classic Trek in all its glory. High stakes, a classic enemy in the Romulans (alot of great peeks into why they are they way they are by the way), great character moments. Every element that makes trek great is in this book.Not to be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revisionist Romulans","review":"The Romulans used to be my favorite Star Trek villains. I read the Rihannsu series because I thought it would be a fun exploration of Romulan culture and history. However, I barely recognized the Romulans in Rihannsu. The book degrades them and seems to radically alter their characters. The main character, Ael, seems too perfect, while the rest of the Romulans seem like a bunch of buffoons. Furthermore, the book radically changes Romulan history that just doesn't seem realistic. It's too bad - the Romulans as presented in the Original Series were fascinating characters who had both honor and deviousness. The Romulans in Rihannsu have little of either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Strings came on time, and so far they are great.

They're very well made, rarely break, and they have a great tone. These are straight forward guitar strings with a round core. The round core may produce a noticeable difference in your sound.

Production quality was good, but not up to par with a first rate concert DVD. Concerns are some of the camera angles were not that great, and also it is not available in blu-ray. But overall, great to have, I highly recommend it even if you already own the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"not famous because of Collins angle?","review":"If you like fusion, this is great, essential stuff. It looks as if the Phil Collins connection, which helped people as diverse as Agnetha, Phil Bailey and Eric Clapton, is a handicap in judging this music.Yes!! Phil Collins can play drums extremely well.This music is more improvised (or based on jams), which may explain the noodling some reviewers complain of. Still, musicianship is great throughout. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Five Star effort","review":"This Brand X album is a classic of the fusion genre. I must disagree with an earlier reviewer re \\"aimless noodling\\" - while the album does have it's share of longer and more ethereal music (Why Should I Lend You Mine...), I find that the more varied styles on this album enhance its appeal. There are touches of world music (the first track with Collins' vocals), as well as a bit of Brian Eno-flavoured ambience. And of course there is the phenomenal ferocious fusion of Malaga Virgen. Disco Suicide is a mind-blowing example of extreme grandiose jazz-rock fusion.Overall, I rank this as the equal best Brand X album with Unorthodox Behaviour. Masques is not far behind. Moroccan Roll is an absolute essential classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great effort","review":"This review is in agreement with the previous reviewer on May 7, 2000.Some songs contain too much aimless noodling in them. It is sort of like the low volume music you associate when a band is warming up to actually playing songs.The melody and passionate playing is not up to usual Brand X standards.Compared to a typical fusion recording (or what they call fusion nowadays), it is great and deserves an 8/10.Compared to a Brand X recording, it gets a 6/10"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fusion Classic","review":"This album is Brand X at their best. Many would say that Mahavishnu's Inner Mounting Flame was the quintessential fusion album, but I'd say this one delivers stiff competition. Lumley's flowing melodies soar in front of Goodsall's intricate picked (not strummed) rhythms and Jones' innovative bass lines. If that's not enough, Phil Collins does his best work ever on the drums right here. There's no comparision to his work in Genesis -- who knew the guy could play this well? If you love fusion, you've gotta have this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Ever Said That Aimless Noodling Was Wrong?","review":"I actually think those that reviewed this as \\"aimless noodling\\" is quite amusing. In my opinion I don't think that there's anything wrong with a little \\"aimless noodling\\". I like the various musical approaches on this album. You can definitely tell that the band was working together as a team. I especially like the tracks \\"Malaga Virgen\\", \\"Sun In The Night\\" and \\"Maybe I Should Lend You Mine...\\". The track \\"Sun In The Night\\" features Phil Collins on vocals. This is my second favorite Brand X album.I definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"REJOYCE BY ANTONY BURGESS","review":"I am reading Finnegans Wake and I think this book will be valuableto me for a better understanding of the James Joyce's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"Hook opening is very small, couldn't grab onto my roof-rack securely.

I saw it by accident on cable and just had to get it on DVD. The theme is universal (across many cultures) and some of the music is quite catchy despite being in Hindii (Non-Hindii speaking viewers will appreciate the subs). The present/past flip-flop may confuse some people but works well. I thought Pia's character played somewhat secondary to the others and towards the end was almost predictable and stereotyped. The story line is simple. Almost too simple as it leaves many questions unanswered. For example, how did Rancho become so successful? Surely the director or school would have come to some scrutiny in a coroner's inquiry over the death of a student.

Drug gang violence is out of control in the city.As for the so-called best places in this book, many of the street corners of these \\"best places\\" are OWNED by drug dealers who stand there in rain or shine selling meth or crack, while the police look on and do nothing because they say THEY DON'T HAVE PROBABLE CAUSE!

It doesn't. Wouldn't fit on my 2.76\\" arm until I took about 0.050\\" off. I still give the puller a good rating because there just doesn't seem to be anything bigger available. OTC has some 2-jaw models, but their photos show what looks like pretty puny hooks on the jaws, and some writers have mentioned breaking these, so I wanted the conical style. Mine looked to be made pretty well - no misalignment of the threads like another reviewer found. Once I got it on the arm with some anti-seize and used a little heat, it worked great. It would deserve a top rating if OTC could just tell the customer some dimensions instead of vague descriptions like \\"designed for light trucks\\". So here's my take: the end of your arm needs to have a diameter of less than about 2.60\\". Sorry I can't be more precise, but the tools is conical, so the thickness and bevel of your arm also affects the fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tool","review":"Well-made tool; rugged and very strong.

Through Jack Kerouac's spirit, returned to life to inspire three struggling artists, \\"Beat Angel\\" shows what it means to produce \\"art from the heart.\\" The camera sets the perfect stage for the story and the message, and the acting is superb. You believe these characters. Kerouac's soliloquy in the bar, a staccato explanation of what it means to be an artist, is a dramatic masterpiece. My only reservation is that the improv jazz score, while entirely appropriate for the theme and a fine accompaniment for most of the picture, at times gets to be too much for me, detracting from rather than enhancing the overall effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I'm a big fan of the beat generation but this film was slow and poorly done.

To begin with the first four chapters were so sketchy that I almost couldn't take it. The author constantly changed the subject in the middle of the scene, so you were like, \\"Whoa, how did we get here.\\" Sketchy and all over the board. The story itself sounded interesting, a rich lady going to a reverse brothel and discover her own sexual awakening. That sexual awakening didn't really exist, and the ending was too abrupt, leaving too many unanswered questions.

The author paints a fascinating picture of what life is like in the early 20th centurty. I found that to be the most engaging part of the story.As the book drags on, there are many unanswered questions. For instance -- who was the woman that Hays was stooping to kiss at the beginning of the book? Characters come and go and contribute little to the story, the \\"gratifying surprise\\" at the end as intimated by Julia Glass, is hardly gratifying and not much of a surprise.

A long and complicated tale about a dispute over a will and a family inheritance that destroys most of the litigants, either to madness or death, leaving it all to the bloodsucking attorneys.There are many many unusual characters in the book and you have to pay close attention (or better yet, keep notes), as in the end the author brings everything full circle and not a character is wasted, and ends up playing a part in the tale. It's just amazing how Dickens slowly tells his story, like peeling an onion. Layer after layer is slowly revealed one after another until it all pulls together in the end.

When finally ruled upon, the \\"winners\\" get nothing, because the estate was eaten up by legal fees. The lawsuit aside and the fact that the first 1 1/2 pages of the book is Dickens' description of mud, there are some real interesting sub-plot twists: small pox, illicit affairs producing offpsring, love, duty, etc. I was surprised that this book did indeed have a \\"happy\\" ending.

This book is phenomenal in every possible way. It is satirical about the rigid power and class of the British aristocracy, the incompetent legal system and government. The characters represent personifications of the wide range of social values, exploitation, juxtaposed to unchanging moral compass, love, loyalty, sacrifice and human decency. It is very interesting to have two narrative perspectives, and it is done seamlessly and with incredible mastery. The predominant motif of fog provides great visual setting of the story and the choice of the name, \\"Deadlock\\" is a brilliant one as well.

You have to ask yourself: what possessed Dickens to write such a hack-job, which even shows some contempt for the reader. The answer is: the usual suspect -- the writer in the semi-autobiographical 'Copperfield' says: 'approbation' (fame).The more you look into Dickens, the more you realize -- the world's just not quite as rich as you thought it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawning in North Carolina","review":"I have read Great Expectations and David Copperfield and enjoyed them immensely. These books offer a wonderful, colorful cast of characters. So, I thought I would try Bleak House. I slogged through 150 pages and finally gave up! Tedious is the operative word here! The characters were dessicated and one-dimensional and I felt as if the plot was not moving forward at all. Overall, a major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Bleak House\\" book review (byAJ from OLSOS)","review":"This novel begins in London during the 1800's. The narrator has appeared in court to discuss the famous case known as \\"Jarndyce and Jarndyce.\\" The Lord Chancellor (the judge) tells the narrator to appear at an orphanage to talk to the owner. She appears at the orphanage only to meet the nicest group of children, and a very kind and loving woman named Miss Caddy Jellyby. The Lord Chancellor assigns the narrator to meet Miss Jellyby because they both have one thing in common, they love Africa.They both love the culture. After the narrators stay at Miss Jellyby's place, she is given a letter with some very horrible,tragic information. This book was one of the worst books I have ever read. I drooled with boredom as I struggled to read each page. There are copious amounts of characters, and too many details to comprehend. These details tend to get you very confused very easily. I was frustrated by the end of Chapter 1. I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"always love Dickens","review":"he has such a way of describing. one of my favorites authors of all time. great to have access to classics"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Dickens","review":"Superb characterizations, and descriptive passages of the scenes before the reader's mind.

When I finished it and saw how everything came together, I considered it a phenomenal masterpiece. Along with \\"Dombey and Son\\" (1848), \\"David Copperfield\\" (1850), and \\"Hard Times\\" (1854) this is a personal favorite of mine. There are very comical moments. Also there are journeys through the poor parts of London. We are also presented with chilling images as well as a murder mystery. Another well drawn part of this masterpiece is the protagonist's painful realization of her questionable birth. There is a dramatic chase through the snow and well placed dramatic irony. While this book may seem to move slow, it will get easier as you proceed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent Norton critical edition.","review":"Norton critical editions are typically of amazing quality, and Dickens' Bleak House is no exception. The additional materials are some of the most helpful I've seen in a Norton CE: maps, drafts, and illustrations, in addition to plenty of historical background and factual supplement.

Bleak House comes alive in its original context."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better get a different edition!","review":"It isn't the text -- that's brilliant. Ms. Holway's editorial material is too distracting. The endnotes are filled with trivia that add nothing to your appreciation of the story; most of the footnotes are gratuitous commentary that you might be able to figure out for yourself from the context. The only academic piece I needed was the background of the courts system, and once that is out of the way, just let us absorb the Victorian aura on our own! I'm just learning to ignore her notes so that I can get on with it as Dickens intended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, poor Kindle formatting","review":"Short version... This book is great and fun to read, but not in this Kindle edition. As others have noted, words run together and the spaces between words are badly rendered.

In some cases you'll see this glitch 3 or more times in a single sentence, or a dozen or more times on a single \\"page\\".I'm going to try for a Gutenberg version next and then a paid version as a last resort, but 5 chapters in I've given up on this edition.EDIT:I went to gutenberg dot org and downloaded their version in mobi format (the format best used on Kindle), and it is free of the annoying formatting issues.

However, at the time I read this book I still had this idea that I might become a wills, trusts, estates lawer, which may be why I had more tolerance to read a book with chapters on descriptions of fog than I might otherwise would have (this is still what led me to deduct a star). The main plot is a lawsuit to resolve a will, and how it affects particular characters. Subplots tend to revolve around romances (seemingly legally incestuous, although not biologically so) and other interpersonal relationships. I think if you like these period pieces, especially from classic authors, Bleak House is right up your alley; if you're short on time or patience, you should probably consider a different book."},{"rating":"2","title":"great boots","review":"this is about the fifth pair of these boots i have bought tried others no comparison fit great right out the box. on my feet 10 hours a day very comfortable and warm they wear pretty good and stay waterproof also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shock absorbing technology works great!","review":"Excellent boots!

Keyboardist Robin Lumley decided to step away from the keyboards and produce the album instead---though I haven't a clue why---and his place was taken by keyboardist Peter Robinson. But both Burgi and Robinson fit the bill perfectly, as \\"Masques\\" remains a major highlight in Brand X's catalog. The material is very strong, and the band's performances are sizzling. Standouts include the hard-driving jazz/rock of \\"The Poke,\\" the gorgeous \\"Black Moon,\\" the incredible workout \\"Access To Data,\\" and the spooky fun of \\"The Ghost Of Mayfield Lodge.\\" Fabulous jams, and awesome music all the way around.

A fast rocker which turns into a slow burner. Another great tune. Longhair is a little less intense, but it's a good trippy song. Lord 13 is a little too typical sounding, so I don't care for it that much.

Great to come up with ideas, but why put it out on disc? Of course he is one of the greatest and most original guitar players ever and I'm going to see him in concert this Friday in Detroit."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of his time and ours","review":"You know, we all expect there to be a lot of \\"product\\" out there--created without any real inspiration or respect for the audience. It's just much more disappointing when it comes from someone that you thought was above all that. Enter this album. Each track sounds like a (very) uninspired first scratch demo that might, with a LOT of hard work, an introduction of creativity, and some top-flight collaboration and production, have become a mediocre song. Really, this is drek. For a player with his credentials, with his well-known post-70s lack of interest in his music career in favor of car tinkering, Jeff would have been much better served if he had simply stop putting out albums altogether and rested on his considerable laurels. \\"Techno-Beck\\" is really too kind a title--that idea could conceivable been interesting.

Declan is hardly a throwaway track and even odds with jan hammer is also very good. Hear where are you on guitar shop and see how jeff becks lends his creativity to a new age style as he does here.

I don't think that is the case. They are very comfortable and appear to be of very good quality. Now if you want to pay $70 or more for Sperry, Sebago, or Rockport, be my guest. But I think these shoes will last just as long. As for the shoe strings, I would rather have these than the leather types which are always coming undone, and they are long enough for those who like to double-tie them.

They work well for my conure, though, because she is a dedicated chewer, and many conure-sized toys are too \\"easy\\" for her strong beak.

It was capitivating and moving. Nora is a woman who has endured alot and has overcome many obstacles. From growing up in an orphange, being abused as a child, and having to work twice as hard to get everything that life had to offer her. She turned out to be a woman of strength. The author has a way of drawing you into the character's life; when she was hurting or confused so where you. When she finally fell in love with Blake; you were her cheerleading section. This book shows you that anything is Possible. I am on pins and needles to find out what happens next in Book 2. What will happen to Nora next? What about her relationship with Blake? Is there a future?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junior-high -- the writer and her readers","review":"Worst-written (and evidently not edited, or edited by a neighbor) piece of anti-heroine crap I've read in a long time. Stiff and stilted dialog, stereotypical characters, 1950s era racism and sexism -- I read the first few pages, glanced through the rest of it, and threw it in the trash. Nora isn't a heroine, she's a spoiled-brat victim, orphan or not. If you liked the women in \\"Father Knows Best,\\" and if you can imagine a woman who would leave her husband and consider filing for divorce WITHOUT confronting her husband with her suspicions and actually communicating her unhappiness -- then you'll love Janet Sue Terry's stuff. Straight out of 1950. If you'd rather read about real women who overcome real problems (instead of the kind you make for yourself), pick up Deborah Smith's Blue Willow, or order a couple of Nora Roberts' trilogies."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent 90's version of Bad Boys Blue","review":"This CD is pretty damn good.

You can forget about Backstreet Boys and N Sync, this is music for mature audiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"The redone music was satisfactory.","review":"After listening to the CD, I though they did a better job at remixing, compared to Mondern Talking and CC Catch. The back ground music was set for the 1990's, but their stlye of singing was 1980ish. I would have given 5 stars if they would have sung at a faster beat. Next time they do resings Bad Boys Blue needs to sing faster, then they would be set for the modern music industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and lucrative both!","review":"My childhood hobby of coin collecting has been revived by the state quarters program, and I am having a lot of fun with this! I casually bought this book because I decided to interest my niece in coin collecting.

It is wonderful to have as much fun doing something in my 40's as I did during my childhood. My niece stays with me for two weeks this summer and I can't wait to show her my quarter collection and get her collection started. This is also a great way to educate her about the different states.

It is a little lighter litarally and figuratively; bit there are still a lot of equations and suggested computer simulations with limited real world explanation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable gallop!","review":"Champion of Justice was a very enjoyable light novel. I love time travel and alternative history fiction, so this was right up my alley. You don't always know what you're getting with a small press publication, but Frederic James has written very transparent prose with very believable main characters.

Some of the dances are interesting, but a lot of them are boring. Blanca is an amazing dancer, and I bought this dvd when I saw that she was in it. But, she is not featured dominantly as the cover might suggest. I was hoping that there would be drills or a choreography to learn, but there are not. This dvd does not seem to be put together in a professional manner, some of the dances are even interrupted by strange video sequences. This video could be much better. This is not to say that the dancers are not talented beautiful dancers, they just could have been showcased in a more professional way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Letdown","review":"After watching a myriad of gothic bellydance videos on youtube, I was severely disappointed by this DVD.

Her first 'number', set to an incredibly obnoxious track of talking and rhythm, has an interlude of what looks like MSPaint comics. Yeah, seriously.And then there's the \\"Feminine\\"...things. Which are, at best, ridiculous and at worst, obnoxious and boring as hell. Unless you're interested in watching some sparkle-clad chick run around and fondle herself in a bodysuit, two badly painted ladies wiggle around a bedsheet for five minutes, or whatever that last one was (I skipped it, I couldn't take it anymore), either avoid this DVD entirely, or be ready to punch the \\"Skip\\" button frequently.

Only 2 I might watch again. Total let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"I was really looking forward to getting this DVD and am now regretting it. Wearing black doesn't make a 'gothic' belly dancer. There are some good performances on the disk but they're few and far between.

Part of it is lead singer Spike Xavier's \\"boldness\\" is definitely an acquired taste ( but in a good way, like Peter Hammill or Fish). Mike Jensen's Iommi-meets-Fripp guitar work is very unorthodox. This is definitely the boldest plate of their catalog - its possible to get completely lost in the dense, beautifully bizarre arrangements in both \\"The Goddess\\" and the ultra-heavy \\"Gemini.\\" And you just KNOW that any metal album with \\"Hell's Bravest Song\\" has gotta rock silly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining Future History","review":"This is the final installment of McMullen's Greatwinter trilogy. This is the most entertaining future history series I've encountered in years. McMullen is a very good writer with a talent for creating enjoyable characters.

That doesn't make it useable, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Speed","review":"I took the mixer out of the box, inserted the beaters and turned it on just to try it out. I was shocked at the \\"lowest\\" speed. It was like the highest speed on my old mixer. Upon first use I learned was right. I placed the beaters in the bowl to cream butter/sugar. I had butter flying all over the kitchen. Then I tried adding the dry ingredients. Flourstorm!! I had to mix it in by hand until it was wet before I could use the mixer again. I wondered if, at that speed, I was completely overworking the flour and my banana bread would be too tough. Definitely returning. I imagine it would be great for the hard to mix things like doughs, but there's no useable low speed."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOPED OUT","review":"I purchased this from a local discount store.

Complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast & Furious","review":"Everyone who stated that this mixer has no low speed is correct. The lowest setting is the equivalent of medium-to-high on other mixers, so you can't use it for initial blending of ingredients or anything too liquidy or powdery without it spraying everywhere! It does a good job of mixing thicker ingredients (cookie dough, etc.) but if you need to start low and gradually increase speed (like a cake mix) this does not work well.This is an inexpensive mixer and if you just want something to use once in a while it may be okay for you. If you are looking to get a hand mixer as a gift for someone, I do NOT recommend it. This one does not perform as it should."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the drywall screw attachment?","review":"As everyone else has said, the speed settings on this thing are ridiculous. You have five versions of \\"too fast\\" with a boost button to make things even worse. Black and Decker includes this alleged bowl scraper attachment, which they say is suppose to conveniently scrape the sides of the bowl while you mix. Closer to the truth is the flexible attachment that snaps onto the beaters helps to minimize food flying out of the bowl due to the overkill speeds. But it doesn't help enough. It's too fast and you lose control of the mixing process because of that.This mixer sort of looks like a modified Kitchen Aid hand mixer. Believe me, it isn't. Don't waste your money on this one. You would think they took some leftover power drill works and modified them into a hand mixer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless Junk","review":"If you want to use the dough hooks that are shown with the product, then Do not buy this product!!!

And here, the first work finds the addition of some jazz elements into the soundscaping, courtesy of Markus Stockhausen et al. Stockhausen _fils_ is most significant here, as these works share some elements germaine to his father's impressive body of work. But while Karlheinz Stockhausen tends to create pieces of avant-garde spikiness, these two pieces are warm, droning, slowly-spinning constellations of sounds and fragments that draw the listener in to either bathe in the wash or to explore the bits that drift by.

That is, it reads the laser's position 6000 times a second. I haven't found a surface where it doesn't work.

This mouse moves eccentricly and you move over the page or screen in fits and starts. Once you turn the magnifying function on, it can be quite difficult to turn it back off. In one case I had to reboot. Lastly, it screws up some other functions like delete and highlight.

Before this, I had been a loyal Apple buyer since 1998, but no more. The first one I got had battery problems from the get-go, so I had it exchanged after about 6 weeks. After about 5 months, the exchanged unit started having the same problem. I went to request service, but Apple would not support it and insisted on charging me $30 for shipping back to Apple to repair. As this was still under warranty, I balked at the idea for having to pay to ship back an obviously defective product, so I requested a return/refund. No one at Apple or Mac Mall, whom I had purchased the unit from, would assist me, shuffling me back and forth without resolution.

In the information on the iPod it says that the capacity is 3.7 gigs. Well whatever I still love it. Is is so small and easy to use with the click wheel. iTunes is very easy to use in transporting songs onto the iPod. It takes less than a second to transport one song. You just drag the song onto the iPod icon. But I highly recommend getting a case! It can scratch really easily (so I've heard).

Won't do if noise isolation is critical or for active use outdoors - too big to wear or carry for anything but stationary use. The foam covers are deteriorated and I need to replace them. Now, here's the problem - it's odd shaped (square) and only OB sells replacement foams. It's $11 PLUS $12 for shipping - sorry but that's ridiculous. I'm going to pay a few bucks more and try a new Koss Portopro instead.So, given the initial cost AND maintenance cost afterwards - don't buy this sucker, although I enjoyed having it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounded Average","review":"If you think these are good then you would die if you heard a set of simple Apple Earbuds.

Not in a full-of-myself sort of way, but in a need-a-large-hat sort of way. And if you have a big head like me, these headphones will break at the earpiece within a few months. It's a terrible design, really. Like other B&O; products (the corded phone that could create its own feedback comes to mind) I have had the urge to buy, the form trumps function.I love the way they look. If only they had taken into account things like, oh, say, head size? No, why would they do that for headphones? It's not like people put them on their heads or, you know, head is in the name of the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Wonderful","review":"I needed a quality pair of headphones to use while I work. I am rather picky about sound and after some online research I found these B&O; Form 2's. I bought them from my local Apple store $99.95+ tax and opened them as soon as i got home. The design is very attractive and the sound just blows me away! Unlike Bose headphones, which tend to be a bit bassy for my taste, these Form 2's are very natural sounding. The bass tones are very present, but also are the high and mid tones. Basically, everything is equal.The quality is exactly what you'd expect at this price and I plan on having them for a very long time. They are mostly high quality plastic with metal adjusters for the earpieces. The overall feel is very technical and European. Once you set them they stay just how you like them and the attachment point aren't loose at all (thus no movement).Overall, I an very satisfied with these headphones and would buy them again in a heartbeat."},{"rating":"2","title":"this 1989 edition has updated information for the traveller","review":"What a wonderful book about 3 rivers in France, the Lot, the Dordogne and the Tarn.

He truly gets to the heart of the post-colonial condition is this novel, one which will surely become a stable of post-colonial literature studies.

In those rare cases where step by step emergency procedures are set apart with a subhead and in a separate paragraph, they appear as many as ten pages away from the description.

He acknowledges in If This Is A Man that the word \\"cold\\" cannot describe the cold they felt, the word \\"hunger\\" does not begin to portray the hunger that became a living thing, \\"tiredness\\", \\"fear\\", \\"grief\\" - nobody who was not at Auschwitz can ever truly say \\"I understand, I feel\\". And I respect Levi for not trying. Just laying the bitter facts down, interwoven with sometimes heartrending, sometimes funny, and always charming characterizations of people, events, incidences, has been a far more powerful, moving and thought-provoking exercise - that is guaranteed to make every reader feel at least one pang of guilt-cum-gratitude for never having known an experience like that, at least one moment where he or she deeply and in the most acute way mourns Auschwitz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking inside view of the horrors suffered.","review":"This book is fairly easy to read as the chapters are fairly short, I found it difficult to put down. I was surprised by the lack of bitterness in his writing he looked past experiences objectively, and with a lot of thought. The Truce is not as strong as, If I am a man, but essential reading if you read the first book. His writing is very comprehensible and also extremely descriptive. A very conclusive book into concentration camps."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cathedrals are one of the best","review":"The Cathedrals are one of the greatest Gospel groups of all time.

The text is light and interesting, not too indepth and the images are supurb. I saw many of the crown jewels in Houston during the traveling exhibit on the imperial treasures of the Kremlin, I was blown way by the beauty of the Faberge peices and the imperial crown of diamonds and Sable that Peter the Great wore, this book is a great deal like the book I bought at the museum on that trip, it was a Russian book and was fantastic, this one is just as good. At any rate, I highly recommend this book. If you appreciate Russian culture or just the beauty of fine jewlery, then I cant imagine you not being pleased with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely Book, not enough!","review":"The Romanov ladies, dressed for a court function, dripped precious gemstones from top to toe, each Grand Duchess trying to outdo another in grandeur. Most of that jewelry has been lost, sold, the stones removed. Those who escaped the Revolution were lucky if they managed to take a small collection of their jewels with the, and most had to sell what they brought into exile to support themselves -- after they had written and sold their memoirs, that is. The memoirs of those who saw the Russian court in all its splendour, however, make it clear that the jewelry shown in this book doesn't begin to give one an idea of what the jewelry of the Romanov court ladies was like, though it tries admirably. I, too, would love to see a book on all the jewels of the Romanov ladies -- it might be impossible to find the information now, but the Soviet government apparently does still have some of the pieces left behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Russian Trars","review":"I bought this book because I adore Russian history, and I already have some other books like Faberge Eggs.

Not so - They are BREATHTAKING, and the text really explains what was going on when these jewels were being worn. I find it amazing that the Soviets kept most of these jewels intact, but, for the most part, these are full color up-to-date photos recently taken, and Prince Michael gives all the background to make them really important and in context.

If you are a newcomer to presentation skills:Based on numerous studies of such things as \\"primacy and recency\\" (what was said first, and what was said most recently), it is generally acknowledged that people tend to pay most attention at the beginning of a standard presentation, nearly as much at the end, and least in the middle.According to this book, however, and with no hint of an explanation or supporting evidence, the exact opposite is true.The rest of the content is of a similar quality.It is possible, of course, that I have misunderstood the author's intended message - in which case I guess that simply demonstrates that the explanations in the book are even worse than I thought they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"INTERESTING THRILLER, BUT.............!","review":"I had seen this film many years ago and saw it was coming on one of my HD channel, so I thought I would give it another look.

The leather is soft but durable, and you will not have to worry about setting off any airport or courthouse alarms as they do not have a metal shank. They are elegant and stylish enough you can wear with just about any suit, but not feel as though you are wearing uncomfortable, stiff dress shoes. They are quiet, don't squeak on floors or make clicking sounds, and they have good traction. The shoes have maintained their shape well these past four months I've worn them, about two to three times a week, without creasing over the toes. A bit pricey compared to other shoes, but you get your money's worth.Update: After a few more months use, the upper area of shoes above the toes began to pop out, perhaps due to not having any metal support.

Both sets were labeled for queen, by the way. The pink set fit great, felt great. The floral scroll would not fit my queen bed without a huge struggle, then popped off the corners the minute I got into bed. Ended up giving them to my fiance for his double bed in the UK, and they fit his bed perfectly. Also, the fabric of the floral scroll sheets was scratchy and not warm and fuzzy, even after several washings.

I became a little wary when the author claimed that no European had any frame of reference for the act of smoking in 1492. It's possible, but it seemed unlikely to me. People in the Middle East and Asia would have experience with smoking opium and cannabis, unless I'm mistaken. I don't know if it was present in Europe at the time, but these were explorers who presumably had some knowledge of Asia. I was also less than thrilled to hear the author's assertion that athletes die earlier than sedentary individuals because their hearts beat so much faster (he goes on to explain that the human heart has only so many beats). The author is very enthusiastic about smoking, and it perhaps colors his writing on secondhand smoke. He spends a great deal of time explaining why he thinks that secondhand smoke has no discernible health effects.To sum up, I think it's a poorly written book on an interesting topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Minute to Zero","review":"Movie had a great story, but filming methods of that time was not that great.

Stereotypical characters, plot threads that run off into nothing. . . at best, the novel is for young adults, but it is in no way for adults. I've been reading Howard Bahr's novels of the war, and they are excellent. I live in the area depicted in the novel, so I was doubly disappointed by the book.

The book serves to remind therapists that we are human, but focuses on all the possible negative aspects of a therapists life and practice. I feel this book turns people away from seeking therapy or going into the profession. The book is written with an over-whelming negativity and a hint of arrogance. If you are looking for something to normalize your negative experiences as a therapist, then this is possibly the best book out there for you. If you are romantically involved with a therapist that you are concerned about, then this may be a good thing to read to better understand what may be going on. If you are new to the field, then read the book on and off as needed (if you must). If you are not a therapist or involved with one, then this book has nothing for you. Therapy, like every field, is a mixed bag. This book fails to acknowledge the goodness in the lives of those being a therapist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a job!","review":"The least this book does is point out the reality that many who falsely pride themselves in the profession of psychotherapy would do better in other career fields: welding, sewing, fruit picking, VCR repair.

But Five also attempts to bring a bit of a funky urban \\"edge\\" to their work: streetwise slang (\\"just kickin' it with you, girl\\"), rap interludes, etc. The result is a varied CD with some real bursts of energy and appeal.Some of the better songs on the disc include the sexually suggestive \\"When the Lights Go Out,\\" \\"It's the Things You Do,\\" and the harder-edged \\"Everybody Get Up.\\" Overall, a pretty good disc; give \\"Five\\" a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good overall","review":"This is a really good CD.

If they could cut out all crap on the CD, such as the sexual etc. etc. then perhaps I would have more respect for them.

The story centers around a wealthy Black family preparing for the wedding of their popular and beautiful oldest daughter. As the daughter returns to this insular community with her white intended, she forces her family and friends to examine their individual ideas of race, class, and love. Edna West tells her story with a lyrical zest without waxing too poetic. She builds the tale cleverly with characters who are multi-dimensional and complex. The reader is allowed to meet each as they pause for reflection throughout the book. I thought this book was interesting, thought-provoking and inspiring. It is the subject of our book club's next discussion. Kudos to a Harlem Renaissance alum for her very timely piece. dsherard@aol.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good beginning, but TERRIBLE ending.","review":"While I read the bulk of the wedding, I enjoyed myself thoroughly reading about all the histories of Shelby's relatives, and the past. Then, in the third chapter from the end, the plot in the present begins. There is a lot of good buildup of tension towards the end, but in the final action scene, the plot falls apart. When shelby sees Lute with his battered husband and child, she somehow infers that the cause of the death was lute's racism. But if examined at all, shelby would not have known anything about the situation, why she was dead, who the woman in Lute's car was, and also, the child's death was caused by the coincidence of Lute beating her, nothing purposeful. As me and my friends joked in school, with all respect, it seems like Dorothy West died a few chapters before the end, and Oprah came in and took over."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wedding","review":"The WeddingThe Wedding by Dorothy West is a very well written piece of literature. The southern influence in her writing is very obvious and adds to the overall effect the book gives. Even though the book is mainly focused around the Wedding itself there are many underlining topic and themes. These give the reader a better understanding of the whole family history and the characteristics of individual people in the book. The upper class setting of the oval island makes the prejudices people have for one another stand out. I thought that this book was very enjoyable and would recommend it to any who wishes to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant weaving of generational race and social status","review":"The Wedding is a thoughtful integration of race and social class. West does a splendid job of unfolding family history in a way that proves that \\"class\\" is much more than social standing. The authors treatment of racial issues are emotional and very introspective. The large cast of characters can be a bit confusing, but the author includes a family tree at the beginning of the book to keep things straight.

I like how the book weaves in and out of generations of history, and it seems a far more mature work to me than \\"The Living.\\" The writing is better, too -- far more fluid and graceful (though I do have to agree a bit that the dialogue is somewhat stilted).

I was so pleased to be able to find a first edition copy on Amazon in perfect condition much like the one my mother purchased for me. The book was turned into an Oprah Winfrey television production starring Halle Berry years ago, and while the movie captured the book elegantly, the book stands alone in perfection.

Whatever your concept of the Great Spirit, God, etc, it's easy to find wisdom here.A gentle, truly humble soul, Merton is his own best testimony to the benefits of shutting out the world and letting your inner voice have its say. This is maybe the most accessible of Merton's writings, and if the war profiteers who control America would open their minds to these concepts, we'd all be living in a much more peaceful and loving world.

For Merton, solitude is not a solipsistic escape from human society but, rather, a search for the mercy of God. It is also a necessary foundation for open and loving human relationships.Merton's writing style is personal, paradoxical, and replete with memorable aphorisms. For example:- \\"Humility is a virtue, not a neurosis.\\"- \\"A man knows when he has found his vocation when he stops thinking about living and begins living.\\"- \\"To be an acorn is to have a taste for being an oak tree.\\"Three generations of readers have found that this little book not only teaches about solitude but helps them begin to experience it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Clips of Lady Gaga repeated continiously throughout the video. there were no videos of any popular songs.There was no one on one interview with Lady Gaga.

We have another hasbro lightsaber, a clear one that's lights can be either red or blue, and we've had that for a long time and it has never had this problem.

Watch AOTC again, and pay close attention to the arena scene, when Mace's saber gets knocked from his hand, the hilt is clearly shown flying to the ground, and it is the gold one. Then, watch the trailer for ROTS and you can clearly see his gold hilt when he walks into the chancellor's office. No doubt this is a very nice looking and fun saber, but a little consistency is nice. Of course, these don't compare to the Force FX sabers, but they're nice to hold you over till you can afford one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sorry you guys are all wrong....yep...","review":"I have no problems with saying that I am a geek, but yes, this is not mace windu's hilt, it is actually his from episode 1 when he never drew his lightsaber...it also had a blue blade. Mace actually makes the new electron (gold) hilt after becoming a senior council member. And this is not half of darth maul's lightsaber (the hilt that is), but now Plo Koon's lightsaber (dies in jedi starfighter, weird mask lookin dude).

While there is some information not regularly included in other glassware books such as brief histories of some of the glass companies and some historical perspective on depression era glassware, the book fails with respect to scope and accuracy. There are misidentifications, unknowns, anachronisms and far too much repetition. The writing style is somewhat amateurish and contains too much irrelevant information like how the author came to own a particular item or how festive this set looks at Christmas. We don't need to see the same berry set in every color that the author has acquired. Much of the glassware shown in the book is not from the depression era and it seems that the book is more of a showcase of one person's mediocre collection rather than a comprehensive guide that collectors would find useful"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact and useful","review":"This book packs a lot of interesting material into a small volume. E.g., I picked up another book recently that started talking about cobordisms right off the bat; despite my having a couple of shelves full of well-known Dover, Springer, Cambridge UP etc. books on topology, differential geometry, mathematical physics, etc., Milnor's tiny book was the only one I found that could help me understand what cobordisms are right away.

Consider that these guys have been recording now for around 30 years,and that this is their 20th studio release. To say that it is absolutely one of the band's best EVER is quite the high compliment! But as I say-it's all true.And yes, I'm comparing it to 'Blackout','Love At First Sting',etc,etc.. If you've ever dug stuff by these guys,then get hold of this as fast as you can-you won't be disappointed in the least. Forget about the mistep 'Eye To Eye' (hey-Def Leppard did it with 'Slang'). 'Unbreakable' marks the return of this class (and classic) band. It's time to CELEBRATE!! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but they've done better","review":"Perhaps my expectations were so high because my prior Scorpions purchases before this have been Humanity just recently in 2008, and only Crazy World (Great album!!)in 1990 when it first came out. I guess this album had a lot to live up to. I've always loved the Scorps but just haven't been following them closely. \\"Unbreakable\\" shows their hard side, yes, but it's not as creative or artistic as many of their other albums, which is what I truly like them for. If you're a die hard Scorps fan, you'll want this for your collection. Otherwise, just download a couple songs like \\"My Generation\\", \\"Maybe I, Maybe You\\", and perhaps even \\"Through My Eyes\\", and you'll have the best songs on the CD. This one just didn't appeal to me as much as the others I've purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're back!","review":"This is a really good album!

Thank you guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cobias, you are a retard...","review":"FACE THE HEAT WAS THE SCORPIONS WORST ALBUM, AND IT CAME OUT TEN YEARS AGO. This on the other hand is a true masterpiece. It may not have the hype or zing of an album like Judas Priest's Angel of Retribution, but it is very much in the vein of that album: a modernized sound, but very similar to the classic Scorpions, driven by power chords and reasonably simple basslines. Klaus has his trademark vocal stylings here too, which is a huge break for fans, because for a while Klaus wasn't himself at all. The bottom line: I think that the album sounds great, and I would get it just for the song \\"Love 'Em Or Leave 'Em.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Scorpions are Back with New Generation!","review":"This album is the best in years...the song \\"New Generation\\" is currently among my favorite Scorpion songs ever...right up there with \\"In Your Park, \\"The Zoo\\", and \\"Winds of Change\\". While this is an anthem song, it rocks more true to the Scorpions regular music. It is an anthem for a New Generation! This one song is enough to buy this CD for...Many of the other songs are good, but my other favorite song from this CD is \\"Through My Eyes\\" which is closer in style to some of the ballad rock hits mentioned above...If you like the Scorpions, you will love this CD!If you love metal or rock, you will love New Generation!If you love ballad rock, you will like Through My Eyes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Impressed...

I thought it was worth the risk.Let me tell you, this is one of the best albums I've heard. It has a really 80's, upbeat rockin' feel to it. I love the songs.

The riffs were lifted from a lot of sources, most notably their own songs. No real hair-raising guitar solos or fantastic drumming or bass playing.

That changed when I sampled this at the local music shop and had to buy it. This is simply a fun rock album. Are any of the songs a megahit? No. Are there any ripping guitar solos that I'll still be talking about in 20 years? No. But the CD is solid. I've had it for 6 months and still listen to it regularly. That makes it a winner in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbreakable...unbelievable!","review":"Having been a fanatical Scorps fan since 1982,and particularly loving their albums from the 70's and early 80's, I had lost interest in them over the past decade. I am thrilled to report that \\"Unbreakable\\" has renewed my love for them all over again. I dutifully continued to purchase every album they have ever released, but after buying the dreadful \\"Eye II Eye\\" I had vowed to never again buy another Scorps album. However, after reading some great reviews of \\"Unbreakable\\" and reports that it was a return to the sound of \\"Blackout\\", I had no choice but to shell out the money and acquire myself a copy of \\"Unbreakable\\". I have to echo the sentiments expressed by all of the other reviewers on this site - this is truly a return to form, and the lyrics are as endearingly silly as ever, making this the best Scorps album since \\"Love at First Sting\\".

Husemoller lays out the foundations, starting from scratch, and presupposes a great deal of mathematical maturity. New applications to physics (gauge theory, supersymmetry and all that) are usually better left untouched in a book like this, since Husemoller's secondary concern is about applications to homotopy theory rather than physical applications. To some reviewers, this would leave much else to be desired, but the scope of the book warrants attention being paid to the nitty-gritty of fibres bundles, suitable for a mathematical audience (say, homotopy theorists).Excellent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good album, terrible production","review":"This album doesn't suck. It has a lot of good songs, but the production is so terrible that I can't stand to listen to it. There is no dynamic range and it sounds like it was being played at a low volume; the guitars sound muddy and the drums sound over compressed. The vocals are reverbed to make them sound like you are in a big room with really bad accoustics.If you aren't a fan of Kamelot skip this and get Karma or The Fourth Legacy instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Siege Perilous","review":"Off the bat, it's a great CD, no two ways about it. However, there weren't any songs in particular that wow'd me or caught my ears. I wasn't expecting anything as awesome as \\"New Allegiance + The Fourth Legacy\\", \\"Across the Highlands\\", or \\"Center of the Universe\\" seeing as how most bands' early works aren't as good due to lack of development, but it would have been nice to have at least 1 song to catch my ear with a little bit of move to it or a powerful chorus. However, I would sooner listen to this CD as a whole, versus some other albums where I would only listen to a handful of songs only. I don't recommend this unless you're a serious Kamelot fan. If you're not, I recommend you start with some of their newer albums and work backwards, haha."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nightmare inducing","review":"I guess I'm alone on this one but the graphic descriptions and cruelty of the villain in Montana Sky were too much for me.

Edgerton fails to create memorable and true-to-life characters as he usually does; I had trouble keeping names straight in the book, and I never felt as if I knew any of them. \\"Where Trouble Sleeps\\" is uncharacteristically vulgar and crude for a work by Edgerton. Frequent profanity and allusions to masturbation that have nothing to do with the plot are things one would expect from a mainstream novelist, not from a highly esteemed Southern author like Clyde Edgerton. Has he sold out to the rest of America and kissed the true South goodbye? Only his next novel will tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hugely Disappointing","review":"I read this book from a recommendation in Honey for a Woman's Heart and I was appalled. It is so crude in so many places. I was hoping for a story full of funny characters that satirized Southern culture.

The stranger tries to fit in and even gets friendly with some of the people in town before he does his evil deed. The book is suppose to be funny and it is in some parts.

I wish it was, it might have made for a better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!","review":"I am a huge Clyde Edgerton fan, and I'm sorry to say I was VERY disappointed with this book. It just never seemed to get off the ground. I was expecting the type of story that I fell in love with in *Raney* and *Walking Across Egypt* (both of which left me in tears, I laughed so hard). If you're looking for Listre, you're not going to find it in this book Oh well, I guess I'll wait on his next one..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creates Nostalgia for a Place I've Never Visited","review":"Clyde Edgerton's loving and funny evocations of the rural South capture the charms and strengths of the South.His old women are especially memorable: drawing their confidence from their religious faith, they don't need a shotgun to assert themselves (and, if they DO need a shotgun, they know how to use that, too). Contrary to his publicist's ads, Mr. Edgerton is not out to mock the religious hypocrisies of his characters. Yes, they are only human and don't always live up to their ideals, but it is also very clear that they draw strength from their faith.Where Trouble Sleeps is a parable of temptation and how a small town can be corrupted. Whether the corrupter is \\"Satan\\" or just a conman is up to the reader's interpretation, but it is a delightful read either way. The story manages to introduce you to what seems to be most of the population of Listre, North Carolina and keeps them fresh in your mind with a few deft strokes of the author's pen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible read","review":"I recently picked this up in an airport and knocked it off in the first few hours of a seven hour flight. The first thirty pages promised something fun and exciting - a World War II adventure along the lines of an Indiana Jones flick. But this book is absolutely terrible! Boring stock characters combined with a plot that specifically avoided each and every interesting turn it may have taken, opting instead for boring scenarios that the most run-of-the-mill TV shows would be embarrassed of.It sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea and beginning botched to the extreme!","review":"This book starts off like a classic adventure in the desert - \`Raiders of The Lost Ark' or \`King Solomon's Mines'. But Higgins phones this one in; that is, what starts as a geo-political romp with Nazis chasing lost treasures is quickly turned he-man superman heroics. Charcaters (i.e. Muller) are inconsistent and unrecognizable; the dialogue pulp and stilted as a B action movie; the action unbelievable and the ending a yawner. I wanted a Good adventure, which Higgins has provided me over many novels, but I got junk. Very disappointing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent adventure with an Eric Ambler ambience","review":"I'd never read a Jack Higgins novel before. It was decent; he manages a sort of an Eric Ambler 1930s ambience adapted for the mass-market paperback.Kane, who is pretty much Indiana Jones minus the bullwhip, but including the battered felt hat, is an American archaeologist-adventurer ekeing out a living in a sleepy, sweltering Arabian port on the eve of World War II. When a lovely woman shows up looking for her missing archeologist husband, Kane makes the rounds of the town and finally digs up a trace.Meanwhile a secret German team seeks to capitalize on a German's discovery of traces of the Queen of Sheba, long-rumored, but never substantiated. The Nazis aren't as interested in the discovery itself, as they are in the opportunity to slip a long-range seaplane with just enough capacity to reach, bomb and obstruct the Suez Canal as the German tanks roll into Poland. An enjoyable adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dissapointing Book!","review":"I had previously read my first Higgins book \\"Eye of the Strom\\". I could hardly wait to read \\"Sheba\\". At first the book showed signs of life. The more that I read the worse it got. A book about doing battle with the Nazis in the desert in Egypt showed great promise. Our hero and the lady hunting for her husband had started the book off on a good footing. Then the book fell apart. The plot hit rock bottom. The hoped for action never took place. The excitement level of this book was a 1 on a scale of 1 to 10. I began to wonder if Higgins had hired a ghost writer. I was glad that I finally finished the book so that I could be through with it.A very dissapointing book.I do not reccomend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The short summary of the story that appears on the back of the book leads one to believe that the book is about a German attempt to destroy the Suez canal just prior to the invasion of Poland in September 1939. However, this is really only a minor part of the story and seems grafted onto the main story - the discovery of the temple of Sheba and the search for a missing archelogist. As pointed out by other reviewers the story is a bit Indiana Jones-ish but the book does pre-date those movies.The book is a quick read and well written but it was predictable and unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree this is a bad buy.","review":"I based it o nthe picture and its nothing like that.

I like that it is not too overly fragranced. It is just an easy lotion to apply, doesn't sting on really dry skin, and does a great job.It is not for super cracked or deep dry patches, although with a lot of application, I'm sure it would do a good job.

How on earth anyone could like Mr. Ro's writing style is totally beyond me - maybe it works in magazines - but clearly not in a 300 page book. He jumps from topic to topic, he introduces WAY too many characters with barely any flow at all and most of his info is either taken from sources who refuse to be identified or from other prewritten accounts. He repeats himself in at least 15% of the book. I had really high expectations on this book - and it fell flat on it's face. Out of the 50 or so business books I've read over the years - this one rates dead last. If you've followed Death Row over the years - you've already read at least half of this book........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hip Hop!","review":"The book was better than average. It had a lot of interesting facts about the rise and fall of Death Row Records. I enjoyed learning about the lives of different groups of people. The book peaked my interest because I listen to Rap music. Rap music listeners are often stereotyped as being involved in drug abuse, sex, and violence. Rap does portray many of these ideas and words related to negative things but it's the listeners responsibility to determine right from wrong. Rap music cannot be blamed for the violence in our world, but it is an expression of the violence in our society. The book was very much like a biography of the Death Row Record label and it provided insight into how violent some artists are and how they live their lives everyday. This type of music, as the book points out, is the way some artist's express their life experiences. It also shows the difference between East Coast and West Coast rappers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ronin Ro rocks the house!","review":"I have been a fan of Ro's since his days at The Source, when he was the first writer in America to speak with Dre about Death Row, right before Dre formed it. Then he tackled the Death Row issue in his book Gangsta. But nothing he's written compares to this book. It's good to see Ro complete the Death Row story: he goes where no other music writer has gone before, and offers us facts about Death Row no one else in the media could get. Those who speak out against this book must be gangsta rap fans, or upset with Ro's accurate depiction of the life of Tupac Shakur. For anyone interested in the real story, and in reading for the first time anywhere, the secret history of Death Row (when it was called Future Shock Records), this is the book to read. Ro's book Have Gun Will Travel is one you'll never forget. I can't wait to see the movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"What should have been a fascinating book, at the very least as a voyeuristic experience, fails to deliver largely due to its poorly written pages. The text stumbles along from incomprehensible link to allusive derailment, making the mistake of huge chunks of repetitive material which inevitably detract from the fascinating subject matter. Perhaps more of an editng disaster than an author's failure.....at the heart of which lies a story deserving a more coherent telling."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent choice; however somewhat repetitive.","review":"Ronin Ro's accomplishment is a magnificent portrayal of one of hip hop's most classic record labels. Trust me, Ro delves into some serious issues that revolved around Death Row's leader Suge Knight. Once I opened the book, I could not put it down, it captivated all of my free time, I could not wait to read what Suge had done next. The only problem with the book is that it is somewhat repetitive when dealing with the roles of certain people, but overall it was an excellent choice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating!!!","review":"I am a white woman in her fifties, who grew up always having a truly deep appreciation for the music from my generation (which was Motown).Never in my wildest dreams did I ever think I would be interested in reading a book about hip-hop culture,but boy- did I thoroughly enjoy this splendid read. It is wonderful to see a book of this topic written with such style and class. Bravo! Hats off to Mr. Ronin Ro. A truly gifted writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good look into Death Row/Not enough 1st hand evidence","review":"Ronin Ro does an adequate job of detailing Death Row Records, though the book lacks new information. I rate this book so highly primarily because of the quality of information about the history of Death Row, its artists, and its business. As a reader that is interested in the makings of \\"gangsta rap\\" and the motives behind this artform, I couldn't put the book down. Ro does a good job of presenting a wealth of information in the book, though was weak in organizing the book. A Must Read for any Death Row fan or anyone that is curious about the label and its artists."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could've been great","review":"I was so hyped to read this book. The subject matter is fascinating, scandalous, timely and emotional. The writing, however, is abysmal. Apparently the publisher's fact-checkers were snoring on the job [the Ballage Hotel (Bel Age)in Los Angeles! ]. The text is very choppy, repetitive, disorganized, and awkward. I was shocked to learn that Ronin Ro is a journalist for national magazines. He's got a lot to learn about the art of writing. His editor is especially to blame."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book For Any True Rap Fan!!!!!","review":"This book gives you an inside look at one of the most powerfull companies in history. Its not just contracts and courtrooms, its murder, shooting and violence. It keeps your interest from start to finish. You see what a true gangsta Suge Knight was, doing anything to get what he wanted. It covers Dr. Dre, Suge Knight, N.W.A., the DOC, Tupac, Snoop Dogg, and many more. Ronin Ro puts direct quotes and doesnt altar or change anything, its raw, real, true. The language is definatly for 16+ but its great regarless. Go behind the scenes of the biggest indusry in music, and go inside the East Vs. West Coast Rap Battle. Once it arrives you will never put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK.","review":"I disagree with the reviewers who found this novel stunning, exquisitely written, brutal, and caring.

All her books in the past have been great, however, this book fell way short. I do respect Ms. Ray with her attempt to write about other cultures set in different time periods.

I love reading all types of books and I felt this book was one on the top of my list. I thought the characters were great together -- the strong- willed Alexandria and the dashing Thorne. They were made for each other even though both tried to deny their true feelings. The plot was great. I have read other books by Ms. Ray that are wonderful also. I would like to see a sequel to The Bargain with a storyline involving Thorne's sister, Judith, and perhaps The Shadow or Lord Stonewell. I think Judith showed courage and will not let her handicap hinder her from finding true love. Judith is a character by herself and deserves her own story! Please keep this in mind, Ms. Ray.

What publisher was stupid enough to consider this printable?"},{"rating":"1","title":"mountain out of a molehill","review":"In and of itself, the book was enjoyable. As an entry in the Foundation saga however, it was a let down. I suppose Asimov didn't leave Benford a lot to work with. Confined as Benford was to this chapter in the life of Hari Seldon, the contribution was mostly filler, not to mention eerily autobiographical. It was hard to become involved with the story because it seemed as if Benford was drawing from his own personal experiences at some points and then mixing in some Indiana Jones at other points. Interrupt this regularly with background info (Joan and Voltaire), end result: soap opera. Once again, apart from the striking incongruity, this was a good book. For Benford to turn this tiny part of the story into page-turning entertainment is a testament to his ability."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Foundation","review":"As an avid Asimov and Foundation reader, one thing I can say is that this book only pays a passing tribute to the Foundation universe of Asimov. Apart from some of the characters having the same names, such as Seldon, Dors etc., they are \\"different\\" characters in that they do not act or behave the same way as in Asimov's novels.The story is uninteresting and the new \\"concepts\\" introduced into the universe, such as worm holes, TikTocs etc., seem very much out of place.Readers of the Foundation series will still want to finish this book to continue exploring the remaining two novels but be prepared for a hard slog through a relatively uninteresting novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I'm sure glad I got this book at the library instead of paying money for it.

Characters, dialogue, even the setting was ringing my deja vu alarm. Finally, I realized: the entire middle section of the book (about Ipan, for those who read it already) was also published as a short story which made it into 1997's _The Year's Best Science Fiction_. Even though the book was good, most if it gave the same impression: it felt like a collection of Benford short stories bound up and renamed \\"Foundation.\\" How else can one explain wormholes, Voltaire, tiktoks, and a dozen other elements that never should have been in a Foundation universe?

If you decide you must read this (glutton for punishment?) you should know you can skip entire pages later in the book as Voltaire and Joan of Arc 'describe' the mesh they inhabit. You won't miss a thing.Benford doesn't add to the Foundation universe, he subtracts. Characters are radically different. The universe itself is different. Why even write a book supposedly in the Asimov universe only to radically alter nearly EVERYTHING?Besides the horrible hatchet job on the Asimov universe, Benford's writing is stilted, boring, lengthy for no reason and rudderless.The only good thing I can say about the work I put into reading this mess is that I now know NEVER to read/struggle-through another Benford book/mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring - does no justice to Asimov's memory","review":"This book is one of the most boring sci-fi novels I have ever read.

In my estimation, Benford is a fine author with many fine books written. However, this is not one of them. As a fan of Asimov, I am quite familiar with the Foundation universe. Sadly, this book takes that universe and rips it to shreds. Benford's Voltaire and Joan subplots were contrived and did not fit into the story. One thinks that Benford, in his bid to stretch literary boundaries, crossed a line that should never have been crossed. In all, I was totally disappointed with this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a longer read than all Isaac's works combined","review":"I have read essentially all of Asimov's fantasy, science fiction and nonfiction works, and I never labored to finish a single one. I wish I could say the same about this effort. The editor did Mr. Benford (and the readers) a disservice by not redlining out at least 200 pages.If Hari Seldon had truly taken as long to reach obvious conclusions as depicted in this novel, the Empire would have collapsed and been reborn before psychohistory was ready (and Hober Mallow would have long since run out of cigars).On its own merit, I might have rated this as two stars. It gets a one-star penalty when viewed in an Asimovian context."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of paper. An excuse for cyber-babble at its worst.","review":"What a complete disappointment. Instead of a true expansion of Asimov's Foundation universe, Benford gives us a token amount of Hari Seldon while going off the deep end into Imperial yuppies playing sex, drug and power games. Even worse, the yuppies are only a mechanism to introduce us to 20,000 year old cyber recreations of Voltair and Joan of Arc, who seem to be in some kind of menage a trois with a robot waiter that has a crush on a blonde cook. And somewhere in this mess he drags in giant worms ala Dune. I had to give up after wading through the first third, which is almos unheard of for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly NOT recomended","review":"Even though Mr. Benford tried to shred a new light to birth of Foundation, his efforts are useless. Boring dialogs, a lot of fantasy, a lot of empty words... The plot is \\"watered\\" with unecessary descriptions, long dialogs that lead nowhere (the begining is not to bad but it gets worse reading to the end).Good highlight is Eto Demerzel's character - his comeback. The writing style is quite acceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just read so you can say you did","review":"Before reading this entry into the foundation universe, i had just finished reading \\"Forward the Foundation\\" and \\"Prelude to the Foundation\\" and found the very different writing styles to be a shock. It was hard for me to plod through the unnecessary converstaion and flat characters of the story.It is also possible that the story was that much worse because it described a piece of the foundation story I had just finished reading, eventhough it was more in depth. Whatever the reason I finished reading it because I had already bought the other two installments and I did not want to miss anything. The book did contain a couple of parts that were very interesting save for tedious description and dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed...","review":"Benford is a good author but sadly his addition to the Foundation Saga did not fit at all. First, the personalities are way too different than in the original series. Secondly, the story contradicts way too many of the things set forth by Asimov such as the non-existance of aliens. Finally, some events are unbelievable such as Superhero Seldon performing feats even James Bond wouldn't attempt.Benford took his previous writings (Immersion, etc.) and simply 'meshed' them into the book, put in the characters, and called it \\"Foundation\\". Had he written outside of Asimov's universe, the book would have been much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep away, else spoil your interest dead.","review":"After reading the foundation saga and taking great pleasure from it, my attention was drawn, whilst in a book shop, to this further trilogy promising yet more insight to Asimov's tale. What a load of guff.The book lacked the gripping story line that Asimov created, fixing you to the book for hours. Whilst the characters showed deep progression along philosophical lines, the whole thing was just very dull and killed off my want for further foundation titles.Be warned, this is not Asimov material and will not live up to any expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Storyline unrelated to foundation series","review":"I've read the original series over several times, both in timeline and published sequence and I found myself asking the question 'What has this story got to do with the whole thing?'. For large portions of the book, it seemed like the author had a completely different story for a completely different book and was trying to shoehorn it into the foundation series - particularly the large part dedicated to Joan of Arc and Voltaire and also the alien intelligences. I found I was reading it not because I liked what was going on, but because I felt compelled to finish something I had started. I had a similar feeling about much of the 'Foundations Friends' book some time ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very tedious book to read. Asimov fans beware!","review":"This novel was very tedious to read. Being a fan of clearly written fiction, especially Asimov, I found Benford's storytelling very plodding. I could only read it in small, single-chapter snippets, unlike any Asimov book, which I could easily read in one sitting. The introduction of \\"sims\\" defied logic. Having a sim act as first minister dumbfounded me. The scenes and references to Panucopia were very distracting. Seldon kept seeing parallels between the Pans and Humans, yet it was unclear whether this formed some basis for Psychohistory. Also the use of the word \\"mathist\\" and other non-Asimov language was very distracting. I wish Benford had included his afterword as a warning to Asimov fans contemplating the reading of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"After 100 pages , I had to put it down. Sorry!","review":"I've never read Gregory Benford's books. I expected this book to be written in the style that Asimov would have written it. Asimov's writing style is what appealed to me I guess and I hoped to just have it continue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Asimov.","review":"This is a really nice book. But it's not Asimov! Benford's writing is nice, and some idea's are revolutionary (like the reason why humans are the only intelligent race in the galaxy). But on the other hand, there are some ideas that just don't fit for Asimov's universe (like wormholes). True, even Asimov had some contradictions, like said in Benford's Afterward. But they still fit. In conclution, This book is nice and you should read it, and even only to understand \\"F&Chaos\\", which should be great. But you mustn't think of it as an Asimov story. Read it, but beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - skip to the 2nd book of the trilogy.","review":"Foundation's Fear is very disappointing. Gregory Benford takes it upon himself to change the physics of Asimov's universe. The book would have been much better if the middle 300 pages had been left out. On a happier note, Foundation and Chaos by Greg Bear is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you loved Asimov's series, skip this one.","review":"I read the numerous reviews and almost didn't purchase this one because of the many negative comments. Being a HUGE fan of Asimov's series, though, I felt I had to give it a try. I regret that decision. This book was nothing like the original series and added nothing to it. If you read Asimov's last book, Forward the Foundation, this one is just a copy with a lot of unnecessary detail included (over 500 pages). You won't miss anything by skipping this one.If you are a fan of Benford and thought Asimov omitted a lot, then maybe you'll like this one. Maybe it was just over my head, but I loved Asmimov's books and this one wasn't necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"...Not a \\"Foundation Book\\"","review":"I found this book qiute tedious to read. It lacks the fluidity that makes Asimov a literary great. Also, I don't like the way that Benford changed the \\"Foundation\\" universe, the worst examples being \\"worm-holes\\" and alien intelligences. Asimov explains this lack of alien civilizations in \\"The End Of Eternity\\". Overall, I found this to be one of the worst books I ever read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"Benford's ideas are interesting. Unfortunately, his prose is grating, his characters are poorly developed, and his plots are laughable. This book has little to do with Asimov's universe, and cannot stand on its own merits. I see no reason for anyone to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Asimov already write this one?","review":"Just from reading the reviews, I can see what is in the book that is \\"Foundational\\" simply rehashes, storyline-wise, the two pre-foundation books Asimov wrote. No. Hari is dead, both of them. Let them rest in peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major letdown","review":"Normally I check out other Amazon.com reader's comments on novels that I intend to buy, before I actually buy. I bought this book without doing so because it was \\"approved by the Asimov Trust\\". What a major mistake! A \\"Voltaire & Joan D'Arc\\" tangent filled half the book, and contributed nothing to the main storyline. I think the author found sudden fascination with the concept of bodyless simulated \\"souls\\" and just happened to be writing this book at the time. So he went ahead and \\"core dumped\\". The book does, however, in the tradition of the other Foundation books, make comments on *current* social mores and on the \\"decline\\" of the physical science research (in conjunction with the ascendancy of the engineering disciplines)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The forward should contain an apology to the Asimov estate","review":"Simply put, this book does not fit any of the Foundation books. The characters act in ways different from Asimov's (including drug use) and the book goes *nowhere*. It introduces nothing of value to the series and left me wondering why I was so insistent on finishing it.If you insist on buying it, don't spend American money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but not great","review":"I expected the 2nd foundation series to pickup where the foundation series left off not backtrack & cover stuff not written about in the past. There is a large section is regarding the SIMs could have been shortened down considerably. I skimmed a lot of the information. A lot of the technology in the book is not mentioned in any of the org books and seems out of place for the timeframe. It seems more star trekish than foundation series."},{"rating":"1","title":"THEY SHOULD HAVE LEFT ASIMOV'S WORKS ALONE !","review":"When will we learn that a great writer is a great writer because of his ideas, imagination and the style he presents them to us with. This book was a terrible attempt to copy a Grand Master. Although Benford is a wonderful writer on his own, could Picasso ever copy Michaelangelo's Mona Lisa? To me, this is a very sad moment. Asimov was one-of-a-kind!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!","review":"This is easily one of the most boring SF books I've read. Don't expect an Asimov-like story. It is not. Benford doesn't come close to the clear, understandable and entertaining way Asimov wrote. Even if you judge it on it's own, it is still boring. Read it only if you are a true fan of foundation and would like to read the other 2 books in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only interesting part is it's title - Foundation","review":"This book could be interesting only to those who read other Foundation novels - without Asimov's original series, this one would be complete waste of time. It is full of pointless explanations and dialogues which make you skip chapters, not pages. Really uncomparable to Asimov's books, this doesn't deserve to be part of the Foundation series..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip It","review":"Seeing Foundation's Fear in the bookstore, I was estatic. No, it wouldn't be the same, but I still wanted to discover where Hari and R. Daneel were heading these days. The first part of the book was great, but then Benford had to resurrect Joan of Arc and Voltaire as \\"Sims.\\" Pure tripe and hogwash, if you ask me. I decided to skip all of the \\"Sim\\" action and stick with Hari and Dors; that made a halfway decent book. I just wish I had received half off at the register. I have never read any other Benford books and now I doubt that I ever will, if Foundation's Fear is an accurate example of his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Bad","review":"Other reviewers have more than amply pointed out that this book utterly lacks Asimov's style, and the familiar characters have changed (brief examples: despite numerous attacks, not one mention of Seldon's twisting; only one line regarding Seldon's adopted son Ryach; and most upsetting, the utter lack of connection and sympathy we feel for Daneel, who has become a weary -- and wearying -- collection of stock phrases and contradictions).Most awful is that this book suffers from lack of a good editor. Hundreds of pages of the dialog between the computer simulated characters Joan of Arc and Voltair should have been cut, and that's just a start. The book is filled with future techno babble which is neither engaging or germain to the story.In short, don't read this expecting to be re-engaged in Seldon's world. And if your time is limited, don't bother reading it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is Benford an author?","review":"After mangling the sequel to Arthur C. Clarke's great novel \\"Against the Fall of Night\\" Benford is back to ruin yet another great science fiction classic, this time by writing what is supposed to be a sequel to Isaac Asimov's Foundation Trilogy. As is usual for Benford, this is a nearly unreadable mess.In the two sequels to this Benford novel, Greg Bear and David Brin do a respectable job trying to repair the damage that Benford does to the \\"Foundation\\" universe, while still maintaining some semblance of continuity with Benford's nonsensical mishmash. But it plainly would have been better if Benford had simply not participated in this project at all.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult","review":"When reading any of the original Foundation books, my greatest dissapointmet always was that I couldn't put the book down. I would finish a book in a matter of a few days. Sadly, I cannot say the same here. I have been reading this book for seven months, and do not feel compelled to even complete reading it. I have read five other books in the meantime. However, having spent good money, and knowing it is part of a trilogy, for some strange reason I feel compelled to complete before continuing. The character Hari was faced with a very difficult challenge; I too, have accepted this challenge, though there may be no historical impact of significance when I complete it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The other two books are much better","review":"I completely agree with the other reviewers. This book was awful (and I'm a diehard Asimov universe fan - I read all 6 of those mediocre Robot City books). Its important for anyone reading these reviews to be aware that the two books that follow this one in the series (by Bear and Brin) are much much better. Unfortunately they had to start where Benford left off, but given that handicap, I think they did a really good job, particularly the second book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"The title of my review may not be creative, but it's accurate. Not only is this a work of \\"fantasy\\" rather than \\"science fiction,\\" it's a really bad work of any kind. Apart from being poorly written in general, it reads as though Benford never actually read the original Foundation series - more like the Cliff Notes version - he has the basic outlines of characterization and story line, but that's about it. If I had read this one first, instead of the second one first, I wouldn't have bought the others in this series. At least Bear and Brin wrote readable books, though I wasn't impressed with them as a \\"continuation\\" of Asimov's series, either.It's sad that Asimov's estate is desperate enough to be authorizing books like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I stopped at the mid-point","review":"I began the book primarily because of the Foundation aspect (as did most other readers). I was hoping for a story picking up where \\"Foundation & Earth\\" left off. No such luck. I was very disappointed to find that the new trilogy was going to \\"fill in the gaps\\" of a time period already covered by Asimov in the last two official Foundation novels (\\"Prelude\\" and \\"Forward\\").The first hundred pages kept me pretty interested but eventually my eyes started to glaze. I slogged on till the mid-point, but after a few days I realized I had no desire to return to the book. That's when I decided to quit.I would have forced myself if I weren't already disappointed with the premise, but I read nothing here to indicate that this particular experiment will provide any indispensible lore to the Foundation universe.I have not read any other Benford novels, so I can't comment on whether this novel was a reflection of his usual work."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious at best","review":"Like most other reviewers, I found this book to be quite tedious and difficult to get through. The Joan/Voltaire stuff seemed out of place and distracting (and long!) while the various assassination attempts, Seldon's dislike of the premiereship and other political events seemed to lack all logic. All that aside however, I have to wonder mainly about the editor(s) of this series. Right off the bat, you are treated to a mis-spelling of Dors Venabili as \\"Vanabili\\" - not once, but several times. I have to wonder if the author himself has read the original Foundation novels...! It would explain a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Science, Small Conflict","review":"Maybe if the first half of this treatise had been lopped off, the story could have been salvaged. As it is, one slogs through 600 agonizing pages of pseudo-science with little conflict and no suspense. Benford should have written a concordance to Asimov's Foundation Trilogy, then he wouldn't have had this weak story getting in the way of his speculation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tough read and Asimov wouldn't have written it.","review":"Isaac Asimov would not have had to explain Hari Seldon or Dors Venabali, his text would have done that for him. This was not an easy read. I have enjoyed Isaac Asimov's writings for many years having been initiated by my father who took up reading Asimov's works from the 1940'S. My first book was \\"Foundation and Earth\\" and from there was addicted. These books made sense as Isaac Asimov wrote with easy prose, not he said, she said, they did. Books that were written, using Asimov's name after his death, are mere stories by amateurish wannabes. Regretfully, no one can imitate his style and description."},{"rating":"1","title":"Foundation's Fear is this Asimov fan's biggest fear!","review":"One of the things that I have always enjoyed about the Foundation series is Mr. Asimov's easy writing style. Unfortunately, I found that reading Foundation's Fear was a laborious exercise. The author seems to struggle reconciling the scientific concepts initialized by Isaac Asimov with his own concepts of physics. The entire dialogue between Voltaire and Joan was particularly difficult to wade through, only to discover that this part of the story line had very little to do with the development of the rest of the book. I understand that some ideas had to be set up for the next two books, but I was frustrated by the sense that this book just didn't have a reason for being other than the commercial success guaranteed by the \\"Foundation\\" title. Given a choice between buying this book or rereading any of the original Foundation titles, this reviewer would recommend revisiting Mr. Asimov's authentic classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad on its own... but","review":"This itself is a great epic story, focusing on Hari Seldon's early life. He is a First Minister for Cleon I (ironic because under Cleon II, his cohorts are expelled in the original Foundation). With a little help from R. Daneel Olivaw, he discovers the science called psychohistory. Personally, I like it a lot, and this series should continue. It gives more background info on Dr. Seldon and his work. However, I agree with most other reviewers here in that it's time for short stories of the Foundation to start again. (A few of the first Empire and of Daneel's efforts to build it wouldn't hurt. Plus, could that other strange robot, Caliban, be brought into the conflict???) Lots of potential exists in the series for exploitation, and personally, I wish I had an agent (and a big enough reputation) to continue the Foundation unto the Second Stage, immediately following Second Foundation with the post-Empire Galaxy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Asimov, nor Foundation, nor good Benford, not good atall","review":"I don't like trashing honest efforts, and I guess this was an honest effort by Gregory Benford, but it fails inexorably.It's supposed to take off from PRELUDE TO FOUNDATION, and does include the two principals from that book, Hari & Dors, also Yugo who's much less interesting than he was in the first book. I especially wonder what happened to Raich who Hari & Dors seemed to be taking in as a son.It is much too heavily laden down with technical talk. There's precious little action on any level for much of the book. Therefore, reading it does become a bit of a chore, not the fun it was reading Asimov's stories.You'll probably want to read it as preparation for the other two books, so just be prepared not to be very excited by it."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad its unreadable","review":"This book is so bad it absolutely unreadable. Anyone failiar with The Foundation series would not recognize this book.An utter waste of money and time spend grinding through each page of innane dialog.thats all I have stength for this book is a POS.(if I could give it a lower rating I would)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I can't even write a proper review since I quit reading around page 250. I participate in critique groups and Benford breaks RULE NUMBER 1. Show, don't tell. He 'tells' so much here that I felt like I was reading a text book on a subject I didn't know anything about. I finally just gave up. I have the second book in the Trilogy (Greg Bear's). I'll certainly give it a shot. I think, by past experience, that David Brin's part will hold my attention better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious...","review":"This book kicks off the Second Foundation trilogy--and makes rather a mess of things. Oh, some parts have virtues. The early history of Hari and Dors, for instance. But it is overlong, badly in need of editing, and thoroughly tedious in parts. The Voltaire/Jeanne d'Arc subplots are both overdone and underdone---too much focus is given to them, and the details are not interesting. THe next book in the series, Foundation and Chaos, is far better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rehashed Material","review":"I am very disappointed in Gregory Benford. If he wasn't up to the task of writing a Foundation Novel, then he should have passed the opportunity to do so.Instead, more than half of this novel is previously published material. The Joan and Voltaire material is lifted from a novella he wrote for Robert Silverberg's Time Gate shared world, and the Chimpanzee Immersion material is lifted from a short story he wrote in 1996 called \\"Immersion.\\"The rest of the novel is, in my opinion, mainly poor characterization of Asimov's characters, acting in ways that would cause the Good Doctor to spin in his grave.I really like Benford's work...but this is certainly the worst effort he has ever put to paper. The fact that much of the book is lifted material (even if it is fairly good material) is inexcusable. The material does not even mesh well with the rest of the book, much less the Foundation Universe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Benford just uses his ideas and puts them on Asimov's Found.","review":"I just couldn't finish the book, it's really boring. Many of the ideas Benford writes about (IE: The \\"sims\\", the \\"mesh\\") were already used in other novels he did.Also, as mentioned in other reviews, the characters aren't themselves anymore! Particulary astonishing is Yugo's change. In this book he is some kind of patriotic Dahlite. Asimov's Yugo never cared about politics.My advice is skip this book, it's not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucky Asimov isn't arround to read it.","review":"This book is terrible. I sincerelly doubt Benford ever read asimov. Please start reading this 'trilogy' from the second book on.The worst characters in all the book are Joan and Voltaire. How did he manage to convince his editor to let this pass as an Asimovian novel is beyond me, as well as the fact that the book is authorizad by the Estate of Isaac Asimov.Do yourself a favor and pretend you know nothing about this book.Start with Greg Bears 'Foundation and Chaos'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trashing the Foundation","review":"BAD! BAD! BAD! I am forced to wonder if the last few reviewers have actually read the origional series. Having read them and listened to them on tape numerous times I was excited when I discovered they were to be continued. Well then I discovered they are not continued. It is a book with the word \\"Foundation\\" in the title but that seems to be the only connection. Asimov gave us a Seldon who used a martial arts technique called \\"Twister\\" here we have a Hari Seldon who almost swings from chandiliers (and does from trees). One wonders just when he had time to work on the \\"Seldon Plan\\". What are wormholes doing in space? They weren't in Asimov's universe and so should not be in this book. Voltair and Joan of Arc? No! This book is not a Foundation book it is a hastily crafted piece of junk. Have I made myself clear enough? If not...if you loved Asimov pass this one by even if it setting on a bin of books to be recycled. It is a pity that trees died so that it could live."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to Foundation fans!","review":"As another reviewer said, I wish that I could give it a zero. I also wish I had read the other reviews before wasting my money on this. I had already purchased Foundation & Chaos before starting Fear. I pray that it's better. I'm afraid to start it now. Anyway, it can't possibly be any worse.The writing is flat and confusing, and as pointed out, the parts with Joan d'Arc and Voltaire are irrelevant and little more than filler. The same with the pan episode. It's like when you had to do a 5000 word essay in school and could come up with only 3000.I wasn't concerned about a story paralleling Forward, but it seems that the only thing Benford did was use the names we all love, without the scope, feeling or sweep of Asimov."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fear of Foundation's Fear","review":"I feel it my duty to discredit this installment of Asimov's wonderful Foundation series. To me, this book wandered way too far into an abstract type of Science fiction that I feel Asimov never delved into. I also feel that Asimov's characters (Seldon, Amarov, etc.) were fundamentally changed. Yugo Amarov was made into a eclectic people-person, when Asimov portrayed him as a reclusive, obsessive psychohistorian. I did not enjoy this book. But Bear's Foundation and Chaos redeems the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have read the reviews","review":"I was very disappointed in this book, as it turns out, for all of the reasons mentioned in existing reviews.

It's a good modern SF novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but we need to see the full trilogy","review":"I enjoyed this book.

This fit the bill. I have other Cuisinart pots and pans which are awesome, and so I figured this would be pretty good. Given that the negative reviews were both very old and kind of inarticulate, I did not worry about them. I briefly looked at the \\"green\\" one offered by Cuisinart, but the negative reviews on that one were pretty clear, plus that one was smaller than this one.I have a ceramic-top range (a Kenmore something-or-other), and this thing fits perfectly over a front and rear burner. I've cooked a bunch of crepes using this griddle, and it works great, even on the flat top range; it doesn't matter that the bottom of the pan doesn't rest directly on the burner, it's actually a plus because the heat has a chance to get transferred to the entire bottom of the pan.I haven't noticed any warping. I will definitely buy another one of these when I wear this one out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for use on ceramic flat cooktops","review":"I was very disappointed when I received the griddle.

Especially informative and provocative are the articles on personhood by Michael Tooley and brain death by Jeff McMahan.

Page Turner!","review":"This was a great book to wet the appetite of ancient What-ifs. The author does a great job in linking ancient mythology, geology, animal extinctions and astronomy into a very probable scenario.In all this was a great page turner that feels like a well written historical account of cataclysm backed by evidence. It is not too packed with data to feel like a geology textbook. Also not being to dreamy like a UFO chaser. Why only 4 stars? I felt that the last few chapters were a little rushed and mostly speculation, but what else is there to go by? I would have liked a little more images, diagrams and something make it just a little more evident. Next I am reading \\"Cataclysm\\" by D.S. Allen and J.B. Delair for a little more scientific evidence of all those bone-caves that Vitale wrote about.Thank you for your great chase through ancient history Joseph!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunning portrayal of what may have happened","review":"A stunning, emotionally gripping account of a cosmic horror that may have happened to our ancestors. The usual account of prehistoric times tells us that \\"there was an ice age and a time of mountain-building\\" and that \\"many prehistoric species were hunted to extinction by early humans\\". That's it. How could something as huge as a giant Planet Killer be ignored and forgotten? This was an unforgettable book that I would recommend to anyone interested in prehistory. At the same time, it is only an introduction. The author touches briefly on many subjects; now I want to read about them in greater depth. I want to see how much of this theory is backed up by research and how much is just speculation. If this really happened... I want to know more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"just awful","review":"very little of this book is devoted to a factual review of the disaster the author believes occurred 12,000 years ago..what he goes over is almost entirely myth - and his own musings..don't waste your money on this book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amusing work of fiction","review":"As a work of fiction it is entertaining.

Hey, get em all!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Close, but no cigar...","review":"I'm kind of torn on this album. It has moments of sheer brillance and greatness, but in large part epitomizes why progressive rock faded from favor. It forgets that music ultimately needs to be musical - a simple rule, but one that this album frequently forgets then remembers which makes this album a somewhat frustrating listening experience (this is a rule that the mighty Yes frequently breaks as well). Flighty lyrics thrown over multi-instrument riffs doesn't necessarily make music. If you want to hear a more \\"musical\\" progressive rock album, try Transatlantic's SMPTe. Also, if you want to hear what a Hammond organ is capable of, buy an ELP album, or better yet, see Keith Emerson live in concert. This album will stay in the collection to see if it improves with continued listening, but it doesn't get any more stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imaginative biography of King Arthur's nemesis","review":"Mary Stewart completes her series of books on the King Arthur legend with this life-story of the knight who killed him, his son Mordred. She convincingly creates a redeeming psychological profile of the killer, rather than letting him be a cardboard villain. The tale also features portraits of Mordred's half-brothers, Gawain, Gareth, Agravaine, and Gaheris. As always, Stewart excels at exposition, with absorbing details of the medieval British countryside and daily life"},{"rating":"2","title":"The wicked day","review":"I was a little disappointed in this book. It didn't have the power the others had, probably because Merlin/Nimue wasn't in it much. The ending was very sad & didn't tie things up well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book of All","review":"This was the best book of them all, and should always be included in the \\"Trilogy\\"as it has as much to do with the story as the rest. Though Mary Stewart wrote 3 great books, (read them all several times) the last book did not feel as an add on, but as the obvious conclusion. Much of the story hinges on Morgan becoming pregnant with her half brother, Arthur's son. Most authors about the Arthurian Legends made the son evil. But in Stewart's book, he is not evil. One should not read the Trilogy without reading the 4th book. It is, the most interesting and believable conclusion to the rest of the stories about the legend of King Arthur. Most of the ones I've read are terrible. But this series is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I love love love this book! The characterization of Mordred is great and the events retold are masterfully written and wonderful. I really really loved this book. I haven't read any of the other Mary Stewart Merlin books, but I definitely will after reading the Wicked day. Even if you are not a fan of Arthuriana, this book is inticing and entertaining.The only letdown is the ending, which never really worked for me, BUT the rest fo the book is great, so this can be forgiven."},{"rating":"2","title":"It wasn't as good as the others...","review":"This book wasn't as good as the others in Mary Stewart's Arthur stories.

He was asked to write a general introduction to his lifetime of work, and his introductory chapter does just that. It was written in English. The other chapters are by different first generation of analysts who practiced as Jungian analysts and taught at the Jung Institute in Zurich and other places around the world. The authors of this book are some of the most serious of Jung's students. This book gives a wonderful view of how the people around Jung thought.Thomas Kirsch"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Introduction, but still Imposing!","review":"As other reviewers have stated, this book is one of two that Jung meant for public consumption. It makes for an excellent introduction to dream interpretation and symbolism, but isn't meant to help you interpret your own dreams by providing a list of symbolic meanings as some texts do. Rather, Jung (who wrote the initial essay) and the other authors provide the basic framework for understanding the mechanics of dream interpretation. The concluding piece on Science and the Unconscious, although the shortest essay, is very interesting and provides tantalizing insights into the relationship between physics and psychology. The book was still a challenging work to read and took me quite some time to finish. It was worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"good place to start with Jung....","review":"....for although he edited this collection and made some contributions, most of it was provided by friends and students who knew how to explain his ideas.

Then I listened to it again with a friend of mine closer, and we learned more about the band and the queen of Otep, Otep. After that, I fell in love with the CD, and now cannot stop listening to it. I suggest getting it, and supporting this awesome band."},{"rating":"2","title":"quite excellent","review":"picked this up after hearing of otep through the metal grapevine, and quite happy that i did. the cd is excellent.if you want a comparison, i liken otep to kittie, with some exceptions. morgan lander has a much better singing voice than otep (hear \\"in winter\\" and \\"charlotte\\"), and otep has a much better screaming-metal voice (hear \\"blood pigs\\"). otep has harder riffs, while kittie is more melodic (if you can call kittie melodic).but like kittie or not, you should check out this cd if you're a metal fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jaded","review":"I have read some of the lower rated reviews and find their points of view to be jaded. I read their references to similarities between Korn and system of a down. this is definately NOT true. Otep is a heavy double bass metal band. one reviewer decided that she/he did not like this CD because of the fact that you can not understand what she is saying/screaming/rapping, not realizing the fact that there is the same problem with most nu-metal bands. for example, if you listen to Cannibal Corpse, you can not understand a word they are saying. you can understand Otep better than you can understand most metal bands. I also read that the lyrics were a tad childish which is true in some songs, but what child can make comparisons to stories from the bible amongst other religious documents? well....i just have to say that this is one of the best and most played CDs i own."},{"rating":"2","title":"oh my","review":"otep screams with rage,and writes with hatred.i bought this cd today and fell in love with it.tortured- this song speaks with whisper,and is definatley a plus to this album.blood pigs- one of the best songs on this whole album.greatt.r.i.c.- greatmy confession- yaysacrilige-just gets better and betteri can't speak anymore, the rest of this album is to good to explain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limp Bizkit/Tool/System Of A Down...","review":"Metal band that sounds like a cross between Limp Bizkit/Tool/System Of A Down.

Otep are basically a death metal band with a female vocalist. But are they the first to do it? Nope! Another death metal band with a female vocalist is Arch Enemy but unlike this band, Arch Enemy are awesome. While Arch Enemy are basically like In Flames or Dark Tranquillity with a female vocalist, Otep are more like a nu-metal band with a female vocalist. However this vocalist is cr a p! She sounds like she's screaming and then suddenly moaning. The guitars are complete garbage as well, just the same old 3 chords with no solos. I'd give this 2 stars to be forgiving but if you want a real chick metal band then listen to Arch Enemy or Nightwish instead of this mediocre group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply amazing!! Beautiful, poetic & downright scary","review":"I saw them at OZZfest and I knew I had to go and pick up this CD. When I finally did I couldn't believe how well done this album is. The music is hard and heavy, the lyrics are beautiful and disturbing but together they flow brilliantly. The lead singer Otep has a range that is unreal. The growling makes you think it's a male but at times when she breaks down in sorts you can hear the woman. Destroy to create and poetry is the perfume of the soul is their message. I definitely think you should give this CD and their message a chance because unlike many metal artists this group has an artistic aura surrounding them. Think Slipknot's heavy beats with early Jonathan Davis lyrics but more poetic and touching. In my mind the best album of 2002!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You People are Crazy","review":"Ok, I'm reading a lot of these other reviews and its annoying me because someone who doesnt know anything about Otep will read these and decide to not give them a try. DO NOT DO THIS! If you like Kitte, My Ruin, Slipknot, Taproot...bands like them, you will definitely love Otep. Before you read any review that tells you they suck or anything like that just find a way to listen to \\"Blood Pig\\" (download it or something). If you dont like that song then no Otep is not for you. But if you find yourself rocking out like me then definitely buy this CD. *Also, They have other CD's out besides this one but this is the one to buy first if you buy it at all. This is the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"heavy but uninteresting","review":"i bought this CD cuz i heard somebody talking about a woman vocalist with a lot of energy. well i didn't know she was going to be screaming and growling. the guitars are heavy and are sometimes cool but the vocals ruin everything. i am sure you will think this is revolutionary material if you ride the bandwagon and love all the cool heavy bands with a \\"new\\" sound like SLIPKNOT and MUDVAYNE and CRAPWANNABEBAND. check out something from the early '90s like BOLTTHROWER or DEICIDE and you will find where all these \\"nu-metal\\" bands get their ideas from. actually FEAR FACTORY - SOUL OF A NEW MACHINE would be the best example."},{"rating":"1","title":"One hit wonder","review":"Ok, i gotta be honest here.

However, it grows thin VERY quickly.After Blood Pigs, you will be sorta hardpressed to find a solid metal song. Sacrilege and Battle Ready are the closest you will find to a true metal song, but even they stray in ways where they just become tedious. The last track is not anything I want to hear.

It is a forgery, banned in many countries. It is a magnificent tool of propaganda, the language is complex and comes across as well researched and to those who do not know any better it is a convincing piece of literature. It has been used as the tool of the anti-semite since its publication, including Adolf Hitler, and so those who disagree with me will no doubt be his loyal post-mortem supporters, thier biggotry undying and their ignorance causing irrepairable damage. To this day, web sites quote Henry Fords appraisal of the work, they fail to quote his retraction and apology to the world of Jewry.

It quotes rabbis who never existed and whose names are so silly, they are obviously made up. It uses supposedly Hebrew terms in ways any first-year Hebrew language student can see are wrong... In short, it was either written by an antisemite or a total idiot (or maybe both.) The first time I came across this book many years ago, it was in a mimeographed form that I thought was supposed to be a joke -- like \\"Legends of the Ferengi\\" and other spoofs on stereotypes. Sadly, it's not intended as a joke at all. Also sadly, there are still people around who are being taken in by what may be the biggest hoax of all time. Sprucing it up in an expensive new edition (talk about hypocrisy!) does nothing improve the idiocy inside the covers. Save your money, folks -- it's just not worth it.

Those are awesome songs performed by the band. The sound quality on this record is a little better than what's on 'Suck On This'. I bought this album on cassette in New Orleans in 1992 and played it too many times. The songs on this record is so funny and they always makes me laugh. I especially love Les Claypool's style of playing on his bass on this album. Nobody can play bass like him. Not one bass player!

Those people havent heard of Victor Wooten or Jaco Pastorius; they can definitely one up Les anyday using only one hand. They both have wonderful solo careers. As for his style, Rob Wright of Nomeansno sounds like him, and he was around before Claypool.

One of my deep conditioners is very thick, doesn't flow quite as freely as I'd like, so I add a bit of a light conditioner until I get a better consistency.Also, amazingly enough, they've been in my shower since 2001 and I've never had an issue with them not sticking.

A nifty album."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD GRIEF!!!!! But not to Charlie Brown","review":"This book is a very taut suspense novel. This is another one where you can't figure out who commits the crimes. I first read this book in 1989 and mailed it to a friend of mine and then I read it again 11 years later. The first time I read this, I was up all night. I will not leave any hints on this, but it is a must read. This focuses on a certain woman who is losing people close to her because of the crazed killer. All I will say is that this killer is out for revenge on an innocent woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hoot Of A Book","review":"Will Self. Raymond Carver. Dorothy Parker. Roald Dahl. OMG could we get a better collection of the best writers ever! I was reticent about the book's topic - relationship meltdown - but it's not a downer at all. It's a hoot! My absolute favorite writers are Carver, Parker and Dahl so I new from the get go that this book would be a good read. Then to discover the inclusion of Will Self, whose name I'd oft heard but who I'd never read, was a treat. Another plus - I found a whole bag of cool writers to add to my favorites list: Self, Almond, Angguish. This book rocks!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughter and Tears","review":"This anthology of stories about the end of romantic relationships made me laugh, a lot, and even made me cry. There is a wide range of authors, from famous literati such as Dorothy Parker and Tobias Wolff to relative newcomers. I loved 99% of these stories, which for an anthology is an impressive strike record. I particulalrly liked the stories by the newcomers, notably Dallas Angguish. Who is this person? His story is poignant to the point of heartbreak, and really funny. A quick search of the web finds Dallas Angguish's poetry wedsite 'Prose Machine' (members.fortunecity.com/powaboy), a bit rough around the edges design-wise but with illuminating poems similar to Sylvia Plath and Allen Ginsberg.

All this book actually amounts to is a short synopsis of an NBA season with little interaction between the players the author is supposed to be introducing us to and himself. At points it comes across as ego stroking on Palmer's part dropping names of all the people who know him and how he gets into all the parties at All-Star weekend. The premise of this book has potential, unfortunately Palmer does not deliver what it is billed as."},{"rating":"1","title":"It deserves 0 stars","review":"I read this book about 6 years ago, but I will always remember how bad it was. The whole purpose of the book was to give insight on how NBA players live their lives, but I am pretty sure in the conclusion he said he couldn't get real insight because it was impossible to get in contact with them. Basically, his conclusion contradicts the entire purpose of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I found this in a discount book store, and was hoping that it would be an interesting, behind-the-scenes look at how NBA players live when they're not playing a game. Instead, it was basically Palmer's tale of trying (mostly unsuccessfully) to get access to a handful of players, but reaping the benefits of swimming in their wake. I agree with most of the other reviews about this book, and found it a chore just to finish it. Not something I would recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame Waste of Time","review":"I got this book at the dollar store, even for $1 I feel ripped off. Most of the narrative is about players avoiding Chris Palmer, Palmer going to the wrong address, Palmer's notes flying out the window or getting stolen, Palmer getting a toothache, Palmer's hard drive crashing. This shoddy book reads like an extended excuse for why he didn't write a decent book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been titled 12th man","review":"I could have read Slam magazine or watch MTV cribs to get the information in this book. He wrote 3 paragraphs about the players he was suppose to follow for a season. All he talked about was what type of cars the players drove and which celebrities he saw. I thought it would be an updated version of Larry Platt's Keepin' It Real. Larry actually wrote about the players."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"I realize the book doesn't portray itself as a hard nose expose or anything like that, but what it amounts to is a writer name-dropping and basically mentioning the perks of being an ESPN writer. There is no in-depth character study of any of the players and the disconnect displayed makes the book very uninteresting. I know nothing more about any of these players than what I have seen already during Sunday Sportcenter pieces. If you're looking for a glimpse into the life of players, this book will keep you waiting, just like the writers are kept waiting by the players. The author definitely left on a miss with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Behind the Scenes?","review":"Chris Palmer's insight into the world of the NBA is about as revealing as George Michael's Sports Machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Absolute Joke","review":"Take note of the other poor reviews, for they are right on the mark. What an absolute joke of a book. Congrats to the publisher for creating some good marketing copy around a solid premise - a backstage look at the lives of five different NBA players. Unfortunately, the book read more like Palmer's boring diary of being an NBA sycophant: picking up spillover chicks; the riveting drama of his hard drive crashing with his manuscript (Hello - are you a professional? can you say 'backup'? Can you say 'gmail yourself a copy of the word file'?); and most embarassingly - the glowing accounts of Palmer getting spiffed with free schwag from NBA players.Lots of stupid asides, a completely disjointed narrative, nothing whatsoever redeeming. Hopefully I just saved you a few bucks..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Sucks","review":"This is probably one of the worst books I have ever read. It provided no insight into the players inside the NBA culture. All the author wrote about is how he gets shafted every time he tries to go out with the players after games. It is very clear that the players wanted no part in a writer witnessing their lives outside the court. Instead all we get is an inside look at how a writer travels in the NBA and trust me, it is not exciting!!! Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"much better than I expected","review":"This book is such an easy read and a guilty pleasure. When I started it, I was a little hesitant...the characters seemed very flat at first and I really thought that if Brock kept calling Kat \\"kitten\\" the whole book it would drive me crazy! I'm glad I stuck with it, though, because I really enjoyed this book. The characters got more depth through each page. The pace of the book picked up a lot about 100 pages through, with suspense and steamy sex scenes. If you are looking to read a really fun, hot, mindless book then you'll love it! I ended up really liking both characters by the end of the book, which I didn't expect at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read. Good contemporary romance. I liked it.","review":"Kat loved Brock as a teen, but Brock mysteriously left town. Ten years later, Kat is on a private island for a five-day contemplative vacation. She is engaged to someone she doesn't love. She sees Brock (for the first time in ten years) as he swims to the island from the ocean. I enjoyed this, but I wish Kat didn't avoid Brock so much for the first two days on the island. I also wish Brock would have told her details about his past and current situation sooner.Sexual content: not evaluated. I read this book before I began counting sex scenes and describing the language. As I recall, it was probably moderate. Setting: current day U.S. and a private island off the Gulf Coast of Florida. Copyright: 2006. Genre: contemporary romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now that summer's over...","review":"Now that summer is over, you're going to need a Hot beach book more than ever. Trust me, SWEPT AWAY by Toni Blake is the perfect all year round beach book choice. It's fast paced, funny, heart wrenching and VERY HOT!I found the secluded island setting perfect and the characters of Kat and Brock to be engaging in a well rounded, fully human way. The dark back story, as well as the supporting cast of friends and parents is also intriguing. I've noticed that all her supporting characters always have a story worthy of mention and worthy of a book of their own, but that's how well she writes. Toni is obviously not afraid to delve into the dark secrets, sorrows and taboos of the heart.Treasure Hunt Alert!

I expected the main characters, Rosemary and Thyme, to be a bit dull and old-worldly but they're actually extremely entertaining. They make a good team, and the stories are interesting and populated with lots of fun characters. And then the settings--as one would expect, lots of lovely gardens and villages.I am very sad to hear that this series has been canceled.

My five daughters and I enjoy watching these gardening murder solving ladies at work. We love seeing all of the beautiful English gardens they visit each week. Occasionally they have visited Spain, England and France as well, those views were also so lovely. Rosemary and Laura are so charming in their funny way of solving the murder of the week and their constant chatter.

Highly recommended for an enjoyable evening of TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rosemary and Thyme","review":"I adore this show!

The music creates a very strong atmosphere in it's simple, woodland-folk constructions. I especially enjoy the concept of the album, that is, the representation of various aspects of nature through three parts: heath or moorland, forest, and water.

Sadly, a truly original fantasy creation has been commercialized for a quick easy profit.

The songs run the gamut from soft, melodic, lyrical phrases to jarring and disturbing dissonance. \\"A plague of Lighthouse keepers\\", is one of the best extended tracks from any of the so-called 'progrssive' bands of that era (1970-1977). Even though it has ten different parts, all flow together in a unique and interesting way to form the whole concept of the piece.

This is my personal opinion. There is nothing wrong with exposing Penguin Cafe Orchestra to a greater audience, but frankly, I am way happier with the later Cafe Del Mar compilations - tunes are better, meld better together, there are more interesting originals... IMHO."},{"rating":"2","title":"a new musical discovery...","review":"Whenever I have any discretionary income I usually head to Barnes & Noble's music department. This time I was greeted with an almost life-size, promotional, cardboard cut-out of Patty advertising 'Impossible Dream.' Since it boasted an endorsement from Dave Matthews, hailing her as a major singer/songwriting talent, I figured I'd give it a shot. Was I glad I did.Sometimes, these marketing strategies are 'full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.' Not this time. What an utterly enchanting piece of work. She certainly does have the kind of voice that demands an emotional reaction. I enjoy artists who fly just under the radar; they are usually the ones with the most to say. Patty is just such an artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's not to love?","review":"This CD is impeccably beautiful. The writing is subtle and sophisticated, and she has something to say, unlike so many of those recording. She uses her voice better than ever, allowing more complex interpretations. I liked her very much before this CD but this brings it over the top. The songwriting is top-notch."},{"rating":"1","title":"time the cruelest critic","review":"I don't think time will be kind to this release from one of America's shining new stars. While the force of her singing and some fine pieces of songcrafting come through, the album is adrift in weak songwriting, ill-conceived forays into blues and gospel, and most notably horrible engineering. No one makes you listen to a record with headphones(or just closely) but it usually helps to fully appreciate the music. Not in this case; close scrutiny is not advised. So we are left with some pretty sounding music that doesn't leave you with much to think or feel about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is the dumpster the origin of life?","review":"O.K., so I listened to this disk once and most likely won't again. On one of the cuts Patti sings \\"standin\\" five times in a row. C'mon now. Come up with any poet or songwriter of worth who would repeat the same word five times in a row. I can't help but think that Patti scoops her lyrics out of a dumpster dumpster dumpster dumpster dumpster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patty is just amazing.","review":"There are some Patty fans out there who simply can't accept it when she records anything that doesn't consist solely of stark acoustic performances with one guitar and her voice. But they are simply dead wrong, and this CD proves it. The gospel-inspired background vocals, the mournful horns on the Rowing Song, the robust full-band work on Love Throws A Line - it's all just amazing.Fine - so far I can't identify a song on this album that is up there with \\"Mary\\" or \\"Making Pies\\" - but there also isn't any \\"Peter Pan\\" on this CD, either. Start to finish it's an amazing package."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhhh","review":"Well, I mean ya its a gundam model kit. If you've ever built one before your well aware of how durable they are. This one looks awesome in the picture, it also has two beam sabers and an assault rifle that come with it. It looks cool when its done, but dont be fooled. It looks way way way better in the picture. The shield has no blue accent on it, and the face has little red like shown.In my opinion it isnt really that bad of a model kit, but thats just it. Its a model kit. Its not for playing with its for show. So if your intentions are to get a model kit to put up on your mantle, splurge a little and get a better one than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coleman Self Inflating Pad","review":"Im very disappointed in this product. Its design is to draw air into the chamber as the memory foam expands in the pad. Because of its one air chamber design when you lay on it all the air is forced down to the feet and under your head. No matter how much air is in it the heavy part of the body the torso is always touching the ground below the pad."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book but.....I have a few qualms","review":"I really hope this wasn't the last one, though I'm sure it is, and I'm sad to see the series go. In some ways, I suppose it was a good way to end off the series, but I really think that Golden could have ended the series better, it leaves you hanging, really, and why do that when the series is OVER??? It nearly drove me insane. The book is one of those FBI books, which I normally do not care much for, but of course, Christopher Golden wrote it and so of course it was good. Brain Trust is slower to start, but it is enticing and an extremely good read. I do have a few qualms with the plot line, or so \\"the plague\\", seemed almost too far-fetched- no, not far fetched, it was weaker than other Golden books. Even with that, Brain Trust is a good book and you should all read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good way to end","review":"I really liked all the books in this series but this book i didn't like that much. it took a very long time for the book to get into the action, unlike the other books. if this was the end of the series, i think they could have ended it better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book in the world!","review":"This book sucked! It was the worst book in the series. If the series does continue I hope none of them are like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly glitchy game","review":"I really can't believe some of the high marks some people have given this game. It glitches out so many times; at least two or three times I had to manually turn off my x-box and restart because of a glitch. Many other times I got stuck on some invisible wall. The AI is horrible and does not live up to the hype.It's not all bad - it's always fun to kill storm troopers with a lightsaber. The cutscenes look pretty, and the voice acting and music are good.This game tries to follow the God of War formula and apply it to Star Wars: slash and hack and level up with new combos. It's not a bad idea, but it's so poorly executed, you'll wish you were playing the old wire-frame x-wing game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Wars Unleashed","review":"Bought it for my 7 Year old. It has a decent learning curve, but he is enjoying the game very much. The controls take a little mastering before you can defeat the bosses. Be sure to go through the training missions first. If you want a game in which you just mash the buttons, this game is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below average rental, for sure.","review":"I don't know how this game has garnered so many positive reviews. It's somewhat fun for an hour or two, but after that the glitches, repetitiveness, and mediocre level design grow too cumbersome for even the Force to save from the bargain bin. Great idea, great marketing, and great franchise, but in the end the game is but a polished turd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Game for the Price","review":"This game was good it is fun to use all the force powers and story is pretty entertaining.

The graphics are dark and gorgeous. My only criticism is that its too short. Also sometimes the 3D models can glitch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Force Unleashed","review":"The game was everything that the original movies should have been, awesome vader, the emperor, lots of storm troopers and wookies dying. and you really got the feeling that you were an awesome sith badass. thats all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game!","review":"I found the game entertaining as well as a great plug-in to the Star Wars storyline. The graphics were on par, controls were smooth, (once you learned which power to use where), and the overall gameplay was great. There were some shortfalls, falling into the deathpits that were randomly set and then later you could jump 30 feet without getting hurt, sometimes I did grab things that I didn't intend to, ect., but overall this was a great game. I'm playing through the second time already and I've only had the game for a short time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gameplay and Story","review":"The gameplay is great fun but the real surprise for me was the story that takes place between the levels. It's like watching a Star Wars movie that takes place between Episodes 3 and 4. There are many familiar characters as well as new ones that are very cool. I give this 5 stars because even if I wasnt a star wars fan this is a great action / adventure game."},{"rating":"2","title":"good game","review":"This is a good game but it is short. The only problem is that it is too short. I had it beat in 6 hours. But it is fun til the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is broken","review":"The game looks great, a Star Wars fan's dream. The story is almost fitting for the Star Wars Universe....BUT you will die alot, I mean alot. This is not for the game being hard...NO it's for the gameplay to be broken. You can tell the developers rushed this one! The glitchy deaths, the uneven platforming and oh and there's a part were the game gives you the wrong instructions! It seems no testing was done during post production. Pass on this one, maybe a rent only if your hard core into Star Wars. You will be mad playing this game. Thumbs way down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another dumb hack and slash game.","review":"I got this game because I read that it was a fun game with a great story. There was pretty much no story and very frustrating game play. A slinky is more entertaining than this failure of a game and a slinky doesn't make you throw the controller through the tv screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding game for any Star Wars fanboy","review":"I almost didn't buy this game, opting to wait for a later discount due to the poor reviews this title is getting. Then I had a weak moment on the way home from work when my Star Wars fanboyism took over. Before I had a chance to recover, I was walking away from a cash register with The Force Unleashed in hand.After playing the first few levels, I'm very glad I bought it. The storyline seems like it will live up to the hype (and this is actually the one positive point on which the negative reviews seem to agree), and I'm still not tired of throwing TIE fighters at people.The one problem I see coming is that the gameplay will likely get fairly repetitive. As long as the storyline stays strong, I can handle that and enjoy the overall experience.This isn't going to compete for best game of the year in any category, but it's a worthy addition to the Star Wars saga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Become a Jedi","review":"A fun game. Only complaints are your character takes forever to recover after being hit and the enemy might be throwing its next attack while you're still getting up and all you can do is watch your health drain. Also, the cut scenes could have been rendered more professionally."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun Star Wars game","review":"This game was fun and the story was good. However, at the end of the game it felt like I was playing the same five levels. Overall I had fun with the game and would recommend it to any Star Wars fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun if you like Absolute Power","review":"This is a fun game if you like to be God. Flinging people around and having massive force powers are impressive but may get redundant after a while. It definitely makes for a good stress release!Amazon gave me an AMAZING deal on this game, bought it used for $10. It works like new. Thanks, Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Really Much Fun","review":"There is not really much I like about this game. Very repetitive hack and slash. The controls are sloppy. The camera angle is mostly hideous. The story is OK. My son who loves watching me play video games will ask me to turn it off after about ten min or so becuase he gets bored watching me do the same things over and over... I would pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!","review":"I got this game and the Force Unleashed Two for my boyfriend's birthday. We are both huge Star Wars fans and he loves to play video games so it was definitely a good buy. I had heard many good things about these games and they definitely did not disappoint! What I liked most was that the storyline seemed to follow and fit right in with the Star Wars movies. He loves them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's craptastic!","review":"I agree with many of the other lackluster reviews, in that this game feels very unpolished, and buggy. The graphics are nice (barring the occasional texture flickering) but thats about it. I highly reccomend borrowing this game or renting it before you buy. I haven't played the demo, but I'm guessing if you've played the demo, you've pretty much played the entire game. Total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Frustrating !!!","review":"I only play a couple of hours a week, and enjoy games such as the Halo series, Gears of War and Mass Effect and this is what I have to say about this game. Cool force powers, good graphics and you get to see characters from the movies thats about it. The story is weak, the game play is repetitive and boring,the camera is horrible, fix the damn camera!!!!. I keep getting jumped from behind, I have to run in circles to see who is attacking me. Fix the damn Camera or add a Radar that makes sense. When you get to fight in enclosed spaces the camera gets so close you cant even see yourself, your attackers or what you are doing and then you end up killed or at the bottom of a cliff. Its really hard for me to undestand how can it take years to develop a game and still miss the basics this game in my opinion is garbage. I was looking forward to the release of this game and even pre-order it, so like the previous reviewer I am pissed !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Wars Money Well Spent!","review":"While some people may say that this game is glitchy, I don't know what they are talking about. This game works perfectly. The levels never get old and it is always fun to push the stormtroopers around. The only thing I will criticize is the difficulty level you chose. I always pick the lowest one because if you try higher difficulty then the people your fighting don't get harder, your health just goes down faster than with the lower difficulty. But still this the most fun of the Star Wars games. I cant wait to throw the stormtroopers around more so I'm cutting this short. I highly recommend this game. You will not be sorry if you buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game!!","review":"The story line is interesting and the action is ridiculous. I'm glad I got it and I really enjoy playing it. I look forward to playing more games like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun game","review":"I enjoyed the game a lot, it arrived on time and in great condition. I'd definately reccomend this game to any SW fans"},{"rating":"2","title":"The game","review":"This games meet all of mind expectations and it is a lot of fun tp play by everyone. I bought the game for my grandson and he just loves the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"falling unleashed","review":"nice scenery, easy enough to beat attacking foes, but extremely hard just to avoid falling into bottomless chasms.Too many slippery surfaces. totally lame and frustrating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you can't figure out camera angle, stop making games...","review":"Oh where to begin.First off, the good. It has a decent storyline. Not bad, not good. Decent. The end.Now for the bad. The camera angle is frustrating. The game tries for these grandiose wide shots where your character is just a wee speck. Many times, you can't even see your character. As you fly around the same couple of levels (they repeat over and over again), if you get too close to anything, you can no longer see your character.Also, the game doesn't have a targeting mechanic. Your moronic apprentice can be getting his bottom handed to him, but he will continue to fire lightning this way and that. The game has a targeting mechanic, but it doesn't work.You have to play through the game once to get the decent skills (or have any skill points put into them).This game is worth about [...]. I wouldn't (and am glad I didn't) pay more than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like \\"Star Wars: force LEASHED.\\"","review":"I have many fond memories of the great star wars titles lucas arts released in the 90s and thought I would give this one a try. As it turns out maybe I should have stayed in that coma for another 10 years. That way I could have not only missed the prequels, but this ill-fated title. This game could be single-handedly ruined by it's poor targeting system, except for the help of other issues that created a multi-faceted ensemble of suck. I love the star wars expanded universe as much as the next guy but jawas that use the force, seriously? It's unclear how to beat the bosses and the game forces you to memorise combos in an unnecessaryly complex fighting system. All in all I paid 10 bucks for the game and it was probably worth it, but it's not worth my time and effort to play to completion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Enjoyable, but unfortunately lacking in replay value.","review":"I have played the entire game through, and I have found that it to be immersing and entertaining, there is just something about using Jedi moves that really doesn't seem to get too repetitious.Unfortunately this gives it little replay value as the plot does not vary on the second time through, so even though the difficulty is challenging on the harder settings, there isn't much of a reason to play through a second time.For the current price it is definitely work the money, but I would not have paid $60 for it brand new."},{"rating":"2","title":"YES","review":"After playing the sequel to this game, I appreciate the awesomeness of this classic all the more(sequel sucks ass.) The boss fights are so epic, it is just ridiculous.. And the add ons are nice especially the one where you can fight Luke's faggot ass. I love destroying Luke Skywalker......Love this game...."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better Star Wars games!","review":"It's pretty sweet game. The achevements are some-what easy to get, the controles are simple to catch on to, you can up-grade your powers, and there a few collectables to find throughout the game too, if your a perfectionist. I've owned this game twice, I first bought it, beat it (in about a week- depending on the difficulty and time you put in) then sold it, after about a month or two I purchased it again because I loved it that much. I have bought and sold many game but this is one I will keep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Plot contrivance since Palpatine Created the Seperatist Movement in the prequels","review":"Palpatine Creates the Rebellion. This is the worst thing George Lucas has ever done to star wars next to creating Jar Jar, or not releasing the original films restored in anamorphic DVD releases.The hack and Slash is fun for about a single play for a few hours then gets boring. Rip Off of god of war just not as good.Starkiller a throw away cardboard character. The emperor's voice over was bad as was darth vaders. The rest of the cast was good to excellent. The graphics of course are stunning as well as the environments.Leia looks hot in this game and Jimmy Smitts voices Bail still not enough to sell a game. Juno Eclipse also was a hottie in this game, still the game deserves zero stars for its plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre @ Best","review":"Pros:Star Wars gamebeautiful graphicsCons:Horrible, non-adjustable camera angles on every levelrepetitive game playClaim of RPG leveling element is rudimentary and basically stolen from previous Star Wars games from Xbox daysMediocre controls, but requires you to finely manipulate your character and objects-- VERY FRUSTRATING!There is a sequence in-game that gives you faulty instructions and would be very lame and repetitive even without bad instructions.The story is lame"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buggy, but great story","review":"it is a great story, with fun (though extremely simple) gameplay. The disk I had froze 2/3rd of the play through. I have spoken to a few people and a lot of them had several bugs directly tied to their disks. Having said that, if you do find a \\"working\\" disk you will enjoy the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"Lame. The word to describe this waste of your time and money. The story is lame, and at times will make you cringe. The game play is lame as you seem to do the same thing over and over and over again. There are far better Star Wars video games. There is no creative aspect to this game. Yes, there are some cool force powers, but KOTOR had that. The story confuses several pre-New Hope story lines, and has nothing to offer other than another example of how Lucasarts cares only for sales."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is to short to be worth 59 bucks!!!!!","review":"This game was good, but it was way to short. I was expecting at least 20 hours of game play, and instead got 8. Best thing to do is rent it out and just play it. Anyone could pass this game in about 8 hours or less. There is no depth once you pass it; that is it nothing special about it. Hope Knights of the old Republic makes a comeback, because that is the only star wars game (besides lego star wars) that was worth any $#@t."},{"rating":"1","title":"fun starwars, but way too little game for a lot of money.","review":"I think this game is a good buy at 29.00. or less, but not $60. The reason is that the game is nothing really detailed or depth to it. It is running around killing anything that moves and moving on to the next mission. Although you can customize the abilities, they do not seem to make that much of a difference. As you go you unlock more abilities that make for more fun ways of killing the opponents, but even then, it is just more of the same. The game is very linear, and not that imaginative for a star wars game. You really just do not feel your a jedi any more than you feel your the god of war, since they both feel much the same, except this one has a light saber, and only half as good.In short, your money is better spent buying God Of War for less than half the price, and get more game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fun. You feel weak the whole time. Bad Platforming.","review":"The platforming elements are not good.You feel like a weakling.The force throw is just about broken.It's just, not fun. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken","review":"i loved the game played it before so i decided to order it.so i did, but when it arrived and i took the disc out to check and see if their was any scratches. what do you know theres a huge scratch on it so i think to myself \\"oh well maybe it will work anyways\\" and when i put it in the xbox it says this disc is unreadable. so i email the guy and he says \\"sorry the game is sold as is\\" but when i bought the game it didnt say \\"SOLD AS IS\\" anywere.so over all i give this duechbag a 0 out of 10 and will never being buying from this seller ever again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as forced as many will tell you","review":"After hearing many negative views toward this game, I decided a rental was clearly due. Upon completing the game, I have to disagree with many of the critics.Simple short review:The games graphics are beautiful, the story is interesting, and the controls are fairly decent. Yes the camera can become troublesome occasionally, and the clunky AI probably don't help (standing not doing anything). Even with somewhat dull AI, it's still fun to hack your way through them. The game is of decent length, but not a long time investment game. The game features a few 'action sequences' and a cool new cast of characters, along with a personal favorite (Vader) A few collectibles scattered through the game may gimmick one to run through the campaign once more, but a rental will do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"Great overall game. Very fun to play and upgrade your character. The story is pretty short providing about 8-10 hours of gameplay, but even if you are used to playing a game only once through you may find yourself going through the story multiple times trying to unlock all the extras like costumes and different sabres.The great feature of allowing you to keep all your force upgrades, costumes, and sabres, even after you complete the game the first time for your future go rounds on harder difficulties is very nice.The inability to skip cutscenes though can make future runs a bit of a long task."},{"rating":"1","title":"sweet but way too short (Rent)","review":"The game play is good. The story is great but the game is way too short. 6 - 10 hours. Rent it.I was in shock that it end so soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfinished","review":"The game has the feel of being half done. The refined parts that take it from being good to being great are not there. You fight with the controls more than you do with the enemies. All the fun elements are there, but without the solidity of something developed all the way through. You'll have many hours of frustration trying to get the character to aim at the right thing. The targeting is weak, the character building is awkward, and the save points land oddly.All in all, a good concept with fun aspects that needed another few months to work the bugs out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly complicated button masher","review":"This game is a pretty typical button masher action game. However, as you progress, you have to think quite a bit about how you wish to spend points to specialize your character. For me, this took away from the button mashing fun as the abilities I gained did not feel different enough to be interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"little fun, cashing in on star wars name","review":"not impressed. no new mechanics, boring. sold immediately after initial disinterest. long for the days of revolutionary KOTOR-style innovation. graphics not astounding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Game","review":"This game played a tug and war between love and hate until finally I gave into the dark side and recognized it for what it is. It's an awful game. If you enjoy strategy and cunning this game is NOT for you. It's only the 2nd game in my 37 years that I destroyed rather than wasting one more second on it. I gave it 2 stars for fun because chucking enemies is great but one star because I hope no one else wastes their time on this. Don't waste your time on this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of the Best Action Star Wars Game","review":"This game has a very good story to it and has awesome game play. There are enough reviews on here already about the game play, so I won't go into it too much on here. I will say that are there was a glich in the game when I was fighting Darth Vader where he actually stayed in one place and I could not cause any damage too him. Other than that I really enjoyed the game. Too bad I waited so long to buy it. I can't wait to play TFU II, which should arrive tomorrow. If you are Star Wars fan then you will be well pleased with this video game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but short","review":"I finished the game today. It took me about five days to complete, and I didn't play a load every day, just a couple of hours a day usually. So yeah, I really liked the game, but it felt short when it ended. Is it worth $60? The graphics are really awesome, the different force powers are really great, and even though the QTE(QuickTime Event) made you feel like you weren't exactly controling the game completly, it still looked great when you killed a major boss. Quicktime events are those moments when you have to mash different buttons to defeat certain bosses throughout the game. (If you were still wondering what QTE was)If you're a fan of the Star Wars series (Movies, Video Game, etc.) than this is a must have. Even though you will find yourself wishing that it was at least a few more hours longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING","review":"I was really looking forward to this game and the demo was good on live but the overall game play is just bad. The story is good but the game play and level up are bad. There's alot of spots where you just get stuck and can't find where to go or how to shut off laser fields. I'm sick of buying strategy guides so my advice is to wait and buy a used copy and get the guide or save your money there are alot of cool games coming out this fall."},{"rating":"1","title":"The force unfocused and kind of all over the place...","review":"Sloppy Sloppy Sloppy Controls and the absolute worst camera ever absolutely kill any fun that could be had with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have been a fan of Lucasarts and Star Wars for more than a decade. The Jedi Knight series was one of the best video game franchises ever created.If you were hoping for a fun, quality game stay away from this.If you are a fan of bland level design, complicated button mashing combos, pathetic story lines, and stupid enemies - get this game.I found that this game only reminded me of far better games, and ultimately made me wish I had never bought it in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed for now","review":"As many have already said, this game is way too short. Unless there's a ton of DLC on the way they should've charged half price. Granted its fun to play but I was through it in 2 nites. And I'm no hardcore gamer.The game should've continued at the end instead of teasing a 3rd istallment. For a game with no online play, its definitely disappointing. The only way to make it better is to introduce online play or give us a bunch of FREE DLC missions."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Force is Strong with this one.","review":"The Force Unleashed was a product that I bought for my son. I have played this game but I haven't spent as much time or been able to engulf myself into this as an adult becuase of time constraint, so with a little help from my son's experience, he loves this game. I had to limit him down to no more than 90 minutes on school nights and 3 hours each day on the weekends. If I haven't he would have learned all the secrets of the darkside of the force and used them against me. Just remember, the force is can influence the younger minded.

Superb musicianship, and a great absurd veiw of life. After all they way we have fashioned the world is absurd. If only a cup of tea could solve all the problems. I must admit the single fillers show why they never were released. Dadaism can only stretch so far.

It's golden, sweet, and a little tangy, and her singing talent makes such good use of it. The song \\"Lo Busque\\" makes this CD worth the price. I heard it on the radio and I had to stop what I was doing and just listen. I wrote it down, bought the CD, and that song has haunted me for days. It's both sad and fun, the way Ana and the musicians banter and giggle through the song and still make you cry."},{"rating":"1","title":"How was this published?","review":"I don't understand how this book/series was published.

The writing can be a big laborious at times but the story has some enjoyable twists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid start to the series","review":"Wow why all the bad reviews? This book was solid and had promise, I'm glad a stayed with the series cause book 2 and 3 were GREAT!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously silly","review":"The story is seriously silly and filled with clinches. It's pretty clear the author didn't plan out the plot or the story, and was making it up sloppily as he went."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that great.","review":"In the hands of a James Rollins or a Matthew Reilly, the story could have been fantastic. In the hands of this author, it's just kind of \\"eh\\". The writing is rather generic and bland, with little feeling behind the action. In fact, it often feels like he's summarizing the action rather than actually showing it! Plus, the female lead character was a totally obnoxious bee-yotch. I hope the sequel is better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Raising Atlantis - Thomas Greanias","review":"Greanias' novel started well for me, but stretched a bit too far by the end of the story. I liked the characters, but found the parentage plot twist (no specifics to avoid spoiling the book!) a bit hard to swallow. The descriptions of the city and Antarctic were great, and I would read another of his novels in the future, in hopes that he doesn't jump off the proverbial cliff with the plot! I gave it 2 out of 5 stars, as it isn't bad, but there are better novels out there with this type of plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beneath Expectations","review":"I don't like to criticize anything too deeply, but I feel if I don't let people know how I feel about this book, some people may make a terrible mistake. I find the myth of Atlantis intriguing. I also love reading most fact or fiction about the Arctic and Antarctic. However, I clearly expected too much out of this novel.The character development is incredibly weak. The sense of setting is okay, if even mediocre. There is no flow to the plot at all. I mean, one minute Conrad Yeats is getting slammed with a ten foot tidal wave, and the next, this tidal wave brings him out of the water onto his feet on a ledge? Suspension of reality is one thing, but this is one example of something completely different! Plus, the ending just doesn't feel right.I'm not encouraged to buy any more of this author's work, unfortunately. I truly believe this could've been much better.If you love high action and adventure in colder climates, try Matt Relly's Ice Station, or James Rollins'Ice Hunt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cussler Wannabe","review":"As a Cussler fan, I was encouraged by his favorable comments of this book, so I plunged in. Having just read one of Cussler's first works, Iceberg, the comparison to this one is absurd. Read one of Cussler's books to see how it should be done. Given this is the author's first work, I will give him a break, since I could never write one. On the other hand, if I had the author's connections and friends, who knows. One dimensional characters, poor writing, etc. are excusable, but getting to the end of a book and going, 'huh?' is the most frustrating. I completely lost the plot and was totally confused by the end. Who were the Atlanteans, what's the deal with the space travel, did the Atlanteans intentionally cause continental drift and why, the connections to Jesus??. It just got confusing and absurd. Add on top, not one likeable or believable character. It was a quick read though. Good to pass time on an airplane. Thank goodness for Dirk Pitt."},{"rating":"1","title":"why!!!","review":"This was purely an amatuer effort with a poor delivery and impossible action. 16 pages from the end I wanted to scream-enough!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you love \\"Atlantis\\" subject matter don't waste your money on this book.","review":"I am always looking for books about \\"Atlantis\\". This onehas been really a let-down. I read the first 100 pages looking for a character that I could connect with. Conrad (hero?) is a whiney, ungrateful man who deserves everything he gets. Serena (heroine?) is an undesireable character who is strident, elitist and so full of herself you wonder why she hasn't been appointed \\"Qeen of the World\\". Oh yeah, she HAS been designated \\"Mother Earth\\".The book has derogatory comments about the military, big business, and Pharmaceuticals and last but not least \\"AMERICA\\". I wished that I had read the author's bio which was a warning for the unnecessary political slant that makes the story-tellingunconvincing and frankly, boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of factual errors","review":"A C-141 Starlifter with propellors?A US Navy battle group sailing 20 miles off the east Antarctic coast in September?

What trash.","review":"This thing is so full of holes they may as well have called it Raising Swiss Cheese. I've also read it before, and much better back in February when it was called Decipher by Stel Pavlou. This book reads like someone read that and decided to rush out a bad copy. Shameless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Remember Chariot of the Gods?","review":"Same nonsense, different wrapping. Have you ever read adventure/science fiction written in purple prose? Well this is it. It is full of factual errors and digraced theories. On the other hand, I did finish the book and it was mildly diverting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put It On Ice","review":"I have to blame my local sport-talk radio station for purchasing Raising Atlantis by Thomas Greanias. It was airing an infomercial on some type of supplement that early morning and - while flipping the dial - came upon an interview with the book's author.But what sounded interesting - and Greanias was talking more about the Atlantis theory with Antartica than the book itself - turned out to be a very weak effort after the discovery of the remains of the lost civilization in the opening pages.There are plenty of one-dimensional characters and a plot that develops on the line of a first-draft for a movie that will have plenty of cash for special effects. And let me stress it reads like a first draft, hardly anywhere near a finished product.Save your money unless you want to read in wonderment how such a book found a publisher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Combination","review":"I finished the new paperback of Raising Atlantis and agree with the reviewer from Jakarta, who has the best-reviewed review of this novel: Raising Atlantis is the perfect combination of the writings of Clive Cussler, James Rollins and Matthew Reilly. You get adventure, military hardware, unexpected plot twists and some romance. It's an exhilarating read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over the top and unoriginal","review":"This book took aspects from every Dan Brown book and meshed them together into one high unbelievable and somewhat silly story. It started out alright, but once I finished I was glad to be able to throw the book on a bookshelf, hopefully never to be read again. 1) The characters weren't well developed, 2) The characters weren't likeable, 3) I felt like Greanias was copying other author's ideas, and 4) The ending was laughable and I felt a bit of embarrassment for the author.I kept wanting the book to end but every time it looked like an ending was in sight, another bad guy would show up. Had the book ended at one of those earlier \\"ending-in-sight\\" points, it would have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"maybe the worst book I ever read","review":"What a disappointment, despite all of the hype. This book supposedly based on certan facts is a mish-mosh of poorly formulated ideas, horribly unarticulated characters and gross distortion of facts. Indeed, I have to believe that the author was drunk when he wrote it. Nothing else can explain this calamity, but even more disturbing, is the fact that a major publisher agreed to issue this disaster. I guess that owes to the fact the dumbing down of America has made book publishers desperate for material. This book is a total waste of money and a disgrace to literacy. Please, give us authors who have a sense of humanity and who know how to delineate their characters and how to construct a storyline. The main character is defined early on as a deconstructionist archaelogist, but he would have to go a long way to exceed the spurious deconstructionist notions of this seriously impaired author. I this is as good as it gets, no one will ever read anything ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Argh, my brain is melting!","review":"Good God someone tell me how this garbage ever got published? Did someone sign some pact with Satan himself? Was the best way to destroy mankind deemed to be a swift and cunnning attack on the minds of anyone unlucky enough to pick up this book? I like mindless action when it makes at least a little sense. I'm not very demanding. I just like novels to contain stories. Is that really too much to ask? And when I read that story I want it to be the author's, not some thinly disguised knock off of someone else's (Cussler's Atlantis Found, Pavlou's Decipher). What's so unreasonable about that? Don't say you weren't warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad","review":"I liked the story and it kept me engaged throughout. It has been done before. I just read a book called Decipher which was similar. However, that is not necessarily a criticism as it is no different than writing murder mysteries. There are only so many ways to kill someone. Here, there are only so many ways to show Atlantis in the Arctic. My biggest complaint is the main character which someone described as whiny (or something like that). I liked the main character but have to admit I didn't love or identify with him as well as some other protagonists.I think he pulled off the ending well, though I can see where some might not be totally satisfied with it. I am easy to please!I really wish Thomas the best and think he has a great writing career ahead of him. I will definitely look for his next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have studied more...","review":"A plot which could have been interesting, if well developed and documented. What annoyed me mostly was the sillines of the errors, which could have been cured with a visit to Wiki or Google.The USS Constellation was never a nuclear propelled ship, and had been retired in 2003, before the book was published.The father of the main character feathers two of the four props of his C-141. Too bad the C-141 is a jet airplane, with no propellers to be feathered.The Black Hawk is so called by the US Army and Air Force, the Navy call it a Sea Hawk or Ocean Hawk.I will not comment on the eco-silliness...Again, a good plot wasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool, Clean, Commercial Fiction","review":"Fun, wildly implausible thriller. The way it should be. Not the Holy Writ of its gushing fans and those RAISING ATLANTIS book clubs popping up at my local Barnes & Noble. Nor the crash-and-burn wreck of its axe-grinding detractors, many of whom seem miffed that RAISING ATLANTIS is a novel and that in reality Atlantis might not be in Antarctica or even exist. It's fiction, people! Four stars. An extra star for proudly declaring itself entertainment and for refusing to play the DA VINCI CODE game of pretending to be fact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Action Thriller - Want to see the movie","review":"Picked it up and couldn't stop reading it: science fiction, action, theology, history, conspiracy, what's not to like. It never slowed down. Can't wait to see his next book. It's about time that the action novel genre has a new star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooorrringgggggg......","review":"I initially thought this would be a really good book. Right up my alley. I heard the author on Coast to Coast with George Noory and since I am interested in this type of subject anyway I figured I'd read a fiction novel. I usually stick to non-fiction.Big mistake. What a waste of reading time. The first half of the book was mostly a big conversation with nothing much happening. I kept reading, hoping it would get better. It got worse. The second half of the book didn't make any sense. The author tries to describe the surroundings but does such a poor job it just ends up confusing the reader. This book was so bad that I didn't even bother to read the last few pages.That's right. I wasted all that time on reading the whole book only to put it down before finishing the last few pages. What does that tell you?Bad book, bad story, poorly written. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"No thanks","review":"I didn't have high hopes for this, and my expectations were met. Take a bunch of two dimensional characters lifted from a stack of other books, a marine and a linguist, put them into a plot lifted from those same other books, Atlantis is in Antarctica, develop a marketing strategy that bald facedly lies about how this book caused problems at the heart of the secret service... Yeah right, like they got the intelligence for Gulf War 2 right that they'd be worried about Antarctica, plus the other books this one apes hardly had an earth-shattering effect on the inner workings of government, it's not like this plot was a secret or anything! And what you get is something aimed squarely at the paranoid who don't give a thought to anything like, oh I don't know - the actual ability to write. A shameful piece of rubbish that went straight in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Pass This One By","review":"The title caught my interest. The first chapter is good. After that it goes down the tubes very quickly. The book is a bore.The story is simply preposterous. The characters are very shallow. The technicalities leave a lot to be desired. The writing is so-so.I should have put this down very early when the Pope became involved in the story; along with an ex-nun. Nothing against His Holiness, but in this story? It's a stretchBeing a first novel, I hope this was part of a learning curve for Mr. Greanias"},{"rating":"1","title":"To Paraphrase Dorothy Parker...","review":"This is not a book to set aside lightly. It should be thrown with great force. Having left this book in the bathroom, I occasionally re-open it and read a few more pages. It's like that morbid fascination with a car wreck as you drive by. \\"Oh it couldn't be _that_ bad!\\" Well...yes it could. Dei ex machinae appear in every chapter. Improbable villains spout dialog so purple as to be unbelievable. A hot and sexy nun (presented as \\"Mother Earth\\" forsooth!) have meetings with the pope and fight off bodice-ripping Arabic storm troops in the icy tunnels of Antarctic Atlantis while remaining virgins. And on it goes. And on. And, yet...the book remains very popular.<sigh> Could it represent the \\"Springtime for Hitler\\" phenomenon? So bad it's good? I suggest you read a few chapters in the bookstore before investing any hard-earned dollars in its purchase. God!

I can suspend disbelief as well as anyone when it comes to a good story, but this one just had too many convenient and fortunate coincidences. Reminds me of a story told by a twelve-year old who makes it up as she goes along. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absurd But Absorbing Adventure","review":"I found far too many tangents and rabbit holes in the middle of this absurd first novel, and it is obviously a first novel, but almost all of the trails were absorbing. The premise itself of ancient ruins in Antarctica is what initially grabbed my attention and the genius ending guarantees I'll read the sequel, which from the hints set up in this first effort looks to be less absurd and far superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time and Money","review":"Raising Atlantis was the worst book I've read in a long time. The first half had some interesting ideas, but then things got ridiculous. I enjoy reading action adventure novels by authors like Clive Clusser and James Rollins but Raising Atlantis was a complete waste of time and money and I won't be reading anything by Thomas Greanias again."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 Bad flicks","review":"All 4 of these movies are pretty bad.

Amid the humorous anecdotes, one detects a feeling of sadness that dwells within the author, who by the way, is one of the city's most competent and respected journalists. This self-published volume represents years of dedication and hard work,and the commercial success of the volume stands as testament to that fact."},{"rating":"1","title":"almost unreadable","review":"This book is almost unreadable. I remember Mr. Hanania's work in the Southtown Economist and the Chicago Sun-Times; he apparently had some very good editors. The stories are, at times, interesting, as when he talks about his childhood; most of the time, however, they are pretty annoying. The book suffers mostly from a serious lack of proofreading; also, most of the stories could benefit from a decent editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware: This book has errors","review":"I haven't used this book much so I can't speak for it's overall quality. I would like to point out a significant error in the text which calls that quality into question. On page 363 it is stated that \\"A custom suppied constructor does not allocate memory\\" which is false. It also goes on to give an example which uses a constructor just for initializing an already existing object. An ordinary procedure would sufficed for this. In other words the author missed the point of the constructor keyword: it allows for custom methods which both create and initialize objects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a different book.","review":"This Book, while covering a lot of ground only touches on each subject.

The antenna comes with a 120VAC power supply but I needed to operate the antenna on 12VDC. The RV-7542 worked perfectly. At one particular location that I camp at regularly, I am lucky to receive one station and have to mess with the rabbit ears on my television to get a watchable picture, sometimes without success.

What a fantastic introduction to the wild and crazy world. I loved the language, the strategy that every chapter ends with the need to crack into the next one. I didn't know much about the borgia family before reading this portrayl but i must say i was just as hot for Ceseare as our main character. Then there was his betrayl. And i hated him and felt the betrayl. I gave it to my sister as soon as i finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great historical fiction.","review":"Having recently read other novels set in Italy by Marina Fiorato, I was leary about how Kalogridis' The Borgia Bride would compare with the excitement and suspense of Fiorato's writings. I loved The Borgia Bride. The strength and poise of the heroine, Sancha, is inspiring. For every evil sent in her direction, she has a thoughtful yet intense reaction/action. I loved the visual descriptions of Naples, Rome and Sicily. Exciting and intriguing from beginning to end. A must-read for anyone inspired by and in love with Italy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing!","review":"I've loved every book published by this author. She spins tales in such a way that you become totally absorbed in the story. If you like historical novels that feature an intelligent, passionate heroine - this book is a MUST READ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to put down....","review":"This was my first foray into the author, Jeanne Kalogridis, and I have to say that I really enjoyed this book. Sancha of Aragon was a sympathetic character, someone you could really admire for her strength, especially when dealing with the Borgia family. Cesare Borgia was most evil, but at the same time, fun to hate. I even came to realize that there was some goodness in Lucrezia Borgia, which I haven't read much of. If you like drama, corruption, murder and don't mind a little incest, then I definitely recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kalogridis on top of her game again","review":"The Borgias were probably one of the most dysfunctional and fascinating families in history. Ms. Kalogridis, most famous for her family Dracul trilogy, does a masterful job describing the era and bringing the characters to life. Pope Alexander and his children were formidable forces - Cesare to me is the most sensual villians in history - and The Borgia Bride portrays each character with the spark each deserves. A definite must read not only for Kalogridis fans, but history fans, and those who crave well written works - Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"I read this book because I wanted to find out more about the Borgias because of their popularity right now with the HBO series. It was very instructing with a good story line and even though this book is fiction now I have a better understanding of the Borgias. I would recommend this book to any one who wants read about deception in the 1400's Europe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twisted, captivating & fascinating!","review":"Truly one of the most interesting & twisted historical novels I have ever read!

Can't wait to read more from this author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"Sorry folks. This is one of the worst books I've ever read. The only interesting thing about it is the dreadful editing of the Kindle edition. How I long for a red marker!! Sancha is wooden and unsympathetic. Unsympathetic would be acceptable if she were only interesting but she's not. This era is a facsinating period of history but you won't get that from this book. It's just dull, dull, dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Having recently read The Other Boleyn Girl by Philippa Gregory and The Birth of Venus by by Sarah Dunant, I was very much disappointed in this novel by Jeanne Kalogridis. It does not match the complexity of plot, character or style found in the other two works of historical fiction about women; its badly written, graphic love scenes diminish it even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A VERY ENTERTAINING READ!!!","review":"I just finished \\"The Borgia Bride\\" in less than 2 days because I absolutely couldn't put it down. This book is a fast paced story that captures you from the very beginning. This book is NOT for the faint of heart. I had a hard time getting through some of the incestous parts but, it adds to the plot of the story by showing you just how sinister the Borgia family really is. If you're looking for a book that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very last page then, this is the book for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Borgia Bride","review":"Sancha of Aragon is a dark Neapolitan beauty. She is fiery and passionate, yearning to be accepted and loved by her indifferent father, but never admitting it. The person she loves the most is her younger brother, Alfonso. They are both [illegitimate], born of noble birth and sharing the same mother. She is betrothed to a wealthy count and loves him. The betrothal is broken off so that Naples may strengthen ties to Rome and the Pope. Unfortunately for the ravishing Sancha, she, at 16 years of age, is married off to the Pope's least gifted [misborn], the 11 year old Jofre.Summoned to Rome, Sancha must fend off a lusty father-in-law, try to make friends with the Roman society leaders and survive the Borgia rule.This book is a great read, which I thoroughly enjoyed and read constantly. Sancha is a fearless heroine that you will know and love - but you have to read the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Borgia Bride","review":"After having viewed the movie \\"The Borgias\\", I was interested in the title of the book, \\"The Borgia Bride\\".

It is the valiant struggle of a handful of honorable, brave men who would not be beaten by force or politics or bribery; men who valued their allegiance to America and the good of its common people....\\"From \\"Starlight Pass\\" by Tom Gill, copyright 1935, Center Books, New York."},{"rating":"1","title":"He to H Who - waa??","review":"Alright, something to do with helium. Maybe Peter Hammill was sniffing it when he sang this stuff. I find he's way over the top, chewing the scenery on every song. He ranks with Richard Harris for over-acting. The songs themselves are pretty boring, not much going on. Would be a total waste if not for Fripp's short guitar solo on one song. I listened to this a few times and sold it on eBay. This is not the great missing piece of the progressive rock puzzle. Too melodramatic. There's not much instrumentally, just hammond organ everywhere, like wallpaper, and some adequate woodwinds. Not much in the way of arrangements either. The songs are too long considering their simplicity. Put in some electric guitar - it's all Hammill's acoustic other than Fripp - and maybe this would do more than make you want to shut your eyes - impossible to sleep though due to Hamill's constant emoting. However, if you are depressed or enjoy being depressed, this may be the album for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY GOOD BUT NOT AN IMPROVEMENT","review":"This is a very good Greek grammar, but it is not better than the second edition. The second edition is visually laid out better. The second edition noun and verb chart layouts at the end of the book are visually easier to read.The third edtion should have followed the second edition layout and outline more closely.The practise exercises and examples are excellent in the third edition.The vocabulary layout in the back of the third edition is better than the second edition.I would say that the third edition may need the help of a teacher more than the second edition.I learned from the second edition and may be prejudiced.Conclusion: The new third edition is better than any other grammar I have read but it is not better than the second edition. They are both excellent.Combine the best features of both editions and you would have a five star book.(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent introduction to MATLAB!!!","review":"I was first introduced to Matlab as part of a junior level signal processing course. Without any kind of introductory manual on using Matlab, I struggled through the course believing that it was a pain to use. Recently, needing to use Matlab again, I found Knight's book in my school library. It made a huge difference. After just a few hours with the book I felt like a Matlab wiz. This book covers the basics concisely, using plenty of examples, and also shows how easy it is to use more advanced features like graphical user interfaces. It also provides instruction for dowloading a library of useful m-files and demos. It is not a comprehensive reference but I couldn't recommend it more highly to a person who needs to learn to use Matlab or feels uncomfortable using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for ingesting","review":"I ordered this product to find out that it's for consumption, not cosmetic.

This book provides nice prohibition era photos and other such pictures, but the information is purely faulty. First off, when they were talking about Capone, they were totally off. Capone had a stand-in son who he took out in public, he never killed \\"thousands of people\\", and the St. Valentine's day massacre was headed by Jack McGurn, (not Jake), and involved 4 men (not 5). The rest of the magazine was the same. Also, i sensed a very biased few, they worshipped Eliot Ness and called Capone basically a brute.

Fusiony stuff generally takes itself too seriously and without any fun going on even on the periphery it kinda wrecks my tea. It's very good stuff mostly, but they sound a little lashed to the task--just an opinion--don't curse my dead Mother. For a few of these cuts (Holdsworth) I thought I was hearing a Mahavishnu disc and ultimately, you know how much fun those guys had. So even though there were POT-HEADS present they were way cleaned up and ultimately, you know how much fun that can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gong - 'Gazeuse' (Caroline) 2 1/2 stars","review":"First off, this is NOT the Gong that many of us have come to know for the cosmic ensemble that have been at it since about 1970. 'Gazeuse' was originally released in 1976, as it features seven players. But the only two members I recognized right off were Didier Malherbe - sax&flute and Pierre Moerlen (R.I.P.) - drums & vibraphone. The other five, as far as I'm concerned are merely stand-ins. They SHOULD have come up with another name for this project, like Gong Revisted or Sons Of Gong (I know...stupid!). Unless you're an extremely open-minded Gong fan who can really open up to some decently played jazz, then you MIGHT enjoy this CD more than I did. A couple of tunes that I thought were well played are \\"Expresso\\", \\"Night Illusion\\" and \\"Shadows Of\\". See how you like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Gong you think...","review":"For those who think that Gong is defined by their wonderful and psychedelic Planet Gong trilogy, \\"Gazeuse\\" will prove a massive disappointment. Coming after the departure of Daevid Allen, Steve Hillage, and others of the core lineup, the bulk of this album is made up of snore-o-delic jazz fusion with little spark, primarily featuring competent but somewhat uninspired guitar work by Allan Holdsworth and the ever-present remaining percussionist Pierre Moerlin. Moerlin, it should be noted, turns in the saving grace of this album, the percussion workout 'Percolations'. But the lame jazz-fusion that makes up the bulk of this offering is little consolation. Your money for Gong could be better-spent elsewhere..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gong 2.0","review":"As everyone here has said, this is Gong without its founders Allen or Smyth, or it's lead guitarist Hillage - or any of the Pot-head Pixie stuff. Yet its not bad for what it is; mid 70's easy-listening Fusion/Jazz/Prog-Rock. In fact it is better than a lot of music, it just isn't much like earlier Gong.(For what Hillage was doing during this time check outLive In Germany 1977, or for AllenFloating Anarchy Live 1977orNow Is Happiest Time of Your Life, both much more like earlier Gong.)I actually like Moerlen's drumming and Holdsworths guitar - sounding a lot like a cross between early Caravan and Mike Oldfield, with bits of early 70's era Zappa and Mahavishnu Orchestra thrown in. In fact it is surprisingly similar to more recent recordings by American fusionists like Jimmie Herring and Derek Trucks Band. While not terribly original its not a bad legacy to be associated with. If any of these artists appeal to you, you'll probably enjoy this incarnation of Gong."},{"rating":"2","title":"gong is back and stranger than ever","review":"Man, I can't believe how COOL this album is. While it's much different from the You album (the other Gong album I bought last year) I'm very satisfied with the atmosphere- it goes from blazing heavy one moment (\\"Shadows Of\\") to delicate (\\"Percolations\\"). I can't say I've ever heard anything like this before.Instrumental playing that's atmospheric, beautiful and captures a special feeling deep inside of me I can't explain. It's why I love rock music- diversity can be incredible sometimes, such as the case with Gazeuse! It's almost like floating through outerspace at times, the way the beauty of the music and atmosphere seems to put images in my head of faraway places I'd like to explore."},{"rating":"2","title":"EDDIE MURPHY IS FUNNY!!","review":"I GOT TWO WORDS FUNNY AND CRAZY!

High on the list is Trading Places, and with good cause. A superb comic cast and (for the most part) original and mature jokes and gags make it among the most popular comedies ever made. The story itself is a classic - a \\"scientific experiment\\" pitting heredity vs. environment in which a wealthy executive and a petty criminal are made to live each others' lives. Sort of a comedic modern-day The Prince and The Pauper that pokes some much-deserved fun at the upper-upper class, racial stereotypes and the money-driven white collar mindset that characterized the 80s. The writing is very clever and the performances are flawless. If you're among the select few who have never seen this movie, I guarantee that once you do you'll wonder why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking good louis.

There are so many films that are really good and would be OK for family viewing but they put in just a little bit of sex or nudity that ruin it.

So many of the lines are classic and it's such fun to see the short apparences by many favorites such as Jim Belushi & Franken & Davis. Jamie Lee Curtis is outstanding, and Aykroyd & Murphy are at their best. We also loved the subtle connection to this movie seen in Murphy's \\"Coming to America\\". We've often thought they should make a sequel, but then there is no point, this movie is untouchable. We really look forward to the release of this movie on DVD.

Initially, for the first fifty pages or so, I was fearful that I had selected a book only about the art of boxing. It isn't this at all. It's the story of friendship, loyalty, love, dishonesty, greed, and most of all folks with dreams shattered and fulfilled. The characters are real. This reader could empathize with Dan's losses and subsequent depression and rejoice when he begins to live again. As a female, I am not an avid fan of any sport, but enjoyed this novel immensely.

Baseball lore and lyric is always an interesting personal deversion, particulairly on a cold winter's night. But I follow and enjoy Baseball as a sport. Boxing, as seen on TV on the other hand, is an undertaking which has taken a barbaric back- seat....too ruthless, savage and lacking star power. However, when written about well and with an insiders' viewpoint, Boxing jumps off the page and into my heart. Ponud For Pound carries a great deal of pathos, and some really cool jargon....makes me feel like I had a stogie and a fedora and a rolled up program in my hand.

My soda with laundry booster actually cleans better, but this one passed the cleaning and smell test with me.I bought the all purpose cleaner as well, wish I hadn't. It did not clean any surface (beyond dust) that I used it on, and the smell was nasty. They would have done well to leave the scent at the lavender and orange which are a good combination, but they had to add some \\"fragrance\\" in there that turned it some kind of awful!That's my take on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY STRONG PERFUMEY LAVENDER SMELL","review":"I ordered this because I really like lavender. I have many other lavender cleaners, oil, candles, etc. However, this product IS NOT LAVENDER. When I checked the ingredients, fragrance was listed before lavender oil. I could smell the product even before opening the package (it came in a box). When I did open the box, WOW. The smell was very overpowering. Well, I decided to give it a try anyway. But, sorry to say, when I took it into the bathroom, I couldn't imagine opening the container in such a small area. I guess others like this smell. But, for those who enjoy a natural lavender smell, do not buy this. That being said, I suffer migraines and cannot tolerate many odors that most people do not have a problem with. So, maybe for most this odor will not be a problem.

I wondered if it would clean as effectively as some of the stronger chemical scrubs. Much to my delight, the scrub was exceptional and actually removed several stains on my countertop that Clorox Cleanup wouldn't budge. I'm not overly sensitive to smells, but I think that this scrub has just the right amount of scent, and I wouldn't characterize it as strong at all. It's a product that really works and leaves a very light, clean scent."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so green","review":"I always thought these products looked the part of clean and natural, until they showed up in my house.They are very fragrance heavy, and being a person slightly sensitive to fragrance I started to notice it would make me a bit flushed and headachy. The countertop cleaner really bothered me most of all, because it would be on my food eating and prepping surfaces.The more I was around it the more it bothered me. I would even say it was overwhelming on my table while I ate and the fragrance got into the food when I used it on my butcher block.My wife also got the hand soap and having just used it I found that it too caused me some flushed feeling. So I decided I should share my experience. I have never written a product review before, but I've decided I find the claim of natural and \\"green\\" to be a bit misleading.

The band covers Ten of their original songs including the hit single \\"Jackie Blue\\". As I mentioned, some of the songs are a slightly slower tempo than the originals, but this does not detract from the quality of the singing and playing of the band.

When asked about the holocaust, he said it was extremely hard for him to deal with that subject, being sensitive to the victim's surviving relatives. And yet when a woman asks about his opinion of rape, he has no problem callously trivializing THIS issue at all! Well, according to Neale, it used to be legal to rape your wife a long time ago, so since society's idea of morality changes all the time, it's all relative, who's to say it's right or wrong? WOW!I think the one thing that one can do that goes against the harmony of Love and God is to abuse another human being, especially when it violates their free will.

Reception was fine with Treo 650 however I couldn't hear the caller. Perhaps the headset did not fit my ear well or this unit was malfunctioning but it was worthless.

Much more expensive but works well (see my other review)"},{"rating":"1","title":"stand down","review":"The fit and the sound are good, but, this headset does not remain in standby mode after five minutes of inactivity. The user guide says the indicator light goes out to conserve power but that the headset remains in standby mode. But I've found that after the light goes out, I've got to turn on the headset again to make a or receive a call, holding the multifunction button. That's inconvenient if I'm driving and not wearing the heaset when receiving a call. In standby mode, the unit should automatically connect when I make a call or ring and just require a tap on button to receive a call. Amazon was quick to replace the headset at no shipping or return cost to me, but the replacement has the same problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really dissapointed","review":"I bought this thinking I could use it in the car while driving. First of all, since the microphone is attached to your ear, other people hear all sorts of noise besides your voice; Second, I can't seem to pick up incoming calls and seem to have to answer it with my cell phone which is what I wanted to avoid; Third, can't tell when it's running out of juice since there is no indicator; and lastly, it disconnects from the cell when it feels like it. I would wait for technology to get better before buying this kind of thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great when it works..","review":"The single most frequent problem I have with this headset is that it constantly loses connection with my RAZR phone. I've used two different RAZRs with it and both of them have the same problem. I've paired it and re-paired it multiple times but always with the same problem.

Does not fit very well in the ear and thus, even at max volume, one has trouble listening to the other person if they do anything other than talk loudly and clearly into the phone. Although it seems to do a good job ignoring ambient noise, it does the same thing with your voice. One must speak at a very loud volume for the people on the other end of the line to hear you clearly, thus making it useless anywhere other than your own home, car, or desserted ally."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Problems","review":"Everything arrived in a timely fashion and works well.

When fully charged it can last all day, which is very useful as I use it for receiving and making Skype calls. There does seem to be noise on the connection, when used with my TRENDnet Bluetooth USB Adapter, but I suspect this is the adapter and not the headset, because I don't get the same noise when I use it with my Blackberry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I got the bad one from the batch","review":"The device looks sleek and is rather small which is good for wearing over long periods of time. However, its grip over the ear is rather flimsy and sudden head movements leave the device flapping. I would really have loved to keep the device but had to return mine because people had problems hearing me when I used it. From what I gathered, I sounded like I was talking through a tin can. However, I could hear callers quite clearly. I tried everything I could using the buttons available to see if this could resolve the issue to no avail. I initially thought the problem could be that I was using the H500 with my LGCU500 phone and somehow, they were not optimized to work with each other. However, I tested the headset with a friend's Motorola V551 phone and had the same results. Other people I have talked to who own an H500 haven't experienced these issues so it could very well be that I got the bad one which somehow made it past the quality checks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect fit to ear and sounds great","review":"I was very uneasy about buying this headset but the reviews were great for it which convinced me to purchase it. I am very glad that I did. I use it with a Blackberry 8800 and people that I have told that I am using this headset have all said that it sounds better then when I just use the BB to speak. I can hear people on the headset even with my windows down in my truck and on the highway. Now of course if the wind is really strong I can't hear that well but that is with any phone.If I needed two or three I would choose this headset again especially for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but there must be something better!","review":"I've been using the Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset for a couple of frustrating years. It sometimes turns itself on or off (usually when I need the opposite - I can be in the middle of a conversation & BAM - GONE!). Also, the volume control works, but not the greatest - the way the headset hangs over my ear makes it difficult to hear if there's any noise around me; if I turn my head too quickly, the headset will fall off . I can switch ears, but not as easily as other units. Lastly, I don't know if it's a phone issue or a headset issue, but when I've tried to turn off the headset & use the phone's speaker while on a call, it won't work - can't get the headset to turn off w/o losing the call. Even then, if the headset is in the vicinity, the headset acts possessed! I'm researching for a different one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Garbage!!","review":"Short and sweet - don't waste your precious money on this.

My first H500 had to be replaced because the ear hook mounting to the actual device broke. Now my replacement has suffered the same consequence. I'm very frustrated at this point because I really don't want to send it back to Motorola for another replacement. Very poor plastic engineering in my opinion. Otherwise it works fine. In medium noise environments the speaker can be hard to hear. I wish I could push the volume up to '11'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor RAZR Compatibility","review":"I purchased this headset to go with my Black RAZR phone as I was told 'it' was the headset specifically designed to work with the RAZR software.Unfortunately, it doesn't keep a reliable link to the phone and frequently drops the connection. Motorola claims there's not a problem yet, actual testing proves different. They went to market without testing this H500 thoroughly with the RAZR.It became so annoying that I stopped using it. This is clearly a software or hardware problem with the RAZR and/or H500.Oh, by the way, I actually had my RAZR swapped-out because I mistakenly thought it was the phone. Oh, and I even had the H500 swapped-out. In short, two different phones (RAZR) and two different headsets (H500). You can't use them together.Buy a different headset and test it before leaving the store.If you're wondering what I do for a living, I'm an engineer...I tested this for 3 weeks and you can't reliably use the H500 with a RAZR.Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I have just received a empty box","review":"I don't know why it's just a empty box delivered to me.

The volume controls on the headset aren't sensitive enough for easy volume changes. And you have to push the connect/disconnect button pretty hard to activate.

That in turn makes the cellphone misbehave: it dials last-number very easily; and you can't hear any calls, incomming or outgoing; even though the phone rings and you can dial out.2. Noise canellation does not work. Nearly useless as a hands-free device in a automobile environment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too bad","review":"Okay, I'll admit it: I have larger than normal ears. Perhaps that's why the earpiece works pretty well for me. I can wear it for long periods without any discomfort, even though I also wear glasses.The sound quality for the user is also excellent. I can hear the person on the other line perfectly. It's really quite impressive. However, I will say that the person on the other end isn't particularly loud. Generally, I can hear the other person without any trouble while driving at around 70 mph in my Acura RSX, but it's a little faint with some people. I think this is the main deficiency of the device -- the sound could be louder.On the other hand, it's very lightweight, has an amazing battery life, has a low price, and it pairs with my Nokia 6600 without any problem.

The second was to my father, who, lacking any experience with Star Trek, said I sounded \\"like a stupid robot\\".That's bad enough, but when you combound it with the high-pitched whiny buzz that the reciever hears in the background, you don't have a headset so much as an incredibly efficient friend-alienation gadget.I for one will be sticking with my crappy old wired headset, which may be a bit more obtrusive, but doesn't irritate everyone I call."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted money!!!","review":"I don't get it...a friend of mine has one so I got it thinking it worked well.

The sound quality received was very good.Con: At least four different people I called said that they couldn't hear me and I had to repeat myself or speak louder than normal.In the end, I returned the headset and I am now looking at the reviews to find a better one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for RAZR V3 owners","review":"Either H500 owners who've had bad experiences are just more prone to write reviews or Motorola has a quality control problem on the headset line. My H500 seems to work just fine. The sound quality is good on both ends of the conversation. It's small, it's light, AND it charges with the same mini-usb charger my RAZR V3 takes - a real advantage, as I only need to carry one charger when I travel. I really can't find anything wrong with this headset. That said, you should be overjoyed if your biggest problem this year is a faulty H500."},{"rating":"2","title":"great headset, very impressed - H500","review":"This is my first BT headset, after I got my Sony z525 BT phone, I want a BT headset to work with it, first I was skeptical how this little headset can do ? Then I decide to give it a try, here is my feedback !1. Sound quality on both end is excellent, I use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me !2. I did have issue try voice dialing using headset (no problem voice dialing by phone) in the first couple days and I explore the internet and saw many other reviews voice dialing not working with their Sony cell phone, amazingly, after many days hard work, finally I got voice dialing working on my Sony phone! Because sony cell phone voice recognition software is very picky, you need to be patient and make sure you wear headset to record voice command if you plan to use headset to vioce dial ! (If you have some issue like me, hope this will help ! )"},{"rating":"1","title":"Comfortable, easy to use, but horribly limited range","review":"The headset is very comfortable and has a decent battery life. Getting it to work with my phone was easy and straight-forward. Putting the headset to use was impossible. I would have to hold the phone close to my headset to get it to work. The headset would lose connection or the signal would become very weak if I had kept the phone in my pants pocket.It really can't be considered \\"hands free\\" if I have to hold the phone next to the headset, right? I might as well be holding it to my ear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constant Buzz Annoying","review":"I bought this for my husband and we have found out that while this bluetooth sounds fine on the wearer's end of the phone conversation, those on the other end of the conversation are hampered by a SIGNIFICANT \\"Buzz\\". It makes conversation difficult because of the constant distracting and annoying buzzing everytime it is in use. Disappointed in this product.Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset (Nickel)"},{"rating":"2","title":"My review of the ear piece I bought for my boyfriend","review":"The unit works all right. My boyfriend hasn't used it much yet. The charging cord was very short. I thought it'd be longer. Overall, I am pleased with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hands Free Head set","review":"This product seems to flop around a lot when in use. It seems hard to use also, unless i just don't know the magic secret of it's use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Headset - Exactly what you want.","review":"Great headset. Does exactly what I want. I link it to my computer, I get audio on that and have hands free microphone. I connect it to my phone, it works as a headset there. Lightweight, sounds good, has great battery endurance. Not overly expensive. Not huge like an Xbox. Overall great product. Will buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that great","review":"It never can seem to find the phone. It will work fine one day, and then the next, you can't answer with it, and it doesn't ring. And that's if it even works at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works nice, looks great","review":"The headset works nice, sound quality is good. and I like its features for its size. The only cons - battery life. It runs out in about 3-4 hours for me, hence I only use when I receive a call. Works great with Skype on my laptop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Echo, echo, echo....","review":"When I got this, the people I talked to said that my voice kept echoing. The only way to stop the echo was to turn down the volume until I could barely hear the other person! I returned this promptly and got the Jabra BT-500 when I got my new cell phone and I am very happy with the Jabra."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Person to buy from - not good for Iphone","review":"It was easy to connect to my Iphone but the quality and ability to hear well or for the other party to hear well was disappointing. I think its the I phone not the ear piece but to me bluetooth connection should be ok even with an Iphone"},{"rating":"1","title":"No clarity with Samsung m300","review":"Nice design, easy to use. However, unless I was holding the phone by my head within 1 foot of the headset, the sound was terrible, and all broken up, which was pretty useless. I had to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was very disappointed.","review":"I was very excited to have the hands free, but people keep complaining that they can't hear/understand me. It is very frustrating. It feels loose on my ear like it might come off, but it doesn't. I guess I got too excited reading the rave reviews saying how crystal clear the sound was. The hands free in my car is better. It just didn't back up the hype.Otherwise, it works, it is pretty easy to use & very easy to set up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the trouble","review":"I was very happy with the appearance and size of the headset - but very unhappy with the performance. When using it, it never feels like it is secure. It just hangs off the ear, and everytime I'd turn my head to the side or bend down to pick something up, I felt like it would fall off. The sound quality was just okay on my end of the phone (I have a Verizon LG VX8600). But everyone I called said that they heard their voices echo and the sound was muffled. In fact, one of my friends refused to even speak to me when I was using it - the sound was that bad on his end. Several times I had to turn it off in the middle of business calls because they couldn't make out what I was saying. It ended up to be pretty useless. I exchanged it for a Plantronics Voyager 510 - it is a little bigger but I've been told that the sound quality is 100% better on their end and it's also better on my end.Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset with Multipoint Technology [Retail Packaged]"},{"rating":"1","title":"regretfully returned","review":"I purchased this bluetooth headset after researching numerous options. When I opened the package, I was very pleased with the quality, size and overall appereance of this headset. When I tried it on, I was very disapointed. It just hung off my ear, not even touching my cheek. What an awful feeling. It was such a let down. I tried to see if I could adjust it in any way so it would feel semi-secure, no luck. I returned it without even setting it up with my phone. I wish it had a bendable earpiece or something. I wanted it to work very much but the poor design fit was unworkable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad buy for Bluetooth headset","review":"I have a Blackberry T7105 - and i bought the Motorola H500 to use for work. It worked for maybe a week. The flimsey headset had poor signaling, horrible audio feed and often would drop calls on full charge. The next week, the earpiece literally fell apart.It was a waste of $40.00"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not loud enough - low talk time.","review":"I purchased this headset because it uses the same mini-usb charger that is used with my Razr phone. Unfortunately, the speaker volume on the H500 leaves something to be desired. Also, the talk time for a single charge is closer to 2 hours than 8 hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok for the price","review":"I bought this headset a couple of months ago, but I guess I was disappointed. It doesn't really stay on your ear, people on the other end have a hard time hearing you, and most of the time you can't hear them because the volume doesn't get loud enough. I would definitely go for the newer motorola model since I hear they are better. This one is OK only due to its low price, but it's worth it to spend a little extra money and get one you're actually going to use! I barely use mine anymore so I guess it was a waste of money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Malfunctioned within a few days","review":"On the second or third usage, I got static noise after 15-20 seconds into the call. This happened several times and also had problems pairing with my phone. I returned the product for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"It was a reasonable price, but the noise quality was not good. I heard a bunch of static expecially when it was windy.The ear clap was not tight enough. It always felt like it was going to fall off. I had to push the ear piece closer to my ear to hear people speak. People said I sound cloudy or far away. So I just send it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died in less than 2 months","review":"Total piece of junk. It died in less than 2 months. I hardly used it.

He thought it was fine but, when people called him they could hear an annoying buzzing in the background. He couldn't hear the noise but others could barely hear him or understand what he was saying. I called Motorola support and they tried to trouble shoot but it still didn't work. They offered to replace it but apparently they didn't have that model (don't know if it's now discontinued). They replaced it with a different model without telling me it would be refurbished. They new model was sent without a power cord for the charger. After another phone call I was sent the cord, now I have to send back the originial within 30 days or my credit card will be charged $60. It seems like alot of work for a bluetooth but for now he seems happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Harbour Can't Be Trusted!!","review":"I ordered this product from Blue Harbour and asked if they shipped to Post Office Boxs. They assured me that they did. The idiots shipped by Fedex and I never received the order as it was returned to them by Fedex. To add insult to injury Blue Harbour charged me over $20.00 for the order being returned to them.So I ended up not receiving my order of two(2) head pieces but also being charged for one,plus the shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy and Imcomplete...","review":"These books vary in quality, but none is especially strong. The biggest problem is that the books don't cover the exam objectives completely. If you use these books as a primary resource in your studies, you will have some nasty surprises when you take the real test. The enclosed CD is terrible--the exam questions don't even vaguely resemble the questions on an actual Microsoft exam.I would strongly suggest that people pursuing MCSE certification buy individual titles from different publishers rather than purchasing a box set. Sybex books are generally good, many of the Test Prep books are strong as well. The quality, however, varies by title, so do a little research to avoid getting burned.The customer reviews here are generally reliable. If a book has a substantial number of overwhelmingly negative reviews, it should be avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst book ever!","review":"This book made me fail the exam....I had to buy another book in order topass my exams the second time. the problem is that is not accurate in the information it provides.
