I couldn't find many reviews but those that i did were positive. I ended up buying it and am glad i did.This thing hits hard! It has a lot of control over the amount of bass and I actually find myself turning it down because it can become overwhelmingly loud and rattle the car.

It is a great value and is easy to install with the built in amplifier."},{"rating":"1","title":"800-Watts.

The conditions under which she was imprisoned were horrific but her descriptions are not emotionally charged or full of hyperbole. A remarkable feature of her story, to me, is how she found islands of humanity in these man-made hells, and how she and her fellow prisoners found ways to survive against enormous odds. It is also a testament to Buber-Neumann's strength of character that she could sometimes see and enjoy, even in the camps, the few glimpses of the natural world that were allowed. Lastly, the story of the Jehovah's Witnesses, and their conduct in Ravensbruck is a lesson in the value of deep beliefs, in this instance, religious beliefs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A profoundly humane memoir","review":"Margarete Buber-Neumann (the daughter-in-law of Martin Buber) was a young German Communist in the 1920s who was active in her union of department-store clerks. When the Nazis came to power, she fled to Moscow -- where Stalin's regime condemned her as a spy and sent her to a gulag. When Hitler and Stalin entered into their Non-Aggression Pact in 1939, the Soviets handed her over to the Gestapo, and she was sent to the Ravensbrueck concentration camp. Miraculously, she survived. This poignant memoir describes the author's journey through the different camps and populations of inmates, with an abundance of memorable characters and moving stories along the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"best price for a quality water filter","review":"paid $16 for this 200 gallon filter, so this is a great deal.

Sure Culligan Faucet Filter got many good reviews, but it fell short of all expectations in my case. The filter worked decently the first week (though the water was never really clean); the little knob on the side soon got stuck, preventing the water from switching back to normal mode in just a few days. On top of that, the water pressure was never very fast to begin with, but after just a week, the water seems to be even slower than normal, and is pretty much \\"leaking\\" out from the faucet rather than pouring out. I tried everything I could with twisting/moving the filter inside around, but no help. So much for the filter lasting about 2 months.This product is a disappointment! I suggest that you do more research before you decide on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit Chicago fixtures!","review":"This sounded great - mostly great reviews & low price. No one seemed to have this problem: we have Chicago fixtures, and they are too small for the filter connection.

Now I don't know if I'll find ANY filter that would work with our faucets. Bummer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It can not be installed on my faucet","review":"I can not install this product. I live in California and our apartment has normal faucet like most of the others. I just can not screw it into position of my faucet. It just does not work.

I am going to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit","review":"I purchased this filter on the glowing recommendations given on Amazon and after years of poor quality PUR faucet filter units. Sadly, the Culligan does not fit. There are essentially two thread types on kitchen faucets: regular and small. Mine is the small external thread variety. The Culligan included no adapter for this (although my old PUR units did!) and their instructions never even made mention of the possibility that a faucet may be of the smaller variety. One would think that Culligan--if anyone--would be cognizant of this. Hence, I never could install the unit and am sending it back to Amazon for refund. My one-star rating reflects my disdain over Culligan's oversight of not including a minicule adapter. I guess I'll never know if the thing even worked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faucet Mount Filter","review":"Easy to install - no tools needed. Works great with no leakage a month later.

We used to get an aftertaste if we used unfiltered tap water, but this filter really does make the water taste like...well, water.We have a stainless sink and chrome faucet, so the white filter attached to it looks a little clunky.

I wanted something to filter out that white residue that always builds up and I'm pretty sure this is doing the trick. Was always running to the kitchen before but now this is much more convenient. Some folks said it was difficult to install but I had two of these up and running in about 20 minutes (10 minutes each and that includes the 5 or so minutes of letting the water run to clean out the filter). I deducted one star because I thought the flow pressure could be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth It","review":"Took about 4 minutes to install and there was an immediate difference in the water.

The water coming out of it tastes great and no longer smells like heavy metals. Its insultingly low flow, however, forces an hour to pass before filling a gallon-sized jug. It's come to the point where we avoid the sink in which this filter is installed. Best left on a faucet the only use of which is to rinse toothbrushes.

I love that it can swivel and I love how the pull knob that turns the filter on will pop back in automatically when you shut the water off. However the filter itself is not very effective. My city has pretty strong chlorine flavor in the water. The Pur filters (2 stage and 3 stage) removed this entirely, it was completely imperceptible. This Culligan filter does slightly reduce it (I did a blind taste test to confirm this) but it does not come anywhere close to the Pur. The water still has a strong chlorine flavor, almost as bad as straight tap water. It is not good enough to keep my wife from buying bottled water, so I am returning it.I guess I am going back to the poorly designed Pur simply because it filters better. I may do as another reviewer mentioned and get it at Costco for the returns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't cut the taste from NYC water...","review":"Basically, due to the Brooklyn/New York/NYC water, the filter didn't cut enough of the city water taste out to be worth keeping. Tried running tap at half flow volume as some reviewers suggest but taste was unaffected regardless of flow rate.Returned before build durability or usable filter time could be tested."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great filter option","review":"This filter is almost exactly what we wanted. After buying, and replacing, 2 Pur filters because they would eventually break where the filter unit connects to the faucet, we decided to try something different. The Culligan filter was incredibly easy to install, works great, and is an excellent price. I have no fear of one small piece breaking and turning the entire thing into junk - there is no flip switch to turn the filter on and off, and the connection to the faucet is very solid. There are only two things I wish were different - 1st, I wish it had an indicator light for changing the filter, and 2nd, I wish it came in a stainless steel option. Neither of these two things take away from the fact that this a great faucet mounted filter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good fit","review":"I got this filter because the Pur filter kept cracking so I wanted to try something new. When I read all the great review I thought for sure this would be perfect. I even bought a replacement filter. When I hooked it up water started spraying from between the attachment and the filter so I was going to return it. They only gave me a week so I had to keep it because I was going on vacation and was not going to be able to get to a post office before I left which was the next morning early. So, I have a heavy paperweight! Great! :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap, better than others, long lasting, simple.","review":"I love this product. Elegant in its simplicity, it's much better than the Pur faucet filter and the plastic Brita pitchers. I don't understand the Brita pitchers- why filter out the impurities when the water is sitting for a day in plastic? The 200 gallon life of the filters makes this cheaper than others. I like the swivel feature of the filter. You can swivel it back when you're using the faucet for other things and swivel it forward when you need your glass to get closer to it.Update three months after first use: the daily swiveling that the filter gets has caused the faucet filter to loosen, so the water is beginning to leak from the main faucet. I have to tighten it constantly. Also, the valve is beginning to get stuck in the filter setting after turning off the water, whereas before it would switch back to the normal faucet mode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth even the small cost","review":"I also have had trouble with the PUR faucet filters. I had the first one for a very long time and after that, I've bought 3 of them in less than a year and they've all started leaking, spraying water all over. I ordered and just received this Culligan unit and while I love the size and all that, it does not filter the water. My water has the same strong chlorine taste thru the filter that it has coming straight out of the faucet not filtered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks; does not contain appropriate mounting hardware","review":"This filter did not fit properly on our kitchen faucet. (We have a standard faucet, not something fancy, special-order, or otherwise odd-sized.) We tried all the o-rings included with the filter but none worked -- the leaking was unacceptable. We were quite surprised, as we have been able to mount other filters with no problem (unfortunately, none lasted long, which is why we decided to try this one). We would have had to go to the hardware store and try to find o-rings that would work, but the whole point of our buying this model from Amazon was to avoid having to go to the hardware store. Luckily, Amazon has a hassle-free return policy (which is a big reason we shop here)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Water tested the Same: Zero Filtration","review":"I installed the faucet filter, following instructions exactly.But after a few days I realized I couldn't taste any difference between the cholorinated tap water and the filtered water - in fact, I had never noticed a difference.

My tap score was 425-430, culligan was 425-430, and bottled water was 005 for particulates.What a complete failure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"The filter arrived promptly and installation was very simple--just twist on.The filtered water is wet, cold, and tasteless--the perfect combination.I was surprised by the very sturdy construction; as shown in the picture the faucet connector is made of metal, much better than the flimsy (and eventually, leaky) plastic connectors most other brands use.To receive filtered water you only have to pull the little pin out a little and it changes the water flow to go through the filter. When you're done you simply turn the water off and the pin automatically changes the water flow back to unfiltered, preventing you from using up your filter when you don't mean to.In short, I'm very satisfied with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"only 2 sizes of faucet attachments...need more!","review":"I purchased this due to the awesome reviews. Come to find out, neither of the attachements fit my faucet, and it is not even an out-of-the-ordinary faucet...I looked in several hardware stores and I couldn't find one that fit so I had to return this filter.

I went to a very large hardware store, Elliots in Dallas, and they were unable to find any conversion piece that will make this filter fit my faucet.

We have a water tester that gives us the ppb for whats in water. Before with regular tap it showed over 600ppb and with the filter it shows 500ish. With the water from the water stations we were getting it was less than 10, so it doesn't filter out everything but it did take all of the bad taste out of the tap. Was it worth it? Yes much more convenient than going to the water stations. And the water tastes fine. The tap is disgusting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better water taste - water pressure...not so good.","review":"Water pressure is greatly reduced, but the improvement in the taste (and smell) of the tap water makes the lack of water pressure something I can live with.

That wasn't a big deal for me, and it was worth maybe a star off my overall rating, but a couple of months ago it started to leak and drip unfiltered water into whatever I was trying to fill with filtered water. I recently replaced it with a PUR faucet filter (FM-3700B), which is a bit more expensive (for both the unit itself and the filter cartridges), but not overmuch, imo. If you're looking for the most cost-effective way to filter your water for maybe a year (and it does perform well when it works), this might be the way to go - otherwise, I'd advise considering a different product."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't like it","review":"Consumer Reports rated it highly, saying it has a \\"reminder\\" for changing the filter. The reminder is a sticker to put on a calendar at the 3 month mark. Has nothing to do with usage, which means if you use it too often, you're drinking contaminated water before the change date....or changing it too often if you use it too little. In addition, the \\"button\\" which one pulls out to produce filtered water is supposed to pop back when the water turns off. That didn't last long...it simply sticks in place so that if one forgets to push it in, the first water out, even when it's not needed, is filtered water.

Well, I can't do anything about that. I repaired with duct tape and now it's leaking through the duct tape.

The installation was easy without any tool. I just wish I can change the filter from the top instead of the bottom of the fixture as I used to do with the older model.

It lasted about a day due to my home having a strong water pressure and the adapter for connecting the device to the faucet is made of plastic which immediately got shot out and thrown on the sink. Not accepting defeat to have filtered water in the home I went with the Culligan. Most important is the adapter is made of metal and once screwed on it stayed lock tight. Second the taste is great though im no water snob but for my quality bar it ranked very well above.

I never realized what a difference my Pur water filter was to the tap until now. If I move the faucet at times water will break through and leak out. I have to turn the water off and manipulate it at least once everyday. I am going back to my Pur water filter. It was nice to have cold water on the spot too. I did not take that in consideration, or if my sink was full of dishes I couldn't get to the faucet. Sometimes good reviews does not always mean a great product. Anyone want to TAKE mine for free?

After going from homedepot to the local plumbing store and getting nothing out of these trips I started reading the other reviews. I learned that others had a similar situation and they hardly got (if )out of it and still use the filter...My suggestion if you absolutely want one of these filters (better have a good reason for the aggravation you'll get through with it)is to get it from a local store so you can take it back if it doesn't fit ... I would have gladly sent it back but I am willing to try one more solution ...a 55/64\\"F X 3/4\\" MH adapter off ebay.

The adapter that Culligan provides does not even fit the faucet. For all the poor quality filters that Pur sells, at least Pur has the sense to provide more types of adapters. That ensures that the Pur filter can at least can be used post purchase. Not so with Culligan. For the lack of a silly adapter (which btw costs just a few cents), Culligan filters need to returned. The adapter should cost just a penny or two when bought on a massive scale. Yet, Culligan choose to not spend even that much for the sake of ensuring customers' convenience. That says a lot about how little Culligan cares about customer satisfaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"$18 down the drain","review":"I live in California and my local tap water is hard and bad-tasting. For decades I have been refilling gallon bottles with good water from vending machines (35 cents per gallon at the local grocery store, but the real price is in inconvenience and back pain). After reading numerous positive reviews of this in-sink filter, I had high hopes. But I have been consistently disappointed for six weeks. The water from the filter does not taste much better than plain tap water. It's not nearly as good tasting as the water from Culligan (and other) vending machines. I can't drink it, my cats refuse to drink it, and even my house plants notice the difference.

Eventually I had to throw it out and get another filter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small, but does a big job well","review":"For a small, inexpensive faucet filter, this one does its job beautifully. The flow of water through this filter is more than adequate. Our previous filter flowed at little more than a trickle, and it took forever to fill a pitcher. The Culligan fills the pitcher almost as fast as the faucet alone does. I liked the fact that it defaulted to the faucet whenever you turned it off, but after a few short months of use, the button now sticks in the open position, so it is necessary to manually push it in to return the flow of water to the faucet. That's really a minor annoyance, and certainly not one that would stop me from recommending this faucet. And I've found the the filters remain effective for much longer than the manufacturer suggests, so replacement is not necessary as often as is recommended, making this a very economical filter to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Filter - Doesn't Leak, Relatively Unobtrusive","review":"Got this a few weeks ago - installed in minutes. The water in my area has a moderately strong chlorine smell, and I was buying bottled water for drinking and cooking. Not anymore.

The water tastes a little flat straight from the filter-tap, but I found that when its chilled it tastes good enough to not every need to buy bottled water anymore at all.

After another few months, it started spraying water from under the filter side.

I trust Amazon reviews and rely heavily on them, but I have been let down with this product.

Seems like a pretty good unit, purchased 11/12/11 - no problems so far. Loses a star for being so slow, my math conversion in the video is off. It's a 2 quart water pitcher, so 8 quarts a week. So that's only about 2 gallon a week, 104 gallons a year. I'm not sure how often I'll have to change the filter, time will tell.Update: 2/14/13- I figured out that I go through about 1.5 quart of water a day, 3/4 of a 2 qt. door pitcher, so lets say 10.5 quarts approximately per week or about 2.5 gallons per week. about 130 gallons a year, I just passed the 15 month mark and filter is slowing down. I just ordered a new one, so it filtered approximately 160 gallons before it started to slow down. It claims to filter up to 200 gallons. Your mileage may vary, depending on your water.

I have to say I'm very pleased with it. It's a much more robust design than the PUR model and it produces good tasting water.

Those filters had plastic connections that eventually stripped, started leaking, then fell off of the faucet. This filter has a metal connection and so far has been great with no leaks. My water had a strong chlorine taste and smell and that is gone now. My only issue is that it didn't fit my faucet right out of the box, I had to use adapter parts (these come with the filter). There was no problem with installation, but the adapters don't allow the filter's automatic shut off valve to work, so I have to manually do it, which isn't a huge deal, but there is a bit of reistance for the valve and I don't know if this will end up being an issue as the filter gets older.

And that's not the improvement I'm talking about. For all I know someone in my family conked it with a frying pan to cause that crack. Nope, I'm talking about the little metal knob you have to push and pull to toggle the water through the filter. The problem is the little metal knob has screw threads. It's attached by them, and every time you push or pull that thing it gets looser, eventually falling off (several times per week) and, usually, going down into the garbage disposal. I've got huge hands and I can't reach in there, so I have to wait for my wife to come home before I dare turn on the disposal.

Fast running, clean tasting, toggle works, it is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective product","review":"The filter came once installed defective knob that allows water to pass filter travez arrived damaged and does not stand alone, the only way is to filter the water that constantly hold, not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like this, I think it's a waste of money","review":"I don't like this. I think it's a big waste of time and money. I had a reverse osmosis water system before this, so it of course could never compare, but I thought it might at least do something for me since some of the reviews were good. The water comes out of this very slow, too slow for me to stand and wait.Just invest in a reverse osmosis water system, that's the best in the long run and then you don't have to mess with contraptions like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"leaks","review":"very dissappointed. at first worked ok, but when I tried to replace the filter, I could never stop it from leaking....too late to return it,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great water filter","review":"I previously owned a Pur water filter and noticed like other reviewers that it wasn't lasting long before it started to leak all over the place. I purchased the Culligan water filter hoping that it would work better. I have used the Culligan for several months and still no leaks. The tab you pull on to get filtered water was a bit of a change from the Pur but more than makes up for not getting hosed down by water. I love the Culligan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Water still tastes bad and had to buy adapter","review":"It hasn't changed the taste of my bad tasting water. The \\"kit\\" did not include the adapter I needed. I found one at Home Depot - another $4.00. My sink spout is smaller in diameter than the filter.On a positive note, it hasn't leaked and it does shut off by itself when you turn the water off.Without testing the water somehow, I have no idea what impurities are actually being reduced.I would not purchase this product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY a great faucet filter!","review":"Really loving this filter. So glad I found the other positive reviews of this one on Amazon. It is SO MUCH BETTER than the Brita On-Tap filter we were using before. Very easy to install, no annoying dial that eventually needs pliers to turn, no water spraying all over the counter (and you) . . . just an excellent, cost-effective product. Could not be more pleased!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well made and workes great.","review":"I bought a Brita filter on clearance. The adaptors were made out of plastic and many times when using the filter it would blow off, shooting water all over. It was upsetting when it happened to me and funny when it happened to my wife.I read the reviews on Amazon and ordered this filter. The adapter is made out of metal as well as the part of the filter that screws on to the faucet. It is well make and works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Filter","review":"The only problem I have been having with this faucet filter has been the leak around the gasket. So have to reseat the gasket every time it starts leaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Faucet Mount","review":"Very good product for this type of filtration. Have used it for 3 months and much better quality than the Brita and PUR which have plastic threads and wind up stripping after extended use. Metal fitting makes Culligan superior to aforementioned brands. Would be 5 stars if the valve stem, which is pulled out to activate filter, disengaged when water is shut off. (It did at first but started sticking after a month.) A little inconvenient but not a show stopper. Also, Culligan does not have an indicator light that notifies you when filter needs to be replaced. However, this feature on the other brands was not very reliable and stopped working after several months of use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great filter","review":"After researching other brands and reading reviews we decided to purchase the Culligan filter. We are very pleased with it and it was very easy to install. Its design is quite simple, but it works very well. The price is great, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAP","review":"I like other reviewers installed and re-installed and re-installed only to have the unit LEAK.It was very frustrating and i thought it was me because i am not at all handy.Amazon was nice when i called for a return label so this crap is going back......"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess!","review":"The water tasted fine but the installation was a nightmare and despite everything, the thing leaked relentlessly. Added to the fact that calling Culligan customer service gets you on hold until they shove you into a voicemail box and then never return your call made me take a fresh look at the Pur which took 10 minutes to install and that included the flushing process. No leaks and the water tastes as good as the Culligan. Giving the 2 stars because the water did taste okay and the thing was cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I got this filter today, installed it in 10 minutes, cleared out the filter as required for 10 minutes and proceeded to drink a glass. Tastes great, smells great, and snuggly fits to my existing faucet in my apartment. The water pressure is a bit low coming out of the filter, but it's quick enough to fill up a glass in a few seconds. Great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"We've had this filter for a few weeks now and I have to say its great!

Will definitely keep buying the filters. Very happy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 1 month","review":"Bought the filter and it broke after 1 month.

Buy the more expensive for... $5 more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy with this filter","review":"Looked at the other brands and did not like the reviews. The Culligan has metal mounts so no problems there. We bought it to take the chorine taste out of the water for our coffee maker. Usually our water is fine here in Miami, but the new coffee maker brought out a chorine taste that my wife noticed. The Culligan filter removes that taste. We bought an extra filter for it. We recommend the Culligan. The other two main competitors could stand to read some of their reviews about their mounts and change them, but I guess not. The difference is what makes the world go round."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than Pur and Brita","review":"Unlike Pur and Brita faucet mounted filters, this one seems much sturdier.The pin no longer goes back in by itself after the water is turned off,but it is still very easy to just push it back in manually.Would purchase again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Filter","review":"The water comes out in a trickle so I thought it was defective but when i called the company, I was told its the way its supposed to work. Its supposed to take 20-30 seconds to fill up an 8 oz cup! And soon after we got it, it got even slower."},{"rating":"2","title":"best for the price. 4.5 Stars","review":"After much research and review, this product seemed to be the most reliable and effective for the price. I purchased the product. Installed it in seconds very very easily. The instructions said run for 20 minutes I did an hour. It took about 5 days to break in. Now the water is odor and metal-taste free. The cost and convenience to have clean drinking water and cooking water and not carry the gallons of bottled spring water.....is not even close with massive savings.. I bought a camelback BPA bottle and now drink more water than ever. The only downside is that the stream of water is somewhat slow. BUT with the metal fastener and button (reliable) the ease of installation, effective cleaning and removal of odor and the PRICE.....this is extremely hard to beat. The unit is also small enough as to not cause any issues at the sink. 4.5 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks Culligan","review":"I've had a brita filter for over two years and fortunately, about two months ago, I gave in and threw it out. The brita is a piece of junk: it sprays from every single place imaginable. Basically, when you want to get a glass of water, you get an additional free shower with it. Another issue is the one of the little plastic nob you have to turn to filter your water: after less than a year of usage it became impossible to turn so I was stuck with filtered water even when I didn't need it. I went out and bought the Culligan FM-15A. I am impressed by the quality difference: the Culligan is made with metal (not plastic) so the water doesn't spray everywhere (no small spills either). The nob is also made of metal and it goes back to its original position every time you close the tap. If I only knew how good this product is, I wouldn't have waited two years to replace my sucko brita filter. Finally, I don't hate using my sink anymore. Thanks Culligan."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not last for 2 months","review":"I have no problem with the filtering system, but Culligan says it lasts for two months. Mine have lasted for one month. After one month you can still get water through the filter, but it trickels into a glass. It take a few minutes to fill a glass up. At $20 a filter (Costa Rica) I am not going to buy a filter every month."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can not use it","review":"I could NOT install it as it did not fit.

Thank you for reading my review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slight Leak, Auto Off Switch no Longer Works","review":"This Culligan filters the water well, but after using it for 2-3 months, It developed a slight dripping leak from the side of the filter (only leaks while the filter is on). Changed the cartridge, no difference. Also, the button that turns the filter on/off no longer auto shuts off when the faucet is shut off, So you can end up using the filter more quickly if you are not proactive about the switch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good water quality, but the normal water stream is far too small","review":"I just bought a set of the product and fitted it with my faucet. The filtered water stream is very small which I can accept.But when I let the water flow the un-filtered stream, the water stream is same as the filtered one.I have to spend much longer time to wash my dishes. I checked the design, no way to change this, it is designed like that. Both stream use the same small whole to flow out.Eventually I have to dismount this filter from my faucet, really can't tolerate so ridiculously small water stream for washing dishes.How come nobody mention/complain this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"filter lid glued on","review":"Seems a good product, attaches well, seems to filter. But when I wanted to replace the filter the filter cover would NOT come off...tried by hand, tried by pliers, tried by wrench... it is cemented.

Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless after a week","review":"Spend your $16 on a weeks worth of bottled water instead of this. Water actually tastes worse after going through it. Someone in a previous review had a good tip: turn the water on to run slowly through the filter allowing it to properly pass through the charcoal and it will greatly improve the taste. The problem is, who has time to wait 20-30 seconds every time I need water.My advice, buy a proper under-sink filter and don't waste your money and time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget about the 5-year warrantee","review":"I was a satisfied user until one day when I couldn't get the darned thing open to replace the filter. I called Culligan and got passed around, finally leaving a voicemail.Corporate has no idea how to handle complaints, either. Those who will answer are used to expensive, permanent devices.Because time is also worth something, it is not cost effective to bother with \\"support.\\" Maybe a pitcher system would be better: at least one can be sure to be able to replace the cartridge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent filter","review":"I had replaced an older Brita filter in my kitchen with a new one a year ago. I was so frustrated that it kept coming apart and spraying around all of the plastic parts in less than a year. I decided to try the Culligan filter. It is a very solid faucet filter...attaches securely to the faucet with a stainless screw on attachment. I like that the filter replacements are available on Amazon at a reasonable cost and the taste of the water is great. I'm very satisfied with this purchase and happy to have a dependable filter again. Brita take note...your quality has gone downhill and your products fall apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tastes the same","review":"I tasted the water straight from the tap and then from the filtered source. I registered no discernable difference. The water here in Las Vegas tastes bad and smells bad to me. In the past, when I have run out of bottled water, tap water is still undrinkable and I have to make an emergency trip to the convenience store. Fortunately, I have many choices to obtain bottled water 24 hours a day because I really can't drink this stuff. All that said, this item does not help my situation. I have a zero water filter system which works great, but I go through a filter every few days, so I no longer use it. I drink about a gallon or more of water every day. To summarize, I wound't recommend it. Also, it takes about 20 seconds to fill a 16 ounce cup. I did follow all the included instructions perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does absolutely nothing","review":"Tested my water quality with this before installing this product:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C0A7ZY/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00And it didn't improve the water quality 1 bit.

My husband and I have been trying for TWO DAYS to change the filter. It will NOT come out. My husband is no weakling. He is known as \\"Mr Fix-it\\" usually. Because of the shape, there is nothing for him to grab on to with his wrench so if it's too tight, you're screwed! I do NOT want to go through this every other month so I am canceling my subscribe and save for replacement filters and I'm just going to start all over again with a new unit (not a Culligan, obviously!) If you are lucky enough to get one that isn't too tight, make sure you don't screw the new one in too tight when you change it. Better yet, just don't buy one this brand to start with! There is another brand on another site that last 3 times as long anyway (at least it claims to but I haven't tried it yet) and it's only $24 so much cheaper in the long run."},{"rating":"2","title":"Replaced my Brita","review":"The Culligan FM-15A is less expensive and much easier to use than the Brita unit I previously used. I love the fact that you don't have to switch it on/off like the Brita. Pull the filter stop to turn it on, turn the water off from the faucet and the filter stops. Very simple operation. The Brita on/off lever was very difficult to turn after the first couple of weeks. I wish the Culligan had an end of life indicator like the Brita but the Brita indicator never worked from day one on the first unit I purchased and also on a replacement unit I received so what's the difference.The Culligan is rated for 200 gallons as opposed to 100 gallons for the Brita and the filtration performance specs listed are nearly identical. Consumer reports rates the Culligan very high also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filter doesnt last","review":"This filter was easy to fix to the tap.However the filter system doesnt last long.

The water tasted nasty and there were also leakage.I read reviews on this Culligan water filter and decided to give it a try, it actually works much better than the Brita filter I tried. The water tasted pretty clean and fresh, there is no leakage, very easy to install. The Culligan water filter is simple and convenient. I've used it for a month now and it is still great!

Tested with a particulate meter (HM Digital TDS-EZ Water Quality TDS Tester, 0-9990 ppm Measurement Range , 1 ppm Resolution, +/- 3% Readout Accuracy available on Amazon as well).Only minor gripe was the it didn't include an adapter for my kitchen faucet which is recessed too far for the included adapters. When I went to local hardware store, I noticed about 30% of the kitchen faucets were also recessed. Culligan should've done more market research and included an adapter with a longer depth (the threads on the included ones were correct, they were just to short to fit my faucet)."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT GOOD..BUT IS THE PRODUCT NOT SELLERS FAULT.","review":"JUST NOT SATISFIED...the stream comes out very slow and water does'nt taste any better. why buy it..i don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good product for water flow","review":"I put this on my kitchen sink and the water flow was so slow that I had to remove it. the water barely trickled out and was so slow that it took 15 minutes to do something that was very a 10 second job. maybe I installed it wrong but its not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy, simple, effective, affordable","review":"This is the best on-tap filter you can buy. The price is very affordable - $17 for a quality piece that won't break like the PUR filter mount. I didn't test the efficacy of the filtering, but consumer reports gave it the best possible rating on this measure. It screws on the faucet head easily, and it's inconspicuous enough to leave there.As other reviews have noted, it doesn't have a super-high speed flow, but that's a small inconvenience for a affordable, reliable and effective filter."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Fine Until It Breaks Down on You...Twice!","review":"I suppose it's my own fault. Having purchased this filter in an effort to save money and based on the positive reviews, I was only a little surprised when the thing broke down after two-and-a-half months. Two weeks after putting a new filter in it, go figure. So, having this filter on hand, and faucet mounts costing almost as much as the filters themselves, I bought another one. That one lasted three-and-a-half months before breaking the exact same way (read: crack in the screw-treads where the filter locks in causing the filter to jettison into the sink and water to spew everywhere). Maybe I was just too invested because attaching the faucet mount was a David-Versus-Goliath-esque struggle (my old aerator had been rusted on, and took a solid hour of trial and error and a couple of embarassing/painful injuries to get the thing off). But I should have known just to walk away. This filter, she'll only break your heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly adequate","review":"The best feature of this little filter: it automatically converts from filtering to regular faucet streaming when you shut off the faucet.

I had a Pur which always leaked and needed so many attachments to fit (in)correctly that I couldn't even fill a water bottle since the kitchen faucet was so distended. This was easy to install, does not drop down too low, and the water tastes great. Also doesn't drip like a sieve. I am delighted that it reverts back to regular faucet after each use so friends who help me won't be washing up with filtered water. No, it doesn't have an indicator, but I have a smart phone and I have set reminders when I need to change the filter. One can also set up regular discounted filter deliveries through Amazon for their personal desired intervals. I wish I hadn't waited so long to replace the blasted Pur device.

This might be a great product IF it could be installed. My faucet is a regular type which can switch between 1 large stream vs many small sprays. This makes it slightly wider than the bare-bones \\"pipe like\\" faucet ends. However, despite being only slightly wide at the watering end, this filter will not fit on my faucet - the filter housing conflicts with the faucet neck. I went to home depot and Aces hardware - nobody carried any adaptors that would help my situation.

It is too long-winded and the story never maintains a smooth flow.Even though Thoth narrates the story from an Egyptian point of view the Greek bashing that goes on continuously does not convey the feeling that it is made as an aid to understand the differences in the cultures or people but simply as a mechanism to demean Greeks and Greece as a whole.As for extensive research, that may be true for the historical facts, but when Sprott uses Greek words or phrases as a wow-he-is-so-learned factor he would have done much better if he employed any Greek school kid as an advisor.Lastly, in which Greek tourist trap did he ever learn that moussakka was a food eaten by ancient greeks???!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This guy is good...","review":"To even begin to describe the music on this CD is difficult...it's like trying to describe what God looks like.

Instead of an insightful look at the workings of Hollywood, Halperin turned this potential into 94 minutes of absolute crap.His sexuality has since been questioned and it's very likely that this piece of work will be looked back upon as his first step towards admitting his homosexuality.If you enjoy touching movie moments, don't bother getting this movie.

Ian's dream world is dominated by an SS officer named Anton, who tortures him at will, while refusing his sexual advances.

An emotionless hit man with a soft spot for his cabbie 'hostage'. I never would have believed it but it all worked.

These heaters are far more-effective than the $80 Vornado heater my friend bought a while back, and when these ones stop working, I'll buy more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Heater!","review":"I live in Florida, but the A/C is cranked at work, to the point that I was miserably cold.

I know they say not for bathroom use, but we put it well away from where it could get water on it. It will shut off in 5 minutes or less just about the time restroom is starting to get warm enuf to hop in the shower. End up having to turn furnace up and heat the whole house, which is a waste of heat as we are both leaving within the half hour. The bathroom and bedroom are 5 feet apart, use a radiator type heater in the bedroom at night, which does very well to keep the chill out of the bedroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasted","review":"This little space heater was good while it lasted. It warmed up my little bathroom in the spring. It wasn't hot to the touch so it lived up to it's name: SafeHeat. However, the thing died after a mere 5 months. I tried unplugging it for a day and switching it on again but it refuses to work at all. While the product wasn't crazy expensive, it's still a waste of $15. It's not worth the cost of shipping it back. I will not buy this product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"It shut off way too quickly and didn't turn back on quick enough.And it broke/didn't work after nominal use of 10-15 times only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"I don't think I've ever purchased an item that is so totally useless. The heat it puts out is anemic on both settings, and the fan would not blow out a candle. The only way to get warm with this thing would be to put it on your lap and wrap a blanket around you. The worst thing is that the controls are terrible, and the light stays on no matter whether it is running or not, which I guess is good as there is no 'off' position. The only way to make sure it's off is to unplug it."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad bad controls","review":"Something I really never gave much thought to before this heater, but the worst controls ever! Really hard to see anything - fan speed or heat setting. Dials are same colour plastic (not like picture) with small embossed/partially obscured numbers (or some symbol???).I give it a 2/5 only because it is a quiet fan with a stable base.I'm curious who approves a product like this at DeLonghi?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty heater","review":"It took a while to take this out of the box so the initial return time had come and gone. When I plugged this in, it had a weird plastic, burnt smell. I guess that's not unusual when heaters are new, but after about an hour it started smoking, badly. This was purchased for an elderly person and I just didn't want to mess with it, so we unplugged it and threw it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"For San Francisco Cold this is perfect (Dont know about New York). More like a personal single room heater.","review":"I use this under my computer desk. I bought this as my room mate use to have this and I too liked it. It has awsome heat resistant body around it, so no danger of burning something around it. It can heat a bed room in about 30mins in San Francisco, not sure about NewYork. Its not the regular high heat emitting type. If you stay away from its blow, you might feel little colder before 30 mins of starting it. This is only usefull if someone wants to treat it as a personal heater with fan. I keep it facing me under my desk and it does a good job for me. I dont like the regular heaters which emit too much heat and makes me feel over heated. But this one doesnt emit too much heat. My friend has been using it since 2 years now and I hope it will last that long for me too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Energy eater","review":"Fine for what it is, but this thing uses a massive amount of electricity. Your electricity bill will double if you use it consistently. That being said, its automatic shutoff feature is a plus. It smells often. It sparks internally sometimes. It achieves levels of power like a microwave - by interspersing time \\"on\\" with time \\"off.\\" Sometimes I wish it would stay on for a bit longer when it's supposed to be on high. But leave it on for long enough and it will heat even a fairly spacious room.It's useful for those times when your primary heat stops working or you need a little something extra, but I'm cautioning you about the extent to which this thing sucks up the juice."},{"rating":"1","title":"This heater is only $14.95","review":"I bought this heater from Amazon in January 2008 for $14.95.

It is worth $14.95, but certainly not $79.99."},{"rating":"1","title":"It blows :(","review":"I wanted something to put under my desk at home since I'm on the computer a lot. This heater blows out warm air right away, but turns off for no apparent reason, is difficult to figure out and lacks a lot of features.There are two dials on it that are impossible to read without picking it up and looking at it closely. There is no ability to move the direction of the air to blow up or down, left or right. It just blows one direction. Also, it seems to use up a lot of electricity and has caused me to run outside to the circuit box several times. It shuts off whenever it wants to... even if it's still very cold under my desk! There is no way to make it start up again until it wants to.I wish I knew these things before I bought it, because I wouldn't have. There are better space heaters out there in this price range."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Heater","review":"We ordered 3 of these heaters to place in individual rooms so that we can turn down the thermostat and focus heat in selected rooms and so far everyone is happy. My husband and I have them placed on the floors in two rooms that lack carpet and these keep our feet very toasty. I have also placed it across the room and it does a good job heating the room quickly. We have only had these a few weeks so I cannot comment on durability but so far we are very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Energy sucker, but price can't be beat!","review":"I purchased the DeLonghi DFH132 from Amazon a few months ago and here I am ordering another for the kitchen.

I got this heater to heat up a reasonable sized room, mainly my bedroom and I can also move it into the living room.The little heater puts out a good heat, warm and cozy (not intense) that can make a chilly room, quite warm and comfortable.I can leave the heater on all night, in my bedroom, at the 3 setting and the thermostat works well enough to ensure that the room maintains a steady heat.It is not a good heater if you want to get up real close when its a really cold day, and you just want to chill out your feet, but if you leave it on for an hour for a good sized room, it can maintain a good heat. For this I give it a 4 rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"pleased with heater","review":"I haven't had this heater very long, but I like it so far. It is light and portable and not too loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product.","review":"This is an excellent, low energy heater! I have a large basement bedroom that this item heats up quite nicely. It has NO problems heating the entire room, and even the adjacent bathroom. My only complaint is the heat regulation is a little sporadic. It's difficult to get the machine to put out the exact temperature you want. I find myself adjusting the dial quite often. Overall, this is a very impressive product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I was dissapointed that in the description it says the heater will turn off when tipped over. When I tipped it over it did not shut off. The instructions on the inside of the box said it will shut off if there is an obstruction infront of the heater or if it gets overheated. It also does not have a shut off and needs to be unpluged to fully shut it off. Other then that it seems to be a good heater and is quiet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet, But Not Too Powerful","review":"The title says it all: It is so quiet that you can barely realize it's working. However, it will take a long time to make your room warm.There are much more powerful heaters on the market. But I love the silence. And, the \\"not-too-hot\\" property just fits my needs.Recommended if you're not living in a cold neighborhood."},{"rating":"1","title":"It works well , then it stops ...","review":"The heater works well when it works. It fills medium and even larger rooms with nice warm air. The only problem with the heater is it turns off when it wants to. The settings don't allow for continues running and when it turns off it doesn't initially come back on. Over all its good for keeping small spaces warm in large spaces, ie office cubical, garage work space, or living room sofa. It doesn't work well in small spaces like bathrooms, its auto off feature kicks in. Overall I will return the heater for a different model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect space heater","review":"I love this little heater! I used it in my office, putting it right on the desk so the heat blows directly on me (I sit under an air vent that makes me freeze). Never had a problem with it.

My feet used to freeze every day at work, since we have a cold draft along the floor. Now I put this heater under my desk and all my cold symptoms went away. The automatic on/off is great, once i set the right setting, i no longer have to worry about controlling it, as it maintains a fairly constant temperature.One warning - when I plugged it in at my apartment, and put on HIGH, all the lights got slightly dimmer, which I don't think is a good sign. But at work the electric wiring must be much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"not too good for the money","review":"Plenty of small sized heaters on the market that are better quality than this one. It's a great size and I liked the controls for adjusting the temp and air flow but this unit stopped working after one season! I live in CA (hardly low temps!) and used it occasionally during last winter in my garage to keep my feet warm while doing the laundry. I would say it died with less than 40 hours of usage. Maybe I just had a lemon but I had all kinds of problems with it, including blowing circuits if it was plugged in and my daughter plugged in the hairdryer in another outlet on the same circuit.

Anyway, I wouldn't spend $5 on another one like this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't stay on","review":"I've had this thing for a day now and can't get it to stay on for more than a minute or two. The only way I can get it to turn back on is to unplug it for a few minutes (as the directions suggest), then plug it back in. Works great for another 2 minutes, then turns itself off again. Plus, what's up with heaters that have no handle or off switch, like this one? I'm returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money!!!!","review":"I purchased this heater to use under my desk at work.

I checked -- this is not the thermostat, even fan only will not function. Obviously the weak fan allows the higher heat setting to warm the unit itself enough trigger the safety shut down. I think this is a design flaw not an actual safety hazard. I am about to return this to Amazon and have already purchased from Amazon the DeLonghi DCH1030 which is excellent. Both fans by the way aim the hot air up sufficiently to not heat at all the surface on which they are placed -- unlike a Holmes unit I used many years but placed on a hotplate for safety."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap!!!","review":"fair price but product is cheap it stops when it's over heated not when you are. i would sugest spending a little more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Next to useless","review":"Well, here are my problems with this unit:1) It barely works. I use it in a 12x14 foot bedroom. There are two settings, 1500 watts and 750 watts, and you have to have it on 1500 before it warms the room at all. At 750, I can put my freezing hands in front of it and the air coming out of it feels slightly above lukewarm. If I leave it on for a half hour, it raises a closed 60 degree room to 62. This has to be the most inefficient space heater on earth to produce such little heat with 750 watts of power. Literally every other ceramic heater ever made is better. You'll spend much more on electricity over time than you save on the heater. There are much better heaters out there, please buy a different one instead - ANY one. You can't possibly do any worse.2) There's no off switch!!! I couldn't believe this until I read the manual, and sure enough - if you want to turn it off you have to unplug it.

I heard it and something just told me it was Dwele, and I still wasn't for sure though. All I remember playing over in my mind was the phrase \\"and this is going to be alright, when I'm around you.\\" I knew his cd was out, but I just hadn't gotten around to getting it. Man, I wish I gotten it much earlier. This is the first album in a long time I can actually listen to all the way through. Every song has it's own kind of flavor.

It is called Dwele and his navel gazing album Subject.The man simply has no musical mojo at all. Not one decent melody. No good funk. Nothing. Every song is slow and sounds the same. 60 minutes and 34 seconds of grinding monotony. He keeps singing about relationships that didn't work out. Maybe thats because you are such a dull pup, my friend. The only song that comes alive a little and stands out from the others at all is track 9, \\"Money Don't Mean A Thing\\". But it is an exception and you will probably be asleep by then anyway. This is watered down, sleep inducing coffee house muzak at it's worst.

This is the type of album that after a date or night on the town you can come home to and relax. If you are into D'Angelo or the whole Neo-Soul movement you may want to invest $10.00 into this cd. My favorite tracks are \\"Find a Way\\", \\"Subject\\", \\"A.N.G.E.L.\\". Or if you respectfully just love someone who can sing and is not a Falsetto, you'll love it. I honestly never knew who Dwele was until I was wacthing VH1 Soul and happened to come across his video \\"Find a Way\\" I loved the song and thought the video was hot.

The songs that I like the most are- Angel (interlude), Day at a time, Subject, Hold on and Kick out of you (my ultimate favorite from the album)..Though his voice leaves something to be desired, it is smooth enough to hold down this album along with the incredible vibe given from the beats..Its a nice album to put on when you just want to relax...It would be nice to hear what else this man has to offer!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dwele","review":"I very happy with my purchase of \\"Subject\\" by Dwele.

The entire c.d had a flowing, smooth sound and it can be listened to in all types of settings. I don't know why the c.d is so inexpensive, but I would have paid more than $9.99 for it because it's definitely worth a lot more."},{"rating":"1","title":"........","review":"I don't understand the hype about this Dwele album.

He can sing yes, and it definitely has the sound but it is sorta watered down. I agree with reviewers mistermaxx and Addicted To The Groove. \\"Is it listenable? yes, Memorable? Not really\\" None of the songs jumped out and GRABBED me. It all blended together. I was listening to the album and got to the end without using rewind one time (used fastforward a couple times though).

The only interesting tracks are the new version of 'Lady at Mahogany' (the old one is on one of his underground albums), the remake of 'I Get a Kick Out of You' and 'Hold On', what Eric Roberson gave to him (the remix with Kanye West and Consequence is even better; it would have lit this album up if included). Better luck next time, Dwele."},{"rating":"1","title":"A different style...","review":"When I first saw his video for \\"Find a Way\\", I was hyped about Dwele.

The unit shuts off whenever moderate road vibration is encountered. It shuts off so much it is completely unusable. After searching the web, it turns out that this is a common problem with most all Garmin GPS units, caused by the batteries breaking contact when the unit is vibrated. I unsuccessfully tried all the \\"fixes\\" described on the internet to hold the batteries in place, but it turned out the problem is caused by bad design - the internal battery connector is not hard wired to the PC board in the unit, instead a metal connector presses against the board. When vibrated, the connector breaks contact and the unit powers off.

The GPS unit is amazingly accurate to within 5-10 feet. And it performs well under tree cover.The only negatives I can list is that the unit is somewhat heavy/bulky for carrying purposes. I hang it around my neck by a strap when not carrying it in my hand. The unit is designed for rugged outdoor recreation so the weight and bulk should be expected.

Handheld Garmins seem to provide comparable accuracy to much more expensive mapping grade GPS units. The extra cost for the better antenna in the 60CSx is well worth it. I've been able to get a good position fix indoors and in pretty dense tree cover, something which I understand is difficult with the lower-end units. In addition, despite many reports to the contrary, I think Garmin's MapSource US topo software (sold separately) is a nice addition to the basemap provided on this GPS.

The Garmin support gave me at least 10 different answers about this but no solution for the problem. If I lose the chip or it gets damaged (as happened a few months ago with another chip) I will have nothing. Also _very_ bad is the fact that you can not update any info in the card. And there are many small errors (things are constantly changing!).- The compass and altimeter have to be calibrated to be reliable.- The unit is not water proof and doesn't floatIf you're not considering using Garmin maps/cityNavigators, it's a very good choice.

Of course, you need a 4G card to do it all... The flexibility of the unit is amazing and accuracy and satellite reception is great.

The only cautionary advice I can provide involves purchasing topo maps for this device.The Garmin website lists the 100K topo maps at $59.00 per region of the United States. 24K topo maps are $99.99 for two states. If you download these maps, you can only place one at a time on a microSD card regardless of GB available. So, when I travel from Texas to New Mexico, I have to switch out cards.Here's a direct quote from Garmin Tech Support: \\"The unit will only read the original file. Renaming the file works on some of our newer units, like the GPSMAP62 series, but unfortunately not on the GPSMAP60 series. Garmin recommends MicroSD cards with a capacity to be no larger than 4GB.\\"It's not a terrible inconvenience for me, but it may be for some. You can also find these maps cheaper on other sites.Great device though, all of the essentials for many great adventures outdoors!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Essentially useless unless you buy mapping software for $130.","review":"I'm a smart guy, but even I got fooled by this one. Although the product description states that the device comes pre-loaded with a maps of the U.S., it contains data only for US Interstates and major US Highways (not even all of them). Furthermore, the built-in maps are of such poor quality that this device is essentially useless out-of-the-box. Garmin designs their products so that only their proprietary maps will work on the device, so you have to buy them. Add $130 plus S&H for maps to whatever you expect this device to cost you. I couldn't be more angry about my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware Garmin Customer Service","review":"Downloaded a map of london onto the unit and it wiped out my Topo US 24k West SD chip. On line at Garmin does not warn you of this prior to download. Customer Service said they could not make this up to me and basically they were sorry that their site does not address the issue prior to download. They stated you have to by a blank SD chip to download another map even though the online download states there is room to download additional maps. Garmin makes a good product and this GPS is one of the best. Their corporate greed is problematic. They have lost me as a customer, though they do not really care."},{"rating":"2","title":"great battery life","review":"The mapping is great but what really surprised me was the long battery life. I had mine on for over 25 hours before I replaced the batteries and I probably could have gone another 7 or so hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin 60CSx GPS","review":"Great GPS. Fairly easy to use. With high sensitivity receiver, quickly locks on to signal. Display is clear. I read other opinions about this GPS and agree that mapdata base that is included is very poor. I have a 2008 street map database for North America I got for my nuvi 350 GPS and disc said it is compatible with 60CSx. I need to figure out how much memory I need as I'm sure it is more than the 128MB chip that gave with the 60CSx. Highly recommend this product for land navigation, geochaching, etc. Don't get it if you want to find you way on the road."},{"rating":"2","title":"GPSMap 60CSx","review":"I purchased this unit to replace my Lowrance Ifinder Hunt that developed display issues during a bow hunting trip last fall. I couldn't be more pleased. The new Sirf III chip is far more accurate than my Ifinder was and the new unit holds satellite lock much much better. There's nothing more frustrating that attempting to drag a nice deer out of public land after dark and your GPS unit can't tell you where you are any closer than 200 feet. That's a ton when your stumbling through the woods dragging a 170 lb. whitetail. The only downside of this unit is the lack of detailed topographic information. Living in northeast wisconsin, you rarely find a 100 ft contour so everything looks flat. Once Garmin updates all their maps to 24000:1, this unit will be hard to beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for your hunter!","review":"I bought this GPS for my husband this year after he got himself lost during a hunting trip this past fall. I am not a GPS expert and had to rely on online reviews. Well, I apparently did well! My husband loves it and has already used it for hunting! It is apparently user friendly (like the Garmin we have in our car) and the screen is a good size. The only drawback, and why i would rate it a 4 versus a 5 is that all the map software must be purchased from Garmin - I have heard that other models allow for the National Geographic software, while this one does not."},{"rating":"2","title":"GPSMap 60CSX","review":"The best hand-held gps so far....Fast satellite acquisition, faster screen refresh, Micro SD data storage.Five-Thumb's Up!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great GPS","review":"I really like this GPS so far. I had a Garmin Vista and while it was easy to operate, I had reception problems. As an avid hiker/backpacker, I go to spots with heavy tree canopy and the Vista was constantly losing signal. Not so with this unit. Over 50 miles with it in the woods and have yet to lose reception.Also the larger screen is great as my eyes get older. The pages are very intuitive as are most of the menu screens. This GPS also does not seem to eat batteries as did my prior one. Only issue may be that the owner's manual and in some ways the GPS are oriented to road travel & navigation while the unit is a hand held and will attract more outdoor users rather than drivers. (By the way, my wife has a Garmin 550 StreetPilot and loves it.)All in all, I recommend this GPS highly, for whatever that is worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thansgiving Day hunt","review":"Thanksgiving day I received a cell phone call from my oldest son.He asked me to check on Goolge Earth to give him some idea as to where his was on the tractof land that we hunt. It is a very large tract of state owned land.He was useing another means of GPS that was not the most user friendly.That was my reason for buying the Garmin GPS 60CSx. After reading reviews on the internet of the GPS products out there I chose the Garmin 60CSx.It was bought as a Christmas gift for my son.I know that His wife and children can relax,knowing that he has the means to get out of the woodssafely. ( Dad Too!! ). The look on his face was priceless when he opened the box.I will buy one for myself for the next hunting season here in Upstate New York."},{"rating":"2","title":"Geocaching Made Easy","review":"A friend talked me into joining him for a geocaching outing. If you are not familiar with geocaching see their web site, geocaching.com. It is a blast!I purchased this unit on his recommendation (he owns every GPS model made) and I can tell you that after over 200 finds this year, this is the best unit you can own for getting out and geocaching. To make matters even better, it keeps coming down in price.You can download geocaches from your computer to the unit and then you are ready for an outing. The unit is fast to acquire satellites, maintains coverage under trees (as good as any unit we have tried - none are perfect) and is accurate taking you to the coordinates of the cache. All the research has been done. Buy this one and go out and have fun.At some point in the future something better will come along, but for today this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice GPS","review":"This is a really good GPS for outdoors (hiking/camping) use. It is very quick to aquire satellites and is capable of displaying MGRS coordinates for those of you in the military. Very very rugged construction. I've dropped this thing countless times, and kept it in a lower ammo pouch on my body armor while crawling around/dropping into the prone with my full weight on it with no problems.The menu system isn't bad but definitely not the most intuitive, and entering labeling information with the on screen keyboard can be a pain. My only real complaint though is the map set it comes with is bare bones, and that's being generous. You'll definitely need to buy a map set micro sd card for your area and they don't come cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good little portable unit.","review":"Good portable unit. Not really for car mount use, but on foot, is great and keeps up well. Accuracy is well within what is stated and takes extreme tree cover to be significantly off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great GPS","review":"Best Garmin I have owned.

Only difficulty encountered was in finding a good screen color for night viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rockn & Rolling","review":"LOVE the GPS. The 60CSx is my first GPS unit. I found it very easy to setup and use in a very few minutes. The topo map I bought (separately) works perfectly.Had it up in the Rocky mountains finding old mining sites & such. The terrain was spot on too. Rolling in to winter I'll be using this a lot to keep from getting lost snowmobiling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Southwest Asia","review":"I purchased this unit along with Garmin's middle east software. I spent a considerable amount driving roads in Kuwait and this unit's routing feature was extremely reliable at getting me out of more then a few jams on their sometimes very precarious roadway system especially while driving during sand storms and withstanding environmental extremes. Purchase this unit, you will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great guide","review":"Wonderful product for hiking, walking with the family and for our main purpose, hunting.

I expected this to be simple. I don't want to spend a great deal of time trying to learn how to use something, that negates the point of wanting to get out and go.I'm returning it. YUCK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT GPS","review":"I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT THE MANUAL.

I TAUGHT MY WIFE HOW TO USE IT IN FIFTEEN MINUTES AND SHE NEVER EVER EVEN SAW A GPS BEFORE. THE ACCURACY COULD BE A LITTLE BETTER THOUGH. I EVEN RESET THE COMPASS FOR DEVIATION WITHOUY THE MANUAL IN A FEW MINUTES. PERHAPS, IF YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND THE MANUAL, YOU SHOULD NOT BE IN THE FIELD RELYING ON THE GPS TO GET YOU HOME.

After some 30 geocaches we deternined it is constintly 23 to 36 feet off the target. Sometimes it just seems drunk. When others in the group are all gathering in the same general locations we found ourselves constantly some 27 feet away. Guess it's the luck of the draw. We just got a bad one.

I have a hard time correlating on the map exactly where I am without stopping to triangulate my position, and if there are no real landmarks, or higher areas in the area, I have to be very careful not to get lost. This unit keeps me on track, and using my map, and GPS, and compass, I've found myself much more confident in places like the BWCAW, and other areas like it. I rarely have problems with satellites getting through; and the fact that it's easy to keep on you, using the provided clip, makes it that much more user friendly since you're more apt to take it along. The basic provided map is just o.k., and you'll soon want to upgrade to for better mapping software."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I was a little intimidated by this GPS when I first got it- it's my first GPS and it has very few buttons to perform many different functions. After 5 minutes or so, I discovered that this GPS is incredibly easy to use, incredibly accurate(I'm stunned), and has functions to do so much! Download a waypoint from [...], and the 60CSX will give you step by step instructions how to get there, telling you when to turn, which way to turn- it's amazing. I put it to the test in a major city, and the directions were fantastic. Definitely a great buy for rookie and pro alike!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Handheld","review":"This is the my third handheld gps unit and without a doubt it's the best I have used or seen on the market to date. I primarily use it for recording fishing spots and water-related waypoints. I also use it to download my many other personal POI files. I'm extremely pleased with the unit's overall performance and would highly recommend it to anyone. On the con side, to fully take advantage of the unit's extended features you must purchase additional expensive mapping software. It's fast when acquiring-refreshing, accurate and reliable and integrates nicely with related Garmin Mapsource products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice compact unit.","review":"Seems to be a good unit but I have had problems figuring out how to use it.

They work ONLY with Windows. For such a well-known brand, this is surprising and extremely inconvenient.

I am sure there is a way to figure it all out if I spend hours studying it, but its Garmins non-user friendly system and you shouldn't have to do that. It's crap. You'd be better off buying cheap $100 car gps with free road map. But don't buy Garmin, they don't know what user friendly is. And getting hold of tech support to help.

The 60cxs is the ultimate outdoor GPS and very adequate for highway and town. The size is a perfect match between weight and readability, the GPS is optimized to a minimum number simple operations, electronic compass and altimeter, the screen and maps are gorgeous and the ability to buy a pre-programmed chip is brillant and cheaper than my first Garmin 45.

As mentioned, I am new to GPS handhelds and I found the 60CSx easy to navigate and to figure out the basics of its use. I was especially impressed with the speed at which it acquired a signal and the speed with which it drew its basemaps.Overall, however, I only give this unit a 2 stars due to having 2 separate units with a screen problem.

But then they sent the same unit back to me saying everything is normal with it.I found a do-it-yourself repair described on the internet. You can crack open the 60CSX case and apply dielectric (conductive) grease to the electrical connection that is known to be the failure point. Sure enough, this fixed the problem (but probably voided the warranty), though now after 9 months of using the device, the problem has returned.

It was an okay story, but I felt like I was reading something along the line of \\"See spot run. Dick threw the ball. Jane has a blue dress on.\\" It appeared to be written by someone who wasn't very intelligent or really was going totally for the laugh and trying to make us think the character was a ditz. It was entertaining, but read it when you really can't put much thought into what you are reading, because you don't need to concentrate to keep in tune with this book. I can imagine her working for the Letterman show, because even though, \\"you want some gum\\" - which Dave says is totally hilarious, it is really corny. It kind of falls along that line if you like that stuff. I do like Dave, but this book was pretty stupid. Okay, I will give you that it will make you laugh at how stupid the character is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pick it up.","review":"I am constantly looking for a good book about single life. Who isn't? Usually, I am extremely disappointed by books in this genre that promise way more than they can deliver. Not so with \\"Girls Poker Night\\". It reads well and is humorous, but not to the extent of being annoying. This has been one of the few novels aside from \\"Heartbreaker\\" and \\"Bridgette Jones\\" that actually delivers. Pick it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated It","review":"This book isn't worth your time to read. I have read a few other books that have identical themes. \\"Good In Bed\\" was an excellent book that I read before reading this book and it was 100 times better. It was poorly written and not very humorous. I had to struggle to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Boring, meandering story line and under developed characters. I did not find this book funny but instead just found it tedious. There were too many characters for the story line and none of them were interesting or had any depth. I found myself losing tack of who was who among the supporting characters, and I never get a real sense of who the main character was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and cool book","review":"This is the kind of I look for:quick, to the point, not too concern about that dreary, dreamy details such as wind blows and the color of the leaves (like many boring books). If you find most of Oprah's selections to be boring (except for \\"I know this much is true\\" and \\"Poisonwood Bible\\" :these are my favorite books), you will find this book refreshing and funny. Great for thirty something women like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Sorry, but this book just didn't do it for me. I would rather plumb deeper into Ruby's pysche (how her father's death has affected her life and relationships) in more detail, than to have little snippits here and there. The book just didn't flow - who really cares if Ruby and Michael get together - you don't get to know enough about them to care."},{"rating":"2","title":"charming and funny","review":"I really liked this book. It was easy to read and I laughed on every page. A real look at women and a glimpse in to the soul of one woman trying to figure out what's wrong in her life and how to move forward.Every situation is looked at through the eyes of a realist with just a little sarcasm, a little laughter, and hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story with a great twist","review":"Loved the story, loved the smart twist to Ruby's dilemma. This is an impressive, ultra witty debut. I read it in two days, started it while standing in a bookstore, read 5 short chapters and I was hooked. The characters are all great, but have more depth and complexity than other books in the same genre. I loved the combination of seriousness and humor. Just great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ruby Capote, you go girl !!!","review":"I loved it !!! I could totally relate, on oh so many levels. Just when you think you're the only gal on the block with these issues: trust, loss, and my favorite...self destructive tendencies, you're reassured. You're not.The sad parts made you cry and the humorous parts made you howl!!It was the perfect mix with a great message. Leap of faith, that's what life's about. We all need to be reminded of this.Take a chance, spin the wheel. You may be surprised!!!I know what all my sister-goddess'are getting for their birthday...this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One pathetic excuse for a book","review":"Why is this book getting so much praise??? It was a waste of money and time. I honestly tried to like this book but it just wasn't possible. I got half way through and stopped, and rarely have I done this with any book. I found it hard to follow, there were no chapters, instead there were entries of random ramblings and complaints about life. The characters were horrible, the writing was bad. Avoid this book at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"ughh....","review":"i had high expectations for this book. i just read the shopaholic series by sophie kisella and was really excited to get into the \\"chic lit\\" genera and was highly let down by this book. i am the type of person that i can't stand spending $ on a book that i don't finish so i forced myself to plug through the rest of this book. the book is written in such a way that you can't form a connection with any of the characters therefore you don't care what happens in the end. overall it was waste of my $5 and i'd give it no stars if i could."},{"rating":"1","title":"ridiculously overrated","review":"I'm stunned by the number of people who thought this book was good. The characters were superficial and bland (a selfish model -- shocking!, a \\"perfect\\" married woman in the Connecticut suburbs -- who'd have thought?!, a handsome editor -- no way!); and the poker nights were a contrivance for a group of girls to pick on each other. The writing was sophomoric if not amateurish. It seemed as if the author (or her editor) threw things in later on (Ruby's father's suicide) to make Ruby sympathetic or interesting. Lesson #1 of writing is show, don't tell. Jill Davis tells you what to think but it doesn't even make sense. I was bored from page 1, but since I was on a six-hour flight with nothing else to read, I plowed through it. Honestly, I'd have been better off sleeping."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel Cheated","review":"I was very disappointed. It's derivative, tries to be Bridget Jones and Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing -- but those felt fresh and had sympathetic heroines (this one's just perpetually dissatisfied and self absorbed). This also tries to be Sex in the City-ish, and that's just so old now. The characters are formulaic and cold and the book's written episodically so there's no character development. I had really high hopes for this book from the jacket and the author's bio but it's about four years too late for the whole girl-book thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"series of wisecracks masquerading as a book","review":"Be warned: I could not complete this book. It did not keep my interest.This review is based on the first half of the book.I bought it based on the reference to Bridget Jones on the back cover. The only thing GIRLS' POKER NIGHT shares with Bridget Jones is a female protagonist. Although Bridget Jones is written in a similar \\"diary\\"-style, it still manages to develop characters and build a plot. As a script for a comedy show, Girl's Poker Night works. It's not a book insomuch as it is a series of wisecracks, sometimes witty, sometimes contrived. If you like watching tv shows where unlikeable characters trade barbs and quick rejoinders, then this book is for you. If you're looking for \\"chick-lit\\" with character development and a plot, try Katie Fforde."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Summer read....","review":"After a particularly heinous week of watching the best weather we've had all year through the office window, I decided to relax with \\"Girls Poker Night\\" by Jill Davis. \\"Laugh out loud funny\\" said the review. Well, they all say that, dont' they? Skeptical but open-minded I settled in my beach chair and started to read. I laughed out loud! It was funny! Yes, it is a \\"chick book\\" but what is wrong with that?I have nothing but praise for GPN. It is definitely a laugh fun way to spend an afternoon. Buy the book. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really quick and entertaining read","review":"This is a good book. It has all the components to make up not want to put it down. It's funny, clever and relateable. Definitely an easy quick read that is perfect for the beach or a road trip ride. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fun but not lacking some insight","review":"this is just a fun, good story about a single girl and the private demons she must conquer to find some happiness in life. it isn't the best book ever written in the history of literature, but it is definitely good with a few poignant moments that makes it totally worthwhile. it's a fast-paced read that is good for lazy afternoons or long commutes to the office."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little depressing","review":"Parts of this book were funny but by the end I felt really depressed and i had a knot in my stomach. It's a sad view of the world and of dating, and I would not recommend it to anyone whose not already dating someone happily or is married. I don't think it is realistic really but it still depressed me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip Off!","review":"Not only is buying this book a rip off, but the so-called humor in it is too. There's a bit in there about the mayor changing the size label on his pants that sounds like it was ripped off from a Seinfield episode.Other than that this story jumps from one thought to the next with no real connection. The attempt at humor doesn't come through and you get the feeling that the writer is pasting together techniques or stories that have run elsewhere, as in Bridget Jones Diary, and Sex in the City. It's a bad attempt at both of those.It's only after a year of writing for her newspaper that one of Ruby's columns is put into the book. The main character only talks about her betting at the poker game near the end of the book after a year of these games. The author's unnerving habit of starting sentences with AND gritted on my nerves to no end.I read the whole book thinking that the ending had to be better then the rest of the book. I was disappointed. Don't waste your time or money on this read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Secret Life of girls ...","review":"The secret life of girls ... that's what I felt like I was reading. I loved this book. It was lots of fun and engaging and wickedly funny. The main charater is very spirited, and also rather introspective and completely genuine. Looking forward to novel number two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying too hard and not making it","review":"I agree with what some others here have said. . This book is TRYING to be Bridget Jones Diary or Sex and the City, but it isn't. I never cared about the characters. The plot was scatter shot. I had a difficult time gauging the flow of time throughout. The whole Girls Poker Night premise is given very brief attention. Over all I thought it was a forgetable book. Towards the end there are some really well written pieces, but not enough to salvage the whole. Over all, this wouldn't be a bad $1 bargain bin purchase if you needed something light for beach or plane reading, but I wouldn't spend money on it, nor would I pass it on to friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good things come in small books!","review":"I found this book and thought it would just be your typical guilty pleasure about the trials of a single \\"gal\\". Instead, what I got was a book with a great sense of timing, humor, sarcasm, and realism. Being newly single, in my mid-30's, I felt like some of the lines had been written about me. Like when Ruby laments, \\"I'm too old to not know who I am\\". I loved it and was sorry to see it end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick read","review":"I found myself laughing out loud while reading this book and I didn't even mind the strange looks I got! Davis does an excellent job intertwining humor throughout the story. Truly a captivating read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!!","review":"I just finished GPN for the 2nd time. I love Jill's book. It is witty and hard to put down. I was always wondering what her and her friends were doing next. I laughed and cried all at the same time. Her style is an easy read. The short chapters are great...they kept me interested, eventhough I have a very short attention span. (and little time to read for pleasure) I can't wait for her next book. It will surely be a bestseller. Girls Poker Night is a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't bother to finish reading this one...","review":"I started this book and was quite excited to read it. I was soon bored to tears and for the first time ever I didn't finish reading a book. If you're going to buy this... I'd go with a used copy and not spend a lot of money. It was disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"i expected more; more laughs, more poker","review":"I would think those who liked Bridget Jones and Sex And the City would NOT like this book. The VOICE of Ruby Capote was DRONE... ZZZZZZ. On the other hand, those who liked GIRLS GUIDE TO FISHING AND HUNTING should like this. Both seem to have the same cynical, unlikable, uninteresting voice. Sorry, had hoped for much more and I am an easy laugher... but this did not make me laugh at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Girl's Poker Night looked promising--a fun book with endorsements by some very respected authors. Yet it was extremely disappointing--the writing was mediocre and the plot was unoriginal and derivative. One of the endorsements described it as a cross between Bridget Jones and Sex and the City--it's not a cross, it's a duplication."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Girls' Poker Night is a fresh, funny slice of life that is unpredictable and insightful. I read it in less than 24 hours. Ms. Davis is a skillful driver as she takes us on a whirlwind of a ride and we chase the words across the page in an attempt to keep up. Good read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad book, baaaad book","review":"I'm an inveterate, compulsive reader. It's rare that I don't finish a book, but I couldn't finish this one. My biggest criticism would have to be the way it was written, as a series of tiny vignettes, loosely organized chronologically. It reminds me of one of the first papers I wrote in college: I had all this material on my index cards, ran out of time to organize it, and basically just put everything in chronological order and typed it up. That was good for an A- in history, but I expect more careful crafting in a published novel. Like other reviewers here, I found it hard to keep track of the characters because there was little to differentiate them, except for the buffoonish characterization of Skorka, the ESL model. If you want a light, amusing Chick Lit read, try Katie Fforde instead, but give this one a miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humourous look at commitment phobia","review":"Ruby Capote: single female humour columnist living in NYC and totally afraid of loving someone.

I've tried to read it three times, but I just can't seem to get going. The continual headers every two-three paragraphs are like tiresome stop signs-- they distract, interrupt, and ruin any sense of continuity. Annoying, and meaningless! Either this book has ADD, or the author is so used to writing brief TV skits that writing an entire flowing, cohesive chapter proved to be too much-- and pointing out that fact every two paragrpahs with a new little header is a turn off. It's a library book, so I may give it another try in a few months."},{"rating":"2","title":"good vacation read","review":"Enthusiastic Recommend: Girls' Poker Night by Jill DavisGirls' Poker Night is a quick, entertaining read with a kicker. It starts out with brash actions and a frivolous air. Ruby, a humor writer, pitches herself for a job in New York City. She wants out of her current life, including an escape from a boring boyfriend. She gets it.I found it funny right from the start, and was not put off by its apparently thin beginning. Then it solidified, became about something much more engaging and challenging than just a bunch of self-centered young women who are pretty entertaining. But it stayed funny. It was the best of both worlds for me. There was no guilt for reading something that was pure silliness. It made me ponder, but not despair. It made me laugh, but not in a senselessly brainless way. It's a good vacation read."},{"rating":"2","title":"meditative music with a lot more than just easy listening","review":"This is a lot more than just another meditation record.

The plates are sporadically placed throughout the book, and some species of birds are not illustrated. For example, what does a Greater Antillean Grackle look like? There is a brief description in the text, but will I be able to differentiate between it and a Great-tailed Grackle?There are no distribution maps either, so I have to rely on checklists printed from my Thayer's Birder's Diary program to determine which species to expect in, say, the Cayman Islands.I will be field testing this guide in May 2002 and may have a better feel for the usefulness, or lack thereof, of this book. Meanwhile, studying the birds prior to my trip is a bit cumbersome due to the design of this book. In any event, would recommend a North American supplement for any trip to the region."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of \\"Birds of the West Indies.\\"","review":"Unless one is collecting Peterson Field Guides, I do not recommend this book. Its organization is dated. Color plates are segregated from the bird descriptions. Many of the descriptions are accompanied by a black and white sketch. Some of the birds described lack any sketch or color plate. The book does not contain distribution maps. Redeeming aspects of the book are (1) it is small in size and (2) it includes a comprehensive list of species in the area with a written text for each."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"When I ordered this guide, I was expecting a format that was similar to the other Petersen bird guides. Unfortunately, this book is nowhere near as well organized. The plates are small, the artwork is not as good, and not all the species are illustrated. The text was also rather thin in life history information. If you are traveling to the Caribbean in winter and aren't up to speed on North American migratory singbirds, you will need to take an Eastern U.S. bird guide with you as well, as the numerous migrants that comprise the wintertime fauna are merely mentioned. I managed to identify most birds that I saw while using this guide, but it was a frustrating process."},{"rating":"2","title":"West Indy Birds","review":"Yea, The book could definently use some improvements, but overall the pictures did depict the birds pretty well. The only species illustrated {in color} are those endemic ONLY to the Carib islands. Any birds that are seen in the continental US are only given black and white drawings, and small descriptions. So a field guide and familiarity to eastern migratory birds are a plus! I am VERY dissapointed with the quality of the pages in the book. After a week in the Islands, mine looks worse than any of my regular guides! Bring a water-proof sleeve or something, because it's going to get wet! Not a bad book though, I had a lot of fun, and pretty much every bird you see tends to be a new species!

Superb cinematography, fine acting from a great British cast, slick writng and direction and a wonderful score from John Barry provide one of the best war films of all time.

The story of how a little over 100 men successfully defended a hastily re-enforced farmhouse & kraal, for a whole night, against some 4,000 Zulu warriors, is well known. This was Michael Caine's first movie & such a fine commencement to a wonderful career, must have made it difficult for him to improve on his maiden performance. His role of an inexperienced, unsure, upper-class young British officer is brilliantly under-played. Whilst an essentially unlikeable character, Caine makes the audience warm to him. His dislike of Chard (Stanley Baker) is slowly replaced by a grudging respect & the interplay between the two actors is a great study. Epic scale action that would be difficult to beat, plus fine parts played by those in the smaller roles. Worthy of particular mention is the wonderful character of the cucumber-cool Colour-Sargeant Major.

It's too bad because the quality of this DVD is terrible! The transfer was horrible (much worse than any VHS tape I've ever seen) and the picture actually freezes several times during the movie. The sound quality is no better. Zulu is a great movie that is begging to be done in a wide screen format, with home theatre sound support. My advice - Wait until someone releases a DVD version that does it justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blu-ray from Amazon.uk","review":"For others interested in saving a bit of money, I thought I'd mention that rather than buying the Blu-ray disk new from the Amazon.com market place, I ordered it from Amazon.uk. The cost was about $21.50 including shipping, which is about half what new copies are currently going for in the market place.It arrived in less than a week and appears to be the the same item listed here. It plays without problems on my US Panazonic Blu-ray player connected over HDMI to an HD TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic movie","review":"Zulu is arguably one of the best movies ever made. Stanley Baker and Michael Caine are the main stars in this true story. The main reason why I liked the film is because of the battle scenes. Furthermore, the character development was excellent and the acting by Caine, Baker as well as the extras playing as Zulu warriors were superb. In short, if you like war movies, this is a MUST buy but if you prefer romantic ones, stay clear of this.This DVD version is in widescreen format."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must See & Discuss film for all Mud Soldiers","review":"When I was in the Army, I was told to see this tape asap. It was good advice in that it tells one how to hold a piece of ground under very difficult terms. Its the closest one can get to understand how men can be made to fight and fight well under some really great leadership. The Widows Army was very lucky to have such men. It is a testimony to their training and leadership that such green troops performed so well. The Zulus are also shown in this movie as very worthy foes as they should be. (Cold Steel against Rifles!! That takes balls made of brass.)A timeless story that is well worth the time and money. As a sidebar this should be complimented with the Book \\"The Defense of Duffer's Drift\\" if you can find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"shooting party","review":"I've seen thse movie which became a bit boring after 30 min. It's a simple story of British who are defending a small fort against a big force of zulu warriors. The only thing which you see is massacre. It was quiet easy for the British to defead these warriors who were only equiped with spears and shields. You see British soldiers shooting and Zulus falling. So that's it : one big shooting party. The film glorifices the dominant British army which was in fact the agressor. It 's a good thing for history that big zulu impi (army) defeated the british at Isandlewana, which was the prequel of this massacre."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZULU","review":"This was another one sided attempt at promoting white/Europeon supremacy. I realize that the film is old and the screenwriter was not thinking of historical or political correctness, but of a \\"feel good\\" movie for white folks. As an African American, I feel it was degrading to Africans because it, as with most films, failed to properly develop the them as characters, human beings and most of all soldiers. Sadly another opportunity to tell a true story was missed, and the medium had its own message."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the origional: Edited out whole point","review":"This version of the movie misses the whole point.In the origional, Chaca Zulu allowes the British to withdraw.This was true to the origional history.The editor of this version apparently feels that the film was about blood and gore, and skips the withdrawel of the Zulu forces out of respect for the British defence.NOT TRUE TO FILM OR HISTORY.THIS VERSION IS FIT TO BE USED AS FRIZBY ONLY.!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"5 Star Film - No Star DVD","review":"This is my favourite film of all time. However if, like me, you are tempted to buy this DVD from the USA as it is unavailable in the UK - don't bother. The other negative reviews on this site are quite correct. The picture and sound quality compare to a cheap copy of an old VHS. If you love this film as I do, you'll be disappointed and frustrated.

The DVD might boast \\"fully restored and digital masters\\", and be the widescreen edition, but unfortunately the picture is badly pixelated and blurred so I have to wonder why they even bothered remastering it. It's not surprising the picture is bad considering that this is a single-sided, single-layer non anamorphic disc. There are also zero extras worth mentioning. Caveat Emptor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Film, Awful DVD","review":"An excellent film that I have seen many times on TV in widescreen. Unfortunately I bought it on DVD without checking it out first (that'll teach me). The main problem is the picture and sound quality which in DVD format I'd expect it to be better than video which this DVD certainly is not. It looks like it has been filmed with a cheap webcam infront of a TV. The moral of this text is don't waste your money on this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"This may not be it, but...","review":"...it's out there somewhere!

I love this film. The battle at Roarke's Drift is well deserving of its own movie and Zulu does it great justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thrilling showcase of bravery.","review":"Zulu was a very exciting and graphic war movie. It depicted the amazing battle of Rorke's Drift. In this battle, the Zulus decided to attack a battalion of 105 British soldiers. The reason was unclear, but it seemed that the attack was primarily for sport. The Zulus had over 4,000 warriors and were on their way home from the battle of Isandlwana. The British soldiers showed courage in the face of adversity, as they overcame 40 to 1 odds. This movie exemplified bravery, the likes of which very few people know about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great film, lousy DVD","review":"Oh dear. Next time I promise to read the reviews before buying.There's a reason this film is so cheap - the transfer to DVD is the worst I have ever seen! It's widescreen, but not animorphic, so most of the resolution of DVD is lost reproducing black bars at the top and bottom. Worse still is the sound quality. And then there's the constant judder - as if someone re-recorded it with a hald-held video camera!Worst of all though is the source of this transfer. It's clearly not from a good print of the film. Instead, it looks like it was taken from videotape. The picture quality was significantly worse than my own VHS copy, recorded on a budget VHS machine off the BBC several years ago!One word synopsis - avoid. Sooner or later someone will get around to doing a proper animorphic transfer of this classic war film from a decent print - maybe even throw in a 5.1 soundtrack and do a bit of cleaning and restoring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Film, Bad DVD","review":"The transfer is absolutely the pits. This DVD is pan-scan BTW. Looks like it was mastered from VHS without any regard to varying the sample rate. When there is a lot of movement on the screen, I.E. the battle scenes, digital artifacting is out of control. Search for this title on VHS; wish I had."},{"rating":"2","title":"A neglected and many times forgotten gem movie!","review":"Michael Caine became a true star with this tragic incident in which the Zulu warriors committed a massacre in 1879 on a British mission, The battle sequence is breathtaking and the cast was simply formidable.

Quick dispatch, shame about the product"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Film even with major inaccuracies","review":"There are numerous Reviews that tell us a great deal of the story of Rorke's Drift, and some detail a number of the film's careless historical handling of that epic event. One is the inclusion of the drunken Lutheran Missionary and his daughter, who were never there.It is a pity that the film fails to mention one of the real heroes of Rorke's Drift - the Padre. According to contemporary accounts, the Rev Smith was as inspiration as he ran from man to man, carrying ammunition, roaring encouragement and powerful biblical texts. Back in Britain, he was known as one of the heroes of Rorke's Drift, and was 'mentioned in despatches.'He became known as 'Ammunition Smith' because of the stirling work he did, handing out the ammunition. He was depicted as a very large, red-bearded man, slightly wild in appearance, in a painting of the seige."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zulu: Now my kids enjoy it","review":"OK, this is a guy flick. I was facinated by this tale a young teen and now my own son's, both in their teens enjoy it as much as I did. They even show it to friends who come over to \\"hang out\\" Why? They just don't make movies like this any more! A true epic tale. No detail nit-picking in this review, just a recommendation to pick this film up and start the popcorn."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a shame","review":"Purchased this DVD and discovered it had horrible skipping problems. After taking it back, Suncoast exchanged it for another copy which had the same problem. This disk will not play on the Toshiba SD-3109 dual tray player.The movie tells the story of a British engineering unit that gets surrounded by a Zulu army in Africa. Zulu is very accurate historically going so far as to show the need for the Zulu to close with short spears. With its fine acting it definitely is one of the better war movies available.I would suggest the reader to tape this one from the History channel or buy it on VHS."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an illegal DVD release !","review":"The copyright holders of this DVD edition of Zulu are traking the company who released this edition. No permission has been sought for publishing this edition. Legal action will commence soon.

Unfortunately, the soundtrack to this version is so faint that even when I turn the volume on my TV up all the way, I still have trouble hearing all the dialog is anyone else is making any noise in the room. I may try the Platinum Disc Corp. version and see if it's any better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zulu- A very enjoyable adventure","review":"Some war films are just plain boring, and others are way too graphic(personal opinions of course), but thank goodness that Zulu is neither of these. Based on actual events, this story of a British outpost surrounded by thousands of bloodthirsty warriors is beautifully filmed in the very picturesque, very deadly landscape of Africa. Stanley Baker, who helped produce the film, leads a cast of Britsh actors including first-time actor Michael Caine. Baker and Caine portray British officers who don't plan on leaving their position to the enemy, and in the process reenact one of the finest examples of military discipline in history. Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Historical Movie","review":"if you are a history or military buff you will like this one. This is one of Michael Caine's early movies, based on a true story, about a small British garrison in Africa that is about to be overrun by several thousand Zulu warriors. There were several British soldiers who won the Victoria Cross (Britain's highest honor for valor) during this action. You have to see how they do it. There have not been too many movies produced about this time and place in history and although you could argue a few minor points in the movie, overall it was very well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent film - historically accurate!","review":"This is one of the best films of its genre to come along in many a time. Well-produced, with very fine performances by Stanley Baker and Michael Caine in particular. It presents the defence of Rorke's Drift by a small detachment of British soldiers in a most historically accurate manner. An excellent addition to anyone's video collection. (Viewers might find it interesting to know that no less than eleven of the defenders, including the \\"slacker\\" Henry Hook, were recipients of the Victoria Cross, Britain's highest award \\"for conspicuous bravery ... in the presence of the enemy\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic, yet exciting","review":"This movie seemed to be a very realistic protrayal of the Battle at Rorke's Drift. The cinematography was spectacular for this movie's time. The fighting added much excitement to the film. The movie showed the British's fighting techniques accurately. I enjoyed watching the British soldiers face such overwhelming odds to become victorious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptable DVD Quality","review":"Zulu is one of my top ten favourite films, but this VCI DVD version is awful.

Everytime I see it again I think I'll be watching it for some favorite scenes, only to be - yep - still riveted to the TV. There are so many good actors in good roles with well-written scenes, so well directed and filmed that it would be pointless to try to list them. The film works on many levels, including an accurate depiction of the actual battle, a peek at a culture that has disappeared in its aboriginal form, filmmaking as storytelling, cultural conflict (in about half a dozen ways, actually), courage and survival, and on and on and on. It's absolutely spine-tingling in the battle scenes. This film has been #1 on my top 10 films list for decades."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie!","review":"First, let me stress this: Buy the MGM release! All others are pan and scan public domain and do not do justice to this magnificent movie.Over 200 people have already had their say, and I have nothing very different. This is a fun, exciting, and deeply moving movie experience. An interesting sidelight is that it's one of Jack Hawkins last roles with someone else doing his voice--due to cancer. And it's the first major role for Michael Caine who does an incredible job of leaving all traces of his Cockney origins behind. If you already have an inferior pan and scan DVD, replace it. You'll be glad when you get that flat widescreen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A small pocket of History","review":"One of the great action/adventure films of all time, Zulu has the advantage of being inspired by an actual incident in British Colonial history.

The direction is timeless, it feels modern enough to have just been made. The film's constant anti-war polemic falls on deaf eyes, at least with me. There's also a confusing bit where Baker demands to know why Caine can't identify the bodies of his men after the hospital fire. Does Caine retort with the guy's name as in \\"Chard, give me a break?\\" or is he saying \\"I can't identify them because they're charred\\"? Hey, I'm a pedant, okay? These sort of details keep me awake at night. That and the Doodlebugs. I'm also puzzled as to why chief Buthelezi would have agreed to take part in a film where his boys get rather a comprehensive drubbing, but perhaps they needed the spear change. I said...<hole opens in floor>"},{"rating":"1","title":"Half fiction, porn, action","review":"A lot of the film is Hollywood dream. It's based on the facts of an astounding British victory, distorted for entertainment's sake. The real life minister at whose station the battle took place, was nothing like the psycho in the movie, with a noble, attractive daughter; who actually was two years old at the time, and no where near the battle. Early in the film there is a long scene of massed Zulus dancing, nearly naked, males and females; accurate, but porn. The scenes of Zulus and Red Coats battling were good. The actual facts are easily obtainable by Googling the battle of Rorke's Drift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superb movie... but wait for a higher quality DVD","review":"I am an avid fan of this classic movie. The quality of the DVD's production though, is nothing short of abysmal. The picture often freezes or becomes heavily pixelated.

I remember listening to this as a child and listening to it all over again has brought all those memories back again. In absolute terms John Denver does not have the greatest voice in the world, but there is just something very appealing about this collection and there is no doubt that he was a talented songwriter - \\"Apenglow\\" is a beautiful song, and like \\"A baby just like you\\", is a Denver original. The others are good interpretations of a blend of Christmas favourites, traditionals (and in this regard, \\"What Child is This\\" and \\"Coventry Carol\\" are particularly touching) and others (\\"Christmas for Coyboys\\"). An added bonus is that other than the two extra tracks (which are quite poorly recorded - \\"Jingle Bells\\" almost unlistenably so), the quality of the original masters is generally high."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album finally receives CD justice!","review":"John Denver's 1975 Christmas album is one of those \\"feel good\\" collections for which he was famous. It has finally received its due, having NOT been mastered from whatever old production masters were lying around the BMG vault, and the sound quality bears this out. Besides the usual songs and carols, this album features several Denver originals, like \\"Christmas for Cowboys\\" and \\"A Baby Just Like You,\\" which were released as singles. This is a must-have for anyone who enjoyed John Denver's music when it was popular, and will probably win over a few converts as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE ROCKIES CAN BE!!!","review":"This CD is a must for anyone collecting beautiful holiday music and John Denver's voice and songs are breath-taking here.

In other words, if you decide to skip ahead to track #6 (\\"Christmas For Cowboys\\"), you'll miss the first three seconds of the song. This is because those three seconds appear at the end of track #5.This appears to be a disc mastering error. I tried playing this CD in several players - with the same result.

All of the songs are so lovely, even the silly \\"Please, Daddy Don't Get Drunk This Christmas\\". But my very favorite song is \\"Christmas For Cowboys\\".

The way it's delivered, it sounds almost autobiographical, and it sure is a song to make a person think.His original, \\"A Child Like You\\", is a real standout.

I am happy with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfort and support at a fair price.","review":"It is so hard to find a comfortable good supporting bra, let alone at a reasonable price. I think it is outrageous that most bras in the larger sizes cost over $35 each. They just do not last long enough to make that a fair price. Also, even Playtex bras, are not as well made as they used to be. That being said, this is a very good support bra for the well endowed figure and it is comfortable all day. I even sleep in my old ones. I highly recommend this bra."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to adjust straps","review":"I'm still looking for a well-fitting bra.

All sorts of mushing and pressing very uncomfortable. Even through the shirt, you can tell it's the cone shaped cup comes to a pointy end. what is this? 1984 madonna bra?? The straps create bulge in the back, also unflattering. I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A whole lot of bra!","review":"This bra is made of industrial strength elastic and I agree with another reviewer who said the sizes are inconsistent. Another reviewer mentioned how pointy the cups are--I agree with that also. Makes me look like one of those women in an old Perry Mason episode with breasts which look like weapons. In any case, it reminds me of a bra from the 40s or 50s when bras and panties and girdles and underwear were called \\"foundations.\\" It will outlast me and go to my heirs, I'm sure. I bought the black one which is very stiff (even after washing) and it's so heavy and thick it feels like I'm wearing another shirt.

I am so disappointed. The fit is terrible and not true to size (incredibly small) and the fabric is a scratchy mess. I had bulges coming out in places I never knew I had. I did wear the bra for several hours, hoping that it would maybe relax a bit, but after four hours, the straps just dug into my shoulders causing more uncomfortableness. I really wanted to like this bra, but I can't. I would take the bra back, but because it's unsanitary to return a bra, it's getting thrown in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this!","review":"Don't waste your money.

Wow, it definitely supports them, and they'd better not ask questions!!!I went around all day feeling like my boobs were 'out there', well-managed, and not going anyplace.It's not something I'd buy again - it's just a bit too uncomfortable - like they were stitched from the same material used to make backpacks, but the one I have will probably last a good while.2 stars because it is indeed well-constructed. SOMEBODY at Playtex said, by golly, I wanna design a bra that MEANS it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable","review":"I really wanted to like this bra as it is very pretty.

It's just not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Supportive, Pretty- Some Caveats","review":"I have always struggled with finding a good bra since I have a larger chest size. This bra is great. It is very supportive throughout the day, no sagging. The straps don't slip. Two caveats: It can make your breasts look a little pointy and smaller. I'm in my early thirties with a baby, so I'm past caring that my breasts look a little smaller and less round. I want support and comfort! It's still a pretty bra, though. Also, it is a little tight and leaves marks, but again, with looser bras, I didn't get the support, so I'll accept the trade off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Playtex is a good brand to buy","review":"I have purchased a lot of Playtex products in the past which is why I ordered this bra.

The material is smooth enough to wear under most clothes if you don't wear anything that's too tight. My only complaint, and I have this problem with most bras, is that I don't think they can get by calling it an \\"18-hour\\" bra. Every bra I wear, and I've experimented with different sizes, seems to eventually ride up in the back and sag in the front. It's like I either have to wear more than one or change half way through the day. For the price though, it is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"It SMELLS!","review":"This bra reeks. It smelled bad when I opened it and the smell gets worse after each wash. According to many other reviews on other sites it's because there is rubber in the bra.

They also create a very unattractive cone shape once you try to put a shirt over the bra.

This is the only bra that I have experienced this \\"overage\\" with. I went down a cup size and it did not make a difference ... I just could not get this bra to fit me.I've tried several washes (even drying on hot) to see if a little shrinkage would help. No go. What I am left with is a relatively comfortable bra around the back and shoulders with a cup that has too much fabric in the front and is too pointy for me. Usually not a problem. Unfortunately, this bra has been relegated to the bottom of my drawer and is only used under multiple layers where any kind of wrinkles or gathered material won't be visible. I'm glad I only paid around $10 for it.Two tries though and it still didn't work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"product perfect","review":"bras were very well made.

It's supportive AND comfortable and when the straps are adjusted - they fit just right and do not have to fixed during the day - they stay put.

It is so sad how a star of this magnitude is overlooked & cut very short. Langdon is this example. Even Harold Lloyd tried helping his career, so he had some great pals helping him.In the DVD it is said that Chaplin had one star that intimidated him;it was Langdon. That's how strong a star he was.For Langdson afficionados, I was impressed of films I've tried to see for 40 years but was never recovered, here in this package INCLUDING an 'infomercial' for GOODRICH tires that was never put in his filmography till now. The commentaries were excellent,except for one who got so technical about film stock that it was boring(HIS FIRST FLAME).At least his son, Harry Langdon, the famous LA photographer is doing well.

If I could make it less than 1 star I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is the worse printer ever owned.","review":"To be honest, this printer sucks. First of all, if you run out of colour ink, you can't print black. Besides that colour ink seems to disappear out of thin air very, very fast. Another problem I encountered was the bad alignment. Lots of time colours aren't aligned. At the start I could fix it very easily with just rebooting the printer or resetting it. But after sometimes it just doesn't come back, specially the magenta colour. Another big problem I have with this printer is the price of the toner, it's very expensive. Simply it isn't worth it, the toners are expensive and run out really fast and you will waste lots of paper with bad aligned printing."},{"rating":"1","title":"HP 2600n","review":"This printer is a primary network printer.

This error is famous as several forums exist to attempt and hack both the Windows spooler and the HP 2600n. Fought this problem for two solid days with Tech calls, internet chats and promises of return calls with a solution. I have yet to hear from either group.

Unfortunately for me it is off warranty.Although some reviews say the 25600n has a lifetime fuser...don't believe it. I've cleaned it numerous times and changed toner cartridges to no avail. Also, HP's on-line tech support chat does not support the 2600n...so if you happen to be past warranty you need to pay $39 just to get to speak to tech support. Bottom line...the $129 for the \\"lifetime\\" fuser and the time to change it is not worth it for a $325 printer. Try something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great-IF You love wasting paper, ink, and money.","review":"I suppose its my own fault for taking so many chances with HP Printers. The one I use at home installed drivers that were incompatible - nay ruined my ability to print at work. Another wouldnt let you print if the toner cartridge was half full, and this one isnt much different...Biggest Problems: Goes through toner exceptionally fast. Probably because it leaves streaks on most glossy pages and many things have to be printed twice. The Manual Feed Tray works roughly 30% of the time- Usually it takes in the avery sheets and instead of printing onto the labels, it kindly prints them on normal paper and cycles my label sheet through the machine - coming out blank. At least this helps to get rid of the $100+ ink cartridges i bought though. Oh yeah that's per cartridge...and I think HP says OEM/3rd party voids the warranty. They also come a quarter filled when you buy this machine. I could go on...Don't be suckered into buying HP Printers.

I was worried before ordering that this copier would be slow, but it delivers copies quickly and then shuts down to a \\"quiet mode\\" (power saver) after a short while. For a small business - at home - I could not ask for a better color laser printer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This product has been a joke","review":"Our office has utilized 2 of these in the 12 years we've been in business and although they print a little dark, they do pretty well. After an identical model started producing unacceptable quality, I purchased this used machine thinking I would be able to use all the unopened ink cartridges still in stock. Within a month or two of receiving this, the color has become absolutely washed out, maintenance hasn't helped, new expensive cartridges haven't helped and I'm about ready to throw this thing in the trash. Just love these beautiful experiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cartridges WAY too expensive","review":"I bought this printer to use for my business printers flyers. Color is great, however, shortly after purchase I started getting a line in the prints. Turns out the cyan cartridge was bad. Took a printer repair person to figure this out at a serious cost and then they wanted to charge me a full price for a used cartridge.When I needed to replace the cartridges, it turns out they can't be refilled and the cost of a new set is about a 1/3 of the price of the printer. Should have bought something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Satisified","review":"This printer was sold to me as a used item, but the merchant didn't deliver the cartrdiges calaiming that it would make shipment heavier and it would cost him a lot more money to ship therefore \\"as he claims\\"he dumped them in the trash , knowing that the cartidges for this particular printer cost alot more than than printer almost $ 450.00. He asked moe to write him a nice review and he would credit my account $ 50.00 if I do so, but I prefer to say the truth and lose the $ 50.00."},{"rating":"1","title":"These printers are junk!!!!","review":"I had one of these because I got a good price on it and wasn't interested in speed at the time. They are definately slow but I could afford it and had always wanted a colored laser printer for minimal use....well I got minimal use. I'm not sure that the printer even lasted a year and it is now in the dumpster. They have a known problem with shadowing problems and of course that is what happened to mine. HP is a fantastic brand and I will buy another one but I'll guarantee you that it won't be this model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Color laser 2600n","review":"This is a wonderful printer I have not had the opportunity to really take it through it paces yet. It is tall, large and heavy though. So, make certain that you have a good sturdy spot for it. Nice open paper path. Installs on the network in a snap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jams constantly!","review":"I've had this printer for about 2 weeks and have been using it heavily... with great frustration. The printer jams constantly... to the point that I consider it to be unusable. I am now shopping for a new color laser printer. In addition, after just a couple days I had already used 25% of my black toner.Update: I've been limping along with this printer, hoping to use it at least until I run out of ink... clearing jams every page or 2... However now the printer feeds the paper in at an angle, bending and ripping the paper as it passes through. So now I can't use it at all. Don't buy this printer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cost of cartridges HIGHWAY ROBBERY!","review":"This may be a good laser printer, but the very high cost of these cartridges (a set of four costs MORE than the printer itself!!!) negates everything else about this specific printer. What a grand RIPOFF! Next, they'll be charging us '3 figures' AND your 'first-born' for a cartridge!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good One","review":"Printer made a rattling/hammering sound most times when I hit the Print button; sometimes even had to turn it off to stop the action.Color quality just OK on paper prints, but on photos was terrible, whether on glossy or matte paper. Color smeared on both front and back of photo paper, which jammed in the machine about half the time.Be careful ordering this from Amazon; they use a no-name shipper instead of UPS, Fedex, or USPS - shipper used snail-mail to contact me, and setting up delivery was inconvenient since I live 50 miles from their nearest location."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 stars?! You got to be kidding.","review":"I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS MACHINE!!!I just can't believe 36 people gave 5 stars. They must be associated with HP! I started having a problem with line on a copy and talk to technician which cost me $36 even my problem is not solved. Also you have to have all inks in order to print black copy.I realized this after I bought 2 color inks replaced, knowing this line not going to be removed I don't want to invest another $90.00 for one more color ink. I went to internet to search this problem I realized so many people purchased this machine having same problem. Now it's sitting in my office just collecting dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for pictures or Photos","review":"The printer leaves gray banding on glossy paper. even HP brand laser paper. The resolution and color are ok but this printer falls way short of the 2550 printer before it. Do not buy if you will be printing photos or brochures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor paper handling","review":"I've just had to return this printer due to its constant failure to feed paper correctly. The paper either fails to feed up from the tray or jams half-way through printing. This was already a replacement printer for another with similar problems so I think it's either a design flaw or a bad batch. The type of paper doesn't make a difference - light grade through heavy presentation types all jam in exactly the same way.On the plus side, when it does print the quality is outstanding. I may have just been unlucky twice in a row, but the mechanical problems mean that I can't recommend this printer."},{"rating":"2","title":"really nice printer","review":"the text is crisp and the graphics is crisp... i can't ask for more... maybe just that the printer can include the 4000 page toner instead of the 2000 one... but oh well.if you have paper jam all the time, it could be due to the orange thingy in the paper tray.... i don't know why but i don't see any paper in the package saying that the orange thingy should be removed. so i had paper jam all the time. after i suspect that the orange things are all supposed to be \\"pulled out\\", then i removed it and then no more paper jam any more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great foaming hand soap","review":"I have very sensitive hands and this is the only hand soap that doesn't irritate my skin.I like the newly designed bottle and the foam makes my skin feel softer than the liquid variety.I'd highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got five bottles - paid for six.","review":"Paid for six bottles, only received five as one spilled in box.

I also was annoyed with having to pump and pump to get my (admittedly large) hands soapy enough to clean. It didn't really seem much better than any generic soap.Recently Method started using a video of a naked woman in a shower being degraded by soap bubbles to sell their products in general and claiming that people who don't like the ad just don't get that portraying the humiliation of a woman for laughs is a great way to sell cleaning products to women. So I'm not going to buy any more Method. I recommend Dr. Bronners if you're looking for a sweet smelling, chemical free, sexism free hand soap."},{"rating":"1","title":"why so expensive?","review":"I'm happy to have a safe, natural alternative, but what's with the price?? $24 comes out to $4 bottle.. they're $3 for a 10oz bottle at Target, and that's not even on sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good feeling","review":"The green tea smell good and no more waste soap, makes my hands and soul feels very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soap Itself is Nice, but Yet Another Shipping Problem","review":"The soap itself is great, but I see that I'm not the only person to get a sopping wet shipping box with at least one now-empty bottle inside. It's not worth the hassle of sending it back to deal with, so I recommend just not buying it (from Amazon) in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"First time I tried a Method product.","review":"This is an excellent product. I purchased this product three months ago and have found that it does not dry out my hands. Also, the real surprise was how long one bottle lasts.

I was so glad to find it online at a good price."},{"rating":"1","title":"The pump is terrible.","review":"I've heard foaming hand soap is more economical and eco-friendly, however, the Method Foaming Hand Soap bottles do not last long and therefore, the buying a refill for the pump is pointless. I have a pair of hand pumps that have not lasted past 2 refills because the pump is not sturdy. It is unclear why they break, it seems that after refilling them the second time, they no longer work and while soap comes out, it isn't foamy. I'm not certain if this then is wasting the soap or what. The soap works great and I still have a large refill container but as soon as the pump is out, I'm going to buy a different brand for the pump but continue using the soap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"If you love the Blue Collar guys, you will love this movie.

So I went and got the red neck tape for him, he being a Red Neck and all. (Blue Collar Comedy Tour: The movie). We just laught at eachothers jokes. It was a fun night for both of us and you can injoy it also.

It is worth every penny and then some to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely hilarious!","review":"I'm not a big fan of comedian type shows, not that I don't have a sense of humor, I'm usually just too busy to sit and watch someone swearing non-stop, thinking that's supposed to be funny. It's not. This DVD, however, had me in tears I was laughing so hard! These four guys are, by far, the funniest men I've seen since Robin Williams' comedy days. Each does their own stand up routine, and they're all absolutely fantastic. They culminate the act with all four telling stories together on the stage, real life, not a single swear word in the thing, just good clean comedy. If you're in need of a good laugh, from way deep in your belly to bring honest to goodness tears to your eyes, you have to get this DVD! Just fabulous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Hilarious","review":"I went into this movie with low expectations. I mean, I like Jeff Foxworthy as much as the next guy, but I was uncertain that I could sit through over an hour and a half of similar material.I was totally unprepared. This is the funniest thing I've watched in a long, long time.The format is that each of the comics takes the stage individually, with a little comical short between. I could take or leave the shorts, but the stage comedy was hilarious. After each comic takes the stage, all four come out and joke around, joke on each other, and play off of each others' routines.I just can't say any more. My wife and I laughed for the whole hour and a half, and the jokes are still running through my head. This is a definite must-see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!!!","review":"I love this DVD!!! I can't get enough of it. I was skeptical because I am not a big fan of Foxworthy's redneck jokes, but was pleasently suprised by this tour. I just watched this for the fourth time and my face still hurts from laughing so hard. Definitely recommend this. It is hilarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeff and friends rule","review":"A blast all the way. My first introduction to Bill Engvall, Ron White and Larry the Cable Guy after listening to Jeff Foxworthy on CD for some time. The comedy tour is going like a runaway train and each of the four guys is leaving me gasping for breath from laughing. Each has a very recognizable and personal style yet they are great, apart as well as together. Very glad to have bought both this title and the sequel, for they really help me put a stressfull day from my mind. Watching for 5 or 10 minutes and my worries are gone, thanks to these guys. A big thumbs up and worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept us laughing through the Blizzard","review":"Loved this DVD Pack!! We were one of those who were caught in the Colorado Blizzard, fortunately we had brought this DVD along with a Jeff Dunham DVD (absolutely hysterical)!

It is abetter deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Fun for a Change","review":"Although these four are mostly 'southern' comedy, they are four distinctly different types of comedians. Laugh out loud funny with very little 'crude' content proving you don't have to use the 'F' word to be a comedian. This is the first time I had ever seen Ron White, but he had me rolling.

I have watched this several times since each time I hear something I missed because I was laughing to hard to hear it the time before. This should come with an advisory not to eat or drink or even expect to breathe for long periods of time. I would recommend a trip to the bathroom before you start this movie also. And be warned you will be prone to fits of laughing as you think back of bits in the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Stuff","review":"I loved this movie.

This is possibly the worst comedy of all time and that is saying something because there are a lot of bad comedians but i think these for geniuses are the worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"blue collar tour 3 pack","review":"I purchased this after catching glimpses of it at a someone's home. I purchased it to find out this one is slightly different and not as funny as I expected. Be careful before you purchase it.

Good Luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's the deal?","review":"I had to give this 5 stars because it's one laugh after another and there wasn't one joke told that wasn't funny on some level.

Why is the release date in Feb? Is this a Special Edition?This IS humor for everyone and a must have DVD for the comedic minded."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is what it is","review":"This comedy special is lowbrow humor that I think is hilarious.

Seriously this is a funny movie. They took material from their tours and edited to make a movie. I enjoyed their stand-up routines. If you enjoy their comedy you should certainly enjoy the movie. Includes a few scenes of them interviewing people on the street. The DVD quality is good and it has fair replayability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the DECADE","review":"Undoubtably the funniest and most entertaining DVD of our time. This is a MUST for anyone with a sense of humor; hell, if you don't have a sense of humor, you will after watching Blue Collar Comedy Tour.

FANTASTIC!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Uproariously funny... but-","review":"What everyone says is true. This is absolutely hilarious. However, I don't agree that it is totally clean and has no cuss words. They are there, I guess you're just laughing too hard to notice them.

It's great fun, but definitely an adult film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahhh!

My husband had heard Ron White on 92KQRS and really wanted to see him on stage. I was unable to get tickets. Instead I bought him this DVD. It was SO funny that since then I have also bought Larry the Cable Guy's CD and new DVD, Ron White's CD, and a DVD and CD from Jeff Foxworthy! I would reccomend this to all of my friends. It is funny enough to watch over and over again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame Stereo-Types & Lamer Catch Phrases","review":"This collection of corny humor was hard for me to watch.It's a rehashing of old \\"Hee-Haw\\" material with the performers using cheesy red neck stereo types and catch phrases.I know they have their fans,but you can never under estimate the public's need for the familiar, (Git R Done,Here's Your Sign,You Might Be A Red Neck.....ad nauseum) Not for me. I prefer my comedy to be funny.This is hillbilly humor at it's lamest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I bought it after reading good reviews but the movie sucked.Out of 90 odd minutes only few jokes were good.Watch a standup comedy of Sienfeld like last man standing.

Stupid, mundane comedy void of intelligence coupled with ignorant red-neck jargon.

I bought this on the basis of the reviews here and it turned out to be rude and crude (although I did like the fart sequence). Much of the material is sexual in nature, I was embarrased to have my 11 yr. old watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Stupid Can You Be??","review":"This is far and away the dumbest thing that I have ever seen. I didn't find the jokes funny, the comedians can't even speak real English and the whole thing is way overrated. This is racist as well. I really don't think jokes about NASCAR (which is not a sport by the way) , how crappy their famliy is, are very funny. In fact it is downright stupid. Redneck comedy needs to curl up and die. The only thing this had going for it is that it was at least better then Rodney Carrington...WORST COMEDIAN EVER! ALthough, Larry(I can't speak properly) the Cable Guy comes a close second. There are hundreds of things funnier than this. Like being shot. Anyway, if you are looking for something funnny, go somewhere else and leave this to all the dumb rednecks.I gave this one star because there wasn't an option for none."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't get it!!","review":"I'm a huge fan of Stand up comedy!! And this comedy show stinks. Or maybe I just don't get hill billy humor. I laughed 2 or 3 times through the entire show. What a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only there was widescreen......","review":"Yes the only complaint I have about this release is that it's not in widescreen! They've shown this movie in widescreen in HD on HBO so there is a widescreen print to use but oh well. I can always hope for a future release. The movie itself is fantastic, always providing plenty of laughs with every viewing. While it's no Ernest Goes to Camp, it's still a great film in and of itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fat people are PEOPLE first!","review":"With obesity being so targeted, it's refreshing to watch a film that shows that heavyweights are real people. Yes, a healthy life style is good--but loving and valuing people is important.

It took 2 weeks to get it. 1 week is acceptable. 2 weeks is ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Exercise in Delusion","review":"The only remotely good thing in this movie is Ben Stiller, whose parody of an infomercial health nut is very funny and fresh and well-done. The rest of the movie is absurd. The message seems to be that fat kids may be different and ostracized, but they should learn to accept their lot in life, and it's ultimately okay because they are better and smarter than \\"normal\\" people anyway. Someone who is not fat is not intelligent and is invariably a jerk. At least among men; women are never truly explored. The movie also teaches that if someone is a mean jerk it is acceptable to injure and capture them and hold them in an electrified cell for weeks. Because he is exposed as a mean jerk at the end, there are no legal repurcussions. Also absurd is the fat kids' complete obsession with food, a desire that goes beyond sexual ... man, what a goofy movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ben Stiller is the only redeeming thing about this movie","review":"This is one of the worst things I've ever seen. Not only is it unintelligent and unfunny(except for some of Ben Stiller's scenes) it's unrealistic and immoral. The message of the movie seems to be that overweight people are better than everyone else. The camp full of kids who are healthy are portrayed as idiots. They lose the final challenge at the end based on the fact that the healthy kids don't know history or math. What does being overweight have to do with intelligence? Are fat kids smarter because they don't go outside much and are forced to study? The movie is perpetuating stereotypes like \\"fat kids love eating\\". They have a veritable orgy of excess when they take over the camp, covering themselves in chocolate syrup and honey. It's supposed to be funny but it's just stupid. Trust me, stay away from this movie. It's a cliched horrible mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"The movie was great. Played all the way through with no problems. Packaging was good and received fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavyweights","review":"This has been my children's favorite movie for many years.

I first saw it around the age of 7 and I still love it 13 years later. Ben Stiller skyrockets his career here in a must see movie. I believe all parts of this movie are on YouTube if you want to check it out there first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny family comedy for any age","review":"Better than I expected. It was pretty funny. It wouldn't have been good without Ben Stiller. I think its good for kids but Ben Stiller still makes it funny for adults. If you liked Stiller's character in Dodgeball then you'll love his character in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Funny, Feel Good Movie.","review":"Great movie, it's a classic in my book. The story takes place at a weight-loss aka \\"fat camp\\" called Camp Hope. After the owners (including Jerry Stiller) go bankrupt, they are forced to sell the camp to someone else. The new owner (Ben Stiller), who definitely has a few screws loose, runs it like a boot camp while shooting a summer-long infomercial. The campers (and many counselors) devote the rest of the summer to trying to defeat him --while making sure they eat their fair share of Twinkies and fast food! Great cast, Ben Stiller is hilarious! Funny for all ages!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favs of all time!!!","review":"If you haven't seen Heavyweights, GET IT!!!!!!!!!! It is one of the first films that Ben Stiller was in, which i think is the best part of the movie as he plays Tony. Another fav of mine has to be Lars who is one of the camp counselers. He has so many funny lines. I think that the movie is way underated b/c of the plot which is kids going to a \\"fat camp\\". it's hilarious, trust me!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"The DVD came very fast and works great.

The commodification of the Tiny Tim character was saddening. I understand that Death is not an easy subject to deal with, particularly with young audiences. But to reduce the character to \\"I'm very thoughtful, but am entirely satisfied by pointless consumer goods\\" is ridiculous. There must have been some other way to deal with that aspect of the story. After all, Dickens was arguing for humanity and the importance of relationships over material. This movie seems keen to cash in on a piece of Christmas tradition, while grossly distorting it. My children will not be watching this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bah Humduck!

Published on, roughly, the 50th anniversary of the disaster, Stein presents a story of young immigrant girls standing up against sweatshop atrocities, only to find themselves, in the case of the girls laboring at the Triangle Shirtwaist factory, pushed further down. The account of the disaster is appropriately harrowing.William Greider's introduction, although occassionally heavy-handed, makes the reader wonder how much things have improved now that we are almost marking the 100th anniversary of that awful day.Also, it would be worthwhile to read this in conjunction with David von Driehle's superb \\"Triangle: The Fire that Changed America\\".Rocco Dormarunno, author of \\"The Five Points\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harmonic Balancer was perfect....","review":"got part for 1/3 of the dealer cost and it worked perfect for my 97 infiniti i30t.

But the revelation was the mature, offhandedly naturalistic and charmingly authentic performance of Alice Ziolkoski. She will soon be a beauty but as of this performance she has already arrived as a performer of emotional honesty. Notice how much more information and emotional resonance the viewer draws from her eyes, demeanor and tone. She conveys so much more than the literal meaning of the lines she says. In this way she reminds me of Rachel McAdams, another actress who uses the spaces between lines to layer meaning into a performance.

No. They neglected to tell us where it is and how to get it. the next level is the first level in which the revolver is important.

I'd donate this to Goodwill, but it seems unfair for someone else to be duped into buying this suckular movie.I've seen and enjoyed \\"Wet Hot American Summer,\\" so I thought that this film from David Wain would deliver..nope. The final scene is an absurd musical recap of the disjointed sketches. The finale just didn't work. I thought for certain that this was originally a musical/play penned by the writers, and adapted unsuccessfully into a film--I wanted desperately to think that this was not the intended product. Nope.Skip this movie. Charlton Heston's Moses made me laugh more than this wannabe religious satire. I wish I could get back the 96 minutes that I spent on this film and go to church instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Struggle to Watch","review":"I don't know how this movie got so many five stars. Like another reviewer said, it does not even deserve one star, but you are forced to give it that much.

The sketches are not all winners but the great ones have Liev Schreiber bringing his AMAZING talent to a crazy situation, Rob Cordry as a lovable rapist and a great great \\"foreign\\" film. It's pretty hilarious.This movie is no Wet Hot American Summer--but what is? There are some AMAZING parts of it and Paul Rudd has a great through line and continues to impress. Some great walk-ons and some great freakouts. I highly recommend it if you like The State."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Funny - If It's Your Thing","review":"Look, I can understand this isn't everyone's type of humor, but it should be. It's absurdly hilarious. Not all the sketches are equally funny, but they add up to being almost as good as Wet Hot. If you liked Wet Hot, and you should, then you'll like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and random fun","review":"This movie starts out completely hilarious. For the first 2 mini movies I couldn't stop laughing. But the movie kind of plateaued towards the middle. In the sketch \\"Thou shall not murder,\\" I was a bit frustrated and uneasy, as well as \\"Thou shall not covet thy neighbors wife.\\" Basically all of the ones involving the doctor were hard to watch. But other than the doctor sketches, the movie is extremely funny and very random. In every single sketch, you get thrown a curveball that you never expected, but yet is very funny. The movie seemed loosely organized, but all of the stories are tied together in their own way. Definitely a movie that everyone must see at least once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever","review":"Probably the worst movie I have ever seen. Not funny at all. Just to cringe at. Thank God it is over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smarmy and painfully unfunny","review":"I normally am not moved to type out a review of a movie, but after having watched the first 15 or so minutes of this P.O.S., I felt compelled to render an opinion. I don't think I've seen a movie that went to such lengths to hit its audience over the head with how witty it was, when in fact it really wasn't at all humorous or clever.

None of the sketches based on each of the Ten Commandments were funny or coherent. The acting, the writing, direction, and production values were amateurous to the point of being like a cheap 70's tv movie-of-the-week. The most embarrassing segment is when Winona Ryder's character gets the hots for a ventriloquist's dummy and she steals it to have sex with it. It was very painful to watch. Overall, a total waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious...couldn't stop laughing.","review":"This movie was really funny.

I thought it was gonna be one of the movies that gets under the limelight but is absolutely hilarious. It wasn't. Nothing about it did it for me. I really disappointed.

This is a relatively easy product to steam with a powerful, standard size steamer. It took forever to get out one prominent crease that the dress acquired in transit from the store to my house. The word \\"pro\\" should not be in the product description at all.On the plus size, it is very tiny, and will fit easily in a carry-on bag.

It's actually manufactured by Conair now.It doesn't get the job done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes too long to use","review":"The unit does eventually steam but it didn't take out the wrinkles until I had a full reservoir and spent a long long time removing wrinkles. After the garmnent cooled I could still see some of the wrinkles. I believe it will work but only after spending a lengthy time working on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average-Performing Travel Steamer","review":"I've used this steamer about 20 times now. It removes wrinkles but only after firmly tugging on the garment while steaming and repeatedly running the steamer over the same area. Also it drips water on garments and offers continous steam for about 5-7 minutes due to its compact size. Although, it still beats ironing for small jobs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great steamer","review":"This steamer leaks hot water on your hands while steaming garments...it has a warning to keep it horizontal but that's almost impossible to do. Not great steam output, but better than nothing, though not much."},{"rating":"2","title":"good travel steamer","review":"I had a steamer I loved for years that is no longer made so I purchased this one. The best part of the steamer is that it is compact and easy to pack. While it works well, the steam is continuous once it heats vs. the other steamer which had a button to push to release the steam.

It's a bit light, however, on theory. The case examples can be a bit tedious at times and somewhat repetitive. I would have appreciated a greater context applied to the examples through explanation of original Jungian theories.Overall, I think this book is best read in concert with Jung's original texts."},{"rating":"2","title":"a well structured exposition of basic jungian ideas","review":"i read the whole book and can contest to it being 'to the point'. the case histories provide working examples of jung's theories in action. singer is a competent analyst and it shows, in that the book is devoted to its subject matter and not to how good of an analyst she is. there were parts however, in the section on religion that were hard to grasp if one wasnt already familiar with them and there was a large chunk of the gender chapter devoted to the women's movement in lieu of jung's (outdated, somewhat sexist) theories. just when you think the examples are about to lead away into confusion, she returns on track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to the point","review":"The style of the book is very unscientific. The author uses a lot of words which seem to confuse rather than elucidate. After reading 20 pages, I put the book down.

I called three times for the same problem. I got three different solutions non of which worked. Their common response is to reboot the system and leave it unplugged for at least 5 minutes. If you ask any detailed questions they do not have an (educated) answer.I returned this system and replaced it with a little higher end model.

Soon, I began experiencing little problems like when I would open the disc tray it would open then close as soon as it opened. Nothing too bad. The sound was great. However, less than a month after I got it, I was watching a DVD. A strange smell started coming from the player like something was burning. Suddenly it froze up. I couldn't get it to do anything. I couldn't even get the disc tray to open. I tried turning it on and off and unplugging it, but nothing worked. I finally had to remove the cover just to force it open to get my DVD back.

I thought the charactorization was amazing and more improtant the history provided creates a rich and incredible world that left me hanging on for more.

I actually bought it hoping to find humor in how bad it would be. I wound up reading it cover to cover in 24 hours because that's how hooked I was. The book is absolutely full of suspense and I honestly would love to see a movie. Maybe if WWE had gone this route instead of the ill-fated \\"See No Evil\\" movie, they wouldn't be the laughing stock of the film industry. This book was surprisingly very gripping and for the price, I totally have to recommend it. If you are one of the many people who would have to be skeptical of the the WWE's forray into fictional novels, then check this out and be proven wrong. I must admit that I couldn't believe it, but the book is an addictive thrill ride, very well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oddball Paradise","review":"This book in its entirety is certainly a page-turner, but am I the only one who is fascinated by the oddball stories like the America Online celebrity stalker and the sad culture of cookware cowboys? Tinseltown is more twisted than I'd ever imagined!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tellin' it like it is, Like it OR not!","review":"Regarding Hollywood and the Cult of Celebrity, it's about time somebody called a spade a shovel. Ebner again proves his indefatigable thirst for the truth and doesn't hold back taking down the sacred beasts of Hollywood and pop culture. Well paced, great humor and gloves off punches make this an irresitable read. Get one for your best friend too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hail to the Hollywood Dream-Killers!","review":"The authors live in Los Angeles, and they clearly know their territory.My favorite sections are Love Means Never Having to Say You're Courtney, Hollywood Nannies, Swing Kids, Hollywood Pan Men, Shilling for Scientology, and the interview with Matt & Trey - the South Park Republicans.Also, I almost busted a gut when I read \\"the heterosexual Tom Cruise\\" for the 20th time!Tragic yet funny, Hollywood,Interrupted is by far the best book ever written about Locust Town. I look forward to the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Political Correctness - The New McCarthyism.","review":"This book is not merely a feast for the gossip monger, it is an expose on the PC thuggery of the Hollywood left wing and the hypocrisy therein. To be sure, all Americans, left, right or center, share in some hypocrisy, but regular folk in \\"fly over country\\" generally do not have the money or influence to bully others into political submission. The book decrys celebrity dissent as PR motivated and that that is always the primary motivation for the famous, whether they are involved in politics, or getting married and divorced countless times, or having or adopting children. The authors further state that the famous view the vast majority of regular Americans as unenlightened children who need to be schooled by them - the cultural elite of Hollywood. Although the notion of hollywood as a modern day Sodom and Gomora is not new, the book is still provocative and an informative insider's view of the hollywood dysfunctional machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"WRITE ON!","review":"Smart, funny, insightful look at Hollywood and who it warps celebs AND America. Loved some of the turns of phrases \\"you can lead a whore to culture but she's still gonna stink\\" (about a certain singer/actress in touble with the law right now)and the juicy AOL scandal about an AOL worker who cyberstalked celebs pretending she didn't know who they were and became their online buddies. Pathetic and hysterically funny. There's stuff in ther that's fresh and never been reported, and the writers make a strong case for Hollywood's ignoring the criminals in their midst because they're \\"artists.\\" I think next tiem I get a jaywalking tcket I'll try that angle here in KC and see how far I get!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hollywood: the Prom Queen with Syphllis","review":"Yeah, the whole dang town is swimming in its own toxic juices. Come to think of it, haven't we been SICK of these ghastly celebrity twerps for just about eons?But let's face it. They wouldn't be openly flaunting our values, hating America, cavorting in public, and mocking the rest of us if we didn't let them get away with it.No one forces us to see their nauseating movies and support their diseased lifestyles.Hence, I see this book as good news.Who can read this book without feeling an intense need for another cleaner fresher vastly more interesting, vastly more admirable Hollywood to RISE UP and be born!So let's go, big team!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired not Wired","review":"I was expecting something humorous, given that one of the authors worked for SPY. Instead, I discovered a disorganized hodge podge of mean-spirited rants and stale gossip, and found I couldn't get through the whole thing. Sure, Hollywood is an easy target and ripe for criticism, and so I suppose the authors should be commended for taking it on (there were a couple of unintentional moments of humor when I contemplated the authors ever getting a job in Hollywood ever after this, or how much of their royalties will go for lawsuits), but something with a sense of satire and irony and not so sanctimonious would have been more of a pleasurable read. At least all those vapid, messed up celebrities in Tinseltown retain their entertainment value. This book does not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oddball rant about Hollywood's destruction of America's morals","review":"I bought this because I'm interested in reading about behind-the-scenes Hollywood. I didn't really find out much about that - the writers rant about River Phoenix and Melrose Place as if they weren't 20 years too late. And \\"rant\\" is the correct word - I wasn't aware I was buying a torrent of personal political opinions on the state of America's morals (apparently they are in a dreadful state because of hippies, sorry dangerous freaks, like River Phoenix's family) but I found that out by about chapter 2 or 3. For any Australians reading this review, this is like something you would only hear on AM Talkback Radio stations such as 2GB. More bizarre than any of the Hollywood information, is the window into the perplexing thought processes of conservative Americans. Very odd."},{"rating":"1","title":"A One star rating given due to a lack of negative numbers...","review":"The subject at hand, the sleaze of the Hollywood elite and how \\"they\\" are trying to infect the rest of us with it, is presented in a (so-called) writing \\"style\\" that was last seen in the pages of the Enquirer prior to the election Richard Nixon.The constant references to \\"the heterosexual Tom Cruise\\" were enough to gall, as if anyone truly cared if he is or is not.While I understand the point that was being made, or rather, attempted to be made, and even agree with it to some extent, whatever was the point of writing an entire book railing about Hollywood sleaze in a manner that can only be described AS sleaze???If a titillating tale is your cup of tea, I would suggest Hollywood Babylon (1 or 2) by Kenneth Anger, rather than this tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read this book? Shoot yourself in the foot? A real toss-up!","review":"I enjoy books about Hollywood and its celebrities--the good the bad and the ugly--but this book was simply repulsive. As for naming names, there were some, but there were still enough blind items to be frustrating. Plus, the tone was so completely unredeemingly negative that there were entire sections of the book I simply skipped because they were repetitive and demeaning. There aren't many books that can make me feel \\"slimed,\\" but this one managed to. It's one thing to dish the dirt, like gossip columnists do--they often do it with a sense of humor at least--but these authors simply poured on the manure unrelentingly, and made me totally regret having bought the book and rewarding them for it. If you're a person who genuinely loves the entertainment biz, even with its excesses, do yourself a favor and pass this one up. Compared to this book, even the tabloids read like \\"Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Mean-spirited, humorless and scattershot","review":"I love collecting books, but this rancid piece of garbage went right in the dumpster immediately after reading. I was expecting a funny skewering of clueless celebrities and their culture (I was a big fan of Spy Magazine back in the day) but this was the most random, nasty, humorless skreed I have ever read. Just a god awful, meandering rant from cover to cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Slogging Through Mud","review":"I looked forward to dishing the dirt on Hollywood, but this book was like walking through knee deep mud and about as much fun. The writers are joyless and lack wit, and the gossip is old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Cranky Material","review":"The writers clipped and pasted old tabloid articles and threw in some gratuitous nasty comments of their own. It is as if the authors couldn't trust the readers to draw their own conclusions. The result is old - very old - Hollywood gossip along with a cranky lecture. This book could have been one long laugh - OK a very old laugh - at Hollywood, but the writers spoiled it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Reading","review":"Hollywood celebrities are like the train wreck you can't stop watching. Andrew Breitbart really knew how sick celebrity culture was and he, along with Mark Ebner, exposed the details of who, what, when and where. It's a fascinating read about how much influence we have allowed celebrity to have in our lives. This book truly is a case against celebrity and very well made indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A City of Fools","review":"Breitbart and Ebner have produced an excellent tell-all book about the excesses and down-right insanity that rule Hollywood. From the drug induced haze that Courtney Love lives in to the throw-away children squeezed out by so-called celebrities. It's all here in a well written and documented book.The chapter on Hollywood Family Values will make you mad. The section on Hollywood Lefties and their outrageous political agendas should have you rushing to the poles to vote conservative. This book is a quick read. Although, Hollywood Interrupted is at times quite funny, it is very sad to think that these damaged people influence every aspect of American society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your precious eyesight!

So annoying!! I paid full price for this book too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull Trash","review":"I should have looked at the book more carefull before I bought it. The two authors write for Spy and the Drudge Report. They'd never make it in mainstream journalism. Their writing simply isn't very good.This is a cut and past book of tabloid articles. What little passes for commentary isn't a bit persuasive, because the authors have poor rhetoric skills.This book was very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tabloid gossip passed off as social science","review":"This poorly written mess of a book presents the premise that leftist Hollywood celebrities are too screwed up to be role models for their own children, much less the rest of us. Unfortunately the sampling of old tabloid stories of dubious truth are compounded by constant contradictions to the premise. So some stars are good single parents, some are absent parents, some are neurotic ex-hippies. Is this not true perhaps, of say, parents in Idaho?The fact that entertainment welcomes more eccentric personalities to it's fold than perhaps accounting does not necessarily mean they create them. Some kids get screwed up whether dad is Marlon Brando or George Bush. Among the many problems with this sloppy book is the fact that in spite going back to the ancient movie scandal history, most contemporary juicy details are about family members of recent \\"celebrities\\" we already can't really place."},{"rating":"2","title":"They'll never eat lunch in that town again","review":"I LOVED this book. The authors paint a clever and amusing picture of how so many celebrity Talking Heads in Hollywood need to STOP THEIR INSANITY!!! How dare these hypocritical, reactionary, insecure, narcissistic, drug & sex addicted, overpaid celebrities assume that they can dictate social consciousness to the rest of us? To paraphrase from the book, as Patricia Heaton suggests when she defies the pack of lemmings on a sociopolitical issue - \\"it won't be Barbara Streisand\\" she has to answer to when she reaches the pearly gates. I have recommended this book to my friends who enjoy celebrity dish as well as amusing anecdotes and social commentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"mean spirited","review":"Thankfully I got this book from the library.

It's poorly written (even I noticed that and english isn't even my first language), it's mainly old news and the guys who wrote it are so right wing they make Charlton Heston look like Tim Robbins. They are also homophobic to a degree that calls for psychological treatment - or maybe for a walk out of the closet ;-). In one chapter they bash Jessica Lange only for acting in the movie 'Normal' that showed some empathy for a transsexual. Another chapter is called 'Reds' and is about these oh so bad Hollywood Liberals. It's the old McCarthy dance - and these guys really mean it! I love gossip and I love sarcasm, but this book only is a bitter and joyless bashing of the rich and famous in L.A. You can't help but to ask yourself if these guys aren't just jealous for not being invited to the party. This book is not really about Hollywood, it seems to be a late payback to all the popular guys in Highschool that these guys most probably were bullied by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Humorless Mediocre Writing","review":"I was hoping to be entertained by this book of Hollywood gossip, but I wasn't.

That's about all i could take of this mean-spirited, one-sided, repetitive diatribe.Please read the Pub Weekly review above. It gives a fair picture of this crappy book.I have no problem w/ criticism of hollywood & celebrity, as long as it's fair & intelligent criticism. This book is neither. It's just a biased, unoriginal rant.The worst thing i can say about it is that the tone is that of a smug, intolerant, finger-wagging, self-righteous hypocrite of the worst kind. Of course the authors, while condemning these celebrities, have no problem making money off of them (& their misfortunes). These guys are the worst kind of blood-sucking insects.If you're really curious, leaf through it at the library & then put it back. Please don't give these narrow-minded idiots your hard-earned money."},{"rating":"1","title":"More right wing propoganda","review":"Thank God I got this book from the Beverly Hills Library instead of buying it. If I had taken one look at the jacket cover, I wouldn't have even checked it out for free. First thing, one of the authors works for Matt Drudge. Second, one of the reviews on the back cover comes dangerous right-wing schizo Ann Coulter. I made it through about the first 40 pages. It's all typical one-sided Rush Limbaugh-style rhetoric. However you feel about celebrities, this is just a vitriolic hate piece with questionable documentation. If you're a right-wing extremist and you hate celebrities - this is the book for you. Be my guest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yesterday's News","review":"This book is so eighties. That's how old these stories are. Some of the newer ones you've heard a dozen times. If you've seen any one of these actors on a talk show, you've heard much more than you'll find in these series of short and boring pieces on each actor.You get these impressions these two fellows were sitting around having coffee after reading a gossip magazine. They decided they'd write a book about Hollywood, but their material is so thin they had nothing much to write but their self-important yammering to each other over coffee.This book is that bad. Not so much because the people in Hollywood are bad, but this book is empty. The word meaningless pops to mind, because the authors are so empty themselves that they can't put any meaningful context around their rants.The result is something that sounds like a drunk father ranting at a teenager who came home too late. It manages to be both predictable and irritating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Relentless Trash","review":"If you like reading gossip rags at a supermarket checkout counter, this book is for you, but don't expect anything more. Much of this gossip isn't even fresh. For instance, Polanski's story is decades old. Other sections could have been lifted from People magazine. What's new is ugly or petty.I expected some balance or some redeeming features when I see something like this in book form, but there was nothing. This book is one long session of carping, and the writes come off as bad as the people they are writing about. It takes a certain kind of mindset to enjoy this nasty worldview."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull Dregs","review":"This book is dull. You will recognize most of the material in this book, except you'll remember that it was better written when you read it months ago.The incredible part is that two guys worked on this book and added exactly nothing new. They aren't wired into the Hollywood crowd to get any new gossip, or to even get details to enhance the stale gossip they printed here.While they are trying to make Hollywood look bad, the authors also make themselves look bad. It's obvious they don't know anyone, and their bitterness shows in the mean-spirited way they write about financially successful people. They didn't even try to tell their nasty gossip in an amusing way.If you want some Hollywood gossip, buy a new magazine. You'll get fresh news without the monotonous attitude."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat Beer","review":"The authors reprinted very old gossip. You won't find anything new here. At least gossip magazines have pictures, and that would have helped cut the monotony of this book, because it is strung together like a series of not particularly well written magazine articles.Anyone can criticize Hollywood, but few can do it well. For instance, these authors don't do it well. This book was a boring waste of my time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pointless Tirade","review":"Hollywood Interrupted could have been an effective rebuttal to the hypocrisy which typifies much of the \\"entertainment\\" that comes out of the film and television industry. Instead, this book is a rambling diatribe that is as pointless and vapid as its subjects. In the place of new information and critical analysis, Breitbart and Ebner rehash old gossip and liberally editorialize. Additionally, the authors employ a writing style that depicts themselves as \\"hip\\" insiders destroying the beast from within. Unfortunately, the style comes off as more than a little duplicitous, especially since Breitbart and Ebner make their living reporting on the very people they are trying to tear down. Because of these weaknesses, readers who are looking for an intelligent analysis of the entertainment industry's shortcomings will need to look somewhere other than Hollywood Interrupted to satisfy their search."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly Written and Obnoxious","review":"Breitbart and Ebner need to take a few writing courses. Knowing the book is badly written only makes reading their biases worse. Apparently people from Appalacia are all backward moonshine makers, according to Breitbart and Ebner.They say they don't want us to challenge nonesense when it comes out of the mouths of Hollywood \\"stars\\". Fair enough. Equally, you should challenge the nonesense that came out of the pen of these \\"authors\\".This book will leave you feeling that the authors are not just denigrating Hollywood, but they are denigrating Americans by suggesting that we are too dim witted to see through them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Behind the scenes, not a DVD extra.","review":"When a large majority of the media is chronically masturbating over what haircare product some ego-laiden celebrity uses, or where they buy their breasts, or even their preference in toilet paper - Hollywood Interrupted marks a refreshing change in attitude.This book shows the rich and famous for the warped, unstable, fallible human beings that they are - and in doing so, questions the danger they pose as supposed 'role models' in our society.The underlying tone is a serious one but it is conveyed with insight and amusement. This is a highly enjoyable, often slightly quirky, look at the inhabitants of tinsel town; and the hidden but rickety crutches, that hold up their exclusive and idolized world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stars Gone Wild","review":"Dirty laundry and plenty of grubby undies on display in this tome with a tone. Some chapters of Hollywood Interrupted read like a surreal novel, while others deliever conservative (and at times, oddly sensible)ideology. I enjoyed Love Means Never Having to Say You're Courtney and the much lauded Pan Man chapter. The Crossroads School section makes the teens in \\"Traffic\\" look like innocent angels. Just noted, BTW, this book is now 15 on NYTimes list (new in non fiction). I can see why the authors are getting grief over this--some people just can't stand to see a different point of view or to have the truth told. Bummer. wake up and smell the scent of something rotten in Spago"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, Hollywood Writers with Guts","review":"What a great read! I'm relieved to pick up a book about these people that so many Americans rely on as role models, political advisors, international policy experts and so on, and have it talk about what they really are - a bunch of freaks. Ebner and Breitbart are gutsy and God bless them, honest.The only way you won't like this book is if you are as needy and weak as the people they write about, not ready to face the fact that your idols are as imperfect as you. Stop being so naive: buy it, read it, and break free of the fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A few thoughts from the plains","review":"Hollywood Interrupted was fun to read. Of course, it's a real eye-opener if you're living away from all those creeps in tinseltown and rarely get any inside information.The timing of this book is perfect, noting that the Oscar's are just a few weeks away. With each presenter and/or nominee, we can now refer to Breitbart/Ebner and laugh our asses off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hollywood--Hardcore","review":"Forget the \\"juicy gossip\\" -- this book hits Hollywood hard and where it hurts, pointing out hypocrisies, cover ups and lies, with wit, humor and a sarcastic sense of outrage. It's more than just gossip--it's a cradle to the grave outline of how Hollywood celebs who screw up their lives are allowed to dictate policy from fashion and child care to religion and politics and how the mass media allows them to keep up this tastemaker inanity, never questioning the stars' talking points. Don't get me wrong--there are great pieces of guilty pleasure (the action hero who videotapes himself \\"decorating\\" a pair of shoes then mails the footwear and the tape to his cyber stalker;the adventures of B-list actors selling pots and pans to audiences at county fairs; the Dr. Feelgoods, etc., for example)and quick turns of phrase that make this the ultimate smart star-lit read. It's intelligent, fun and informative, read it for pleasure, and you'll learn a lot--painlessly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just more right-wing clap-trap.","review":"All you have to do is look at the \\"Customers who bought this book also bought:\\" section.

The first is that these stories are meant to shock, and the stories are from reliable and intellectually uplifting sources such as...nannies. The effect is nothing more than mean-spirited gossip.Given what has happened in the world, the gossip isn't even shocking, it is just Hollywood navel gazing. Uday Hussein raped and murdered young girls. He returned their body parts to their families. Wealthy people in Singapore hire women for pocket change and brutally beat them daily. Looking up from the navel makes one realize that there are even worse events than those told in this book.It's true that many people in Hollywood squander their resources and their lives and that's sad. It's also true that others have used their resources to the benefit of their loyal families. That might have been work putting in this book, but you don't get that kind of information from nannies with an axe to grind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Tabloid Stories","review":"I read this book and I want my money back! Mark Ebner was interviewed on Comedy Central and it went exactly as follows:Mark Ebner: \\"This book very easily could have been a tabloidish sort of compendium of flame-outs and meltdowns.\\"Jon Stewart: \\"It IS a tabloid compendium of flame-outs and meltdowns. I read the damn thing. It's exactly what it is.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Minor League Book","review":"I kept reading hoping that something new, entertaining, or interesting would finally appear, but this was a major disappointment. One of the reviews below had better gossip than you will find in this entire book. If you read the people section of Time Magazine, you will know more than what you'll find in the pages of this book.It doesn't seem possible, but the content of this book is more empty and meaningless than Hollywood. I could have picked up a few current magazines and written a better book on a Saturday afternoon than these lazy authors.It seems the authors don't have any connections with anyone in Hollywood who could have given them direct quotes or direct personal insights into the people they write about. These bottom feeders never needed to even go to Hollywood to write this book since they merely regurgitate things you've already read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idea isn't bad, but the execution stinks.","review":"In competent hands this could have been a good book. Good Hollywood books make the top ten. These lousy authors can only dream about it.The authors claim they want to debunk the cult of celebrity. Instead they try to suggest they are superior to it in a moralistic and boring tone. Even worse, these two half-wits don't make a whole. They use old tabloid tattle as evidence then sneer and snarl. Dullsville.I got the idea they are trying to tout this book as the antidote to the cult of celebrity. Instead they are part of the problem, not part of the solution.This book is a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"At Least These Guys Make Their Position Clear From The Start","review":"While well-documented, the politics of the authors are so blantantly negative and condemning it lessens the impact of their well-researched stories.Moreover, their final chapter on the heroics of online muckrakers, like themselves, is too much.While I am a big believer in checks and balances on our celebrity-obsessed, US Magazine-rich culture, I don't think these guys had to be so nasty and self-righteous to make their point.The Courtney Love and Scientology chapters were great. The online heros and, gasp, left wing politics chapters hurt their credibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I usually like reading about the seamy, scandalous side of show business but this is a bad job of reporting. There is far too much editorializing and with aone-sided socially conservative stance. Bad behavior in the entertainment industry is not limited to liberals.The book is far too opinionated as if the facts can't stand by themselves.The authors have a moralistic tone rather than an entertaining one and they come off as holier-than-thou. If they think Tom Cruise is homosexual (if that is so important to them), why don't they have the courage to say so directly instead of bitchy, multiple oblique references to \\"heterosexual Tom Cruise\\".I tried to finish it but it got to be too tedious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Expectations?!

After reading \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", you can imagine my sadness by being forced to pick up this boring sleep enhancer. Throughout the entire book, there are about 5 points of climax, each lasting for a few pages. For a book of over 500 pages, you can see why my eyes started drooping after Chapter One. As a matter of fact, the book doesn't even pick up until page 350, and that is only a small gain. Reader beware, save yourself and go find something better to do with your time!

Here, contestants are put through things just to keep viewers watching. Contestants have their own exhibitionist and self esteem issues. Some contestants are obviously chosen to play stereotypical roles based upon their identities, etc. This movie asks, \\"When are these shows going over the line?\\"I believe this work was made in Chile. I am very disappointed about the homogeneity of the cast. I heard that Chile is racially diverse having indigenous people, Spaniards, and many of mixed heritage. In this film, all the characters looked 100% European. No Chileans with any drop of indigenous ancestry were given roles. I find this very problematic. Critics have said that Latin American TV and film often act like people of African or Amerindian ancestry don't exist and this film is glaring proof of that.

His assignment for two months to get three innocent souls to sell their souls. Cosby as Devil is almost as fun as George Burns was in Oh God You Devil. I will say this, when Cos is on screen, he steals the scene away from Gold everytime.On the other hand, Gould plays a slick con man who is not the sharpest tool in the box. His wide-eyes deer in the headlights look makes his heroic Devlin like most Disney main characters. Gould's simple Devlin does not try to be heroic, it comes out at the endAs flawed and as dated as this film is (its almost 27 years old), it still holds up as a family film.Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLDThis cute comedy does not sound preachy.

I was required to read it along with A Prayer For Owen Meaning for AP English. From the beginning I found it unrealistic and predictable, like an after school special. The story is about Davy, Reuben's older brother, who kills two boys and escapes prison. The whole book is the Land family's adventure in a camper to find the outlawed member.Reuben doesn't believe that Davy should be in prison, although he is obviously guilty and should be punished.

It was a good tale that left me wanting more, so I picked up \\"Peace Like A River.\\" Both books are good reads with strong similarities in construction. In both the apparent protagonist is not the most significant or strongest character. One of Enger's great strengths is his ability to create secondary characters who, as the story progresses, become more fascinating, more complex, and more interesting and important than the main character. Enger's books are a good weave and well done and I highly recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"a matter of taste","review":"This book came highly recommended to me by a long time friend I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as she did. There is a very persistent and deep religious theme which might appeal to a lot of people but which I found tiresomeThe author tries to achieve a combination of Mark Twain americana and a strain of magical realism but the writing style wears thin. The narration is from the point of view of an 11 year old boy who is a sympathetic character but it has a tone of irony which is unconvincing for the time and place and the charactersThe basic story is too thin for the number of pages and stream of consciousness taken to tell it and rather than wishing it would never end I found myself thinking \\"WILL it never end?\\"Nonetheless, I think for a reader less analytical and more sentimental than I am, it would be a totally satisfactory, memory piece I can see why some reviewers are rhapsodic, but it didn't have that affect on me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still waters run deep","review":"A stirring and satisfying story with characters that befriend the imagination with wisdom and innocence."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gem","review":"The most remarkable thing about this gem is its writing.

I put this with Ian McEwan and Frank Conroy in terms of its excellence, and it has become among my favorite books.As a postscript: Please don't let the hint of \\"religiosity\\" prevent you from reading this book. There's a thread of spirituality (relating to the somewhat mystical father, who is a prayerful man) running through the book that is just delightful.

I very highly recommend this novel. It is written in a style that is lush but not pretentious. Though the story-teller is Ruben as an adult, the words and thoughts of the children are very authentic and the emotions are founded in reality even though the events are often supernatural. It is spiritual but not preachy. It is engaging and funny. I am a language arts teacher and will include this on my list of summer reading for my students. For the reader who was disgusted by the lack of commas and the word \\"and\\" placed after semicolons -- relax, will you? This is a novel, not a term paper.

Leif Enger has a gift of storytelling. I was entralled by the tapestry of words and the charming characters. Swede is a sharp, precocious young girl who reminded me of Scout Finch from \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\". The book flows well, is easy to follow, and is hard to put down! I was seriously aghast to discover there were those who did not like this book, or who found it boring. (I guess everyone isn't blessed with a healthy, vivid imagination.) Who cares how believable it is that a nine-year-old girl can write so well and have such a vast vocabulary? If every fiction book must be absolutely believable, then Harry Potter wouldn't have been so successful! This book made me want to read more. It made me want to slow down and enjoy simple pleasures.

It's interesting to note that reviewers seem to overlook the character of Roxanna. She plays a pivotal role in healing and restoring the Lands, who were physically and emotionally at the end of their endurance.Swede's precocious abilities are stretched beyond belief. As an eight year-old, she has been decked out with a vocabulary, poetic mastery, and an insightfulness that is perhaps needed in this story, but not from a third-grader. She's reminiscent of Leah in Pat Conroy's Beach Music, another character whose unbelievable prescience becomes a distraction as the story unfolds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shades of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\"","review":"Leif Enger's gripping tale of family crisis and redemption elegantly unfolds with grace and foreboding through the eyes of a child- as heart-wrenching and enduring as the voice of Scout Finch in Harper Lee's masterpiece. Now that this exceptional work is in the hands of Billy Bob Thornton (who else but a younger Robert Duval could one envision as Jeremiah Land?), my hope is that he casts unknowns (and not Dakota Fanning or Haley Joel Osment) in the roles of Reuben and Swede. To Kill a Mockingbird is one of very few films that translated skillfully and faithfully to the screen.

Everyone I've given it to has loved it, and I've given it a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"Just finished this book and loved it all the way through to its fantastic ending.

Think Plainsong.Captivating characters and relationships. Think To Kill a Mockingbird. Write on Leif."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and Boring","review":"Oh Dear! Have you ever read a book that the words, spoken in a monotone voice, lulls you to sleep? That is my synopsis of \\"Peace Like a River\\". I did enjoy the spiritual side of this story but was slowly lulled to sleep every time I attempted to read it. I wouldn't suggest you pick up this novel unless you need a good long nap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I The Crazy One??","review":"That's the question that I've been asking myself after I read all the fabulous reviews for this book and then actually read the book. IT'S NOT THAT GOOD!! I read other people's reviews and found myself agreeing as well as disagreeing with many things said. Overall though, this book has no point and is completely random. I have no problem suspending my disbelief for a literary sake...i.e. fine, I didn't completely question the \\"miracles\\" that occurred in the book, but they are NEVER EXPLAINED! Why can the father \\"talk to god\\"? It makes no sense to me. Furthermore, I found myself reading as fast as I possibly could just to get to the end of the book. I read A LOT of books and unless one is absolutely horrible, I will stick with it to the end. That's what I did with this book. So, let me save you innocent readers some time and recommend that if you want to read a story with a point and one that makes any sense, DON'T READ THIS ONE!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and not believable","review":"Had to read this book for Book Club. I have only one word: Yawn. I couldn't get into the characters nor the plot. I found the so-called miracles completely unbelievable and couldn't wait for the last page to appear."},{"rating":"1","title":"mawkish","review":"silly, mawkish, trite, stereotypical. So many adjectives to apply to this poor novel. Was there a plot? I couldn't find it. I couldn't finish it either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money!","review":"This book is utterly boring, and the reader adds to the monotony. Perhaps any reader would have similar problems with this subject matter. The author strains to find unusual adjectives to modify almost every noun. Many of them are laughable; not funny, just laughable! The tiniest event takes page after page of detail writing. You will see what I mean when you finally come to the end. It drags on and on! Sorry, but that is how both my wife and I evaluated it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pees like a what?","review":"We read this book in my book club and many of us agreed that this book was just too long and drawn out (read: BORING). Many times I found myself skipping entire pages just to see if the 'story' was going anywhere (it wasn't). I really could not bring myself to care about the characters, what they were doing, or where they were going. I also was annoyed by the author trying to use 'symbolism' with the poem that the little girl was writing. It seemed like a cop-out to developing a real story. I don't recommend this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I give it zero stars?","review":"This book starts out with an offensive story about hunting, a truly cruel and cowardly activity, in which the protagonist, as a child, celebrates the experience of wounding a goose which, having been lured down to seek companionship with the decoys it takes to be its bretheren, is then chased across a field - painful and terrified - until it is tackled and torturously killed. What a pleasant story. Anyone who isn't offended by this needs to have their head examined."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peace Like A River. Why not read something better?","review":"This book is very boring. There, I said it. I really just don't see what is so great about this book. It's long, relatively uninteresting, and dishes out a heafty load of guilt for nonexistant characters who are the most pathetic group of people I have ever read about. The daughter is named Swede for crying out loud! Swede! What kind of name is Swede? It's not like they are from Sweden or anything! Pretty much the only good quality that this book has is good writing. Leif Enger can write, he is good at it, its just that he came up with a story that doesn't do his talent justice. It is basically a bad To Kill A Mocking Bird, thats all. You could definately find something better to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading, less buying","review":"If you must read this, borrow it.The writing is not complicated, but the story is unrealistic. I found myself dreading picking it up every night...the book just didn't keep my interest. I kept thinking, when will it get better...Normally, with a good book, it goes fast and I can't believe I am done. Not with this book. I didn't choose to read it (it was a book club selection).The daughter's ability to write prose at such a young age is ridicules. The ability for an older brother to escape the law is crazy. The thoughts and writing was not of a young child. The child would have to be unimaginably gifted to write about what he wrote and have such \\"insight\\".Don't bother...it's not worth the time investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It","review":"This is one of my favorite new books! The characters have a way of sucking you in. I can't wait to read his new book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book, Loved it!!!","review":"I am a college student, and my professor chose this book as the one we would be reading and writing an analysis on. With my other experiences, I had my doubts about this book being any good, but I loved it...I hated to put it down. If you're looking for a great read, I would say buy this!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new kind of love story!","review":"A broadening of the classic love story. Instead of just man and woman, he's included the tremendous love of a family. This family has it's share of difficulties, but rises above them to form an incredible bond and a love big enough to include those who stray into it's path. But this is no fairytale, this is a triumph of human spirit. When one makes a mistake, the entire family suffers the consequences. Where perfect love does not mean perfect people. And hope and forgiveness are partnered with faith and respect. Adventure becomes a way of life and miracles an everyday occurance.This is my new favorite. A must read for everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of Those Rare Discoveries","review":"This book touched me so deeply - the beautiful writing made me smile over and over again in joy and awe, and the characters! Wow. I treasure a good read, and this was certainly one. I feel like a better person for having read it...you'll have to read the book to understand why."},{"rating":"2","title":"poetry","review":"A wonderful loving story about family and love, and the writing is magnificent! I have read this book more than once; it's a permanent fixture in my library!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Moving Peace","review":"Of the hundreds of audio books I've listened to, this one has to be one of my favorites. Leif Enger has created a story that is both beautiful and compelling as the lives of the Land family unfold before you. Told by the younger Land son, Reuben, I was completely captivated by this young boy's honesty and vulverability as his journey with his family to find his older brother takes one \\"miraculous\\" turn after another. Swede's (younger daughter) poetry interwoven into the story adds a dimension one rarely finds in literature. This is a family one easily grows to love and hope for, and while I at first thought Chad Lowe's reading lacked expression, as the story progressed I realized that his solemnity of tone fit perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different kind of novel","review":"Peace Like a River is a unique novel in terms of plotting, narrative, theme and overall flow.Negatives: Several descriptive passages and allusions, in the later half especially, drag on disconnected from the story. The plotting also feels indecisive and unsteady for most of the later half, including bits in the very last chapters. In terms of story themes, the entire ending with Davy seems shaky - it doesn't quite mesh with the values and themes established at the start of the novel. Some point of resolution is missing.Positives: Strong characters, lots of hearty American motifs, and a good dose of real-world trouble with the more folk-lore/elemental and religious themes. The raw story is very solid, and the first half is plotted well. The ending is also handled fairly well, though it follows a long, weaker portion.Overall: Peace Like a River is a fascinating and moving read, and the problems in the novel are minor compared to its strengths."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Peace Like a River is undoubtedly the most amazing book I've read in some time...maybe ever!Enger's use of the English language is nothing short of inspired. Some passages I had to read out loud just to hear the words...they are so beautiful. The story touches my heart. The characters are so richly developed I feel I know them. The emotions it evokes are consuming.This is a book I know I'll read time and again, for the sheer joy of it! Thank you, Mr. Enger, for an engrossing, beautifully written book. (I'm sorry, I know I'm gushing. But you've just gotta read this book!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting book","review":"I usually have trouble finding good books to read, but this was actually pretty good. I usually don't like westerns or country type of stuff, but the book was interesting and exciting. After starting the book, I found myself wanting to keep on reading and know what happens in the end rather than dropping it. Which is pretty rare. I bought this because I needed it for school, but I'm glad the school made me read a good book rather than a boring one I'd have to keep forcing myself awake to read. I stayed up till five am reading this book because I couldn't put it down at one point. Anyways, the characters are unique and interesting, and the story has a twist later on that keeps things suspenseful. I kinda wish I could find another book like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I was rather bored during the reading of this book. The story the author tried to tell was interesting, but told in a slow and dull manner. What some may find descriptive, I found horribly boring and I repeatedly found myself saying GET TO THE POINT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Long Winded","review":"I was so excited to read this book but what a disappointment! It started off well I thought, with an interesting story told by an 11 year old boy. However, unfortunately for me, I didn't realize how much I actually hated this book until I was over half-way through, so decided to just finish it hoping the ending would be spectacular enough to save it. Once again, extremely disappointed. While others have very justified problems with the overzealous language and overused literary quotes, and the ridiculous aspect of the father performing miracles, my main problem with this story was that it was simply so ANTI-CLIMATIC. Every time something bad or dramatic happened, it would still all work out. People get caught but always narrowly manage to get away, they got shot but not fatally or even brutally injured. It was as if the book was for an eleven year old instead of told from the point of view of one. Bottom line, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated!","review":"Reading this book was a painful experience. I really don't see what everybody is raving about. There was not a lot of creativity, most of the characters were weak, and it has a forgettable story.Lots of people talk about the book being about faith. It's actually closer to scifi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly Tedious","review":"Maybe I missed something. This book came highly recommended by people whose opinions I trust. I found it tedious. The main character and his father were unsympathetic. Mostly they left me flat. His younger third grade sister had a genius all out of proportion with reality. The first few pages captured me, the remainder left me difting. The writing itself was terrific, but the characters and story line left much to be desired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and Life-Affirming","review":"I really can't remember what led me to this book. But once I started reading it, I loved it so much that I wanted it to go on and on. Reuben tells the story of his father, brother and sister in the aftermath of a tragic event, and of his father's quest to restore their family and still maintain his sense of ethics and morality. But there's much more than the plot. This first novel is almost poetic, at times making you laugh, at times making you cry.I hope Mr. Enger will grace us with his talents again soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful story","review":"I liken the author Leif Enger to John Steinbeck. His words are so descriptive that you feel like you're right there watching the story unfold. It's a beautiful story written eloquently."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful literature","review":"I've taught reading and writing at my junior high school for 18 years. I absolutely love this book. The writing is unbelievable; it's a complete art. I love the christian appeal to the book - the father character is so inspiring. He makes me want to be a better parent! I'm going to have to rate this in my top 20 reads of all time and I've read thousands of books! I will continue to read Leif Enger books without a doubt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much hype","review":"Being from Minnesota, I thought from all the hype that I would like this book, but I quit after three chapters. Comments about this book were very misleading and are one of the worst examples of the growing tendency for editors and promoters to write in this forum. The book is weak on plot and weak on characterization (Reuben's sister Swede is a sad example). The promoters--or the author, who may have written many of the comments from internet cafes--should let readers decide about the quality of his book."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLeeeeze","review":"I've had enough of books with miracles and dead people looking down from heaven. Give me books like Atonement,No Great Mischief, and Exteriors. Let us think!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Indifferent but divided on opinion","review":"Others may appeal but not me. I thought was overdone. Now with that out of way my wife loved. Sort of 50/50 split. I'd give 3 stars for effort. Wife give 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obviously a debut novel","review":"Two stars might be a generous rating for a book I couldn't even finish. The plot and premise of the novel were very appealling to me, and I really wanted to like this book. However, the narrator's voice distracts the reader from getting into the heart of the story. Enger's presentation of Reuben constantly takes you out of the story to unrelated and uninteresting tangents. The depiction of sister Swede is unbelievably precocious and also distracting. Davy is the best character in the novel but unfortunately he disappears after the third chapter.As a reader, I could definitely tell that this was a debut novel, and it wasn't worth it to me to even finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"poetic, sublime, inspiring adventure story!","review":"I almost was turned off early when the Dad walks on air. I don't really go for fantasies. But in the end the book worked wonderfully for me on several levels. As a can't-put-it-down realistic adventure tale. As a gentle encourager of faith and miracles (and not just via a generic God but via Christ - the true source of miracles and the deserving object of faith). And also as a poetic, romance-for-the-old-West literary masterpiece. This book was obviously skillfully and lovingly written. Perhaps the only author where I would buy his next book sight unseen. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare gem","review":"What a truly magnificent experience it is to read a book that is as well crafted as this one. Without one falst note, Enger masterfully crafts a story about family, love, redemption and what \\"miracles\\" truly are. The reader is constantly challenged to question their values of wrong from right. This book and its chracters stay with you long after the last sentence. A noteworthy first novel from an author who hopefully will have many more to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves more than 5 stars!","review":"Leif Enger weaves the English language into a tapestry of exquisite phrasing, imagery, suspense, action, and emotion. I loved every page and the ending made an impact that was positively spiritual. Enger's style blends humor, vision, and insight into crisp storytelling. Remember, this is FICTION! Grab a copy of Peace like a River and luxuriate in this wonderful, amazing novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's amazing...from the first chapter to the last.","review":"This novel had me from the very beginning. It is a novel about how God works in such mysterious ways. Every chapter contains a miracle...some great...some small. As Rube says it...\\"make of it what you will.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wondrous Place","review":"Peace Like a River is one of the most intriguing books that I have ever read. The story flows with a sense of country and the depth of convictions without prudish piety. The descriptions of landscapes and the insights into human hearts are almost breath taking. It is so beautifully written that I was sorry to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"When miracles matter","review":"This book is full of miracles but the 10-year old protagonist is the only one who sees them. Set a small farming community, it evokes the life of a family torn by struggle but healed by miracles. Not a book easily forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"had to struggle to finish this one","review":"The excessive use of Swede's western poetry made this book a tedious read for me. Was given this book as a gift so I made myself finish it. Would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really tried...","review":"Since purchasing this book, I have tried reading it 3 different times. I'm glad to see that I am not the only reader who doesn't understand all the hoopla about this novel. Tedious is not even the word for it. Peace Like a River is painstakingly boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only the 2nd book I could not finish!","review":"I could not get through this book. It required a dictionary on almost every page. I think the author wrote this with a Thesaurus to be original. Original he was, I got to page 127 and said that is enough! The story line did not flow at all. The author makes a 9 year old girl talk and sound like an adult.I read the previous reviews before I purchase this book. I must have gotten the wrong book, but the author and title are the same. Sorry I do not agree with the previous reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing read","review":"Like another reviewer, I am shocked at the attention this novel is receiving. Lacking believability, even miracles aside (which I do believe are possible), the topper is the daughter, Swede. There is no way that any nine year old can do all the things that she does. Please understand that I can \\"go along\\" with the idea for the sake of the story, but it came to be ridiculous after a few chapters. Moreover, the fundamental problem of the novel, the son's crime, could easily have been solved in so many other ways using the father's powers of will, prayer, and miraculous intervention. It was just too silly and convenient for the author to selectively use such character traits only when they suited his rather thin plot.The weaknesses aside, the author does know how to turn a phrase and many passages are a pleasure to read for their descriptive power."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing: could not see it through","review":"At first, I was touched by the beautiful writing and the brother-sister relationship. The Western poetry is an admirable twist. But in the long run, I just could not finish this book. The pieces did not gel together for me. I didn't care enough about the characters to care how they wound up.A MUCH better book with a similar brother-sister relationship is THE BOTTOMS by Joe Landsdale. That title won an Edgar but never received the press it deserved. If you insist on trying Peace Like a River, go for it, but purchase a copy of THE BOTTOMS as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 stars, people? Were you sleeping when you read it?","review":"First, I can't believe this book has gotten so many good reviews?!!! It was boring. It was uninteresting. I would have stopped reading somewhere in the beginning if it wasn't for part of a book club I am in. The ending ruined the whole thing for me. It just seemed to have NO emotion at all in it. When things happened, without giving anything away, people should have been devastated, hurt, crying, mad, vengeful. There was none of that. It was emotionless. It left me feeling empty and not finished. The ending was so abrupt. I would say it left me wanting more, but the only \\"more\\" I want now, is a totally different book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't say enough!","review":"This is the best thing I've read in ten years, since The White Bone. Fabulous writing, each line, captivating characters, and a totally surprising story that makes you wonder and think and leaves you in awe. Taps the rich undercurrent of the midwest,too: there is something between LA and NY."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing debut!","review":"Peace Like a River is a beautifully crafted and well written book. I loved the simple style and immediately engaging prose. From the first page, I was hooked, and there hasn't been a book in a long time that I could say that about. I would definitely recommend this book, and would read any other books Leif Enger writes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleeps like a River","review":"I really wanted to like this book and thought I would after reading the rave reviews. I have not totally finished it yet but I dread picking it up every night trying to finish it. I really want to like it and there are times in the book when it moves a little quicker but I have to agree with many that it just could not hold my interest. I was able to relate to the characters but the plot was just too slow. I am still trying to decide if I will force myself to read the last 40 pages or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Have Found Better","review":"I read this book for school. I thought I wouldn't enjoy but I proved myself wrong. I reccomend highly this exciting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"great audiobook","review":"Chad Lowe does a fabulous job narrating this adventur esome and inspirational story. I recommend the audio version of this journey. Great book for a long car ride or a snowy day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Peace Like a River: Faith in All","review":"Peace Like a River is a beautiful cross between a western and a story of faith. The author Leif Enger depicts Ruben Land and his family on a search across the west for their outlaw brother. The story shows the strength faith can provide through Ruben's father. This man of strong faith seems to attract miracles, adding an element of supernatural to the story. Told from the eyes of Ruben the story is a literary masterpiece. The story seems to flow more as a memory than as a simple story. The rich wording and detail make this story an immensely enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible read!","review":"I have to say, I was expecting a good book based on the reviews, but I was THOROUGHLY impressed and loved it way more than I thought I would. The imagery, the descriptions, the characters...all of it was fascinating and had me hooked from the very beginning. You NEED to read this book. I wish this author had more books as I would definitely read them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Let your imagination create the images","review":"Leif Enger is an excellent storyteller. You may think it's about a quaint little family in the midwest, but, there are some intense twists. The character development is superb and the insight into human desires, longings, and love and sin should be shared with all who are willing to open their own minds and hearts. Have you seen a movie before going to bed and then you lie awake for hours thinking about some of the more intense movie scenes? After reading this book, you will do the same---so try to finish it well before you want to go sleep at night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Immerse yourself in the river of this book!","review":"The title drew me in and I wasn't disappointed. From the flow of the words to the aliveness of the characters, I loved this book. Enger's delight in reading and writing and imagination and history frames this story. Choices are wrestled with, decisons are made and consequences follow and the Land family stand solid with love. I eagerly await Leif Enger's next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book You Want to Share","review":"The language of this story moved me in a new way. When you read alot and stumble across something this beautiful, you just want to share the surprise with everyone else you know who cares about reading and the beauty of words. This is a very special book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truely Magical","review":"This book is an all time favorite. It is one of those books that stays with you. It really is magical, I loved it. Loved the story, loved the characters, just loved all of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"an endearing adventure of family, life, love and faith","review":"This was an excellent read. Lyrical in it's writing and soothing to one's soul. I so enjoyed the characters, the story...the heart of this book. I think I cried for the entire last chapter--not because it was sad (though it was a bit), but because it was beautiful, endearing...and it pierced my heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've read","review":"I wish I could write like this. What a beautiful book! I highly recommend it. It's nice to read a story that is told without vulgarities. In a way, this book reminds me of a religious/spiritual version of Frazier's \\"Cold Mountain\\", especially the conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweet, harsh, moving, true","review":"I just finished this book and was shocked from the beginning at the beauty of the writing. From Swede's love of the Old West, to Jeremiah's faith, to Reuben's truthful, albeit naive perspective, I loved it all. This book is about the kind of people I know. People who desperately want to do what is right, who love their God, who are humble and often poor. I grew up among these types. Enger displays a huge repertoire of knowledge, from Old West heroes and outlaws, to political figures to surprising biblical understanding. If I were his mother, I would know I did something good. Thank you for this book, I WILL read it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A reader from Denver","review":"I was given this book as a gift by a friend who is an avid reader and who I respect greatly. Thus, I was greatly disappointed by the \\"rambling\\" style of the author. The beginning few pages interested me and I had high hopes for the rest of the book, however, I quickly became bored with the incredible intelligence (??) of eight year old Swede and, as previously stated, just a rambling, boring read. I did notice in reading the reviews that most of the five stars were women and the lower ratings were men. As a woman, this both surprised and disappointed me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moses and Jesus","review":"I don't mind flights of fancy as long as they are launched in the known universe. The characters were never true to themselves and the plot wandered as if the author wasn't sure of the direction or outcome of this book. But most of all the Renaissance 9 year old Swede got on my nerves. I can believe that there are child prodigies out there that can recite and retain knowledge beyond their years, but emotionally they will still throw tantrums in the toy section when they don't get their way. This baby Moses was a terribly conceived character and then there was the wizard child that performed Jesus-like miracles and the whole thing went right down hill from there. I gave it an extra star for its originality and high concept, but that's as generous as I could be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most satisfying book I've read in years ... possibly ever.","review":"This story has a lasting effect of the best kind. This is a book that I have already recommended to every adult I know, and fully intend to pass down to all of the children in my family (23 in all, counting nieces and nephews), as soon as they are old enough to appreciate it. It's richness and excellence deserve to be shared and savored for generations. I'm absolutely certain that I will read it again, and recommend it HIGHLY to anyone who has not yet had the pleasure. I promise you that this is a journey you will truly love. I can hardly grasp the fact that this is Leif Enger's debut. I will definitely be among the first to grab the next creation by this author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to connect","review":"The prose is a joy to read, but I could not connect with the characters and after a while found them tedious. Although lighter fare, I found \\"A Miracle for St. Cecilia's\\" by Katherine Valentine a more satisfying read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big deal?","review":"I finished this book last night and was so utterly disappointed I wanted to scream. Perhaps Enger is a marvelous writer, perhaps his literary skills are maginficent, but the story really bites. I was so disturbed by the appearance of \\"the villian\\" (Jape) and the fact that he is still lurking around in society after shooting up this family and their home. And I could hardly believe that anyone could be excited for the love story that transpires at the end. I mean come on, what do we know about this girl and why should we like her? I spend a lot of time reading this book that should have been spent doing other things and it's all because of the hype surrounding the book. I thought for sure at the end the book would be redeemed and I would agree with the masses, but I guess I'm going to have to stop trusting popular opinion. Ughh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peace Like a River","review":"Peace Like a River is probably one of the most boring books I've read. Maybe I'm just too young to appreciate it, or just the fact that I like quicker moving stories, but it seemed to drone on and on about the same topic for multiple pages. Although the plot was interesting, it probably would have been much better if the author had not lingered on the same subjects (some of which were not relevant to the story.) This book had the potential to be good, but was screwed up during the writing process by someone who (not trying to accuse anyone of anything) probably wanted to fill up a bit more space. The plot was intended to be inspirational, and would appeal more to those who need to be inspired. I would not reccomend buying Peace Like a River unless you can handle slower moving stories. Otherwise, it's always available at the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good Novel","review":"I randomly purchased this book and was almost disappointed to find out it had a somewhat religious bent (note: quite a few biblical references). With an open mind, I delved into the book and found it incredibly hard to put down, even with my college workload. The story has an adventuresome feel with excellent language. Truly suspenseful, heartwarming, and uplifting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Story","review":"This is the best novel I've read in years.If you are looking for a novel with world-weary detectives or slick lawyers, you will be disappointed.The central characters in this story:A soft-spoken med-student-turned-janitor, who performs subtle miracles reminiscent of the New TestamentAnd his perceptive children, who discover that the distinctions between right and wrong are complicated, especially when family is involved.Tough choices.Put this on every middle-school/high school reading list."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought it would never end","review":"Enger did a wonderful job of choosing the language of this book. In that respect it was beautifully written. However, I found it to be quite an unusual book with odd characters that did not seem \\"real\\" to me. The plot was slow-paced and usually that is fine with me, but in this case I found it to be boring. There were many \\"side stories\\" that the narrator told that had very little to do with the main plot. Frankly, I thought this book would never end. My book club, composed mainly of teachers, did not enjoy this book. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purefoy a Delight in Feast","review":"I mainly bought this film to see James Purefoy. Purefoy did a masterful job as the charming yet bossy older brother in his small role. This film was vintage Merchant Ivory in terms of the lovely scenery and great costuming. The film also had a tragic story in rural England Thomas Hardy type quality reminiscent of Tess of the D'Urbervilles and The Woodlanders, eventhough this is not a Hardy story. I'm glad I got the film, but be prepared for an unhappy ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely period piece","review":"it doesnt take a rocket scientist to know which brother is the lover since they are on the cover.

But the hidden treasure in this film is Ben Chaplin. He gives an incredible performance. But, he brings that quality to whatever film in which he appears.This a wonderful period piece. And, of course, you know the end before it comes. The trip is what makes watching this film worth it. The end is not surprising. No hidden twists and turns. Just sit back and watch 19th century unfold in front of you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feast of July","review":"Very disappointed in this movie, especially James' uniform.

It doesn't even have her hair color right. It's a man-hating revenge film. She undergoes endless abuse, including the \\"casting floor\\", but wins out in the end by becoming Mariyn the star.Terrible script; terrible acting. Not graphic, but there is some nudity. Not even the saving grace of an attractive cast to offset the bad quality. Misty Rowe is painful to watch as Marilyn Monroe- what a travesty! This is a very bad exploitation film, with little relation to reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST MOVIE EVER","review":"This is the worst movie of Marilyn Monroe ever.

Engine 88's singer used to sing in another band, Sordid Humor, with Adam Duritz. That album is pretty good too. The lyrics on all of Engine's albums are original, interesting and funny. I believe that the singer is an environmentalist and he uses a lot of his experiences in his lyrics. Definitely worth the few bucks you can pick this up used for. Other bands I'm into if it helps categorize Engine 88 are Catherine Wheel, Swervedriver, Mystery Machine, U2, Radiohead, Death Cab for Cutie and other indies..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute story.","review":"A little cow is unhappy with where she is, so she starts off for the other mountain.

I am extremely disappointed in the decisions they have been making regarding the release of this series. I will NOT buy this 6 disc set. I reiterate the words of a previous reviewer when I say that people do enjoy this series and would probably buy this, but not when it's produced with such incompetent negligence and disrepect for the fanbase. I hope people will boycott this edition lest it be a subtle marketing ploy (often done by George Lucas with his orginal Star Wars movies) to hook devoted customers into buying this edition, and then to release a set in season format with additional episodes among those that have already been released.

So why this lame maketing device? Once the themes are exhaused, then what?\\"The Outer Limits\\" was a remarkable anthology series, but what will happen to the many episodes that aren't thematically related to others? Or (unlikely as it seems), will all 100 episodes somehow be pigeonholed into thematic units?

One of my favorite episodes from the Outer Limits New Series was with Brent Spiner (of STNG fame as Data).

I guess they don't like money. I would incur my wife's wrath and buy it instantly. In the absence of such an offering, I opted to get this 6-disc set just to enjoy some of the episodes (it was under $14 so not too bad). Although I don't regret buying it, let it be known that these are flippers... another thing DVD collectors universally hate. Also, the compression quality I found to be VERY poor. On a widescreen 32\\" Samsung and when played in either our dvd or bd player, I'm looking at mediocre (at best) VHS quality.

I have three MTH O scale Proto-sound 2.0 steam engines with synchronized, fan-driven smoke units. MTH's Proto-Smoke fluid is OK but not very dense and can somtimes can gum up the smoke unit heating coils. I clean them gently with an old toothbrush with smoke fluid on it. However this should not happen so I tried Mega-Steam smoke fluid which was very good, but burned up the wicking too fast, and was way too expensive. This stuff makes the densest output, no build-up, and the wicks last the longest. The price is perfect! I have even tried this fluid in my friend's Lionel 681 pellet smoke unit and was blown away with the results.

When I bought the mixer, I also got the blender attachment and the food processor attachment and blades. I will never have another brand mixer, and may never have to buy another one, period. It is a workhorse. It will handle large loads of heavy bread dough and whip meringue. It makes smoothies and chops veggies. The stainless steel bowl with the odd beater and scraper combo gets the job done, but so does the plastic bowl with the whipping attachment. I use the mixer at least once a week, and usually a lot more. The blender attachment will handle ice, making smoothies that are really smooth.

While the KA had the dough nicely kneaded after 4 or 5 minutes, the Electrolux had the dough stuck on the kneading hook while the bowl was happily spinning underneath the dough.I can see this mixer doing well with batter and moist doughs, but if you bake whole wheat and rye breads, as I do, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Challah Mixer Graet Power","review":"This mixer is rated as the best Challah Mixer in the Market If you want to make a real Heavy religious Sabbath Challah this will be the best mixer for that.Ask around people who use it love it I make every Week a 9 Large Challas and all my neighbors and Family come to share itOh they they think I Should make the Challah for messiah!!!

Is the DVD made of GOLD? Only a moron would pay those kind of prices for ANY movie! And what's up with a used DVD being worth more than a brand new one? I see that a lot. It's not a car, people. It doesn't go up in value just because it is used. My friend sells stuff online for rediculous prices and I asked him why? He said, \\"There's a sucker born every minute and I can sell anything for 20X what it's worth.\\" All I can say is \\"wow\\". I've got some used dog food I should sell. Maybe I can get $500 for it.

Filled with the brilliant production of dj priemer and the lyrisism of guru, the owners is a must by classic which will hopefully change the ways of sellout oriented rappers today. Highlight tracks include sabotage, Right where you stand, peace of mine, who got gunz, Riot ark, in this life, and the title track.

I think Skills and Right Where You Stand are two very good singles and are underated. I hope Gang Starr accomplishes a success with this album and I am looking forward 4 Gang Starr next project.

In this era of bling bling and me-me rap acts, these two will outlive all of these current flavors of the month, and even some of the bigger acts of today. They are back with a vengance with their new album, The Ownerz, as as usual the music is nothing short of excellent. I will say this though; it seems that the group looked to go the commercial angle, as you can see with some of the guests but it's not as obvious, as say Jay-Z and Missy Elliott. There are so many good songs to name, it'shard to single them out, but Rite Where U stand with Jadakiss of the Lox is one of Primo's best beats in a long time. Gangstarr probably won't ever sell millions of records like the MTV/106 & Park MC's out there, but at least they'll be here when my kids are growing up.

Google the title and some providers will pop up. The film also features other great rock acts from the 50s and early 60s, including Chubby Checker, Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, The Five Satins, Fats Domino, The Coasters, and some others. Influenced by the WOODSTOCK movie, it uses multiple screens even more effectively. There's also some great montage sequences of 50s imagery as well.

I loved watching this series both originally as they aired as well as having the ability to watch them at my leisure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I've been buying this series for my dad ever fathers day/christmas at Best Buy... And wow. What a mistake. I save so much money buying from here on Amazon. It was also in perfect condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Show, Fabulous Season","review":"This show is witty, funny, dramatic, and engaging, and the final season was one of it's best. If you are a fan, you'll love it. If you've never seen West Wing, start with Season One... you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God I've got the answers now!","review":"If the writers were going to end the season, at least they did it in a classy way; answering all the questions I had about how the characters were going to end up. My husband and I became addicted to the series and will regret its loss."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a shame it's the last season","review":"West Wing must be the best TV series ever produced, at least for people interested in American and world politics. And it's also very educational.You really feel like you're living with those guys at the White House and deal with actual world problems.Aaron Sorkin is a genius and he has a wonderful team working with him, writers and actors.I'm really sad that the 7th season is the last."},{"rating":"2","title":"The West Wing - 7th Season","review":"I didn't \\"discover\\" the series WEST WING until the second season, and then missed quite a few episodes due to the time slot in which it was scheduled. As the seasons were sold in DVD, I bought each one. I have found that the shows I love are always cancelled. I am glad this one got to run 7 seasons, but would have preferred that it continue. By buying this product, I can ensure that it carries on in THIS home anyway. I liked the interactions of the characters, the realistic conflict, the intelligent dialogue. I basically hate politics (and most politicians) in the real world, but WEST WING made the incomprehensible entertaining at the least and at its best, made motivations more empathetic. The features and interviews were well worth watching. I admit, I have not watched the final episode yet. (Postponing the inevitable.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This should be required for everyone - fantastic.","review":"If you have ever wondered how a presidential election would ideally be run in a democracy of well educated and visionary people, this would be it. We can all learn so much from this and the humor is such a great added feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good final season........","review":"Oddly enough, the seventh and final season of West Wing is much better than I remembered it when it was broadcast and I'm so glad I purchased it on DVD. This is one of the best television dramas of all time and the Seventh Season is up to the task."},{"rating":"2","title":"West Wing Season 7","review":"Season 7 of West Wing came to me promptly and in perfect condition. I am very pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay but not the best","review":"There was some helpful information in this book, but there were quite a few things that actually created additional fear in me. I would recommend other books over this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"One thing bothered me","review":"While I am not a fearful flyer, I did pick up this book to find out what is being taught to those afraid to fly. It did have a large section devoted to common questions about the physics of flight and pilot competency. However, I was disturbed that more than a few of the answers containd a phrase similar to \\"well . . . it's never happened before.\\" Apparently, this is to convince readers that a certain event will never happen in the future. I could be wrong, but I find that misleading. No one expected the Concorde to crash, but it did. Ditto for the space shuttle Columbia."},{"rating":"1","title":"More afraid","review":"That's right, this book has made me more terrified than ever to fly. I read it cover to cover, and I am someone who loves to travel and needs to take a plane to see family; and I dread it. Instead of addressing why you are afraid to die in a plane (which is the problem correct?), it lists stats and probabilities, some of which are lies. For instance, he states no plane has ever been lost to turbulence, ever. That is a lie. Japan air, Aerolineas Argentinas, and the recent American out of JFK were all turbulence-related crashes. This author used to work for American, what do you think he's gonna tell you? Another: pilots aren't allowed to fly into level four turbulence. Yet turbulence is unpredictable! How can they not be allowed to fly into something they don't know is there! I know dying on a plane is a 1 in a million chance, that doesn't make me feel any better. Neither will this book help you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fear no more","review":"I am someone who either did not fly or would drive. If you want to overcome your fear this is a great book. All of the reasons I am afraid to fly are addressed. I was especially amazed to see he addressed, albeit briefly, one of my main reasons which is being afraid not to be afraid, as if my fear was keeping me safe. I let go of that on my trip to Disney World with my wife and 5 year old son and it was the best trip I ever had. Also it did not ruin my vacation worrying about the trip home!! He explains all the sounds the plane makes and that was another relief. I knew exactly what to expect, and it gave me more control of the situation. I would recommend this book to anyone who is a fearful flyer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fearful flyer book.","review":"This book was a good addition to my fearful flyers library. It gives good basic information.Another book I liked was The Backseat Flyer, more storylike and fun to read, but told of a tincture I could take that calmed me down. These two books are a good team."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Good information but didn't improve my attitude about flying","review":"This book has some informative material but for me that didn't help much. I am able to fly but I don't think I'll ever like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wouldn't Fly Without this Book","review":"When I get my laptop ready for a trip, the first thing that goes into my case is this book. I had a frightening experience on a plane about 10 years ago, but after my daughter was born, I started to panic everytime I was slated to travel. The Center for Travel Anxiety in Bethesda, Maryland recommended this book and I never fly without it. The book covers everything from the basics of how an airplane stays in the air and industry safety to techniques on how to stop racing thoughts and creating your own flight plan. If you are a fearful flyer, this book is a \\"MUST READ\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"I had sworn off flying for almost 6 years, until...","review":"This book is amazing. I used to have paralyzing nightmares about plane crashes and had given up flying for almost 6 years. I swore to never fly again. I picked up this book, almost 2 months later I have flown 4 times and it gets easier each time. Please buy it..It's amazing I am telling you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An overpriced loser","review":"Door hinge squeaks; lubrication ineffective. Door doesn't close fully unless I jiggle it. Door handle loose; no way to tighten it. Toasts unevenly. Lower heating elements became increasingly crooked over time; both finally quit working at all. But all that is minor. Toaster doesn't shut itself off and I consider it an extreme fire hazard.Please note that I am not a timid housewife who's afraid to change a light bulb, I am a mechanical engineer. This is the worst product we've bought in ten years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Floris mon amour","review":"This is an amazing book that will absolutely enchant you. The story continues in Floris le chevalier de Petersbourg, La belle de Louisiana and Les amants de Mississippi. Read all of them if you have the chance. You won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby's 1st Video","review":"I received this video as a gift from friends when we had our twins last September. I have not found another video that compares to this one. Both of the twins love the black & white images, the music and the baby sounds. Now, at 6 months, they anticipate what is coming next and get very excited by the images, especially the fish. I always said I would not allow my children to sit in front of the television, but with twins sometimes you have to in order to get anything done. At least I know that the video is helping their brains develop and that they are learning. Baby's 1st Video is highly recommended by this mother of twins!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The bridge at andau","review":"This book gives a very clear picture of what went on durring the revolution. The stories are touching and detailed. This book has given me insight into the way Hungarians think and act."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hidden History","review":"Before I read this book I knew very little about the Hungarian Revolution. Now I know why. The American government did not support the revolution as it had pledged it would. This book makes me wonder about the other historical occurences that we never here about. What else has happened?"},{"rating":"1","title":"good book, bad condition","review":"This is an older book but has good context with changes in the middle east.Bought the book used, supposed to be in good condition but it was an old library book with broken spine and pages falling out"},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-Fiction which is not what Mr. Michener excels at","review":"The expectation is that this is a story about the Andau Bridge, the bridge was barely mention until the end of the book. The picture on the paperback is totally misleading. The cover shows a bridge for cars over a river. The real Andau Bridge was a foot bridge over a treacherous swamp crossing. As the book tries to illustrate the plight of the Hungarian people, what comes across loud and clear is the brutality and inferiority of communism. On the bright side it does provide a great insight to the history of the Balkans area which at the turn of the last century was so topical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless and One Sided","review":"I'll give Michener 2 stars because his book makes for interesting reading. This book has several problems. The biggest problem this book has is that Michener is a native New Yorker, and is EXTREMELY biased. The only people whom get a word in are the violently anticommunists. Michener apparently didn't talk to people who didn't aid in the revolution. He was probably using very extreme cases in his \\"study\\" of the AVO. In short, this book is not history, and is anticommunist propaganda. If you want an account of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 don't read this book...I would refer you a REAL historian. The only real use that this book could be used for was to show how anticommunist the West...other than that it's a worthless, one sided account of a failed revolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"The truth is uncovered","review":"The writer is determined in this book to show the brutality of communism as covered by the Soviet propaganda in the middle of the 20th century. The book's composite characters demonstrate the reality behind the iron curtain. If anyone is wondering what life was like in Soviet controlled countries, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"1956 Hungarian Revolution Revisited","review":"Excellent overall view of the events of 1956 in Hungary. Personalized stories are those of other refugie families I met in Austria in 1957-58; or like my family's. Brings the events close for the reader, although slanted toward Cold War view from the West."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This book is a very true account of what happened during the tragic Hungarian Revolution. As a Hungarian-American, I was fascinated to learn more about the history of Hungary. It is a first-hand view as witnessed by James A. Michener. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in European history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great repellent","review":"This is good repellent, served its purpose. I actually use this for adults and children being that its soft enough for them too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Source","review":"I read this book 25 years ago and recall it often. It is a rich history of judism. I loved this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best book I have ever read.","review":"If I was allowed to give this book 100 stars it still wouldn't be enough. It is the only book I have ever read more than twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"thanks for the warnings!","review":"I would like to thank those who wrote about the Kindle edition and the poor editing. I read The Source years ago, just got back from a visit to Israel where I visited Megiddo. i was looking forward to reading the Kindle edition of The Source, but knowing about all of the typos etc, I will wait to order this. I read and loved the Clan of the Cave Bear books and was terribly disappointed in the Kindle versions, so won't order the Kindle edition of The Source at this time. Amazon: could you please let me know when you fix this? Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All Michener books are great","review":"When I have read the best sellers, I always go back to Michener. This is a wonderful history of religion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent story of Judeo-Christian-Moslem origins","review":"Michener at his best, with insight into human and spiritual ethics that are unparalleled. He looks through the eyes of modern and ancient peoples of the Middle East as though he was alongside them. A virtual roadmap of the beginnings of civilization as seen through the Holy Land. He wraps the concepts of Judaism, Christianity and Islam around their basic singular origin, and shows how these three major religions are from One Family. He shows the struggles that leads followers to preserve each faith with respect, dignity and reverence, and their inter-connectedness in the devotion of faith. Any Jewish, Christian or Muslim scholar or person of plain, simple knowledge will benefit by reading this. A wonderful gift for anyone who loves mankind!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ponderous. Michener's worst.","review":"This book is ponderous beyond belief.For example: The description of new characters as the book goes along can take pages.I've read virtually all of Michener's books and I'm a big fan of historical fiction.This book, however, goes on and on and on more than I can stand.Strunk and White would've kept him after school for months."},{"rating":"2","title":"History comming to life!","review":"Colorful insights of an ethnic groups'\\"struggle for existance\\" throughout its' history.

I learned so much about humankind and the history of religion. The stories enterwined made the books so readable. Great writing.I appreciate Michener more and more as I get older."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth reading","review":"Although I found parts of this book to be tedious and wordy, I still enjoyed it. The way Michener was able to weave the objects of history into this history was truly astounding. I marked 8 favored chapters that I intend to go back and read again. I am just sorry that Mr. Michener is not with us anymore so he can update and modernize this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the finest & most entertaining books of a generation!","review":"This is one of the best books I've read during my lifetime! Michener is at the top of his form, combining current fiction with historical legend and fact. He provides a sweep of history that non-historians can relish. Although \\"The Source\\" chronicles the history of the Jews through the lives of 20th century characters (and flashbacks through time), it is a book for all people (Christians, Muslims, Asians, Jews, agnostics, atheists), because it tells the story of individuals struggling, living and dying within an evolving cultural context. A master storyteller giving us a glimpse of eternity!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally understanding what it means to be Jewish","review":"Six years of Hebrew school, a bar mitzvah, a trip to Israel, and a lifetime of being Jewish -- and yet it took a reading of James Michener's The Source for me to truly understand what it means to be a Jew. The book is awesome in its scope, using vivid storytelling to portray the survival of Judaism over the course of 11,000 years. Especially insightful is its description of the genesis of the sometimes curious laws that observant Jews follow, and how those laws have allowed the Jewish people to overcome every attempt to destroy or assimilate them.This is a must-read for anyone, Jewish or not, who has never completely grasped what Judaism is and means. It is also a marvelously entertaining book that seems perfectly suited for treatment as an epic mini-series. It is surprising that none has ever been made."},{"rating":"1","title":"book","review":"I bought this book because I thought it was a history book, rather than a novel. Nothing wrong with a novel, just disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Michener ever!","review":"I have read over twenty Michener novels and this by far was my favorite. A sweeping epic of a land that spawned the worlds three major religions. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"the source","review":"This was one of my favorite books--but I had forgotten a lot of it and wanted a permanent copy instead of going to the library. It is everything I remembered and more. The story is fascinating and definitely not Indiana Jones but you could imagine Indy in some of them. You learn a lot of history and archeology from the whole book but in a very entertaining way, and the characters are wonderful. I learned a lot about Israel and the people who live there. I don't think I will ever forget what I read about the Spanish Inquisition."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Great Ones","review":"I consider this to be possibly one of the greatest books I've ever read! I've have to disclose I am a huge James Michener fan. The story naturally starts at the very begining, with the cave man. Michner as always is complete and thorough in covering his subjects. He uses a story of an archaeologist on a dig in the modern world to frame his stories of the past. This book really brought to light the struggles of the Jewish people. This is a very long book, but not one you'll not want to put down. Michener really brings the land of Israel alive. His characters as always are compelling. This is one of the first books I have read about Israel or the Middle East, although I'm sure their are many people polarized on this subject, I felt the author treated his story very objectively."},{"rating":"2","title":"His Best!","review":"From what I've read of his, this is Mitchener's best. He develops his stories through artifacts found on a dig of a mound in Israel that represents the detritus of thousands of years of human activity. Very well written, and he makes each of his stories credible. Perhaps most important, all of his stories are very, very interesting and hold the reader, at least this reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"L.A. Dood","review":"I read 'The Source' while I was an exchange-student In Peru during my high school years. I learned more about the religious conflicts in the world, and more poignantly, the Middle-East conflic that haunts the world still to today. Read 'The Source' if you want a good history on religion from the archaeological side of the equation."},{"rating":"2","title":"at a dig in Israel","review":"\\"The Source\\" goes slightly off Michener's usual track, because the history of Israel is revealed during the digging at the archeological site (fictional city ruins), where various items corresponding to different times in history are found, and the story is based upon them.The scheme, nevertheless, is similar to other novels by this author, the chapters based on important events from the point of view of one, usually fictional, individual. The characters in the further chapters are often descendants of the more ancient ones and references are made to the past.As usual, for people who want to get some knowledge about the area in the novel form, this is an excellent book. I have enjoyed this novel very much, and for anybody, who likes this author, it will not be disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Source","review":"The book was just as represented, and arrived in a timely manner, well prepared for shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely difficult to follow - flashbacks.","review":"This book was recommended to me to read prior to a trip to the Holy Lands. I gave up trying to get through it - very long and difficult to keep straight due to flashbacks to prior times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michners best","review":"This is one of Micheners best novels. I am waiting for more of his work on Kindle, such as Hawaii and Alaska"},{"rating":"2","title":"The large book on vacation","review":"When I am traveling I cannot carry large books. To have the book on Kindle is to have the book in a convenient form to enjoy it. THE SOURCE by Michener is large enough that one book lasts a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Should Be Required Reading in All Schools!","review":"This is one of those books that is simply amazing, interesting, and extremely educational regarding the history of the Jewish people. It spans from the beginning of time to the present time. Michener does the best job of researching his books than any other author I have ever read. I love all his books! Get this book, read it, and enjoy being educated! This book should be required reading in all schools."},{"rating":"2","title":"Several Novels in One","review":"I had read this many years ago, but it is worth reading more than once. I read it again just recently for the book club to which I belong. As always Michener does a superb job of weaving fictional characters into historical facts. Fascinating read. I recommend it to everyone, especially those interested in the history of Israel, the Jews, early Christians, the Crusades, Arabs, Turks, and the various empires that dominated the area around the Sea of Galilee and Jerusalem from the time of the cavemen up to the time this book was written. Even though it was written decades ago, it is still relevant to what is going on today in the region. If I could give it more than five stars I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Finest Novels written","review":"I've read this book three times and it's still fresh and exciting. Michener's ability to blend fact with fiction is masterful. This book was written almost 35 years ago, but many of the issues raised towards the end of the book still apply in today's world. I highly recommend this book regardless of your religious beliefs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great for school...","review":"I, a child of 14 was forced to read this book for an honors english class (read book over summer, write essay over school), and it was not a good choice of the teachers. Personally, i don't find Judiasm too enthralling, I could barely read 100 pages of this book, much less more than 1000. I (as a common opinion among my peers) find this book very dry, and unless you're heavily into Judiasm, I would not suggest this book, although you may find it interesting, if in your spare time, you tend to read the encyclopedia."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Windy Disappointment","review":"A very long book, that's really a medium-sized book that's been relentlessly padded to outlandish lengths. Despite his massive success, Michener's writing also suffers from an unpleasant clunkishness -- his prose is anything but elegant. Frankly, halfway through, I threw the book into the ocean."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book wa the same thing over and over","review":"The Source, by James Michener, I found to be quite repetative. The story line has no twists or turns, and there are no suprises in the plot. Over the course of the book, the Jewish people who inhabit Tel Makor are killed, and then they rebuild. In my opinion, if you read the first chapter, you have read the whole book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Source of all Evil","review":"James Michner's the Source is without a doubt one of the worst books I have ever been forced to read in my entire lifetime. Not only is it boring and confusing, it is also very graphic and repulsive. One of Michner's main characters, John Cullinane is confused as to which religion he is a part of. He is also a chauvenistic pig (which could only reflect upon Michner himself). I would not recommend it to anyone, unless they were alive in the time period (9834 B.C.) that the Source began in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"It never arrived. I ordered it, paid for it to be sent to my cousin in the U.S.A., and although amny other books before it had successfully arrived there, I was told that it was an incorrect address and as such my order had been cancelled. Thoroughly disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bosch filters are quality","review":"I researched oil filters for my Honda minivan and read some very detailed discussions and analysis from people who had gone into great depth, and the best one they found was the Bosch.

Usually biographies don't interest me, they tend to be a little dry. But a book on Grant Green is a welcome to my shelves. The author gives a great, but brief, insight into the guitarist's life. She does this through stories from people who knew Green, this is the appeal of her novel. The discography section was a happy surprise. I get to see Grant Green through the eyes of the people who knew him the most. I just wanted more, that's all.The only question I have to the record labels: Why hasn't all of his music been re-released?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a Grant Green CD instead!","review":"Being a big fan of Grant's unique guitar playing, I've always wanted to know a bit more about the man behind the music. As far as I know, this is the only book about him. The book doesn't go into a great amount of detail. The discography and selected reviews are worth reading. I'd say your best bet to understanding Grant Green would be to spend the money you would plunk down on this book on a good CD of his- Idle Moments, Green Street, The Complete Quartets with Sonny Clark. Then you can really get your money's worth..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial, disappointing, unfocused.","review":"I was thrilled to find that a book about Grant Green had been written, so I ordered it right away.Big mistake. This book has almost nothing to do with Green. The author is Grant Green Jr's ex-wife, and the book is essentially about her and her marriage, not Grant Green. She doesn't seem to know a thing about jazz, or music for that matter. I felt ripped off.There's more substantial information in a single album's liner notes than in this whole book. Calling this book superficial is being kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"The soul of jazz guitar...","review":"This is a must read for all Grant Green fans, or anyone who wants a glimpse of what the 60's and 70's jazz scene was really like... How he got started in St. Louis, the years in New York at Blue Note, the good times in Detroit in the 70's, and that last fateful trip to the Lighthouse in the green Caddy... Grant was truly the heart and soul of jazz guitar and everybody, including Wes and George Benson knew it... Written by Grant Green Jr's ex-wife there are lots of personal stories from the folks who knew Grant best! Lots of the great Blue Note Album cover photos by Frank Wolfe too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Politics, Not Enough Biography","review":"I like Grant Green. I always thought he was one of the four or five top jazz guitarists of his day. He deserves a true biography, rather than the immaturish writing and same old liberal rationalisms for why Mr. Green failed and died young. His career failed and he died young becauee of drugs---no one's fault but his own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Latcho Drom","review":"Although I haven't seen the movie/video of Latcho Drom, the music on this CD is quite evocative, and takes you on the Gypsy/Romani journey, from their origins in India, right through to Romani music from Romania, Hungary, France and Spain (which is more like the sort of music I was expecting on this CD). I think you'd get more from this CD if you'd actually seen the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pattern for a winter baby","review":"We bought this seat last summer for our preemie son. For safety record, you can't beat a Snugride, but some of the patterns didn't exactly wow me. I wanted something sharp and gender-neutral, and this pattern (Lotus) fit the bill.After using this seat for five months, I can say that the fabric is quite durable. It is, however, not soft, and would probably be very hot in the summer (a problem the Metropolitan fabric also suffers from). The canopy has been very useful for keeping out rain, snow, and wind. The boot, however, doesn't really offer much protection.The infant inserts in this model are outstanding. When our boy came home he weighed 5 lb 4 oz and the inserts kept him secure quite easily. Adjusting the straps and moving the harness up weren't exactly easy but it was doable and still feels secure.We pair this seat with the Graco stroller frame, which you can't beat for price and ease of use."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best tub","review":"After trying 3 other types of infant and toddler tubs, rings, etc. with my oldest, I finally bought this one for our new baby. I love that I don't have to fill the tub all the way (saves water), but it is still big enough for him to splash around and play with toys. The lying down side worked great for the first few months, and now at 13 mos old he is still loving the sitting up side. Also, there's nothing pressing on his crotch area (like with the toddler bath rings). It's super easy to clean - no crevices or fabric to get moldy.Even with our tiny 5x6' bathroom we are able to lean it against the wall out of the way. When guests come, we slip it under his crib to hide. It is definitely worth the price, as you won't need anything other than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"BIG but GREAT!","review":"The bath tub is BIG but I like the size! I like that the tub grows with the infant. I do not use the plug on the tub because after I finish with the water, I lift one side of the tub and pour the water down the drain of my sink without any problems. This tub is perfect for my family!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very good, well-written manual. it is a must!","review":"I think that this product is truly a must for anyone taking business english classes, anyone working at an office, or anyone teaching an english class. this is the best manual there is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gregg Reference Manual is a Must Have!","review":"My staff already had a Gregg Reference Manual, but they use it heavily and we obviously needed another copy so that one would always be available.

I honestly don't like a single thing about this book. It is a required text for a class I'm taking this semester. I think this book is very poorly organized and it is set up really weird. The whole thing with numbering the paragraphs is very annoying and makes it hard to find what you need. Also, this book has a ton of examples. But it doesn't have anything in the way of step by step directions. It tells you how the document should look, but it doesn't tell you how to get there. I have talked to a couple of other women also using this text and they are just as frustrated as I am. A much more useful resources that covers a lot of the same material (especially in regards to punctuation and grammer) is the AAMT Book of Style.

First off, the characters are stereotypical and shallow. The author tries to paint a picture of division in social class, with the \\"skaters\\" and the \\"preps\\" (or whatever they're called in this book). Instead of accomplishing that, (like it was accomplished in \\"the outsiders\\") the book comes off sounding like it was written by a bunch of \\"punk-rock\\" wannabees.

She tries to deal with the effects of emotional abuse, but the heroine just comes across as a whiner.

I couldn't see how the hero had, in a four-month relationship, seen any good side to her - I wanted him to move on and find someone else.

Well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gemworld...Worthwhile Reading!","review":"In my opinion John Vornholt captured each of the characters very well. It was nice to see Reg Barclay play a major role in this two part book series. As I was reading I could just imagine being there directly in the story playing a part in helping the crew of the Enterprise-E try to save the Gemworld planet. It was also intersting for me to visualize the Alpusta, the Frills and the other inhabitants of Gemworld besides the Elaysians. It was in my opinion a book that I could not put down, to me it moved at a nice pace. I would recommend this book to any Star Trek and any fan of Reg Barclay or Melora."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't care for it","review":"This story should have been ONE book. The fact that it was split into two only dragged it out long past the sell-by date. There are too many characters--too many races-- in this book to keep straight, and after a while I just quit trying to remember who's who; they weren't all that important, anyway. You're familiar with the saying \\"his eyes are bigger than his stomach\\"? Well, this author's ambitions are bigger than his delivery. (In my opinion.) Bottom line: if this two-book story were chopped in half and fit into a single book, it would have been much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book gave me a plan for designing customer retention","review":"I heard Ms. Smith at a conference and bought her book to get more details on her 7 steps to designing an e-loyalty strategy.

I designed and implemented a customer retention program based on the book and our customer return rate has really soared.

It's a great book for businesses with websites that aren't successful, or for anyone implementing a customer retention program online."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remarkable light on the substance; disappointing purchase","review":"I read a number of the reviews here and was quite excited to read this book when it came in the mail. Much to my chagrin, the material was very light and pretty much common sense. There were no great insights and a remarkable lack of specific examples. The author discusses her suggestions in generalities, but does not support those suggestions with specific examples forcing the reader to long for clarification on exactly what she is trying to recommend. All in all, a disappointing purchase. This book may have been great in 2000, but today is obsolete."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Book I've Read All Year","review":"I'm relieved to find so many that have read this book agree with me that this book was BAD! Though I wouldn't have said it was because of the date this book was written, even in the 80's I would not have liked this book. The \\"hero\\" was a chauvanistic brute. We try to teach our young people that a girl can say no at any time. This guy didn't believe it pertained to him and could do anything he wanted. He treated the \\"heroine\\" like she was a child and that women in general had no brains and shouldn't be treated as such. Don't waste your money on this book. It left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I kept reading it to see if it would get any better; it didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Too Dated","review":"I enjoy Miss Krentz's work but found this book much to dated. The heroine was not conflicted but spineless and helpless in the face of the prescence of the alpha male. Although she considered herself assertive, she always seemed to be following orders even though she didn't feel that they were necessarily in her best interest.The initial love scene was too dated (i.e. the woman wants to say no but is so overcome by the attraction that she loses all sense of self -- actually common sense, I mean)and left a bad taste. I barely finished the book and next time probably won't read anymore of Miss Krentz' earlier work. I should have known, as I had a similar response to Ghost of A Chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"I couldn't even finish this book and I have most of the Krentz books. The heroine was a wimpy fool and the hero wasn't any sort of a hero. He was just abusive. Sheesh!I ran into this same problem with the re-issues of Krentz under the Stephanie James name. Foolishly, I bough the first 6 because of Krentz's reputation. Won't be buying any more of those old issues!But it's nice to see how well she's risen above those earlier books, isn't it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book To Be Avoided.","review":"I purchased this book because I am familiar with the author and usually enjoy her books. A big mistake this time. The plot is thin, the characters are unappealing, and the relationship between them is unhealthy. The male is portrayed as obsessed with the female lead. I am a social worker by profession and I read romance novels for relief and to depressurize from my job. I do not want to read about relationships that are abusive. Frankly, I would be frightened of a man that wanted as much control over my life as this \\"hero\\" wanted with his \\"heroine\\". I understand that this book is actually a book first published in the 1980s. Ms. Kranz is capable of writing entertaining books and she does so under several pen names. She should forget trying to make a few more bucks on her old books and write some new ones. If she continues to reissue older books with plots and characters similar to \\"Man With A Past\\" she may find that her name will no longer draw readers like myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible time warp","review":"This is the last \\"old\\" Jayne Ann Krentz that I buy!Written in 1985, her characters are so stereotypically cast that Icould barely stand it. There is no complexity and there is nobackbone. The age of the meely mouth woman who plays at working andis almost raped by a man that she then professes to love - is over. Ilove Jayne's newer novels, her quirky repetoire and loveablecharacters but these old Harlequin/Silouette titles need to be foundonly in the used book store, not sold for twice the original askingprice just because the author has finally found her voice. I am nowforewarned to look inside the book and check the original date ofpublishing - just to protect myself from such mindless dribble.Straight out of a Bond movie - \\"Oh, James!\\" Shudder."},{"rating":"1","title":"We call this abuse these days","review":"I picked this one up in a used book store last year. I never got past the first two or three chapters before I threw it away (actually threw it away, something I have done only three or four times with the thousands of books I've read) so no one else would be subjected to it. Reading the full plot description provided by another reader makes me glad I did. This kind of controlling behavior has all the hallmarks we now look for in the abusive male. There is NOTHING romantic or sexy about any of it. Avoid this one like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass This One Up","review":"I read anything written by Krentz. I was very disappointed with this book. The couple were constantly arguing, and the man was a chauvanist. He was an overbearing character from page one. I would not recommend this book to any of her fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"FORGET THIS ONE.","review":"This story was awful. The \\"Man With A Past\\" demanded a great deal on trust and gave nothing in return. It takes more than \\"blind trust\\" to establish a lasting relationship. Forget this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"I have enjoyed Ms. Krentz's books for several years. This one, while not one of her best, is good fun. The hero, Cole, is very secretive about his past and refuses to answer any questions that Kelsey poses. He is evasive yet very strong in his desire for her. He wants a relationship based on trust, not the past. Kelsey, on the rebound from a disastrous relationship, believes strongly in communication and truth and wants to know everything about his past. She tries to break off the fledgling relationship when Cole refuses to answer her questions. They have some quirky adventures on a tropical island with a bear of a man named Valentine. The dialog is crisp and fast-paced. The characters are slightly off center, as are most of Ms. Krentz's characters. It is a fast read with just the right amount of tension, mystery and adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my....","review":"In most books, the hero of this one would be the villain! In fact, I have read many romance novels where the villain was exactly like Cole. It almost reads like a bad parody of a romance novel, with the hero certain that the woman belongs to him and determined to 'enforce' that. I can't believe this was reissued in the early 90's; the publishers should be ashamed. The opening chapters are frightening. How could JAK have thought this was acceptable even in the 80's?I love her later books, and I keep forgetting to avoid her 80's works..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"I would bet that JAK would love to have this book disappear. Unfortunately, that means it will probably be republished along with some of her better efforts. Somehow, our mistakes are always with us. Didn't Shakespeare say something similar?The entire plot of this book is one of an abusive relationship. It consists of a basicially insecure Neanderthal man and a submissive female.The book came as a shock to me after being fond of JFKs other books. The only thing this book deserves is being thrown in the trash. Probably to the great relief of it's author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass!!!","review":"What happened???

My primary takeaway is that governments are incapable of behaving on moral parity with individuals, and that they should not, and that looking to them to do so is a futile endeavor that misses the point of effective government.Current events and what they've revealed about our own expectations regarding how our government should react and behave indicate that Niebuhr's insights are as needed as ever. Although the place he gives to the League of Nations and Marxism in his arguments can make the material seem pretty dated, several of his conclusions are arrestingly prescient and speak to the basic soundness of his thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Niebuhr, a Nihilist?","review":"I have not read this book, so this is really just a comment, but I have recently read the excellent work Why Niebuhr Now? by the late historian John Patrick Diggins.Why Niebuhr Now?I recently read The Pragmatic God - On the Nihilism of Reinhold Niebuhr, by Professor Harry J. Ausmus, The Pragmatic God (American University Studies. Series VII. Theology and Religion) , a book that, strangely, has been universally ignored by scholars in history, philosophy, and religion. Ausmus contends that the logical consequence of Niebuhr's thought is nihilism.Why has this work published in 1990 been ignored?I suspect that Niebuhr scholars and others fear that accepting the challenge to examine Ausmus' thesis may just disclose some nihilism in their thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kessinger Publishing","review":"Buyer beware: Kessinger \\"Publishing\\" does not actually sell you a new printing of Niebuhr's book. What you end up with is actually just a photocopy of an old edition (in this case, the 1934 Scribner's printing). Unbelievably, it also includes page underlining and marginal notes, photocopied from a used and marked up version of the text. Apparently it was too difficult to find an unmarked text, or to white-out the markings when photocopying the text. If you want an unmarked version of this text, avoid the Kessinger version--you might as well buy a used copy of an actual printing rather than a photocopy of someone else's marked-up text.

For a company that prides itself on ergonomics, this is more than just a minor annoyance; it's a significant screw-up.I was aware of these reviews when I purchased, but I figured that the difficulty was overblown and a lifetime of great design would easily offset a few extra minutes of elbow grease. I was wrong. Spending that much time and various cleaning fluids to ready the product for its first use is really unforgivable. Worse yet, the residue is inside the cup, calling into doubt whether it's a good idea to let food products come into contact with the interior until all of the adhesive has been defeated.I simply cannot recommend this product to others until Oxo fixes this.

The only problem is, once lent out, there is never a guarantee of its return. But back to the review. As i stated in the title, this is the best book i have ever read. It all makes sense, in a different sort of way. By no means am I suggesting that one should adhere to it as one would a holy book such as the Quran or Bible, but it is a book by which one could live ones life, of understood properly.

The quotes in the book are numerous and applicable; I found \\"There is no such thing as a problem without a gift for you in its hands. You seek problems because you need their gifts\\" to be very insightful for me, for it presents advice that I can apply to my every-day life. Some of the lessons are controversial and some are frustrating, but this nature of the book creates an opportunity for debate and creative thinking.

It is certainly a book to keep close to the heart and read it again and again. Richard Bach wrote a great book and I can heartily recommend it to everybody who is willing to read and think about it because the more you think and put your own thoughts into it the more it develops from a nice story to something great to live by - like your own how to become a messiah session."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Will Change Your Life","review":"This is in simplist terms one of the greatest books i have ever read.

This is just a work of fiction.","review":"I have reads parts of the book and know the story. This isn't a review of the book itself, so much as a very abbreviated cautionary tale. At age 19, my old roommate read this book while he was suffering from a newly-developed and undiagnosed bipolar disorder. Read during a prolonged manic stage, he took the book too literally. Suffice it to say that it did not end well. We are not all possible messiahs, and we cannot perform \\"miracles\\" to alter the reality around us. If you want to attempt to prove otherwise, do so in a safe place, and with respect for those who care about you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Awesomeness!","review":"For those who wonder, yes, Richard is the remote offspring of the famous composer. It's true.A friend recommended this book to me years ago. It's a relatively short read, and it's totally worth it.It's the story of an airplane pilot who makes a living by flying people in his biplan. I don't recall exactly but I think this is all set in some wide areas of North America, above endless fields and stuff like that. Some day this pilot meets a really weird person, who happens to be a messiah, and that's when they start to travel together; this messiah has the same job, he also flies people in his airplane for a living.This strange messiah starts to teach his messiahnic knowledge, which includes passing through walls and other magical stuff like that, but most of all, it's a philosophical journey. There's a great collections of quotes in the novel, from a book called something like \\"Handbook to becoming a Messiah\\". Those quotes are really profound stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cute story as a vehicle for comforting New-Age ideas","review":"I must speak out. The emperor has no clothes!! I read the book and found it naive. There were some interesting ideas, but it was marred by lots of feel-good platitudes and factual errors. The search for truth is rarely easy. Most of us are not really interested in doing the work it takes to open up to life's beauty and sorrow. The beginning of the search for truth should be to question everything. God, soul, soulmate, magic, telepathy. Ask yourself why you find these ideas so compelling? Can you be honest with yourself? If you are really after truth, read the brilliant philosopher J. Krishnamurti's 'First and Last Freedom' or 'The Book of Life'. (They can be found on Amazon.com) Contrary to what Bach preaches, it is NOT choice, but rather un-choosing, un-prejudiced AWARENESS of what is that leads to true insight and love. Perhaps this book inspired the spiritual seeker in you. If so, are you open minded enough to continue what you started?"},{"rating":"2","title":"7 Thunders \\"An very GIFTED person\\" ;)","review":"This B**k is an one of an kind.

Some of the assertions among the scattered rabbit ...: if you are unhappy, it's your own fault; likewise, if you are sick, poor, miserable in any way; physical limits to your world are the result of your rigid thinking, not any laws of nature; death is a trivial transition from one phase of existence to another.I would normally stay away from this genre but a book club made me read it. We burned our copies of the book rather than reselling them to spare anyone else the misery of reading this rot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay Book","review":"This book really confused me.

I first came across this while looking midlessly through my local \\"spiritual\\" bookstore and ended up reading the entire thing in the next two hours.As a fast read, with a simple, concise message, this book lacks nothing. It isn't dated, unless you consider religion or spiritual ideas dated. Richard Bach creates a story that can effect you as much or as little as you want- but it teaches the precepts of becoming a messiah yourself and helps you to view Jesus, Christianity, God, and yourself in a brand new light.Needless to say, this is a five out of five. Buy it today and then give it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lifetime companion","review":"I read this book 17 years ago. I was 19. I remember this book gave me guidance thru hard times. I have been reading it once in a while, every 3 or 4 years, and the magic is that the book grow up with me, teaches me about new things, depending on my specific situation. Somebody said in this reviewers list that this is Life 101. I agree; I like that definition. This is a book that will teach you about life, no matter your religion, your social background, your IQ level. This is a basic message about how to live and enjoy the life.

But extracting concepts for living will take a lifetime. On the surface this is a piece of light fiction. Deeper, it is a guide to looking at the world in new ways.

It is along the lines of \\"Way of the Peaceful Warrior,\\" however, gets the same point across much more quickly. The unique thing about this book is the passages in italics from the character's Messiah's Handbook - Reminders for the Advanced Soul. If you just open the book up at random, the right passage will jump out at you. This book also emphasizes the importance of discovering/beginning a spiritual journey for YOURSELF, not for anyone else. A quote from the book (one of many, many) will forever stay with me, \\"...depending on people to care about what I say is depending on somebody else for my happiness.\\" The price is a small amount to pay for such a tiny book with big messages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlighting","review":"This is probably the 20th time I have read this.

The messages are very relevant and the story is interesting. I love Richard Bach's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Illusions, a masterpiece","review":"\\"Illusions, The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah\\" is a thought provoking look into life on earth and beyond. Two pilots, Don and Richard give people quick flights for three dollars a ride. Their simple career ends up being a journey into the human soul. Don, the messiah is here to teach the unknowing Richard about the ways of the world and the universe, and inform him he too is a messiah. The book portrays the events the two men go through in order to discover all of the lessons that Richard needs to learn. Every few pages or so, quotes concerning life lessons pop up and offer Richard and the reader inspiring knowledge about the world. This book encompasses spirituality, but mainly offers a glimpse into the human mind and spirit. I reccomend this book if you like novels that make you think, and not simply cheap entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply amazing","review":"I seriously recommend everyone to read this book .

Good addition to the library of evolutionary thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"great if you know what you are going to find","review":"This is a book for those who have left its mind to much tight with social, moral or fear rules. It's not an apology to anarchy but a decided bet for openess of mind. Written in mistic like fashion fantasizes with your beliefs to bring to you to reconsider every fence you have decided you can not cross in your life.I don't think it's against religion or faith, indeed a faithless reader might find its arguments just more incredible.I strongly advise any reader to just linger into the book as if it were a dream a then decide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I have actually read this book so many times, that I've needed to purchase 3 different copies because the others were a little worn. I won't give an over-view or anything like that. I think that different people who read this book will get different things out of it. Some may take it literally (hopefully not) and some may take if metaphorically. As a reviewer said \\"Not Only A Great book, but a great way of looking at life.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I read this book after Jonathan Livingston Seagull and it is sort of a continuation of the ideas expressed in that book. This story is about a mechanic turned messiah, who escapes the crowds demanding miracles and answers by 'barnstorming', flying an old plane into farmer's fields and offering people plane rides for a few bucks. That is how he meets the author, who also barnstorms. Free from all the constraints of the modern world, the two pilots share the same field and form a fast friendship. The messiah begins to teach the author his knowledge, and helps him to understand the way the world works. Again, the theme of belief in self and achieving the impossible is present in this book. Although with fewer metaphors, Illusions presents more questions and ideas than Jonathan did. A very powerful ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"you will love this book","review":"The world would be a much better place if everyone dropped what they were doing for a while, and read this book. Then we could remind ourselves how we can better our lives, and possibly the world. Every once in a while the reader will come across a quote from the \\"Messiah's handbook\\" that will possibly bring them to a revelation about there own lives. For instance, \\"You teach best what you most need to learn.\\" what does this quote mean to you? Certainly this book will broaden your horizons, as if you were up there in the Travel Air 4,000 with the ex-messiah Don Shimoda, right there learning with the messiah-in-training. Not to mention the storyline is both humerous and magical. You will definitely appreciate the humor between the relationship between the two messiahs. So read this book, and become your own messiah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Word of mouth","review":"This is the kind of book that you will hear about eventually if you are exploring your self-awareness and the nature of your being.Illusions introduces some very complex ideas and presents them in a competely digestable format. Whenever I meet someone who is interested in delving past the surface and exploring their awareness this is usually the first book I recommend. Persons reading it will be entertained while also being challenged to think in a way that is so subtle it is almost unconscious. Illusions is similar in that regard to a movie like The Matrix or Vanilla Sky. I give it a rare (for me) 5 star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shouldn't messiahs do more than make screwdrivers float?","review":"You can't imagine my relief when I discovered that nobody in my bookgroup liked this book. If they had, I think I would have had to quit that group. This book was shallow and did not do justice to the title of messiah. A true messiah is about much more than making random items float, having vampires materialize out of thin air, and dying a predictable and annoying death. Being a messiah is about being countercultural and addressing the injustices in the world. This book drove me up a wall and it nearly went out the window many times. The only reason I finished it was because we made a promise to finish every book before our meetings. I would have given it a zero star rating, but it didn't go that low."},{"rating":"1","title":"The commercialization of spirituality","review":"Upon finishing this trite book I felt I had been had by yet another corporate motivational speaker.

I wish there was a way to select NO STARS. I have to give Bach credit, though. He's managed to get rich off of this dewy-eyed claptrap. No small feat--quite a clever slight of existential hand, actually. But it's all smoke and mirrors. I'm sure glad this book was lent to me, and that I didn't waste a dime of my own money on it. Yuck! Double Yuck! Triple Yuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow, shallow, shallow...","review":"This book is a shallow amalgamation of poor theology, a fourth grade understanding of Aristotelian metaphysics, Buddhism for fun and profit, and a healthy dose of 20th century American low ball individualism. While being marginally entertaining on the most superficial of levels, this little book's argument utterly falls apart under any serious consideration. Save yourself the trouble and go read Hafiz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Illusions","review":"This book is a good fictional story, but if you want truth I would suggest a more realistic book. As far as inspiration goes Bach tries to influence the lives of his readers by explaining that they can do anything. If you have beliefs in past lives and fantasy beings this is the book for you. Bach mixes a man who can do anything and the last days of his life teaching another man about the illusion of the universe. On a personal note I do not believe in what the book teaches. I would like anyone who reads it not to just accept everything it says as true, but think for yourself on what is and what is not correct."},{"rating":"1","title":"An enormous waste of time","review":"We read this book for bookclub and, even though it's a quick read, it was nevertheless excrutiating. At the end of the group, I threw my copy in the fire in the small hope that I might save just one person from wasting their time reading this steaming pile. This is hands down the worst book I've ever read - you can get the same life lessons from your average Barney video in far less time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a load of crap","review":"Sorry to disagree with my fellow non-messiahs out there, but this book is not worth the little time it takes to read.Yes, it's in interesting look at the complications of the human soul and psyche. It's also wrong. If you're a pantheist, or at least a universalist, you might find confirmation of your beliefs here, but for the rest of us, it's New Age tripe that borders very precariously on the blatantly heretical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Philisophical ambrosia for the open minded","review":"This book is absolutely stunning. It has marvelous quotes (every time you think you've settled on a favorite, you come across another, even more sublime.) Really shocks you into looking at the big picture.

Not recommended reading for the closed minded and those with no fire in their hearts. The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah...truth/ consequence, reality/fantasy,fiction/non-fiction== they are all relative to the perspective. I have read this book countless times and only enjoy the story and the delivery more.

This is beautifully-written, with poetry interspersed with prose, as well as a neat look into hot-air balloons. Is altruism an important trait in a person (might you let a vampire/wompire bite you, so he could live)? Do you need another person to show you the way, or just to ask the right questions of you? What does it mean to be lonely? So many thoughts in so few pages of this excellent book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bach's Reluctant Messiah","review":"The ideas in this book were fascinating and freeing. The author's powerful message was basically that we are in control of our own lives, and the power to do whatever we want and be whatever we want is in our hands. His Messiah, the pilot of a bi-place barnstorming the Midwest in the late 70's, has decided to quit. This twist of the plot itself is part of the message - that we are free to \\"quit\\" the responsibilites put on us by others in order to be true to ourselves. I didn't think the book was particularly well-written - it was sometimes choppy and unclear. But the author's point transcends, and the book is well worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Richard...where is you?","review":"Okay....I like this book. I like all of Bach's stuff. I was glad to hear that he'd managed to purchase most of his work back from IRS seizure. This only goes to prove that no matter how much good Karma you've got or how great an understanding of the Creator and his Universe, there's always that one reality check waiting in the corner to trip you up.I sent a copy to an ex wife who's into the Celestine Prophecy, Eckhart Tolley thing. She really enjoyed it but she also claims several \\"psychics\\" have informed her that she's presently on her 39th reincarnation and that this will be her last run on the planet.It's a good, thought provoking read if you don't attach to much to it.

With his level-headed, nonchalant mannerisms, Shimoda delivers countless (often ambiguous) lessons to a skeptical Richard Bach.Posing as a fellow aviator, Shimoda accompanies Richard as he travels from state to state, offering passers-by ten minute rides in his biplane. Richard immediately realizes that this is no ordinary man, and his life-altering lessons soon begin. A journey of self-discovery commences over the pastures and cities of rural America as Shimoda guides Richard to understand that what he perceives to be reality is in fact an illusion.Prepare yourself for a new way of thinking, as Illusions will leave you reconsidering your outlook on existence; what is real, what is possible?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like to think?","review":"This book by Richard Bach, will if anything, make you THINK!

I kind of thought it would be more spiritual, but it is just some nonsensical passages that seem too obvious to be profound in any way.Richard rides around in a plane with Don, who also has a plane. They discuss random things. Richard looks up to Don and Don tries to teach him the ways of becoming a Messiah. At one point, Dracula is conjured up in an image and then just exits the scene. I guess this is to prove a point, but it just doesn't seem to flow with the rest of the book.Okay, so the point is everything is an illusion, or you know, we make our own destiny, blah blah.

The \\"how to\\" spiritual guide is both thought provoking and constantly inspiring. The mere suggestion that one has the ability to control one's own destiny is a source of encouragement in a world that seems quick to take as little responsibility for actions as possible and often seems about to spin out of control.

Do I cause my own cancer? I don't know, actually. Maybe at some level that I'm not in touch with, I do. But I do believe after reading Illusions that, as Abraham Lincoln said, \\"A man can be as happy as he makes up his mind to be.\\" This book tells me in simple terms that people, places & things don't make me happy.

I felt Leyla's coming out scene was very moving - particulary her father's reaction. I do not like Leyla's line to her mother, \\"Well I don't accept it!!\\", however. I think this is a key moment in the film to think about....I look forward to watching Lisa Ray and Sheetal Sheth in future performances.

First of all it's too short so if you are looking for some tummy control look somewhere else!

The fabric is the same as a bathing suit but without the tightness or thickness, it is very thin. I'm 135lbs but after 3 children (3 c-sections) I was looking for some tummy control without having to wear a giant pair of panties that go half way up your body and then roll down while you are wearing them (not to mention having big panty lines!)If you are looking at this as a support bra, forget it, the fabric is too thin and flexible to lift or support anything.In my opinion if you have a great body, much like the models and want a comfortable tank to wear under clothes or around the house and don't mind your tummy hanging out, then this is for you. People will think you are wearing a bathing suit top though (with no bra liner)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I expected","review":"This cami is just like any cami you would wear with any outfit.

Although the reviews here are very positive that's not what I've read elsewhere, so it wasn't really a film that I was obsessed with tracking down, but I saw it at my local video store and gave it a go. The first thing I found is that it's much funnier than I expected, one of Allen's funniest in my opinion. The humour in the film is something that isn't even mentioned in a lot of the reviews I've read elsewhere. Also, the atmosphere is perfect and the sets are amazing. Talk about a movie living up to it's title. The music is also very effective, not just the standard old jazz/pop tunes he seems to use in every single film he makes. It also has one of the best cast's he's ever assembled and everyone performs well, except for maybe Malkovich who seems a bit awkard.It may have been passed over by some critics, but SHADOWS AND FOG is a must see."},{"rating":"1","title":"KafkaMania!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is one of the very worst movies yet made by the King of Self-Indulgent Cinema, Woody Allen.

But here, with the exception of his trademark nervous, manic, neurotic that I always love to watch, he falls way too short. Lily Tomlin, Jodie Foster & Kathy Bates all deliver the most dreadful caricatures of prostitutes. Madonna is, well Madonna. John Malkovich is his usual pretentious self. John Cusack is wasted. The only bright spots are the always reliable Donald Pleasance & Julie Kavner, both who exit way too early. An interesting enough story but with way too many holes & nonsensical scenes of forced hilarity.

This book made me wanna put it down after 20 pages. The more I went on and the more I hated it. At the end I could have burnt it. Being able to make a nicely articulated display of the English language doesn't necessarily mean to be a good writer. The story has no plot whatsoever and we only see this stupid boy growing older while the frog he carries in his stomach keeps on being his sexual alter-ego. By the way the story is presented, it is supposed to be a fairy tale, but in this it is totally unsuccessful and it ends up being neither this nor an adult look at the sexual awakening of a young French boy.

Shot on a shoestring budget way back in 1994, BALKAN RUNNER has a stiff and pondering script full of holes (like how did the hunky hero get unhandcuffed from the dominatrix's claws?), a talentless cast, and a score reminiscent of a 70s cartoon series. Daisy White is certainly lovely as is Isabel Russinova, but their emotional range is that of a rutabaga. Paced incredibly slow and with no exciting sequences to brag about, BALKAN RUNNER is one of those movies you've never heard about, and rightly so!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An unpretentious time-killer","review":"Partly filmed in the relatively unexploited environs of Sofia, Bulgaria, \\"Balkan Runner\\" is an unabashed B-movie whose makers have no more ambition than to churn out a passable time-killer for those undemanding viewers who have time to kill. It's undistinguished and utterly forgettable but it's competently photographed and edited and it sports an easy-on-the-eyes cast with both male and female eye-candy. Ex-boxer turned actor Stephane Ferrara has two bare-chested bondage scenes in which he's repeatedly punched in the stomach in an attempt to force information from him. The second of these scenes involves Daisy White who knows that the most vulnerable part of a man's anatomy lies somewhat south of his stomach, and it often responds to something other than punches. Most of that action, however, takes place off-screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wicked Witch of the Middle East!","review":"This book tries to present Ashrawi (a Christian Arab woman) as a voice of reason.Unfortunately, Ashrawi's support of Islamic terror has put her squarely against both Christian rights and women's rights. Her role as education minister for Arafat has helped destroy the rights of a generation of Arabs. And if what she's done to her friends isn't bad enough, you might want to see how uncharitable she is to her enemies. She's a voice of irrationality and destruction. It's a shame that it will take more than a Dorothy from the Middle West to undo the damage she's done.Christians are fleeing the Middle East in droves, and Ashrawi is part of the reason.

The cast is bland and forgettable. The villains are obvious and phoned in a mile away. The battles are chessy & corny at best. The Animation is so-so at best. The story is tired and done to death.

The white top was crooked, and the metal legs don't mount flush. I feel like if they gave a little more effort and care into this product, it would be a great item. It's just disappointing how poorly constructed it all was. I really wanted to love this stand, but I ended up just finding it acceptable. For the price, it functions and raises my monitor.

While Tim Ferris tells you that you need to reduce the time required to handle paperwork and other tasks that come up, Davenport tells you how.

But more then anything else it made you realize just about how much \\"stuff\\" comes your way on a daily basis. To have a system that acknowleges such a large amount of \\"stuff\\" is important for your sanity. She also helps you realize that although we have a list of \\"to-do\\" items- they are usually things that must be done with no larger purpose. She suggests to incorporate in a heart-line or a single task a day that will help you move towards a much larger personal goal.I would recommend it as a read- but take her advice with a grain of salt.

This is a great hour of tasty low fat recipe's, snack ideas and she cooks everything while talking in her kitchen. Charlene has a great sense of humor (she could easily do a cooking show) and her recipes are easy and look really good! Some of the info is a little outdated - like having to take the skin off the turkey before cooking to reduce the fat content (in one of her later workout videos she said she learned about the membrane around the bird that keeps the fat from soaking in to the meat so you don't have to de-skin it) but for the most part, the information is great and still relevant.

They point to the arguments and fudging and messiness that make up emerging scientific knowledge and say \\"See! To understand where this knowledge comes from, you really need to understand all this social interaction.\\" But they never venture out with the natives to see the elephants' graveyard for themselves. Which is not surprising as it may takes years of study to know the right path to get there.

It is either there or it isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting but ultimatly pointless","review":"This book is very interesting and would be very valuable if it had stayed with criticism of the History of Science and how it's presented in text books. However, the authors' insistence that scientific fact is built by consensus independent of the facts of the world is contradicted by their fear that defense lawyers can deconstruct sciencetific evidence. I don't see why they would be worried about jury's ignoreing evidence unless they are affraid guilty people are being set free.

Don't bother making the effort though. Banks was always at his best as a collaborator, a member of the collective group. As a solo artist, he struggles too much to identify a clear musical identity. The fact that he hired such a lifeless, untalented vocalist, doesn't help matters. To find Banks at his most creative listen to any of Genesis' efforts prior to Steve Hackett leaving the band. Selling England by the Pound through Wind and Wuthering are in particular, oustanding recordings. A Curious Feeling is not among his better efforts.

Poor Tony Banks, he just can't put out a solo album. I bought this album when it first came out way back in '79 hoping for an 'instrumental Genesis' album. Wrong! Forgettable songwriting, below-average vocals, and just kinda dull. I sold the album to the used record store in 1979, now when I listen to the samples again 30 years on, well, it hasn't gottten any better. Perhaps the 'Genesis brothers' (Tony & Mike) should call up Ray Wilson and put out a progressive Genesis album? Not gonna happen.

My low rating is for the digital remaster, NOT the album itself. I stupidly lost my old, hissy, probably-mastered-from-an-LP version of this classic. So, I picked up this new version, not paying much attention to the \\"digitally remastered\\" part of the album.Look, when you've heard this album as many times as I have, the subtle use of echo slapbacks, phase shifters and distortion becomes part of the song. It doesn't even sound right without the tape hiss. This new version is cleaner, quieter, and has less \\"obtrusive special effects\\" to \\"allow the instruments to be heard better\\". Yecch. I hate it. I have the same problem with the digital remaster of Jethro Tull's \\"A Passion Play\\" too, for all the same reasons.

As it is, it is very satisfacroty for a small room. It has no moving parts other than a valve, does not need frequent cleaning, and provides essentially sterile mist which is especially beneficial during winter months. One minor drawback is that it does gurgle quite loudly and that takes getting used to. When on high, it gobbles up the water and needs to be refilled three or four times a day, and will barely make it through a night. But on low, it easily provides enough moisture for a small room.

Plastic is good but the way it is supposed to slip together somehow doesn't really work.

The first day I assembled the deck box on my 3rd floor condo balcony, a gust of wind blew the lid open, causing the nested sides to shift and the entire thing to collapse. This in turn caused the soft plastic \\"hinges\\" to bend out of shape, and now whenever I open the lid, the nested pieces pull apart.

This box was easy to put together (with the help of my 6 yr-old daughter :)). It's very sturdy, and does not fall apart when opening lid (if put together correctly). I have had a very strong wind open the lid, but that was remedied by a large clip through the lock hole. This box replaced a flimsy Keter box -- which got severely damaged from hail.

I had to have my husband help me with a few of the screws, because the plastic had indentations for the screws but no holes.I'd have liked this deck box to be a little bigger (my fault for not measuring).

Assembly was much mor difficult than expected since the holes in the base need to have their knockouts removed with a hammer and screwdriver. You'll also need a pair of pliers to work the knockouts loose to remove them.

It may still be useable if used to hold stiff cardboard reference materials, but thin sheet protectors need to be able to slide over all three rings.I am therefore disappointed with this binder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Initially I was very happy with this product. I bought this for my 11 year old son for school. It is very easy to open and shut the rings and the binder itself was nice and sturdy. However, only after 1 month of school, the bottom ring does not shut and the middle one now has a small gap. My son has to carefully flip each folder and notebook in the binder, which like most 11 year old boys, patience is a little difficult. Therefore, folders and papers are starting to get ripped. My son is careful with his property, he has not abused the binder. I will have to buy another binder and I am only one month into the school year. Very disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good All-purpose Binder","review":"What can you say about a three-ring binder? Well, this one is pretty handy and easy to use.

I bought this on a whim in the hopes that I could possibly go from roughly 15 women per 1\\" binder to possibly 20. These binders are indeed heavy-duty, and with the 2-inch binder I can easily fit 35 women for each binder. The clear pocket allows me to make cover pages and easily organize by hair color, body type, culinary skills, and general moodiness. I did not give this 5 stars because I did notice that the inner pocket tends to stretch after a fair amount of use, particularly with the larger framed female group.

The binder is sturdily constructed and seems as though it could take a fair amount of abuse. It has all the basic features one would expect, including flat-sided rings that enable it to hold more paper and to handle page turning more effectively than round rings. The ring mechanics work smoothly and do not seem like they would break or misalign (a common problem with many cheaper binders that have cheap ring units). There are 4 pockets rather than the standard 2, which is nice, since more pockets equals more storage and organization. I also like the fact that this binder is large enough to accommodate dividers, so as that the tabs do not stick out past the cover.All in all, a nice product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome binder with one-touch opening!","review":"As far as binders go, I always thought it was kind of hard to get worked up about them. Until I tried this binder. It has a nice weight to it, so you know it isn't just going to fall apart at the slightest thing. The outside has a clear protector over it so you can insert papers on the front and back and also the binder edge. There are also multiple pockets in the front and back to hold things. But my absolute favorite part of this folder is the fact that you can open the rings with just one touch. No more prying them open using both hands. Just use one finger and push the button and it easily opens all three rings at once. With the two inch diameter rings, there is plenty of space to organize school papers for all three kids.This is a truly great binder and I would highly recommend it and would definitely buy it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good quality","review":"It appears to be made well and should last for quite a while. The rings are super easy to open and they are large enough to carry a great deal of papers/folders.

It could be my busted, hooptie of a TV, but any time the English subtitles were more than 2 lines long, I couldn't see the last line. Still, you can guess what they were saying from context. I love the way that there's a burgeoning body of films about gays in Eastern Europe. A film major could probably write a great paper comparing and contrasting them.

You're familiar with the saying \\"his eyes are bigger than his stomach\\"? Well, this author's ambitions are bigger than his delivery. (In my opinion.)

Many examples have been noted in other online reviews, but it's worth mentioning some of them again: the overwhelming focus on \\"ex-pat\\" hangouts, the author's love of foodcourts located next to train stations, and the compulsive need to mention that we can find McDonald's, Starbucks, Subway, and so on in Taiwan's major urban centers.What's left behind in all this is the astonishing beauty of parts of Taiwan, the compexity of its history and its social formations, and the genuine warmth of its people.To Lonely Planet: please find someone who actually cares about this place to research and write an edition that Taiwan and its visitors deserve!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still A Handy Tool For an Ex-Pat","review":"Although I have been living in Taiwan for nearly 16 months, I still take LP Taiwan Guide along for weekend trips, and even jaunts to nearby cities, regardless of how many times I've visited.The information is vast, for major urban areas as well as more out of the way locales.

I loved it the first time I heard it, and I still love it. It's musical and atonal simultaneously, it's wild and controlled at the same time. I am a big fan of Captain Beefheart, and love almost all of the stuff he recorded, (but not all of it). And I don't get how some reviewers are calling this his \\"punk\\" or \\"new wave\\" phase music, his stuff all sounds original, can't be categorized, and the ultimate litmus test is that he has his own \\"sound\\" no matter when he recorded any of his albums, you hear it, you know it's him. As for each individual song, it's better to just listen to the CD in its' entirety, instead of going into individual reviews of each song, 'cause its' all of the same ilk. Quirky rhythms, offbeat poetry, swamp blues, Beefheart madness."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece","review":"One of my desert-island discs. When I recommend it to people, I encourage them to listen past the angular rhythms and dramatic vocals to perceive what is my favorite quality of the record: its atmosphere of joyful creativity in a relaxed communal setting. Picture the Magic Band working out these tunes in the sunny living room of the Captain's California digs and you'll see what I mean. (\\"Double Nickels on the Dime\\" by the Minutemen, another beloved classic, also has this cheery vibe. Buy it today!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Original assured fantastic!","review":"This album is my favorite Beefheart cut. This is him at his most assured. The production is perfect and the band is right there making this difficult music easy. With Trout Mask Beefheart had to mutate his blues musicians to get what he wanted. These guys grew up on Trout Mask and there is an easy joy in their playing. The use of mellotron is startling. Beefheart is very painterly with his music and once you get past the initial shock of his supreme originality you find an invigorating life affirming beauty. The sleeve art by the Captain will give some indication of what is inside, if you see something in it then try the album. Favorite tracks: \\"Sheriff of Hong Kong\\", \\"Sue Egypt\\" and \\"Brickbats\\". Has to be one of the greatest recording artists of the century."},{"rating":"2","title":"When it came out...","review":"The Ex and I happened to catch the good Captain on SNL (back when it was funny) when punk was new to the scene and this album was newly released. Her previous experience with the Captain was to catch a small piece of Trout Mask, then buy me a headset for my stereo. The band came on doin' Hot Head. \\"This guy created punk,\\" she said. \\"Yup. Lots more, very bulbous.\\" Later on Cap performed Ash Tray Heart. We were dancing, and her eyes teared. I pulled out Trout Mask, and she still loathed it. By the time I got this record home, she'd left. I still think we'd be together today had she stayed and danced to Ash Tray Heart again. I still dance to it. This music is immortal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-inflated ego..","review":"Somebody bought this book at my company. I already had a bad feeling as I read the feeble attempt at a poem at the start. As a newcomer to BizTalk, I'm looking for something practical to get me started building new systems and really understanding what makes such systems tick. All I found was pages and pages of abstract waffle, which left me with the question; so what? This is supposed to be a \\"complete technical guide\\" - a technical guide to what? on how to bore programmers perhaps, certainly not on BizTalk.

The book has lots of B2B examples that just recently died off with the dot.com crash of 2000-2001.

Unlike other books, which throw the kitchen sink at you immediately, this book focuses on first the slap and muted notes along with bass lines using the technique, then the pop along with bass grooves using both slap & pop, then hammer-ons, pull-offs, even a little double popping. The layout of the book is logical and helps one get comfortable with each technique before introducing a new one. I like that each chapter has one bar grooves, two bar grooves and four bar grooves. The CD that accompanies the book is very helpful and gives you the opportunity to practice the bass lines at the given tempo with the CD. 5 stars for this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"drew","review":"From his livejournal site to his corrupt.net site to toothpaste, drew has never let me down.

It was his earlier days of being famous. I LOVE Rush...even though I disagree with him on many issues...still, no one can articulate the issues from a conservative view generally as well as Rush. I noted a change in his woman bashing after he remarried. I know he is divorced and has been through the fire now in 2006. NOW is when Rush needs to write a book.I don't get to listen to him much any more, but I think you'd find the same views written in a very different way...a much better book.

I forgot how funny he could be. For any serious Limbaugh fan, this is a must! Issues change so fast in the political world, it's interesting to go back and read \\"The Way Things Ought To Be\\" and hear that \\"spotted-owls\\" were once at the top of the agenda! In addition, Rush's books always have a \\"timeless\\" theme when he talks about hard work, entrepreneurism, and the American Dream. His critics should look at Limbaugh's \\"true\\" record: from several firings to world renown entertainer (if that's not the American Dream, I don't know what is). I highly suggest dittoheads pick this up, as well as \\"See I Told You So\\" (Rush's 2nd Book) and \\"Bob Cobb's Dittohead Bartender's Guide\\" (Not one of Rush's books, but just as funny). Conservatism is not dead in America, and Rush Limbaugh's popularity will continue to exhibit that fact.

Courtesy of Goebbels, this nonentity spouted hatred of Britain, our independence and democracy, all the while claiming that he was a better patriot than those of us who were fighting to defend our beloved country from Hitler's aggression and tyranny.

Blind men are trying to describe an elephant. One man grabs its trunk, another its ear, another its tail, another its leg and so on. Each thinks he's describing the whole elephant and that the others are just plain wrong. Blind man Rush has done a very good job of describing the elephant's left nut and I'm in general agreement with his description - but it ain't the whole damn elephant. To my mind Rush's political philosophy (If I can use such a weighty term to describe Rush's incoherent ramblings) is to a large degree reactionary, motivated primarily by nothing more than anti-liberalism. And by continually taking the most absurd examples of left-wing lunacy it's really no challenge to discredit it. Nor is it very useful to continually dwell on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Guy, Bad Book","review":"While I do not agree with many of Rush's opinions, it is impossible to deny that, in some cases, he presents them with great skill. However, in this book it was almost impossible to find the opinions worth hearing.

I am a Republican who has been disillusioned by the party's takeover by the extremist right-wing. Perhaps I will join the masses of Republican voters who are, in record numbers, flocking to their local governments to change their party.

The writers background is apparently that of a disk jockey. Most of the book is rather anecdotal and all over the place. The jokes are laboured and long winded.The attraction of the book is hard for an outsider to see. It probably says something more to people caught up issues.

It all comes down to a weak last stand against the Germans only really seeking a loot of fine art in the basement of the building the Americans and civilians are all holed up in.Some people may like the feel of the movie (those who know very little of what happened in the ETO) but I personally wouldn't watch the movie again.Dark and uninspiring and bit strange."},{"rating":"1","title":"pointless","review":"For the 1500W of power that it draws this provides about the amount of warmth that a vaccum cleaner provides by friction on a carpet.

I would recommend one where you can change the fan setting to go at all times on low without the thermostat stepping in and ruining a good warmth.

Also also the front heat control knob says \\"off\\" you cant really turn it off without pulling the plug out of the wall, rather inconvenient.

I've read technical books, personal accounts and everything in-between. But NO book, before Nobody Nowhere, could tell me what it's really like to be autistic. Donna Williams has an amazing gift for writing and describing her experiences in living detail. I was so engrossed in this book; I could hardly put it down. Williams' is a haunting story, but one that now serves to help others. I am so grateful she wrote this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It explains many things.","review":"I don't personally suffer from autism but I know many people who do and this book helped me to have a slight understanding of their lives. It also helped me to appreciate my life; I always used to think I had a hard time, but reading about Donna's experiences has helped me to put things into perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Demystifying autism","review":"Donna Williams' Nobody Nowhere is the Rosetta stone of autism. The author is an autistic herself, and her autobiography gives you a very good idea of what it would be like to be in her skin. She gives plausible explanations for common autistic behaviors, and offers some fasincating hypotheses for causes and contributing factors for this syndrome. And she offers advice on how to communicate with an autistic person with respect and without overwhelming them.This book is an invaluable resource for parents, siblings, and doctors of autistic people. But it has found a much wider audience, with good reason. Nobody Nowhere is a gripping tale, related in an honest and straightforward manner. It is the story of one woman's triumph over what fate has handed her, and her determination to move beyond her handicaps. You cannot help but be moved by her story, and inspired by her courage and determination."},{"rating":"2","title":"inside the head of autism - one person's journey","review":"I was mesmerized the first time I read this enchanting book; not only was the subject matter interesting and well represented, the selection and particular combination of word choice makes beautiful reading.... she could write about underwater basketweaving and make it magical, so stunning is her prose; I use excerpts from this book with my students as an example of beautifully written, highly descriptive (in an innovative way) writing. She takes the reader on an intense, personal journey inside the mind of autism and rewards them with a new comprehension and understanding. I love the way she so matter-of-factly expresses internal thought processes using such original language. This book provides a new appreciation of verbiage for readers and will whet their appetite for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Autism via Donna Williams","review":"I read all three of Donna Williams first books, starting with this one. For someone with autism or anyone else, she is acutely articulate, with words, I thought. As I read on, I found many things that pertain specifically to her abusive upbringing and I would not recommend her books as mapping out autism, because her ongoing resentment of her childhood experiences clouds the issue of autism. She would be better off working through her own anger of her early life than maintaining her self professed expertise on autism. Also, her sense of superiority and disdain of what she condescends to as \\"the world\\" was objectionable. I found her very self absorbed (but that is not autism), and superior minded. Personally I would rather read Temple Grandin for insight into autism, a far cry from the annoying personality of Donna Williams. (If I ever hear the reference of being a'fruit salad' of personalities again I will scream.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disappointing","review":"The content of this book was truly engaging, but the author's disjointed manner of writing and her constant display of self-importance put me off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Christmas","review":"I suppose the book is not for everyone, but if you have an interest/soft spot for old English Christmas traditions & tales, it's a very nice read.

Hillage and Miquette Giraudy here weave a complex, drone-based tapestry of ambience for an installation/chill-space at a UK music festival in 1977, but later artists of the rave-oriented ambient scene (such as The Orb and The KLF) grabbed onto what Hillage and Giraudy did here for their seed-sources, with The Orb clearly in acknowledgement of their debt as Dr. Alex Patterson was a collaborator/remixer/producer with Hillage and Giraudy's System 7 project. But System 7 really begins here, according to Hillage, with these two side-long flowing works of pure guitar and electronic tranquility.

But I'm not sure if it's the cables, the game or my tv but the characters seem a lot more pixelated when the Wii is in HD mode with these cable attached. I'm trying them with Wii sports since I lack any other games at the moment. Even the menu screen seems more pixelated and grainy.

So i considered these $3 cables just to see if the picture can be improved. I compared the video quality before (with stock RCA cables) and after using the new cables. I plugged in the Component cables, put in Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword, the difference is night and day! The colors stand out more and aren't blurry like they were with RCA cables. Even though the WII isn't HD but the game surely looks like it now, its still running 480p but its a nice 480p. Other games look really nice!

First of all, the cloth is very unusual-looking, with long threads in clumps that look kind of furry. Secondly, when using the cloth it has a very strong chemical smell. I'm not sure if there is something the cloth is soaked in, but it does not smell pleasant and made me wary of using it. Finally, it did not remove my eye makeup at all. Not even eyeliner, let alone mascara. Any washcloth will get off blush and powder, which this one did adequately. However, I feel like I wasted my money.

I have to say I was very disappointed. I am always excited to try products from companies who offer a more eco-friendly alternative, but this product just doesn't cut it. I don't wear heavy makeup, and live in a humid climate so I sweat most of it off by the end of the day anyway. However, the Wonder Cloth did not remove any of my mascara-normal everyday mascara, not waterproof or extended wear and wouldn't even touch lipstick on the days I wore it. I started to break out after about a week of use so to see how effective the cloth cleaned I swiped my face with a witch hazel soaked cotton ball after using it and was appalled to see considerable makeup residue still left on my face. The cloth is VERY slick and therefore doesn't seem to \\"grab\\" the mascara or makeup residue off the face. Instead it just seems to smear it around. A plain wash cloth without makeup remover did a better job at removing makeup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful score","review":"I am confident that Pride and Prejudice would not have been a box office success had it not been for Marianelli's score. For those with a trained ear, the understated and yet powerful pieces were the highlight of the movie. For those without musical knowledge, the ebb and flow of the music, tied in perfectly with each scene, still heightens the sensation and emotion of the film. For instance, \\"A Postcard to Henry Purell,\\" with it's stirring violin performance, creates the mood for the dance shared between Darcy and Elizabeth - a mood of seduction, and yet hesitation...perfection. Many other pieces have the same affect - as the other reviews have pointed out in detail. The music is a joy to listen to on it's own, although I dare say that with the change from one song to the next, you will also visualize each related scene from the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome","review":"This cd was simply enchanting I listen to it in my car and any other time I feel stressed!!!!!!!!!

However, knowing the orignial story I can imagine it to the music or even just enjoy it for what it is, great music. I highly recommend this cd. My personal recommendation is that if you have the software to take out the beautiful scenery in the movie, then make your own movie set to the soundtrack backround. This way you can enjoy only what you want of the movie, accompanied by this wonderful music."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this soundtrack","review":"This is my most favorite movie and to find the soundtrack was awesome I so love this music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pride and Prejudice movie soundtrack","review":"We love this CD.

The music is simple, delicate, and just lovely. This is the only CD that affords me comfort on those nights where I can't sleep because my head is pounding. It's also wonderful to listen to while working or feeling in a contemplative mood. The work the composers did on this album is truly appreciated."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Score?","review":"Am I listening to the same soundtrack as everyone else? I found the score of this film amazingly bland with each track having an average running time of 2 minutes. There's no substance, very little style, and at times is unbearably slow. What little color is there is very thin and pale and the \\"orchestra\\" (made up of perhaps five instruments) seem to just peddle along in a quick vignette without any time to reach a climax. I understand that this is a Jane Austin film and am not looking for a \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" theme, but similar period films have been able to achieve soft music with depth, emotion, and substance. After hearing the first few tracks I was unbelievably bored and could hardly force myself to finish the CD. I'm definitely passing this one up for a \\"real\\" movie score. This hardly qualifies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent work","review":"I've seen this movie several times, and I found both the movie and the score to be magnificent. The music suits the movie very well and was excellently composed and performed. It captures the spirit of the movie and it suits the times, flowing with the movie and enhancing it. It is one of the few movies found where the music stays with you, as in Harry Potter, the Chronicles of Narnia, the Lord of the Rings, Pirates of the Caribbean, and others. I would recommend this soundtrack to anyone who enjoys classical music at all, and perhaps even to some who don't. I would also recommend it to anyone who plays the piano--even if you don't play classical, you may find it helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure serenity","review":"As a huge P&P fan I had high hopes for this soundtrack and I was not disappointed.

Overall, I would recommend this product to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it","review":"I really liked the movie and decided to but the album. I play the album when I am at work because it's tranquil, heart-swelling tracks that are very individual and unique.

I thought it was worth the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good music! Need a few more credits","review":"As a string player, I did enjoy the music in this collection though it is \\"piano heavy.\\" Pianists should really enjoy the sheet music for this soundtrack. Marianelli wrote some beautiful pieces.I only wish that the liner notes would have given proper credit to the three English country dance tunes in the collection. I did a lot of extensive research to locate the original titles and composer. These were orchestrated by Dario Marianelli for the film, but all were originally written in the late 1600's by Henry Purcell. Here are the original tune titles:#4 Meryton Town Hall - \\"Tythe Pig\\"#8 A Postcard to Henry Purcell - \\"Moniek's Maggot\\", also known as \\"Rondeau\\" from Abdelazer Suite#11 Another Dance - \\"Kit Kat Club\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"She Loves It!!!!!!","review":"I Bought This For my Wife.

The solo piano pieces are my favorite compositions, particularly the first track on the CD, \\"Dawn.\\" Overall, the music is light, relaxing and romantic. It's always a disappointment that most of the tracks on movie soundtracks are only a minute or two in length (or less), but that seems to be the trend with all film scores these days. Still, the \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" score successfully captures the romance and dreaminess of the film. It's a great CD to play in the background when you're curled up with a good book or are just in the mood to relax."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soundtracks","review":"Classic meets Romantic music style. Simple harmony with a beautiful \\"legatto\\" melodie. Nostalgic and peaceful music. Great soundtrack!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"It is hard to come across a soundtrack that completely captures the essence of a book or movie. This one, however, is an exception. The music from this soundtrack is absolutely wonderful and simply beautiful. There are a variety of songs on it, too. There are the soft piano and orchestra pieces such as \\"Dawn\\", \\"Liz on Top of the World\\", and \\"The Secret Life of Daydreams\\". There is also period music like \\"Meryton Townhall\\", \\"Can't Slow Down\\", \\"A Postcard to Henry Purcell\\", and \\"Another Dance\\". Other songs (\\"Stars and Butterflies\\", \\"The Living Sculptures of Pemberley\\", \\"Georgiana\\", \\"Arrival to Netherfield\\", \\"Leaving Netherfield\\", \\"Darcy's Letter\\", \\"Your Hands Are Cold\\", \\"Mrs. Darcy\\", and \\"End Credits\\") are equally excellent, and bring you deep into the world of Pride and Prejudice. The entire soundtrack of Pride and Prejudice can be enjoyed of the movie, the book, or those who have no affiliation with either."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Match!","review":"In short, this is my new favorite CD to listen to while painting, driving, writing and working on any thing at all. I am writing my next novel as I listen to this work. The music puts me in a good mood to be sure. I oft cannot help but recall scenes from the movie while I listen to this soundtrack and so I can relive the movie even when I am too busy to get a warm cup of something wonderful and put my feet up to watch it for a couple of hours. I adored the movie, even though it differed from my expectations: better in some ways, a little lacking in others (though it gets better and better with every viewing) and it has not replaced but only added to my other 5 hour BBC P&P movie miniseries. More Jane Austen is always good. The only thing lacking in this soundtrack are one or two missing songs that I loved from the movie. But then again, and after all, I cannot truly complain, for there is so much ear candy in this modern work of classic genius. This is truly a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soothing memories","review":"I recently have developed an addiction to anything Jane Austen, especially anything to do with Pride and Predjudice. While I prefer the A&E production as opposed to the more recent verison, I prefer this soundtrack over the A&E verison. The lilting melodies bring back memories of the movie but are also very soothing after a hard day at work. I listen to it on my way to work to peacfully begin my day and then on the way home to relax my mind after a long day. I have enjoyed listening to the piano forte solos \\"immensely\\" (Jane Austen's influence)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie and music","review":"I bought this record for my daughter. She loves the movie and the book. In fact Jane Austin is a favourite writer of her. And I must say that I liked the movie too.

Number 15, \\"YOUR HANDS ARE COLD,\\" is just so... OMG is that Mr. Darcy walking across the fog shrouded field???? See? The music is THAT good. Highly recommended. Love it (and the film).

I have not had any problems with any other software. Therefore, be aware that this recorder may not work on your computer as well. I am giving a two star rating because 1) the claimed selling point is not working. 2) Panasonic has terrible customer service with this product. No support information on this product on their website. No response to e-mail inquiries. Called them, I was put to wait for 40 minutes and then kicked out. Their customer service let me feel angry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this recorder","review":"I bought this recorder for the purpose of recording meetings. The recordings needed to be transfered to my computer. All in all, it's a wonderful product. The reason for the bad review is in the difficulty (nigh unto impossible) of retreiving your recordings if you should happen to lose the CD that comes with the recorder. Panasonic's tech support is horrible at best. There is appearantly no way to replace the needed software or drivers via mail or download. The best solution I was given from Panasonic's technical support was to \\"buy another one, copy the CD and return it.\\" Aside from the dubious legalities of that suggestion, I recommend not supporting a company that doesn't support their products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recorder OK but can't share the sound files","review":"This is a versatile recorder but it is NOT recommended to anyone that wants to send their recordings to other people or even keep their recordings for the future. The recordings can only be read and edited using a Panasonic software (Voice Studio) which is incompatible with anything else. If you want to save your recordings in mp3, first you have to save to .wav using the proprietary software, then transform wav to mp3 using another software. On top of that, if (as it happened to me) you lose or damage the CD with the Voice Studio installer, there is NO way to get a copy from Panasonic or anyone else. It is absolutely mind-boggling why Panasonic would not offer this software for free, as you cannot use it unless one buys the recorder first.Bottom line: if you want to keep your recordings in a computer, make sure you buy a recorder that records directly in a known format (preferably mp3). Do not buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Recommend this or any other Panasonic Voice Recorder","review":"There is nothing wrong with the hardware. It is a fairly straight-forward implementation. My beef is software.Panasonic records in a proprietary format. It requires proprietary software to transfer your recordings from the device to any computer. Panasonic no longer supports the software, has not updated it for any operating system post Windows XP and provides no support for any other operating system (Mac OS, Linux, etc).Since this device is clearly abandoned by Panasonic, they should release the source code for a reference driver that would allow others to write drivers for it (Linux, MacOS, more modern Windows versions).Panasonic clearly does not want to support their customers. That is a real shame as I am now very unlikely to consider any Panasonic product in the future. I will also attempt to influence anyone else that I can do do the same.Do not purchase this or any other Panasonic products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't ever bye anything from panasonic cheap ass","review":"Don't ever bye anything from panasonic cheap ass, i have a hard time to find the driver, send email call and no thing in respond."},{"rating":"1","title":"no software support or driver downloads on site.","review":"Product works OK for the price.Problem is that I lost the software and after a computer crash I am unable to download the info.

The software for the program is great, as long as you only want to use their sound file format. You can convert to .wav, but the sound quality it dramatically reduced (and background noise amplified). It's also impossible to share your sound files with another person...or it might be, but I've been unable to find a way to save the recordings to cd. If you plan to use this for minimal use in a disciplined environment, than this might be the one for you. Otherwise you might want to shop around some more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - Panasonic is Unprepared to Provide Support","review":"I bought the RR-US360 one year ago for my son to use at college to record and download class lectures. When a hard drive crash required that I reload drivers, I found out the hard way that this product class is not one Panasonic takes seriously. Driver link on website leads to dead end. Three calls and multiple transfers to tech support lead to dead ends and total frustration. I had to multiple time explain the concept of a USB driver. My recommendation is to find a company serious about their product.(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding sound quality","review":"I do not know about this model, but if you don't need to download sound files to your computer and all you want is a pocket sized digital voice recorder with excellent sound quality and ease of use, then Panasonic's identical looking cheaper model RR-QR160 (less than $50) is the ticket.

Turns out Panasonic has decided specifically not to support this device on Vista, so if you bought the RR-US360 recorder and now have a Vista computer, you are out of luck! You can't copy new recordings to your Vista computer, and you can't listen to old ones! Thanks, Panasonic, for selling a product and not supporting it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Panasonic not suitable for professional dictation.","review":"This recorder has high quality sound but the features do not make this suitable for professional dictation. In particular, it is not possible to rewind a dictation to make corrections, and once the stop button is depressed, there is no possibility of further editing. For these reasons the Olympus DS-330 is a better buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Propriatory Audio Format is BS","review":"That's really all that needs to be said. I bought it assuming it recorded in MP3 format, like most recorders do these days. I bought it specifically for recording ambient samples to be used in my music. Because there is no way to convert it to mp3, and Panasonic refuses to write software that allows that conversion, the product is entirely useless to me.However, if you just use it for class notes or something and don't mind the crappy software that does come with the recorder, you'll be fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Lose the Software!!!","review":"As was stated earlier, the recorder only works with the included software because it records in a proprietary format. After upgrading our network and having to create new user accounts, the software no longer worked and said it needed to be reinstalled and I have since lost the CD. Again, as stated earlier, there is nothing on the panasonic site that helps. I call and they want $25 for the CD, plus $8 shipping on a device that costs $70. Terrible, terrible customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great recorder - horrible computer interface - no customer support","review":"I really like my Panasonic Digital Voice Record, as far as recording and playback go. I've been using it for years. However, the proprietary file format means that you have to use the software that comes with the device, which is not compatible with Windows Vista. Since my old computer died and my new one has Vista, I no longer can transfer the files to my computer. Panasonic provides terrible support. According to their technical support on the website, the device is not compatible with Vista, and they have no plans to make it compatible. Also, they don't have the interface software available on the support page, so if you lose it, you're out of luck.Unfortunately, I'd be very hesitant to buy another electronic device like this from Panasonic again due to their lack of support."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY- PANASONIC WILL NOT UPDATE TO WORK W/ VISTA","review":"Hi, I've had this for a year. My computers crashed, and the \\"Voice Studio\\" software made by Panasonic, is not compatible with Windows Vista. I contacted Panasonic, as they did software updates for some of their recorders to work with the most popular operating system, Windows Vista. They sent me an email they are not going to make this recorder compatible with Windows Vista. Therefore this recorder gets one star, for not being supported, since it is only a year old. You can not download the recordings without using their software. Other recorders by other brands may let you connect by USB, and you do not have to use their software to download and access your recordings.

What I realized is that I needed to be able to see the process over and over until I felt I really understood it. With a video, it is easy to replay the segment as many times as you need. Often, taking a derivative is not even the real problem; rather it is simplifying the answer down to the final form that I needed more help with and this DVD really helped with that. Jason offers numerous samples from the various ways that you need to take a derivative so that you can easily see the process and apply it to your own homework.

Anyone who can condone behavior that clearly destroys children's lives is off."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just didn't get it","review":"I just didn't understand this book. It just didn't make sense.

I like this for a pick me up snack."},{"rating":"1","title":"not licorice that's for sure!","review":"These are more like a very chewy, slightly hard fruit roll-up. It doesn't taste at all like red licorice or nibs etc. Cherry is slightly better tasting than the strawberry. We threw the whole case we had to buy away because no one would eat them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tasty treat","review":"My 6-year-old daughter is allergic to every artificial food color. That makes it difficult to find tasty treats for her. These have a wonderful natural strawberry flavor. They are not super sweet, just right. The reason that I had to give them 4 stars was for the texture. They are a bit hard. Mind you, it did not keep us from eating all of them. Maybe actually it is a good thing because it made us take longer to eat them! I am actually coming back now to try the raspberry vines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like twizzlers","review":"I was kinda disapointed when I ate these gluten-free vines. They taste kinda blan. They have a plastic taste, they could have more flavor and a little more sugar. The texture wasn't bad.

This album makes you want to close your eyes and \\"take the trip\\" into the songs, it makes the hairs stand up on my neck and head whenever I listen to it! Everybody I play this album in front of WANTS IT, but here in Australia, without a credit card, you CANNOT buy it for LOVE NOR MONEY....

To be honest, I totally regret it and in fact, I think they should have either added this directly to Amazon Prime or paid me to watch it for wasting my time. I've never had anything bad to say about anything before, but the acting sucked, the backgrounds were fake (the skull backgrounds were pretty, even though you can easily tell the actors were superimposed on them), the sound effects sucked, the plot was horrid and the makeup was terrible. I don't think this movie even deserves be called a \\"B\\" movie. It also stole a lot of lines (\\"Don't bring a knife to a gunfight,\\" \\"I'll be back,\\" etc.) and plot from a lot of other movies (like From Dusk to Dawn, the Howling, Vampires, Blade, etc.). Unless you are a glutton for punishment or you need a good laugh, don't even bother with this until it goes to Prime."},{"rating":"1","title":"westwing the complete series","review":"Wow, what a joy it was to actually get my hands on this wonderful series.It is everything I thought it would be, except that after season four, English subtitles are no more.

It's so much better than the set I bought for a higher price a couple of years ago for myself (mine didn't include the book filled with synopses of each episode and the pilot script, although it was supposed to--I didn't get it from Amazon). Now I'm so envious, I almost kept the new set for myself. Those two books are great additions to the set. We get hundreds of cable TV channels, but there are many evenings when there isn't ANYTHING I want to watch on TV. So I watch West Wing episodes in order. It's unbelievable how well these shows hold up--even the political conflicts are basically the same. The writing, the cast, the humor, the drama. Maybe the best TV show ever. Even my lame set was some of the best money I ever spent. The set from Amazon is better and less expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully presented","review":"Could not be happier with this set - have not encountered any of the difficulties enumerated in the 1 and 2 star reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best series ever","review":"It's one of the best seeries of TV history and it is edited in a DVD edition as good as the series. Great value."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST PRESENT EVER!","review":"Good presentation box, flipping through the booklet of episodes with descriptions and pictures made me more excited. Reading the commentary by Aaron Sorkin and the Pilot script in the second booklet made me laugh out loud. Watching the episodes brought back the same excitement, hope and overall good feeling that I got weekly years ago. The ultimate gift for West Wing fans!! Must have!!! I can't get enough of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Series","review":"This is a fabulous series. I did not watch The West Wing regularly so it is really nice to see it in order by season.

From the pilot to the final episode, I made sure to watch the original TV show, and then watched the repeats in syndication. I am just starting to review TWW by way of this DVD Collection and enjoying each scene. If only we could have a POTUS like this one portrayed by Martin Sheen, not to mention TV dramas with such impressive writing! I've got my bowl of popcorn at the ready whenever I pop in a disc! I recommend this set to anyone - Democrat, Republican and Independent - before or after the November election."},{"rating":"2","title":"West Wing","review":"When my order came, I was thrilled with the look of the packaging, since I have coveted this series from the beginning and used to rent DVDs as they came out, but my rental store only carried the first two seasons. I am enjoying the accompanying book outlining the various episodes, and like the commentaries.The only thing I am VERY unhappy with is that the front flap with the seal came unglued and required repair.Thank you for shipping so fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent choice","review":"This is a great selection. Not only does the set have all years of the series, but it also has interviews with key personnel which really add to the enjoyment of the episodes.

Not only is it entertaining, but also informatative as it shows you a little about how the executive office of our government works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best written show -- ever!","review":"The West Wing has to be the best written show for television ever. Not to mention the stellar acting and directing done consistently throughout the series. This unparalled quality endures the times with great story lines and character development that are rich with detail and ripe with irony. I recomment this DVD collection to the die-hard fan as well as to the uninitiated."},{"rating":"2","title":"TV History...","review":"This program has been an inspiration to me from the moment I first watched it to the final scenes. The mix of humour, drama, tension and education (and that's usually in the first five minutes) consistantly results in episodes of pure quality.The Complete Series Collection is everything you ever hoped for and much more. The quality of the packaging has been so well thought out that it just oozes Presidential class and the bonus material is the icing on the cake. I had bought one of the other single season sets but when I saw this, I knew that it was just exactly what I was looking for.Any fan of the show should invest in this. They will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sorkin/Schlamme's Best","review":"I don't think this show needs any more piling on; it's spectacular. If you haven't seen it, see it.As for this boxed set, I haven't looked at seasons 5-7, but the other disks are all just repackaged versions of those found in the original single season sets, with all of the same special features, menus, etc. I've found the case itself to be a little ill-conceived: the tabs for each season get bent if you turn the box over, cardboard disk slots aren't the best way of holding DVDs, It's physically large and heavy, the booklet is large and a little difficult to fish out from the top of the box. The inclusion of the script from the pilot is a nice, if unsubstantial addition.Bottom line, it's a cheap way of getting all of the DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"West Wing series, Christmas gift","review":"This was a perfect gift for my grown son for Christmas.

I would rate it 5 starts.Aside from the fact that many of the discs would not play correctly on several of our disc players/laptops (we finally bought a new DVD player and that solved THAT problem), the first 3 discs of season 3 were entirely missing! We didn't discover that until after the 90 day return policy. We are on season 7 now, the last season of the series, and when we sat down last night to watch the second disc in that season, it was labeled correctly, but it contains episodes from season 6 that we already saw. I can only hope that the rest of the discs in season 7 are ok. Noticing other reviews about the English subtitles, I will add that the set we got did have English subtitles through season 4 or 5 but then that was no longer an option.I would not do business with Moms Video Store again due to the defective nature of the set of discs that I received."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty DVD set","review":"I purchased this DVD set exactly a month, for my husband, who's a huge West Wing fan.

We just started to watch it in may. There are already two CDs that do not have anything on them and the DVD player and computer both say the discs are blank. We have not gotten through the whole set. I can only image how many are blank. I was a bit worried when the CDs came in a round case instead of the Complete Series folder. It seems like the seller has burnt CD to make more copies of the original. I have also emailed the seller to see if I could return the set but I have never heard back. I suggest very strongly not to buy from this seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed and Extremely puzzled","review":"I very excitedly open the Amazon shipping box only to be shocked and dismayed at the condition of the Box Set inside. The left side was torn and completely separated from the front. The \\"folder headers\\" were bent. There are dents on the underside of the top flap. The dvds are in wrappers but the wrappers are all bent and hanging out of the folders. There is a sticker on the front of the box that when peeled off, takes the covering with it.This is not a New product as was indicated on the order.A call to Amazon will net me a return box and a refund of my money, but I have to order the box set again. This one came from Chaim Fisher.I am surprised Amazon does not have more quality control. I hope they take notice and look into their relationship with Chaim Fisher. This was not a new product."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best","review":"I, personally, consider \\"West Wing\\" to be the best television series to ever come down the \\"pike\\". The dialogue was superbly written, the direction brilliant,the deep character development and interaction was done at the highest level.The plot lines were entertaining as well as informative and often dealt with current situations. A \\"fictional\\" depiction of what Jeffersonian democracy is. I like to think that if Thomas Jefferson had seen the series he would have applauded it. Again,in my opinion, this is the best work Aaron Sorkin has ever done, and that is saying a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show, poor packaging","review":"We are big fans of the West Wing--it's a terrific show.

If you figure that's about $4.50 per disc. The west wing is one of the best dramas ever, if not the best. It ran for seven strong seasons, including three after creator Aaron Sorkin left the show. Even in those three seasons it was better than any other drama on TV, and at the end of the seventh season, after they knew they were going to be cancelled, the writers tore out all the stops and did everything they wanted to do by the time the show ended in about 6 episodes.

The big difference is that the DVDs here are single sided (4 shows per disc) while the individual season box sets are double sided. I think that makes this set just look bigger but since the price it better than buying them individually it does not matter. The quality seems the same.+ Good price if you want more than one season+ Good packaging- First season quality is ok (but what do you expect from an old TV show that was filmed 4:3.- The contrast seems a bit washed out at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Gift","review":"I already own The West Wing, and my friend, Valerie, always said that I had to leave it to her \\"in my will.\\" I made a mental note of the fact that if I ever foound the series at a really good price, it would be the perfect gift for her.

I have noticed that quite often when a series is reducedby 50%, we will see the BD version coming out very shortly. Still, I am purchasingthis show because the price is just too good to pass up.

The disks came in perfect packaging and the cases are good. There was although a problem. The episode guide was very nice in finding specific episodes fast and easily.One big letdown was the fact that seasons 1-5 have English, Spanish, and French subtitles, but seasons 6-7 did not. I have trouble hearing some words in the show so until season 6 the subtitles were a lifesaver. I in fact stopped watching the DVD's to watch TV reruns which did have subtitles. I think if you liked the show or want to try a new show (and like politics!) this is the best show to watch.To be honest the pilot scrip was just a big waste of paper. I cannot possibly imagine what you could do with the script in typewriter font.I would buy this again but the subtitle problem was big as was the waste of pilot script. If you are a fan of the show this is one to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice show but not so good quality packaging","review":"As mentioned before by others, there were scratched discs in the set that came to me, now awaiting the new replacement, hopefully no more scratched discs.Today when watching season 6, discovered there were no english subtitles, which is strange as the amazon desription of the individual set of season 6 has got english subtitles. How come my set got no english subtitles, is it their production forgot to add in english subtitles?!

Although, especially King Crimson and Gentle Giant are more technically skilled, VDGG made rock history in their first period (four albums, between 1968 and 1971) with some of the most beautiful flute and sax driven songs ever.

VDGG is an interesting band and it's worth having their records in your collection, but I wouldn't expect one to listen to them non-stop. Their performance is pretty good but nothing extraordinary. Hammil's composing skills can draw the same kind of praise, it's pretty good but nothing outstanding, besides his musical themes are often similar, in the same key (Darkness and White Hammer for example, pretty good tracks by the way), and it's quite noticeable after a couple of listens (only the Rolling Stones managed to massage the first 3 notes of Satisfaction to produce a dozen hits without being put on notice for self-plagiarism).

Now, my return window has expired, and I'm stuck with these stylus for which I have no use. Okay, so this is a, rather odd gripe, but the fact that I cannot store it in my DS while not using them, is annoying. In fact, that's the only reason I bought these.

It could have been a lot better without some of the eye-rolling metaphors and silly characters whose bodies seem to be able to perform some pretty super human feats in the bedroom.

I was basically expecting another movie on the level of The Mask of Zorro or The Thirteenth Warrior. What I didn't expect was the intensity to which I would be glued to the t.v. set. Especially since he was not portrayed as a sexy leading man figure. I was blown away by the story line and the performances by all the actors involved. The political and religious views were very well expressed and came across in such a way to really make you stop and think about the world wide repercussions that could develop should such an event occur. I personally stayed on the edge of my seat until the very end of this movie. I recommend it to anyone not looking for a mindless, pretty faced, lovey dovey flick. It is one that you will find worthy to tell your friends about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best Movie","review":"While The Body does raise some interesting theological questions, it wasn't a well put together movie.

The movie would have increased its level of credibility if the central actors portraying members of the Church were not either going insane, hiding the possible truth in an insideous way, or throwing off their collar in contempt for the Church.

Hollywood formula gone mad.The dialog is stilted and stupid. There are scientific, as well as storyline, inconsistencies, and it is, overall, a boring movie.There is one highlight.

It's too bad that they had to ruin this with yet another Hollywood assault on the Catholic hierarchy and the type of political naivety those Hollywood clowns are so well known for. Using the name of liberation theologist (an attempt to smuggle Marxism into Christianity) Gutierez as the main protagonist is another nice touch. The idea that we can have a God who is involved in some parts of our lives but not in others is a nice job of liberal swindling and a good way to avoid responsibility for our actions. To Hollywood: Come on get off it guys. Could you please give us something worthwhile for once? By the way, if the Catholic church were to sell out to political squabbling, they wouldn't take such a hard line on such ethical questions as abortion and human sexuality; instead, they'd just do what all our \\"courageous\\" American leaders do and \\"take a poll\\". Nice Hollywood.

I do give credit to the screen writers for altering the book's plot to completely write out the role of the Soviets in exploiting the possible discovery of the unresurrected body of Christ. Of course, the book was written in the '70's when the world was deep in the Cold War so this element would be meaningless today. First off, I had trouble understanding the characters since everyone had heavy accents from several different languages. The movie plodded along without ever capitalizing on this rather novel concept: a discovery so powerful it could profoundly alter politics, the balance of power, and, of course, religion forever.

If you can find the original book get it and read it (I unfortunately gave my copy to someone and never got it back and have been unsuccessful in finding it in ANY bookstore). Do yourself a favor - pass on this movie. In the book the characters are lead to believe an incorrect explanaition for what they found.

My dog weighs in at 45 lbs so that is three teaspoons/day.So if you want to feed your dog a powder treat with meals then go for it. If you're looking for something to reduce tartar then keep looking because this won't do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Also Great As A Toothpaste!","review":"We've been using this as a paste to brush our dog's teeth by just adding a few drops of water to an amt of product to create a thick consistency.

In 2006, it's pathetic that this PC game would be released without joystick support. Ever try to fly a plane using a mouse and W-S-A-D? It's not a pretty picture. As far as I'm concerned, the game is unusable and should never have been released. And try to send an email to Ubisoft to tell them what you think.

It was the only strategy part of the game.I got the feeling that the creators of the game just wanted to throw something out there for the 360 without much planning or thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame! Lame! Lame!","review":"This game could have been cool, but they dropped the ball. Were they trying to make a flight sim or a cartoon? When I first saw it I thought: Cool, 42 flyable planes and not just the obligitory ME 109 and mustang. But then I saw that you had to \\"earn\\" the ability to unlock all the planes. I hate that!!! I see the reasoning for that in a racing game, but I should be able to pick aircraft/mission type in a flight sim. The absolute worst part of the game are the obnoxious, supposedly funny, radio chatter. I know for a fact that allied and axis pilots DID NOT insult eachother via the radio, they did not speak their adversaries native language, and they did not all sound like Col. Klink. A real combat pilot would have been too busy using his radio for communicating with his wingmen, tower,etc and NOT hurling annoying, childish \\"insults\\" over the radio.

The graphics and game play are pretty decent, but quick manuevers will cause incredibly bad screen tear. The control methods are unusual and require a longer than average learning curve. It will take a couple of missions to get used to flying the planes effectively. The game overall is fun to play and the variety of aircraft is great, but the poor control layout (which is unchangable) and horrific screen tear during extreme dogfighting drops this game to a 2 star rating. Should cost $30 at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOWN IN FLAMES","review":"This was my first WWII dogfight game and it stunk for the following reasons.1) The game is repetitive, fly around take pictures or shoot/bomb a target.2) Xbox live support for this game stinks! There is nobody to play against for this game. The players know it stinks and don't even bother to play anymore.3) How many times can you hear the same crappy taunts from the A.I. in this game.4) The A.I. stinks. Your squad mates are just plain stupid. I found myself yelling at the T.V.5) The time restrictions on the various missions are ridiculously short. I found it close to impossible to complete missions. I eventually gave up on this game after spending countless hours attempting to master it. Playing the same scenarios over and over again!Which leads to6) I have been through most of the game and I have not gotten even one of the 1000 Xbox 360 Achievement points for all the time I waisted. The award system put in place is just as crappy as the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Positives: Ubisoft is known for their outstanding graphics. --And this is why I bought it.Negatives: Oh, let me count the ways. Controls are terrible. Camera angle(s) and instruments are a disaster. Annoying radio chatter that actually confuses by leading one to believe the objective of a mission is actually something else. JUST READ EVERYBODY ELSE's review.In short, I am extremely disappointed with it. Played it for 2 hours just to get up from the chair and wanting to punch into the wall with frustration.

A story of one familie's history dating back to the 1400's and how their ancestor's sacrfices continue to play a part in the character's modern day lives. Although the book was sometimes difficult to follow due to jumping from 1400's characters to the present day characters , it still drew me in and made me anxious to find out more about the familie's deep history. The history lesson (which is based on true historical facts and a true family)intrigued me and peaked my interest in to the lives of the Jewish people who were forced to hide their faith for so long. Though, the love story was a little far fetched, I still found the book to be a very interesting and satisfying read."},{"rating":"1","title":"More on Hannah Mendez","review":"Wow!

Nothing could be furher from the truth. With the exception of the initial quote from the original manuscript by Hannah Mendes, the book is a florid, over written, content-free piece of fluff.

The way the author goes back and forth between the past and the present makes it very interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ghost of Hannah Mendes","review":"I was disappointed in this book. I had expected an historical novel juxtaposed with a present day moral crisis from a Sephardic Jewish perspective. While the storyline follows this format, the character development is extremely weak and the romantic relationship development reminds me of a Danielle Steele novel. The story centers on two sisters and a grandmother. We are not even told which sister is older, and are given limited insight into their childhood. I am almost finished the book, and am still waiting to get to know and to care about these characters. I had hoped for much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review-Ghost of Hannah Mendes","review":"I have loved every other book by Naomi Ragen. But this book was justplain boring.

The multi layered story becomes more and more complex but it is livened up greatly by Tommy and Tuppence's witty banter, between themselves and also when they're scolding their manservant, Albert, who has been in every one of their books. I wish Christie had written more tales with this couple. Their adventures always seemed more realistic and possible. This one most of all will leave you reeling. It's final twist is a doozie."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm going to buy it right now!","review":"I first started reading this as a book report and didn't want to read it. Then I finally read it: This book is great for any type of reader. Whether you have not read a book in a while or read all the time, this book will suit you. The plot is so interesting you never want to put the book down. It might be a little hard to follow at first but once you begin reading, you will fully understand it. The characters are very captivating because many main characters in books are not elderly. The characters in this book are always connected with the plot and doing something to solve the problem. Your interest level might be very small at first but when you come to the end of the book you won't want to put it down. This book is very nicely put together. The ending is completely unexpected and makes it even more interesting.

We have our Alpha Male hero and post feminist heroine. Some misplaced sympathies with a terrorist whom we are invited to \\"understand\\" and a loosely wrought implication of government interagency conspiracy. The most interesting character in the book was the exKGB agent, Boris, with his astute observations on the American Character. The ending was Stephen King-like in its lack of satisfying resolution. If there is a sequel, I will consider checking it out of the library (maybe) just to see if The Lion gets it in the end. This one goes on the \\"C\\" shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great insight into the mind of the terrorist...","review":"Demille's journey through the minds of the \\"Lion\\" and his wannabe captors offers an interesting insight into the reasoning behind some forms of terrorism.

Some of the plotting is ok, but there is little to recommend this book when there are other fine books out there that deserve your attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rooked","review":"The opening gambit of this game is as exciting as any thriller in the recent past. An airliner in distress is about to land and the tension is so well drawn that you will not be able to stop until the first 125 pages are read. But then we are teased with action sequences alternated with transcripts of meetings with people we don't need to know. The author takes time to slap those movie critics who didn't like the film made from his earlier work and generally looses focus. At the end both major players walk away from the game and declare a draw. This is a work that needs an editor, who could have maintained the thrill of the opening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I'm a big Demille fan, but I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. It starts off great and then spends 600 pages petering out to nothing. It is obviously a prequel to another book. It is also full of fluf. The book could be reduced by a couple of hundred pages, and an ending could be inserted. I won't even loan it to friends who are Demille fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was very, very disappointed...","review":"I have read every book Nelson has written and have been a devoted fan. I couldn't wait to get my hands on his latest, \\"The Lion's Den\\". What a letdown! The plot plodded along. I hoped I would be rewarded toward the end but no dice. The action is mediocre at best and setting up for a sequel after a gazillion pages was a betrayal of his loyal readers. I won't be so eager for the next installment. If I do read it I'll wait and borrow someone's paperback copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down.","review":"The only other DeMille book I had read was \\"The General's Daughter.\\" But if all his book are as good as that one and \\"The Lion's Game\\", I 'll have to read more. The story line was interesting, and DeMille's use of humor was excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of DeMille's best if not THE BEST.","review":"All of the books that I have read by Nelson Demille have been execellent. However, this one is in a different playing field. The way DeMille wrote the first 65 pages of this book should be required reading for students in journalism. He let the reader find out what happened to the plane with all of the characters in the book. I couldn't put it down. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. I got this book at the libary and went past my due date and didn't care. I loved the adventure.DeMille also writes with such humor. When he wrote about the NYPD sitting on their butts and reading the file on Khalil and the FBI agents sitting on their derriers and reading the dossier on Khalil I laughed out loud. I also liked how he brought back the character Boris in this book from one of his previous novels, The Charm School. I agree with Ms. Meyer the first chapters were among the the best I've ever read. The whole book was intoxicating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I know I'm reading a great book when I can't sleep, can't eat and can't work...just have to finish it! And then of course there's the disappointment when it does finish. The Lion's Game was absolutely great, I love John Corey's wiseass attitude, and the very believable Asad Khalil was terrifying. The technique of alternating chapters between the point of views of John and 'The Lion' was very effective and kept up the interest factor. It's a rare combination to have a thriller to which you can laugh out loud whilst sweating with anticipation! I was happy with the ending that leaves it wide open for another appearance of these two fascinating characters. Bring it on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Action-Adventure Material; Where's Hollywood?","review":"Yes, I smell a sequel. And I can't wait till DeMille writes it! I'm going back and reading the earliest DeMille and re-reading his more recent works.The Lion's Game would make a GREAT movie. So would the others I've read. I hadn't read General's Daughter and didn't know it was a DeMille story when I went to see it at the theater. It was the first mystery movie in a long time that I hadn't guessed the ending within the first 15 minutes. So I wasn't surprised when I saw DeMille's name in the ending credits. My question: When is Hollywood going to catch on and make these suspenseful page-turners into edge-of-your seat flicks?Buy this book if you want suspense and humor crafted someone who knows how to write!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long and too weak","review":"You can almost hear the publisher screaming at Demille to finish this book... which he does, quickly, giving a weak and disappointing cop-out of an ending. Then the editor left in at least 100 pages of rambling character description that served to bore rather than excite. This book equates to the last meaningless chapters of Plum Island that were far fetched and wordy. Only the occasionally clever dialog earns two stars.Read Gold Coast, but leave this one on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far below Demille quality standards","review":"Being Demille among my favorite authors I am really disappointed with this novel. Flat, too long, with a lousy start and a lousy end, no suspense and a trivial content, he made a bad job out of a very good idea, leaving you at the last page with the sense that you read a lot and could not get anything in exchange. Bad for the humorous John Corey who plays the role of a clown instead of a cop all the time distorting the sense and realism of the tale and good for the credible bad guy, Asad Khalil who was involved in situations which could have been exploited with more action packed suspense for the benefit of the reader but weren't. Demille is a very good writer, if you are looking for a Demille good one, go for The Gold Coast or Word of Honor and skip this one"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent work by Demille","review":"Excellent book.

Looking forward to Demille's next work"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Outstanding Game","review":"I've read them all and this one is one of the best. You don't find yourself wanting to skip ahead to the end, because the details in the middle - the chase - are really great reading.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Demill's Lion Roars","review":"You don't have to be a mystery fan to enjoy a Demille book.

If your offended at the politically incorrect, avoid this one, if you love comedy combined with mystery, Demille's books are pure joy. When your finished reading this novel, the book will serve as a very capable door stop as its a big book, over 700 pages long.This makes Demille the most economical writer of any of best sellers when you divide the number of pages by the book's price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Enjoyable Thriller...","review":"This is my third book by Nelson DeMille. HATED General's Daughter, LOVED Plum Island. Loved this book too. John Corey, the hero is really funny. The plot was interesting, I liked the way the chapters alternated between the hero and the villian's point of view.I guessed at the ending and was pleasantly surprised to be wrong. Course it screams \\"Sequel\\" at you but after this book I'd buy it right away. Pretty funny too the way the author slams a couple of reviewers who badly reviewed his \\"General's Daughter\\" movie.If you like thrillers, definitely check this one out! I can't wait to find out what John Corey does next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"What a delightful surprise- a 700 page book packed with excitement and suspense, twists and an evolving plot line that never slows or faulters.

I had resisted reading Nelson Demille for years until last summer when, on vacation by the pool, I FINALLY picked up the Gen's Daugh...after that I read every book I could find....Lion's Game was one of the best...GREAT characters and character development, and interesting story...and the best sarcastic humor!

In \\"The Lions Game\\", I had to allow myself to try to understand the Muslim culture. Once past that, I just sat back & enjoyed the harrowing game.John Corey is back with his witty, sometimes over the top wisecracking. Sexy Kate is there to keep him in line.It all starts with a 747 arriving in NY with over 300 souls lost. The plane lands itself. Everyone is dead, or are they? The chaos of a viciously vengeful Libyan psuedo-defector continues from there.I liked this book. I enjoyed the back & forth of Corey's 1st person & the mix of the \\"Lions\\" perspective. And the sidebar mentions from some of Demilles other books mixed in from \\"The Gold Coast\\" and \\"Plum Island\\" were good to see.Parts of it I read out loud to my husband, He loves Corey's sometimes sexist but funny ways. I do too, most of the time. A good book, enjoy it.(...)-CDS"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I always look forward to a Demille novel, this book however was a big disappointment. The story starts out as a terrific thriller but quickly loses its momentum, becoming tedious as the story plays out. My biggest complaints were the totally unsatisfying characterizations of the detectives on the case. John Corey was fun as the wise-cracking protagonist of Plum Island. Here, the wisecracks ring hollow. No one could maintain a wisecracking demeanor faced with the multiple deaths presented in this novel. The ending was rushed and unsatisfying. A sequel to this bomb we really don't need.

The type is typical action/mystery fare- a flight arrives in America with all its occupants dead. While this may seem riveting initially, Nelson Demille continues unsuccessfully to maintain interest through a string of murders as John Corey pursues the antagonist, with limited success.By far the book's biggest drawcard is its realism- Corey is often confused and at a loss to explain his failure to catch the assassin. However, this alone is not sufficient to raise the reader's interest. The ending, in particular is not satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute terrible read","review":"Key points on why this book is absolutely terrible:1) Written in first person2) 900+ pages long3) Too much detail about stuff that really doesn't matter (again reference 900+ pages); author could have reduced the size of the book by 400 pages and still sold just as many copies4) Bad guy does so much damage5) Bad guy gets awayCan't really say I liked much of anything about the book.

The book is twice as long as it should be for the story it tells. Page after page of small talk between characters fill in between real plot elements.

I closed the door, locked it with the key and put the key into my pocket\\"... - such incredibly empty&boring passages make the book two times longer than it should be.

Never more John Corey!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing how close to reality this novel is","review":"This one seemed as though it was ripped from today's headlines. I read The Lion's Game almost two years ago, and thoroughly enjoyed it back then. It's one of those novels that is just written so well that you can't wait to get to the next chapter.What makes this novel work so well is the main character, who also narrates. John Corey tells the story with just enough wit to keep it entertaining. It is the wit that drives this story, even though there is more than enough action.If you liked Plum Island, and liked John Corey in that novel, then this is a must read.

I am a huge DeMille fan and love his wit and suspense. This book was a page turner and fun to read, but predictable and I felt not fully developed. I found the middle section of the book overly detailed about information that did not pertain to the plot and would have rather read more dialogue between the main characters. I was also a bit disappointed by the ending. I say all of this as a critical DeMille reader, as I did not think that it was as good as the Gold Coast or the Charm School. All of this being said, it is certainly an entertaining book and enjoyable to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lion's game","review":"This book was very good, but it was not quite flawless. As a couple other people have commented, the middle pages do tend to drag a little bit; also, I didn't find the ending especially satisfying, but Demille's books always have strange endings, so I can't be too surprised. Overall, however, this was classic DeMille--I thought that it was funnier than Plum Island, and (at least in stretches) almost as funny as Gold Coast. For the record, I would rank DeMille's books: 1. Gold Coast (the best modern novel I have ever read) 2. Charm School 3. Lion's Game 4. Word of Honor 5. General's daughter 6. Cathedral 7. Spencerville (what happened?). #2 - #6 were all very good, just no Gold Coast, and #7 was the only blacksheep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Demille's John Corey character is one of the Best!","review":"Over the years I have become a real fan of Nelson Demille, but his stories with John Corey in them are his best work. The Lion's Game is very fast paced, and Corey is hillairious! His on going critque of the people he is surrounded by keeps things moving. The story itself, is really quite beleiveable for the times we live in. Asad Kahill is pure evil. I was sorry to get to the end, Demille is a master! Can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"It read more like a text book!","review":"I love most Nelson Demille books but this one felt like he needed a lot of filler between the action. Sure it gives a lot of insight to the mind of a terrorist but there are a lot of words between the action.I was disappointed. I felt like I was reading a Tom Clancy novel and felt there were way to many facts that did little to help the plot and for most of the book I would skip pages hoping I could return to the plot.I kept thinking, \\"OK, get on with it\\".Plum Island is WAY WAY better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just missed","review":"This could have been an excellent book. Dialogue was wonderful. The first 150 pages started out fast-paced making it hard to put down. The bad guy was awesome!! The pace slowed. Then it virtually stopped. And to top it off, there wasn't a conclusion. Too bad!When reading a book that relies completely on the plot, the pace has to be at a break neck speed. There is no room to stop the story to develop a weak romance and characters who are fleeting to begin with. And setting up for a sequel does nothing more than irritate me and makes me feel as if my time was wasted in reading the book.I won't be buying the sequel...or any other DeMille books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not his best work.....slow read.","review":"I usually read right through DeMille's books in one sitting but this one took me 2 weeks because the pace would pick up then it would SLOW>>>>>>>down and be soooo boring and then pick up a little again and slow down yet again. I had to force myself to finish the book and in the end was left with an overall disappointed feeling about Demille's latest effort. Hopefully the next one will be as good as he usually writes. If you are a first time Demille reader and found this book boring...go back and read some of his earlier works like The Charm School and Plum Island and my favorite Spencerville."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Start - Feeble Conclusion","review":"Demille has been consistently one of my favorite authors - hitting memorable highs with Gold Coast and Plum Island. With Lions Game he has gone from boom to bust. The thrilling and imaginative beginning gradually unravels to an imcomprehensible conclusion. What is all this John and Kate nonsense - ending up at the altar after Kate more or less extracts (molar like) a proposal from our courageous hero? What is with the Lion disappearing in the end - are we being primed for a sequel? What is with the sale of character names to charity? After reading this book I feel less like a happy satisfied reader than grist for some marketing mill with an unknown agenda. Demille - find your pace again or you will start losing loyal readers!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A great disappointment","review":"The first half of the book was good. It moved quickly and the terrorist was very believable. The events depicted were amazing as the book was written prior to the tragic events of 9/11. The main character, John Cory was an idiot as was his girlfriend. His silly and stupid comments really got old. The dialogue was so predictable that it was depressing. The second half of the book was truly awful with nothing happening for many pages. The ending was the worst part of the book. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"What? I'm sorry, were you intending to write a novel, here?","review":"I have read everything by DeMille and with the exception of this book, they were all novels.

Interesting, no."},{"rating":"1","title":"926 Pages, Really?","review":"There's a decent 300-page beach read in there somewhere. Trouble is, you'll have to wade through 926 pages to find it. Spoiler alert, the US Government is a screwed-up bureaucracy. There, I just saved you 400 pages, most of which are dedicated to our hero (John Corey - of Plum Island fame) whining about that fact. Double spoiler alert, after slogging through chapter after chapter of the bad guy's every waking thought and movement, the whole thing was nothing more than a set up to a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Demille Does It Again","review":"Every book I read by Demille keeps me wanting more.

Though most of the action is pretty intense, Nelson also injects humor. In other novels , mostly by other authors, their humor tends to take away or interrupt the story line too much. For Nelson, the humor is part of their characters and flows well with and doesn't detract from the story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as his others","review":"I am still reading this book and must say aside from the humour I was quite disappointed especially I thoroughly enjoyed The Charm School, this is a bit of a let down. I liked Plum Island and General's Daughter. Shall give him another try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairly disappointing","review":"After the fantastic 'Spencerville', 'Charm School' and 'Plum Island' reads, I was anxious for DeMille's latest. Unfortunately, after a great beginning, it turned out to be much like 'Gold Coast' in that not a whole lot actually happened in the book. And the ending was a complete disappointment. Obviously, he's left himself open to write a sequel, but at the reader's expense in this case, I'm afraid. Seven-hundred-and-some-odd pages, and you're just left hanging! I think the author's actual reason for writing this was to see if he could set a world-record for beginning paragraphs with the word 'Anyway'! He's had so many good books, though, that I'll give him another chance..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly entertaining book - a great & fast read","review":"This book is so very fun to read! I raced through it and then my husband raced through it as well. The length wasn't a bit intimidating - in fact, I believe if it had been any shorter, it would not have been as good.The match of wills and intelligence amongst the various main characters is fascinating. And, I love, absolutely love, John Corey's character. His sarcastic wit had me laughing out loud. He is not a perfect person, but, then, who among us is?I believe this to be classic Demille. If you want truth, realism and sensitive characters, you probably should look elsewhere. If you want a good, meaty story, with great characters, a good good guy, a good bad guy, a romance thrown in for good measure, plenty of suspense and action, then give Lion's Game a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage transformed into words","review":"He bears a striking resemblance to my eleven year-old cousin, except DeMille carries a 'good' plot--'good' deserved in comparison to those of my cousin. For a main character who was addicted to revenge, it seemed like he was just addicted to killing; and Corey, addicted not to stop crime but sex. I can make a concession: the ladder's plausible. I respect him for his audacity: a parody on terrorism. And he did make me laugh, but I need more from 900-pages printed on onion skin.

The reader is subjected to fifty pages describing twelve hours of boring meetings with borimg bureaucrats that are so boring they even bore the main protagonists. And that just the beginning. Long musings by the villian. Long musings by Corey. Sophomoric juvenile plot structuring.. Corey musing followed by another unimaginative terrorist murder alternated with more of Corey doing nothing (not even leaving his office) followed by another predictable terrorist murder.. and on and on and on.

It really makes you think about the ease in which a terrorist attack could take place in the US. It also has some really interesting insights into Middle Eastern terrorism. However, halfway through the book it was as if some other author stepped in and decided to finish the book. There was no longer any suspense; however, the author continued to go on and on as though there was a great surprise at the end of the book...

The witty and charismatic hero of Plum Island has turned into a misogynist bore. As a long time Demille fan [I count Plum Island, General's Daughter, and The Charm School as must reads in this genre] I am afraid he has missed the mark here. This is a long, boring ride to nowhere. The villain was particularly tiresome in this book [though I'll have to try the soda bottle silencer trick] and the sequel portending end was disappointing.

We expect a great plot, interesting characters, and great humour. We get a decent plot, although this one has a weaker ending than Plum Island or The Gold Coast, both of which have somewhat less than ripping endings. We get John Corey, whom we already know, and he is predictable, as always. We get Asad Khalil, a character whose relationship with Corey is pretty hard to believe.

It was much too long, and went on and on, repeating over and over the same scenarios you just went through in the chapter before. And the terrorist they were chasing and chasing throughout this long drawn out waste of time, GOT AWAY in the end and you never even know what happened to him. It was such a let down from other books I had read by DeMille. And the so called romance interest was like fingernails on a chalkboard. Once I was finished, this one got tossed in the recycle bin.

The description of the book sounded interesting. And the book was interesting in the beginning, or at least OK. Around page 200 John Corey enters the picture. And brings with him one annoying line after another. Every word out of his mouth is a 'zinger' and I guess he's supposed to be witty, but he just got on my nerves and I didn't find one thing he said funny.

His wisecracking got old fast and for the most part, it was juvenile. Wisecracking is supposed to be a part of the character, but in this book, it was over the top. He's supposed to be a very smart cop/whatever, but in this book he was just childish and annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eerie 9/11 Prequel","review":"Eerily, this 9/11 prequel addresses Muslim terrorism by getting into the head of a fanatic. The premise and events are all fairly convincing and thought provoking, and clearly timely. The lack of cooperation between the FBI and CIA was almost right on target and quite chilling. But I can (and did) get enough of John Corey and his inane wisecracking. Sarcasm being the lowest level of wit, the main character has clearly mastered that art, it becomes repetitious and annoying. I would also say that Mr. DeMille does a better job of getting into the head of a radical muslim fundamentalist than he does getting into the head of a woman, the Kate character was so cardboard there was absolutely no dimension or believability to her while the Khalil character was so well etched. All in all, this audio book was very well read, and much more exciting than the telly when stuck at home with the crud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reads Like Today's News","review":"This is the only DeMille book I've read and after reading this book I do want to read some of his others. I read this book about two years ago, closer to 9/11 and this was a very errie read. I will not summarize the book, others already have. Sometimes it seems as though game plans are being laid out for terrorists. It was a very very quick read, the characters were believable and it was like a semi non-fiction because it reffered to many real events. It is a long book about 600 pages, you can read it over a long snowy weekend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly at times, and a terrible ending!","review":"The Lions Game was mostly not a bad read.

I wish he could write them as quickly as I can read them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lion had no bite","review":"First of all, this is the most verbose book I have ever read. It could have definitely been written in 500 pages or less.The character of Kate Mayfield was woefully underdeveloped and one dimensional. She is either quoting FBI scripture or trying to get laid.While the characters of Asad Khalil and John Corey were well developed and entertaining, there was a lack of interplay between the two characters. While Khalil was carrying out his mission, Corey was pondering relationship problems. It was like reading two books and the interaction between the two characters was coincidental.Lastly, the ending was a big question mark and resolved nothing except for the status of Mayfield and Corey's relationship. Maybe the author should start writing romance novels like Danielle Steele :-\\\\"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be shorter","review":"Lion's Game is a well-constructed novel that could have been trimmed by a couple of hundred pages and been a better read. It takes until well over half the book before someone finally gets on the terrorist's track and the chase begins. Until then, you are bogged down in too many meetings and a lot of talk, no action. The author should have more respect for the reader. If he wants to write this many pages, he should make the story less stale for so much of the book. The only one generating action is Khalil when he is toying with his victims. The other characters sit around too long with their fingers up their you-know-whats."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lion's Game","review":"The least satisfying Demille book I've read.

On to someone else, like Donald Westlake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the way he writes","review":"While the plot wasn't as exciting as Plum Island, I continue to enjoy the way DeMille writes. The inner monologue of the central character is hilarious. If the first few pages make you laugh, read the rest..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prepare to stay up late with this one.","review":"Other reviewers have complained about this story because the ending does not wrap things up as neatly as some might like. When the Perry Mason TV show was on some complained because Mason never lost a case. The answer of course was \\"that was only on Tuesday nights\\" when the show aired.Mr DeMille's editors not withstanding I applaud him for not following the crowd and withstanding the probable considerable pressure for and against a stock ending.\\"Love ya big guy\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific book!","review":"I read this book this past summer and could not put it down. Since the tragedy of Sept. 11th , I have not forgotten Nelson DeMille's account of the mindset of these terrorists.Its hard to forget this one. I would like to mention that the main character of John Corey is wonderful and witty throughout the book. I hope the character of John Corey returns, not the story line, at any cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Book","review":"I think this book was very good. It is the sequel to Plum Island, which I also liked a lot. I gave this book a 5 stars because it was very exciting and the plot was very good. It takes place in Long Island, New York. It is about a Libian terrorist named Asad Kahlil. He is on a 797 plane from France to Long Island. When the plane lands, everyone on the plane is dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just buy it and pass it around to all of your friends!","review":"A great Demille book. As I read this book before going to sleep I found myself really thinking about this book and how real of a story it is, especially during a post-9/11 era in America.This story has all of the action of a terrorist-thriller, but Demille writes the story from two points of view, something that I have never seen before. This method allows you to get up close and personal with the terrorist and his psyche.Get it and enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story!","review":"I was reading this book on 9/11. It helped me understandthe mindset of the people who want to hurt our country. Thisis a great story, exciting and full of suspense and humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorougly Enjoyable","review":"This is one of Demille's best about a Libyan terrorist who came to America to take revenge on certain people on his list to assassinate.There were tons of banter and snide remarks which were like delicious side orders on a main-course meal, and I thoroughly enjoyed them.I listened to the work via audiobook rather than visual consumption. Sometimes I was laughing out loud, sometimes excitedly talking back to the tape, sometimes just silently almost holding my breath, as the scenes flashed vividly past my minds eyes.The story \\"hanged\\" at the end leaving me wanting more, which was surely to come in a later book with the same characters called \\"The Lion\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lions Game","review":"This beautiful book arrived in record time and was in more than excellent condition. We had previously ordered this book from another source and there was such a vast difference between the two orders for nearly the same price we were astounded. We hope one of our neighbors might like that less desirable copy. We will definitely return to this supplier for more books. Packaging was excellent and ordered was received far sooner than projected. A personal note was enclosed as well. What a delightful shopping experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Outstanding \\"Read\\"","review":"Not only do I read a lot of books, but because of a long commute, I have been listening to unabridged audiobooks for over a year. I have probably listened to a couple of hundred. However, I always save my very favorite authors for reading only, not audiobooks.Although I like Nelson DeMille, he did not fall into this category. I have read some and listened to some. The Lion's Game is probably the SINGLE ONLY book I have ever listened to that I would be willing to bet is better on tape, only if by Scott Brick, than it is to actually read. It was absolutely outstanding! Scott Brick's voice, delivery, etc. is amazing. I can't imagine getting the same feel for this great book by reading it.I am now listening to another narration by Scott Brick, and although his voice, etc. is still excellent, his narration of The Lion's Game is just unbelieveable. This was one of my all time favories!This was an outstanding book by DeMille, and I highly recommend it, whether read or listened to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Middle-Of-The-Road Demille","review":"Judged as a stand-alone work, The Lion's Game is a well written and enjoyable thriller. Any writer would be proud to have this novel in their published works. However, as a Demille novel, I found it somewhat tedious in parts and having a lackluster ending. Too bad, after such a promising start. I consider this an average Demille novel. I feel that he has published some that are not as good as this. On the other hand, I don't think that this story is in the same league as The Charm School, The Talbot Odyssey, or Cathedral. Still, as a loyal Demille fan, I eagerly await the next novel, hoping..."},{"rating":"1","title":"An abberation, I hope","review":"A major dissappointment. Loved C athedral, Charm School, Gold Coast, Plum Island and General's Daughter. Hope this is an abberation. The book is much too long. Bored with the protagonists after a while. Plot is too predictable. Hope he returns to the tight plotting that characterized his previous works. Looking forward to the next one; but wished I passed this one by."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read from a Great Author","review":"This was a great book. It was in my opinion even better than Plum Island. I am a big fan of Demille and have read all his works. My favorites are Gold Coast, Cathedral, And Word of Honor. However, this book was great. I even enjoyed the references made to Demilles other books in this one: Gold Coast, General's Daughter, and the Charm School were the ones I noticed. The book was well written, exciting, and hard to put down. My only complaint was the ending. I don't like the obvious lets set up for the sequal type ending. It ended too much like a Patterson work. However, despite the incomplete ending, this was a great work of fiction. A great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved The Book","review":"Loved this book and once I started, could not stop. However, I did get tired of DeMille's sentences beginning with Anyway,. Got to the point where I started watching for the \\"Anyway.\\" While reading, I kept thinking of different ways the sentences could be started.Other than that, the book is very good and I love the main character, John Corey, thought he was very funny. I'm almost finished and I hope that when they get the bad guy, they get him good.Hope Mr. DeMille writes more with John Corey as the main character."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFUL WRITING, HORRIBLE ENDING...","review":"I think few popular novelists have the skill of Nelson Demille to write a book with such sharp, crackling prose. The writing style simply carried me along like a branch of driftwood in a rushing river. That being said, if you really want to enjoy this novel, don't read the last ten to fifteen pages, just make up the ending on your own, or you'll be riding for a really big let down. I can only hope we're being set up for a sequel or I'm going to be really disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dis","review":"A long and boring tale, much of the dialog is during meetings of various U.S. law enforcement agencies.

As with Word of Honor (which rivals Arthur Koestler's \\"Darkness at Noon\\"), Cathedral, and Charm School, Lion's Game shows that DeMille is able to weave seamlessly prescient and biting social and political commentary with superbly plotted page-turning urgency. It is a shame that \\"literati,\\" who tend to disdain fast-paced fiction (preferring the latest restrospective on The New Yorker -- or the generally plodding, angst-driven \\"coming of [intellectual, sexual, spiritual, etc.] of age\\" indulgencies), have pigeon-holed DeMille as a \\"mere\\" \\"popular\\" writer. Simply put, Lion's Game proves that a writer can be \\"deep\\" without be boring. DeMille is a master --- a multi-dimensional master. Lion's Game is one of his best! It is a book that you hope never ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many words and a terrible ending","review":"I have read all of Nelson DeMille's books but this may be my last. His stories are always interesting and fast paced but this one was far too wordy, too long and the ending was a real let-down. 673 pages of chasing a terrorist with no resolution at the end. Additionally, I am getting a bit fed-up with his abundant use of the \\"F\\" word. It adds nothing to the story or the characters. It was excessive in his novel \\"The Generals Daughter\\" and was even more so in this one. I can understand occassional profanity to make a character life-like, but he went overboard this time. It cheapens the story. Grisham doesn't do it and neither does Clancy. Both write great stories. DeMille should take a lesson from them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic story, great humor... oops, bad ending","review":"DeMille is a great storyteller. He does not dissapponit here... until the well structured scenario comes down crumbling on the -literally- last couple of pages. Still, this is a must read. Over 600 pages of an extraordinary plot and great characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"four-plus stars","review":"Having discovered Nelson DeMille with \\"Gold Coast\\", I have avidly read every book he has written. I didn't like the ending, but obviously, the author will write further adventures of John Corey.

I read it through without looking at TV!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lion's Game","review":"The book was short on plot and suspense.

Wasn't worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"On the bad Scale, 25 Stars","review":"I give this book 25 stars on the bad Scale only because the reader is drawn into a pretty good story for 600+ pages only to be rewarded with a cliffhanger ending!I did not ignore my husband, turn off the phone, and miss a beautiful Saturday in the Los Angeles sun (70s and sunny this past Saturday) to not have the gratification of finding out what happens to Asad!!!!I would only HOPE that a sequel is on it's way. Until then, IT BADD!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too bad, but formula","review":"The writing style is Ok, but the plot is pretty predictable and the ending was easily amongst the worst I've read in years: VERY unsatisfying!

The novel is too long, about 150 pages too long. Midway thru the story it gets tedious, you tire of Khalil's whining. But it picks up again in the final one third of the book and I love the ending . . . it promises a sequil. (Where is Asad Khalil right now? Look over your shoulder because he's out there somewhere :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Lion roars!","review":"Ever since reading Plum Island, I have been eagerly awaiting a sequel. And now that it has come, I am not disapointed. Demile is a fantastic writer and the Lions Game is a great example of his skill at creating absorbing plots, interesting characters, and fast, exciting pace. I also love his ability to incorporate humor into his books. John Corey is hilarious at times. The wit and satire in the book is great. At 600+ pages though, the book is somewhat bloated and it could have been cut down quite a bit without sacrificing anything important. Nonetheless, as far as thrillers go, this one definitely qualifies in the \\"page turner category\\". Highly recommended.One final thing worth mentioning is that with the end seemingly setting up a sequel, I was disapointed to learn that Demille has no intention of bringing John Corey back again. However on the positive side his next book will bring back Paul Brenner from the Generals Daughter, so that is something to look forward to."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lion's Game is a winner! (refers to hardcover edition)","review":"I had been eagerly awaiting the sequel to Plum Island and wasn't disappointed. The first person POV of John Corey is as captivating as the peek into the mind of the terrorist, Asad Khalil. I am a huge fan of The X-Files and couldn't keep up with all the references, hilarious! The in-joke about the movie critic that bashed The General's Daughter was cute too. I have read most of Mr. DeMille's work and have also listened to several of his books on audio tape. The interview with Thomas Block and Nelson DeMille on the Mayday audio tape was enthralling as was DeMille's solo interview on the Spencerville audio tape. I prefer the unabridged vesions of audio tapes where available, as I miss certain parts of the book I remember reading. Keep writing Mr. DeMille and I'll keep reading and listening!"},{"rating":"1","title":"$9.99 or else","review":"Why would anyone pay more than $9.99 for a kindle book when the paperback sells for less.

Why can't he simply get dressed? And Corey's attitude gets stale after about 200 pages.It seems he is the only character that has any brains or good ideas - I don't think so.I would have given the book no stars if that was an option. One star because the book does a good job explaining what a \\"jihad\\" is.Try \\"Shadow over Babylon\\" or \\"Point of Impact\\" for assassination thrillers. Both are lay HUGE shadows over this fodder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wordy","review":"The first 40 pages were facinating. It was all down hill from thereon. Too long, too wordy and too predictable. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"Fun beginning, fun end, but the middle and majority was a complete bore. The main problem is there is NO mystery to the story at all. You know what's going to happen, then it happens...chapter for chapter. I don't know about his other novels, but this one seriously lacks in the \\"how to tell a good story\\" department."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing performance - not worth the effort","review":"I bought this book to have something special for my vacation. I was sadly disappointed to find out that it didn't live up my expectations. The beginning is very gripping (especially if you happen to be on an aeroplane experiencing turbulence as I was at the time) but all to soon it just gets plain dull and tedious as the never ending hunt for the terrorist begins. Also, the ending is sad and uneventful. Save your money or buy a Harry Bosch novel instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story, But No Ending","review":"This novel had a great story that reeled me in and dealt with issues that are relevant today (viz., terrorism on American soil). Definitely worth reading, although the ending was a let-down. It seemed to me like Mr. DeMille was trying to set himself up for a sequel -- a fine idea except that he hasn't ever come through on the promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"DeMille is an American treasure","review":"Forget Grisham, Patterson, Baldacci. These guys may sell, but they sure can't write. DeMille does both! If you've never read Nelson DeMille, now is the time. The Lion's Game is DeMille at the top of his own game. And after you've read this one, go back and read every single book he's ever written. He'll delight and entertain you time after time, with intelligence, humor and suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly humorous","review":"A hilarious book based around high action drama. A terrorist is killing people in America. No one is able to find him. The ex-NYPD on the case (now working with the FBI) is determined to apprehend him. The author lightens the blow of seriousness with John's sense of humor. You'll be seriously spellbound one minute and laughing the next. At first, I didn't think I would like The Lion's Game, but quickly changed my mind after the first few pages. An excellent read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We read for Entertainment, Here's some","review":"If your reason for reading is other than entertanment then this book is not for you. It is not deep in political signifigance or is it a thick plot. It is well written plot development with a few interesting characters thrown in.Our hero ex-cop is a cynical middle age wise cracking guy who has seen it all. He gets a job with an anti terrorist group and investigates the murder by gassing of a whole airplane full of innocents. He gets a cute female partner and cracks the case. What more could you want?How many 900+ page books keep your undivided attention the whole way. That is a ton of entertainment for a reasonable price. Yes the ending is a bit weak but what the heck you've been happy for 900 pages whats a little disappointment for 10 or 15?Recommended for a good read between heavy novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Den Of Fast-Paced Suspense","review":"When it comes to pace, DeMille is a sprinter. The Lion's Game is an intense yarn that rushes from a startling begining to a slightly disappointing conclusion. John Corey, hero of Plum Island is back with sarcastic humor that brightens up a violent and grim plot. Asad is the king of the jungle with more dimension then the average fictional mass murderer. The two protagonists engage in an intriguing duel until the end. No, I will not give it away. Yes, it is worth the read despite my ending regrets. Like many trips, the journey is a lot more fun than the destination."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've read better De Mille books","review":"I found \\"John Corey's\\" constant sarcastic comments ridiculous. The book (which was 926 pages long) could have been a much more compact read without them. His annoying character spoilt what otherwise would have been a good thriller, despite the disappointing ending. Not up to the standard of his previous novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read.......","review":"This was the first Demille book that I have read. I love the characters and the writing style. The story is fast paced, changing back and forth between one location and the other.In light of September 11, this should be required reading for all Americans. It offers a lot of insight into the Jihad mindset.It's spooky that this book was written before the terrorist attacks on our country. As one reads Lion's Game, it would have seemed inevitable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not terrible, but not good","review":"Demille is a good writer and a lousy story teller. This is the first book of his I read. I was looking forward to reading more. But not now. He is in serious need of an editor. Reminds me of Weber.The first 200 pages are a decent read with a solid B. Then the author goes completely off track. In a major way. He loses the story line, seems to forget how to convey a story and has the reader reading about meetings and conferences and just garbage.This stuff doesn't help character development, it doesn't help the story and is exceedingly boring.I give an F.From page 200 to 700 is full of this. Then finaly around page 700 he decides to finish the book and the next 200 is a decent B read.A good editor would have cut out 200-700 and had a real decent B book. Instead, the writer gives an impression of someone who needs to do a lot more work on his craft because he isn't up to grade level.He writes like a journalist and not a story teller."},{"rating":"2","title":"There are no more lambs","review":"This is a thrilling read....land the plane!!! What's Asad doing? Time to go to sleep, work tomorrow. What about taking a vacation day? I'll just read a few more pages. A feeling takes over ...must know his next move.

It was a small budget film and it shows. It didn't show enough of the works of Lorca or Dali. I thought I would have liked to see from what well Salvadore Dali sprang from.All in all, not a waste of time, but it could have been better."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest","review":"This has to be one of the greatest movies ever done. I can't believe nobody heard of it, and that it has gotten so little recognition. This is surely no mainstream as it is about art in different forms - painting, poetry, music. This is also about human rights, women rights. It's about love and friendship, hard choices, mistakes. Beautiful cimenatography, great performances, enchanting music, beautiful and heartbreaking story of extraordinary people. This movie will touch you deeply and will stay with you forever. Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I thought it was a great movie because Rob Pattinson is awkward in this movie and he pulls it off.

The actors are fine, but overall its a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little Trash","review":"What's good about this movie are the vistas that were beautifully shot. Looking past the bad direction, writing and delivery of lines, I thought the actors were passable except for the guy who played Dali. I was only peripherally aware of Robert Pattinson's existence because of his \\"Twilight\\" movie fame, but I totally forgot he was in \\"Little Ashes\\" when I began watching it. I kept saying to myself this guy playing Dali was fresh from a high school theatre elective and was badly miscast. The other reviewer did the right thing by hitting \\"Eject\\" after 20 minutes of this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still scratching head...","review":"This movie (and \\"How to Be\\") makes me think Robert Pattinson is trying to be the next Johnny Depp. I could see Johnny Depp in the role of Dali because he has a talent for eccentric roles. Pattinson just doesn't cut it. While the rest of the cast seem comfortable in their rolls, Pattinson constantly appears on edge and seems almost frightened to deliver his lines. I'll be the first person to raise my hand and say that while Pattinson is very handsome, his acting skills are better suited for bubblegum teen movies or light-hearted romantic comedies.It is an interesting story but the poor acting of the lead role takes away from that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Co za interesujacy temat!

However, after watching it, i fell in love with it, with the actors who portrayed each character so well. I have read way too many negative comments about this movie, ranging from the small budget to the bad acting. I honestly don't see it, i think this movie is great. It touched me in a way that made me want to learn more about Federico Garcia Lorca and Salvador Dali so much that i bought any book i could gather about their lives and work. I would also love to go to Spain to visit the cities where these two great artists grew up.Like i said i'm completely fascinated with their lives. After reading so many books about them i still can't get enough.We all have different tastes about movies but i think everyone should give it a try. It's sad this movie didn't get the publicity it deserved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Film","review":"I thought this film did an excellent job delving into the possibilities and mysteries of Dali's life and adventures. It was romantic and heart-breaking. Robert Pattinson did such an excellent job that after a few minutes I forgot all about \\"Edward\\". Javier Beltran was simply amazing and when the two are on screen together, their chemistry and portrayals completely wrap you up in their tale. If you're a Dali fan - I think you'll like it (if you care about life stories and not just looking at his work)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Ashes movie Review","review":"I first heard of this movie through Robert Pattinson's affiliation with the film. After watching this film I became truly inspired...especially as a young homosexual who is struggling to show people that love has no limits and this includes the individuals' sexual orientation. I believe this film showed that you cannot choose who you fall in love with; love can be irrational, unkind, and painful, but what this film showed was that, yes, it is all of theses things, but it is also beautiful, and innocent, and limitless. I would strongly recommend this film to anyone who is either questioning their sexual orientation or have questions regarding love and how it corresponds with homosexuality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything Salvador Dalí did, except paint","review":"I bought this movie because I was interested in Salvador Dalí - the artist. The movie rambles through his early college years in a two hour fixation with a homosexual affair he may or may not have had with another student. Who cares! Dali ate sandwiches, cleaned his shoes, had lovers, sat on the toilet, just like we all do. but what was extraordinary about Dali is that he was also a brilliant painter and this movie basically avoids that aspect of his life altogether. It also barely touches on any of the eccentricities he was famous for. If this were a movie about Joe Bloggs who was a nice looking guy who fell in love with his mate then it would be an ok movie, but as a record of Dali's life it's plain terrible! If you love Robert Pattinson you may struggle through this, if you love Dali it will bore you to tears."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO NO NO!!!","review":"Let me say this if you are a Robert Pattinson fan DO NOT watch this movie!!! It will change your view of him terribly. His acting is good in the movie but to see him kiss another man was just TO MUCH for me. However if you want another movie with him in it I recommend \\"Remember Me\\" it is a GREAT movie. I have just recently ordered the \\"The last airman\\" and hope it doesnt let me down. Like i said his acting is good its just not a movie one of his fans from twilight should watch cause he is gay in this movie not that Im against that but when a person has a crush on an actor its hard to look at him the same way after you see him making out with a man no offense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Air please","review":"This window fan is great.

His poor attempt to replace Edward Said as a formative expert on the Middle East fails.

The songs that stuck out the most to me were \\"Out Of Control\\", \\"In The Groove\\", and \\"Caldonia\\" (in the middle of the song they re-do a very famous Glen Miller tune). It was also very interesting to hear this band's rendition of Billy Idol's \\" White Wedding\\" and Metallica's (another favorite of mine) \\"Enter Sandman\\".

So, all in all it's a good starting point to begin your Klaus Schulze collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps Schulze's best album","review":"In my opinion, Timewind is perhaps the best album Schulze had ever done. Recorded and released in 1975, this guy was trying to rival Todd Rundgren with how much music he can cram on to one side of a vinyl LP. Both cuts on Timewind clock at just slightly under 30 minutes (turned out Rundgren won in the end with his album Initiation, where side two crammed over 35 minutes). \\"Bayreuth Returns\\" is basically a minimalist experiment. Keeping a steady synth pattern, he includes lots of nice synth solos on top of it. It pretty much sticks the same thing throughout. \\"Wahnfried 1883\\" is a totally mindblowing piece that consists of lengthy drones but gets very dramatic. Certainly it might not be as easy to get in to as the Tangerine Dream albums of the time (like Rubycon or Richochet), but this is truly deserving as a classic of electronic music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elektronik Impressionen","review":"\\"TIMEWIND\\" is a real masterpiece.

I ended up buying a fleece liner and a down blanket to sleep on for extra insulation. Now I find myself defeating the purpose of packing light when half my pack is sleeping gear. I've finally had it with this bag after giving it enough chances so, I've decided to give it to my son for summer camping. If you are looking for warmth this is not the bag.

I'm not a big guy (5'7\\" & 165), but the width from the shoulders thru the hips is very narrow. So much so, that I had to sleep with my arms outside ... which kinda defeats the 30 degree rating of the bag. Needless to say, I was cold and uncomfortable all night long.

The characters are flat, flat, flat, and the plot was more eye-rolling. I sometimes feel bad about not liking it, because there's obviously a lot of love put into these novels, but ultimately, they're just not very good.The constantly shifting character voice gets to be a little annoying. It worked for Faulkner, but the way the perspective continues to slide around after not a great deal of time gets to be more than a little disorienting.And despite this, the plot wraps up and ends in a nice little bow far too easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Unsatisfied","review":"I've read a few of Mark Roeder's early novels. The Soccer Field Is Empty was very emotional and well written. Someone Is Watching tended to stray away from the central plot, but was still good. My favorite, A Better Place, was awesome and so good that I expected A Better Place II to carry on the drama, twists, and turns. Unfortunately, I was terribly mistaken.The premise of the novel is engaging. The farm is near bankruptcy and the new boys on the farm, Casper and Brendan, are trying to fit in their new community. New to the story is Dane, who is very naive compared to Casper and Brendan. However, beyond the introduction, the characters stop growing. None of the challenges in the story were complex and almost always easily solved favorably.

Once you do, one has to wonder of this woman is a genius; as she disperses crystal clear recollections and -hard to get at first- wry anecdotes of a childhood in an impovershed African homestead riddled with mud, numerous malaria outbreaks, multiple infant fatalties, alcoholism, shrieking madwomen, acrimonius relations with the neighboring villagers, and above all, survival. All set against a backdrop of blistering terra firma and wild animals abound. Not only was she born to tell one of the greatest stories of all time, it seems plausible that Ms. Fuller had been born with a silver pen in her mouth.Warning: this book is not for those who are of the faint of heart or weak stomached."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves much to be desired","review":"I have to say, I was certainly looking forward to reading this book, having heard much about it from family and friends (I'm from Zimbabwe). Perhaps it is the fact that I am not a white Zimbabwean, but from the first pages, I had a bitter taste in my mouth. I admired the writing, but that was about it. The overwhelming impression that we had of whites growing up in Zim became manifest in this book, and I was transported back to those days. The most disturbing thing for me was the lack of remorse...no, redemption, by the author. She would relay stories about her racist parents, her upbringing and such, and did not transmit any sense that all this was not right, not humane. Strange how the same words can be read by different people and evoke such divergent responses."},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite","review":"I'm and avid reader, and i must say this book is one of my favorite reads, if not my favorite. I lived with a family in Malawi Afrifca for awhile, so the book, for sure, draws my sentiments. But Alexandra Fuller spills guts and soul into the sharing of her African childhood experience. As a child, she writes with a child's voice, a child's soul, and as she matures, so does her expression. What a gifted writer! Her writing rings true, and I am hungry for more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, Horrible.","review":"This is one of only two books I've ever bought that was so boring and weird that I could not finish it...and I've been stuck in a hotel room in Mexico for 2 weeks with nothing else to do!

This is one of the worst books I've ever bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"This woman is fascinated with Toilet Functions!!!!","review":"Okay, now as a former and recovering English major I'm going to admit that Ms. Fuller is actually a decent writer, But I do want to point out a few things the other reviews don't cover.First, Ms. Fuller is stridently politically correct and distorts the historical facts of the former Rhodesia in an effort to demonize the whites. The distortion does border on reverse racism, however much I hate to trot out the r-word.Secondly, this woman is absolutely obsessed with toilet functions and other bodily things and takes any opportunity to describe them--particularly her own. She takes an almost narciscisstic delight in describing herself in these terms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Africa","review":"I remember author and humanist, Chinua Achebe explaining the importance of literature to the world you lived in. He didn't see how it was possible to just write for the sake of writing. I thought of Fuller's book when I went back to that speech Achebe made. If \\"Don't Let's...\\" is a journal and for whatever reason, depth or understanding or historical perpsective was not something to aim for, then why such a muddled project? The native Zimbabwean people are completely absent from this book and we get a weak colonial portrait about funny times, mosquitoes and animals. This is old nineteenth century Byronic romance and unforgiveable today in a world where we all now know better. I would reiterate the importance of reading more perceptive and less narcissitic Southern African writers such as Bessie Head and Tsitse. ALexandra Fuller's book does nothing to convince the rest of us that Africans are human beings and that the people of Zimbabwe have something of worth to tell us and to teach us."},{"rating":"1","title":"The dysfunctional family abroad","review":"I read this book for a library book club I belong to. I can sum it up simply and easily. Two white racist alcoholics raise two daughters to be white racist alcholics in Africa."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"After forcing myself to read 1/2 of this book I still had no idea what is going on with this woman and her family. I devour every every book I can find on Africa and have loved them all, but not this one. I passed it on to a few friends. Same reaction. None of us could finish it. The vapid attempt at shock value by constantly mentioning the word pee is ridiculous.On the back of the book jacket, Wiiliam Finnegan is quoted as saying, \\"Nobody has ever written a book about growing up in rural Africa the way Alexandra Fuller has.\\" That's an understatement. Let's hope no one ever does again..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dogs Tonight","review":"The problem with this book is its laden, self-pitying tone. I got no sense of the beautiful country of Zimbabwe, the beautiful natives of that great country or of the incredible, formidable liberation struggle fought in that country for close to a generation. This... book and in many instances dangerously incomplete and infactual. Fuller has atleast an obligation to the historical facts, I would think, if nothing else. Her prose also made reading this book torturous. Unless you're Toni Morrison or Thomas Pynchon then you shouldn't attempt complex metaphors else they fall flat and come of as foolish, confusing and unintentionally funny. For the more literate readers out there looking for a good book, don't believe the hype on this sensationalist mess. There are many other writers, black Zimbabwean women writers, who are writing about the same period, about the same things with more intelligence, depth, feeling, compassion and humor. I would try them first."},{"rating":"1","title":"not of the world","review":"Another version of white settler life in Zimbabwe could be George Clark's work. There is some nuance there and some substance. There's little here in \\"Don't Lets...\\" In fact, for the many native people who lost their land, their lives and their dignity and customs, this book is dangerously irrelevant. Again, for those who need and demand more from a book that portends to be about a complex topic that forever remains in the news, Fuller's book is not for you. There's no denying it is for a few others who may be reading for some light entertainment versus those of you hoping for a fuller understanding of the so-called modern world filled as it is with tremendous suffering and strife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling. A story you will want to devour.","review":"There are currently 266 other reviews of this book available here, so I won't waste time revisiting the plot. The author tells her story in first person, with the insight and \\"wisdom\\" of the child she is throughout most of this book. The realities for her include terrorism, alcoholism, depression, racism, death. But through it all is the love of family, strength of character, and the background of a very real Africa that few of us could ever know. Although the chronology is jumbled at first, the reader can quickly acclimate to the unusual flow of the dialogue and novel. But it is for this reason that I give it 4, not 5 stars. It certainly is a book that left me wishing for a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"disturbing","review":"I just finished reading\\" Don't lets go \\", and I have to say, I find myself totally disturbed. On the one hand the story is fascinating. But I was hoping that at the end Alexandra would come around and not be such a racist.Black Africans are hardly mentioned except as inept servants. Even at the end of the book she says that there aren't any europeans living nearby for her parents to talk to now.I'm wondering what she now teaches her children.I thought that the way she turned her mother's alcholism into humorous episodes was false. there was an absence of fear of the situation which i think would be inevitable if your parents were as unstable and idiotic as the ones portrayed in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Being born in an interesting part of the world should not be an excuse for just anybody to write","review":"Alright, so her childhood was a bit different than your average white middle-income childhood.Should this motivate anybody to write a completely non-imaginative, devoid of any insights book?Don't be fooled by the exotic side of it. A poor writer can ruin a story, regardless of the exotic locale.If you were expecting to find an \\"international\\" jewel like Jhumpa Lahiri's \\"The Namesake\\" or Zadie Smith's \\"On Beauty\\", you will be greatly disappointed.If you are into Africa, read something that has more than the exotic place to say for itself. Ben Okri's \\"The Famished Road\\" (booker prize winner) or The Palm-Wine Drinkard and My Life in the Bush of Ghosts (Paperback)by Amos Tutuola will be much better choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book","review":"Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight: An African ChildhoodI read a review of this autobiography which raised my interest. But after reading fully two-thirds of the book, I was disheartened at the racist attitude of nearly all of the significant white characters in the book: her mother, father, and even the young woman herself. It re-inforced the cruel treatment of the Black majority in then Rhodesia by the members of the White minority we met while reading it. I strongly recommend anyone interested in reading this book to check it out of a library, rather than purchase it. I am a white woman aged 61 and I was very dissapointed in this book and would not recommend it to anyone. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just don't get it!","review":"I don't get this book. I didn't learn anything about the history of the place. The author is not so interesting that I need to know about her nor is her family. Why are they there? I don't get the father at all - his character is not well developed and it just seems like they are a bunch of drunk gypsies with no moral compass. Not sure what the point is and have no idea why this is such a book club mainstay. Yuchi!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Let's Read this Book - Ever","review":"A topic which held such promise was a bitter disappointment. The story struggled along, largely because it was very difficult to follow her chronology or lack thereof. So much was left out regarding the war and social struggle of the time in an effort to spotlight her family, that it left me wanting to know more about the country and times in order to understand what her family was going through. Fuller bounces around from one time in her life to another without any consistency. Overall, this book was just very boring and there was nothing to grab onto as a reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"dysfunction junction...","review":"I joined a book club in order to broaden my pop book horizons. This is the first book on the reading list, and I am starting to rethink the book club because of it. I was really looking for a good story of living in Africa, and being in the melee of the troubled times of Rhodesia. I have very little time to read a book, and I have gotten half way through this disjointed memory collection of a dysfunctional family via an audiobook. The audio book narrator is good, but the story is just horrible. It is depressing, dysfunctional, and all over the place. I expected to find the book written with a slight racist slant, due to the time and the place, but I didn't expect this. I should have saved my $20 for the audiobook. Its so not worth the money. It should have been re-written as a surviving dysfunctional parents book...there really is no point to the story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let's Go to the Dogs","review":"I trudge through this book to learn a little history but I despised the book and gave it's companion away.

While I have never been that interested in anything Africa, she seemed sure that this one was not to be missed. She was right. An interesting read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"This book is fascinating, though not the best pick for those with a weak stomach. It's painfully honest and that's why I loved it. The author has a really rich yet simple way of writing, so you feel, smell, see, taste the entire experience they had growing up in Africa. It's far from a comfortable way of life, and it's downright depressing in some parts, but that's reality. I really respect someone who is able to write about their own life without glamorizing it nor condemning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My most treasured book as another African Child","review":"This book was given to me by a friend. I have read it over and over since then.Maybe its because I was born in Zambia, moved to Rhodesia as a three year old to the same town were I grew up, and attended the same school as Alexandra Fuller, but I think not, rather its because it shines.As an author this book released me from the need to write about my childhood, I felt I could not do it any better. The places, the people the sounds and smells are the Africa of my childhood and hers,This is writing of such fierce brilliance it can only come from actually living.I feared that in the hands of some it would be as pearls before swine, yet I see it has already risen to the place it deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"An uncomfortable read","review":"This is a very personal account of a girl growing up in Africa.Feels a lot like reading someone's diary, with the family's losses, grief, and subsequent functional breakdown exposed for all to see.It's written truthfully, maybe too much so.I was very absorbed by this book, but I'm not sure I can say I actually enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rhodesia to Zimbabwe through the eyes of a little white girl","review":"This book takes one to a time and place that most have never, and will never, experience.

At the end of the book one really understands the magic of Africa for white settlers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing memoir","review":"Really enjoyed this memoir. Some of the events were hard to imagine but apparently really happened. The author grew up tough!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"\\"Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight: An African Childhood\\" is one of the best written biograhies that I have read. The language is raw, but innocent and realistic. It's a tragic home life, but with the humor and childhood acceptance of reality it doesn't leave one feeling depressed. There is no real resentment from the writer towards her alcoholic, emotional and selfish Mum, only love and sometimes compassion with an admiration that only she can express in the best way. She idolizes her dad, even with his descripancies of drinking liquer too often and driving recklessly a lot. We get an idea of the way of life for a British family living in Zimbabwe, Africa during war times at their beginning and a good insight to what is to come. I'm glad that I read the book and feel that I can better understand the way of life for most transplanted Africans. I am looking forward to reading her next book to learn more about her Mum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been There","review":"Off in the Colonies literature had its hey day in the 40s, 50s and 60s. Typically it features wild, rafish adventurers roughing it in the outbacks of East or Southern Africa. The wildlife and ecology are superb and there are many invisible servants to serve your every whim. There is play, sex, drugs, violence, extremes, \\"hardships,\\" and people who can be called characters with a mischievious laugh. But, alas, it's not the same any more. Well, so they say. If you've read this literature before (\\"White Mischief\\" comes to mind) and that's your entertainment then go for it. If you're a bit tired of that sort of thing and a bit tired of reading how the people and ecology of Africa are destroyed for profit then you may want to pass on Fuller's book. You're not missing anything. If you would like a more full portrait of present-day Africa, one grounded in the realities of most of the people living there, I would advise you to keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"One for the dogs","review":"The story jumps around a few lossess but am at a loss as to how or why this ever won an award."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wild Romantic Africa?","review":"For all you potenetial readers who are like me, students of Africa and African literature, don't make the mistake of being mislead by the subtitle: An African Childhood. Africa is a large contintent made up of over 50 countries and several hundred ethnic groups. In the South and the East where the soil is rich and the material benefits large, white settlers can still be found. Fuller conflated a particular white settler Rhodesian childhood with African somehow. Like the South African afronaut, this is a silly claim and misleading if you are truly seeking to read a book on Africa and Africans.On the plus side, she loves animals and gives nice descriptions of the non-human native life forms."},{"rating":"1","title":"White man point of view","review":"This book is basically a white mans point of view of the great continent that they distroyed.

Found the book boring and difficult to get through. I was expecting an exciting book about growing up in Africa, unfortuntately found an almost-documentary, very un-exciting and didn't manage to finish the book. I am surprised that it had such a high price on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest and beautifully written","review":"A woman who grew up in Africa recommended this book to me. I have never been to Africa. Fuller manages to convey her love and attachment to the continent without in any way downplaying the difficult moral and physical challenges of growing up there as a white kid during the war for independence. I was sorry to come to the end of the book. Her portrait of her parents was astonishing to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tragic & Beautiful","review":"This book is a must-read no matter what one's preferred literary genre may be. Alexandra Fuller has taken me to Africa where she has shared a most incredible childhood and family life. Since reading, I've become completely fascinated with African culture, particularly the white farmers and their battles to make a life and home of this often brutal and merciless land. I hope she continues to grace the world with her unforgettable stories and unique style of telling them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating read!!","review":"An interesting expose of the inner workings of family and how one's childhood and ennvironment are strong influencers for one's adult life. Fuller so acuarately captures childhood as a white child in Africa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not racism but realism","review":"This book takes me back to the 12 years I spent in Southern Africa. Africa is where it all started and there is something in the blood that draws me back there.The descriptions are evocative and beautiful, and convey something of the problems people encountered when trying to survive in Africa. Despite all the corruption and problems I can't help loving the people there, of all races. I can't say the same about politically correct critics that have never even been there. For your information there was, for all its faults, more freedom and justice in 1970's Rhodesia than in many black African countries and a hell of a lot more than there is in Zimbabwe now. Not to mention enough food to feed everybody!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing but hypnotic book","review":"A fascinating book concerning a part of African history and its effects on one family. There are some terrible things that happen within this family, but somehow you want to keep reading, maybe to find out what happens in the end. What a remarkable young woman to write such a powerful book. It's tough to put this book down once you've started reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Traumatic Childhood?","review":"I read this book before Ms Fuller's \\"Scribbling the Cat\\". I am the same age as Ms Fuller, and also grew up in small Rhodesian towns. I found the racism and generalisation that all white Rhodesian are racist very offensive. Some of my best friends when I was growing up were black children, and if I or my siblings had behaved towards black people the way Ms Fuller and her family did we would have been severely disciplined. This book made me ashamed to be a white African, and I actually have no reason to feel that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alexander Fuller, my favorite -","review":"I have read three of Alexandra Fuller's books. This is my favorite. The story begins, written by a young Alexandra, told almost abruptly, with both passion and a nonchalance at the same time. It is told as she lived it. Her 'unstructured' family, living in the bush of Africa, experiences both the agony and ecstasy of living in wild places, caring for wild animals and each other. I have recommended this book to several friends without an African connection. They all enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doom and Survival in modern Africa","review":"Poignant memoir with moving tributes of emigrant love and perspective for several countries in central Africa. A. Fuller writes beautifully without self pity or rose tinted filter when recording parental flaws. I gained as much insight for post-colonial Africa as I did for Fuller's experience as a white Anglo during these years. (Read her second memoir - \\"Cocktail Hour Under the Tree of Forgetfulness\\" first, but found this book equally compelling.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An African Childhood","review":"I can't believe some of the criticisms of this wonderful book. As a white woman who grew up in Zim - even though I was a few years older and lived in town - it captured exactly what it was (is) like. The matter of fact descriptions are powerful on their own - would you expect a 13 year old girl to be making a studied analysis of the political forces at work? The point is that Fuller manages to describe vividly events which fit into that world and give you a richer understanding of it. There are good novels and historic/political books from other perspectives, but that does not mean that her perspective is invalid. Try reading some of the dry as dust ones like Cathy Buckle's account of the current experiences of white farmers (written from a very liberal, politically correct standpoint) and see which gives you a better insight.By the way, for the reviewer her questioned her teapot metaphor - has he/she ever looked at a map of Zimbabwe?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Shocking, Vivid Memoir","review":"Written as a series of stream-of-concsiousness stand-alone essays, but organized in a linear fashion, covering the period of time from the author's birth, through her marriage. I live in Africa, which makes me appreciate the author's descriptions even more. I have traveled extensively in both southern and central Africa, although I've never been to the locations described in the book. Her descriptions are extremely vivid-after reading this book, I feel that I've been to these places, and experienced her life with her. Nevertheless, I found her young life shocking in many ways. The book also helped me understand the current political climate of Zimbabwe today, and the origin of why the blacks are dispossing the white farmers today. A very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Colonial life from the inside","review":"Excellent writing---entertaining and full of good solid information. If you have ever been curious about the nitty-gritty of mid- 20th century colonialism, this is a good way to discover what the reality was for the people who lived it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've met people like this","review":"Have you ever known someone who likes to talk a little bit too much? They go on and on with story after story. Some of it is entertaining, but it doesn't all link together and make much sense. If so, that would be a good description of this book. Parts of it are entertaining and interesting, but it mostly feels like random jumps, one after another, with no glue to hold it all together. Random stories with a lot of negativity and very little redeeming value. It didn't work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"I thought I found the racism in the book unsettling until I read some of the comments. And that's when I was REALLy blown away. I started this book but decided, after getting a few chapters in, that I would rather read a Black person's take on growing up in Africa, rather than read this woman's flippant and light-hearted description of her family's racist attitudes and behaviors. As other reviewers pointed out, while the racism wasnt particularly surprising, her failure to address the \\"wrongness\\" of it was. And reading so many comments suggesting that white rule was acceptable and almost necessary because African countries fell apart without it made me feel sick. Racism is alive and well in this world. SO sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too internal for my tastes","review":"Strange that a book centered around Africa, and so rich at times with descriptive passages, should leave me feeling so left out. The book really jumps when the narration concerns itself with the others around the Fullers, both white and black. However, the prose is overwritten when focusing in the family and self, and I never felt the narrator was more interesting than the landscape."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Extraordinary African Childhood","review":"Alexandra Fuller's \\"Don't Let's Go To the Dogs Tonight\\" will bring you into her world of a childhood spent in the wilds of Africa. Hers is a colorful memoir that you won't soon forget. While reading this book, I literally carried it with me everywhere I went so that I could read it during any spare moments I had during the day.

It is about a British Special Security agent named Boysie Oakes. Much to my delight it was quite funny. I thoroughly enjoyed his writing style and it was a wonderful experience....couldn't put the book down. There are many John Gardner authors, so it's kind of hard to figure who's who by browsing the web with that name. Sorrowfully, this appears to be only one of two books he ever wrote.

This book was very interesting and explained the climate before the videotape, during the time of the incident and afterwards. I think most people had no idea the undercurrent that was running through that city and the police department in particular before that tape was aired. The cops were wrong, especially the supervisors, but they were so used to getting away with things that this was nothing out of the ordinary.

While I am a fan of the LAPD parts of this book were painful to read. While most officers in the field seemed to want to do the right thing they were left in the cold by Darryl Gates, a man I admired and a command structure at LAPD that could not think on it's own. This book offers a fair accounting of the beating of Rodney King, not the \\"motorist\\" the felon Rodney King running from the police. Nothing good comes from running from the police. The book is probably more interesting if your from that area and know something of the people involved.

The author reconstructs a bishop's project of building a mission in an area that has forgotten God - folks who's grandparents fled the revolutionary war and became heathens.

So much drama. A bishop, a missionary, and an orphan try to help a group of heathens become better and have God in their life. They start to find religion, but not in the exact manner as the bishop would hope. After a while he gets upset and changes the church so that it is more Catholic and the town does not approve of this and they all go back to being Heathens again.

I would keep it with me, always.\\"~Billy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!!","review":"Overall, I really enjoyed this book. Linney was able to capture the elegant yet primordial lifestyles of the Appalachian people, particularly in Heathen Valley (aka Valle Crucis). This book was a collection of stories (somewhat fictional) from the church histories of the Valle Crucis mission in western North Carolina. It is told in 4 parts during the 1850s, where a bishop from New England and a real mountain man try to transform the valley. It was exciting and interesting to read about the characters that Linney so delicately created. Each character had extensive amounts of layers that created a complex world in a simple community."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY IT FAST!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is a great DVD.

It is very educational and believe me, very interesting. It shows old footage, interviews and a lot of coasters, and does so with a very fast pace. It will keep you interested throughout the movie, but this is not more than a movie. You won't see much of the rides, and it is not a thrill to experience.

After reading LA Times, I remembered why I hadn't bothered with one of his new releases for years.

Woods makes it clear to his readers, once again, that he lacks any ability to discern how real people go about their lives and what is actually remarkable about human interaction.After wasting a few hours reading this latest \\"novel\\" of his, I wonder whether he huffs airplane glue from a paper bag before sitting down to write.

It lost me in the third. When the heroine gave herself to Richard and agreed that it was ok to break her married vows, but when he marries into a woman of \\"his station\\" it would not be ok for him. I say, No Deal. I decided to give the woman the benefit of the doubt, as she had been a strong, rather independent for the times, and outspoken gall up until this point. However, she proceeds to give Richard three sons, the last of which she throws away as not to harm his marriage to Anne. I would also like to add, she allowed her gay husband to smack her around a bit. I am truly not impressed. I like to read about strong, admirable woman and I found this woman horribly weak.

There is indeed no proof that Richard III had his nephews murderred. I see him through my 21st century ethics and disapproved of the betrayal. Whether or not he orderred the murders, Richard III failed to carry out his responsibility to protect Edward V and help him become a good king.

It's appropriate that people who purchase this also purchase \\"Marquee Moon\\" by Television because the vocals are not pop-pure. If Tuxedomoon were still in print, that would be a good combination.

The pressures of his job and his deteriorating relationship with his girl friend have become too much so he takes a temporary assignment in Gannet, Vermont. Gannet is where he spent many happy summers while growing up and he hopes the atmosphere will help him get back on track. However, a mysterious fire that leaves five dead, a strange cult, a missing young woman, and a murder blamed on his boyhood friend Rennie, all place Gunther right back in the hot seat as he tries to unravel who killed who.As in all Gunther novels the police work is believable and the characterization is strong. Gunther is not a fiery detective but he is methodical and eventually puts all the pieces together. I didn't feel that this novel was as strong as \\"The Skeleton's Knee\\" or \\"Fruits of the Poisonous Tree\\" but it is still a good read for mystery lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story Teller","review":"My 75-year old mother loves these Joe Gunther books.After reading the first in the series for free on kindle, my mother has been getting me to buy the rest of the series.She bought the first one after she finished Sue Grafton's \\"Alphabet Mystery Series\\".

However, I ended up needing to return it. It fit everywhere quite well and had many adjustable straps, except the one strap that goes under your belly. This felt too tight to me and was uncomfortable. I definitely couldn't sit down with it on and even when standing it left a visible impression under my baby belly.This may be because I carry very low and have a little extra belly fat, but still if they had only made it adjustable I would have loved to keep this product. Unfortunately now I am still unable to find something that works. My only suggestion would be, if you are a slightly bigger girl, try ordering one size larger than you think. I purposely did not because other reviews suggested to order your exact size. Anyhow, it was worth a try. Now if I can just find something else. This product would likely still work for your average or small sized woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to put on for the \\"well-endowed\\"","review":"I ordered 1 size up but still couldn't slip this contraption over my chest. There is no way to open it all the way to put it on - you need to put it on like a shirt, which is completely ridiculous. It needs to work like a vest, especially with the extra curves and lumps of pregnancy. Notice that the woman in their photo is not particularly well-endowed.

OK Japan were running out of steam after Tin Drum and The Quiet Life. But here he distanced himself somewhat too much from what made the combination of personalities in Japan so great. Actually his voice is not that great for these kind of intimate sketches that he delivers her. Red Guitar was good but not great and I rememeber the disappointment when I received the single back then. It is till a very beautiful record but I do not listen to it anymore, obviously.

It's rare to find such a well-rounded, well-balanced release--not a single track is lacking and each one has something strong to offer.

Even @ maximum volume, bass doesn't pump well and the sound is flat all the way through. I'm dissatisfied with these headphones all the way through. You want cheap headphones, get them from a discount store.You're better off getting the JVC Marshmallow earbuds, which are roughly the same price. Great sound, bass, and one of the best headphones.

Bendele says the things that need to be said, and she does it so well that her message is unforgettable and undeniable.And the best thing? You may be reading her poetry silently to yourself, but it reads like it's being spoken aloud to a packed auditorium. As a reader you get the sense that you're on the edge of something big and brilliant - the end of denial, and the acknowledgment of survival and hope in a painful and unjust world.Please, Ms. Bendele, more, more, more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing grace","review":"Asha Bandele is the Maya Angelou of my generation.

Some or many lawyers and black rob judges have become so radical and liberal minded they have turned their back on the principals of the founding fathers, I agree totally with what this says and it is more a challenge to our generation to wake up and realize how perverted our legal system and judges and politicians who are almost all lawyers too, have become. so I hope this helps you understand what you are buying better than I did.

My issue here is presentation; agree or disagree with Barton, how can anyone argue that he presents his case well? His narrative careens wildly from point to point, randomly touching on a point here and there, before zooming off in another direction. Lengthy digressions appear out of nowhere, sometimes serving a purpose, but sometimes serving only to derail whatever point he his trying to make. I haven't read Barton's books (nor do I intend to) but if his writing is as badly-organized as his narrative in this DVD, I have great pity for those who attempt to plow through the pages. Nobody deserves that kind of suffering."},{"rating":"1","title":"History? More like Propaganda!","review":"This was actually PAINFUL to watch!

David Barton CLAIMS to be a historian, however his \\"higher education\\" consists only of a Bachelor of Arts degree in religious education from Oral Roberts University.

I paid just over $20 on amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"buyer beware you are not getting a deal...","review":"Nowhere does it clarify that you are only getting one filter (perhaps purposefully?). I guess I should have read the other reviews more carefully but who in their right mind would only want one filter when you obviously need 2? If my TV remote needed new batteries would I go out and buy just one batterey? So considering shipping is $5 you will save your money buying one of the other ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have a HAP422, filters are cheaper on the Holmes site","review":"I own the HAP422 and it has been the greatest thing since air. I have allergies to most cedars and cats. This has made a noticeable difference since day one. It has been well worth the money. HEPA filters are the real deal.I also have been looking for the filter and haven't been able to find one. I checked amazon to see what they were asking, and I'm flabbergasted at the high prices.Folks, go to the Holmes website. The filters are $13 there. I'm going to order 2 now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the Job","review":"This filter is HEPA type rather than HEPA, so I know it's missing some microbes, but it's grabbing enough that I can breathe much easier in the room where I use it. I live with a smoker and a cat, so I need all the dust-grabbing help I can afford.I'm using this filter in a Holmes HAP2400 that runs almost constantly, alternating between settings 2 and 3. It's been running pretty much steadily for three months, and the filter is gradually darkening, but it's not all used up yet. I have a washable booster filter that I rinse out once a month, so I think that might be extending the natural life of this filter a little bit.All in all, this is an allergen-reducing solution that I can afford and, combined with some other measures like heavier-duty filters in the intake vents of the house, it's been working out great, no complaints. I'd recommend both the air purifier and the filter to others who need to reduce air borne allergens in the home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product on time","review":"recieved product on time, universal filter, so had to adjust brackets, works well, and at a reasonable price, thanks thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"HAPF30 Replae Filter","review":"It was a perfect fit for my Holmes purifier.

It worked for a about 6 months before it gave out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bag","review":"Absolutely love this bag. And also arrive earlier than expected. Only 1 small cosmetic issue with the material, but nothing worth crying over. Overall over concrete buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect sized bag","review":"Okay so I was looking for a bag that was durable, had enough compartments, was affordable, and most importantly, could fit into a locker easily. And this bag really fits the bill. It has a good front compartment for keys, wallets, personal items etc. A side pocket for shoes (which tore a little on the inside which is also the only problem with the bag). And another side pocket perfect for toiletries and other smaller items. The main pocket is spacious and perfect for a towel and change of clothes when going to the gym. The price is very reasonable I think which is very important. However, the bag's biggest appeal to me was its size. I have a medium Nike bag that was slightly too large to fit into my locker which is why I purchased a new one. This bag however is the perfect size to fit into a locker and the ends of the bag are very durable so I don't have to worry about it ripping taking it out of my locker.Overall a great bag that I would highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not this time","review":"When it was time for a new gym bag,I went for the Ogio Crunch.It was a deal at $25.00 and I've had a few Ogio bags in the past (laptop bag and suitcase) that are great.This bag was a bit of a let down from the begining.I purchased this bag as a gym bag.My last gym bag has alot of inner compartments for shampoo, soap etc as well as a hook to hang a lock from.This bags side pocket has nothing of the sort.The \\"shoe compartment\\" takes up most of the main compartment once you put shoes in it.The final straw was a few days ago when the stiching on the shoulder strap came undone and it fell off my shoulder.This happened less that 45 days after purchase.Luckily, I was within the return period with Amazon.The bag is on it's way back and my refund is being processed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not 24\\" in length","review":"The bag looks exactly like it does in the picture, but the provided dimensions are not accurate.

Shipped when promised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I was looking for a duffel with a separate pocket for shoes and all metal hardware. The previous duffel I had used plastic hardware, and it broke, making the bag unusable, but OGIO has made a great product in the Cruch Duffel Bag that I'm sure will last me a long time. It works well for daily gym use and is also big enough to work as a main bag for a week long trip. If I ever need another bag for anything else, I'll be going to OGIO first."},{"rating":"1","title":"good little bag but the quality has diminished.","review":"I previously owned an Ogio Transfer bag purchased from the same vendor. I work in the travel industry and found that particular bag to be way too big and so I would find myself over-packing and getting weighted down. So I bought this as it was smaller, still expecting the same quality. Well first when I opened the package I was disappointed as the color was not correct, but I'm not really picky so I kept it. The zipper on the seldom used front pocket is starting to get caught up and snag after just two months of use. The overall quality is lower than the previous Ogio bag, I don't know if they changed manufacturers or what? If you need a small travel bag, find another. If you can live with a bit larger bag forr the money, get the Ogio Transfer you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this bag!","review":"I've had it a couple of weeks, use it for weekly ultimate games. Cleats and tevas go in the shoe pocket, iPhone and wallet go in the outer pocket, water bottle, extra clothes go in the main pouch. All the zippers seem good, it looks good, is the right size (I've got size 13 feet and my cleats and a pair of teva fit in the special shoe pocket)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkward","review":"I got this after reading good reviews and wish I hadn't. The bag is too big, which makes it awkward to carry around. I don't need this much room in a gym bag, it's hard to carry it on the streets and in the subway.

Side pockets are nicely designed for shoes and a shaving kit.The inside cover started to show signs of wear and tear in the 2nd month.The shoulder strap is connected to the bag by a metal latch. The metal latch has caused the nylon to rip. this results in the shoulder strap becoming disconnected from the bag as I walk down the street.Zippers are not as smooth as they were 3 months ago and are already showing signs of wear and tear. A quality gym bag should last at min 12 months. I am rather disappointed that I will be shopping for a new gym bag so soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't keep the shape.","review":"The bag looks good. It has enough compartments that you would probably need for every day work out. The biggest problem i see with the bag is the bag does keep the shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Sized Bag for the Gym","review":"This bag has been perfect for me. I've had it for over a year now and it's well made. I love that on one side it has a small zip end for a pair of shoes, and on the other side is a deep pocket that tucks into the interior of the main compartment, where you can put dirty or wet gym cloths separate from other items. The long strap has a paddled section for your shoulder and there is a smaller side pocket that I keep things I need to get to quick in. The interior holds a good amount, but the bag as a whole isn't so big that it's unwieldy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Functional Gym Bag","review":"The OGIO Crunch is a super functional, lightweight gym bag. It replaced a larger, heavier gym bag. My only suggestion would be to have a few more pockets. My old bag had no shortage of useful internal pockets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very flimsy - has no body","review":"I purchased this about 5 weeks ago and have been using it ever since. The bag itself has no body or form, including he bottom. When the bag is empty and on top of a table you have to support the sides and top just to fill it. My old bag had some rigidly to it so that when empty it filled up easy.Putting sweaty gym clothes in this bag is like putting a wet watermelon in a tight fitting plastic bag, very difficult. The bag itself is a great color with lots of compartments but it is otherwise useless. I tried to return it tonight but found out I was past my 30 day mark, which is my fault. So I'm stuck with it for a while until it pisses me off enough that I purchase another one. Don't buy this bag, there are plenty of good ones out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bag smells like gasoline","review":"Bag is nice size but smells so bad of gasoline or petroleum. That smell permeates clothing and you can smell it when the bag is in the car. Its horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has an almost toxic smell to it and if you want to return it, they will charge you a restocking fee.","review":"When I first received this gym bag, I was so excited. Until I opened it up and the smell of gasoline nearly knocked me out. I decided to use it anyway that day and it worked fine. However, the bag still reeked of gasoline so much, that I wrote to the company for suggestions. Waiting to hear back from them, I sealed the bag up with a box of baking soda in a Ziploc bag to get the smell out. That did not work and neither did trying to air it out (as they had suggested). Since neither worked, I am sending it back and they want to charge me a re-stocking fee for returning it. Wait, so you want to charge me a re-stocking fee for something that smells like an oil spill? This does not seem right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great durable bag","review":"The Ogio Crunch is a solid, durable bag. It has plenty of space and a separate section for shoes and/or wet items. I also love that the handles don't use velcro, but instead big hardy plastic claps. My only complaint is that it doesn't have a flat supporter on the bottom. If you don't have much in the bag, it gets pretty floppy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice bag","review":"I gave this rating, because the bag is very nice and what I expected.It was purchased for my daughter, who plays basketball and soccer for HS.She said it seemed small at first, but after she used it for awhile, it seemed to fit everything she needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roomy and bright","review":"I purchased this bag for weekday use - I exercise in the morning, so I'm toting my work clothes with me in the morning, and then carrying my workout clothes, shoes, toiletries, and makeup back home in the evenings. The bag is roomy, and I like the bright green color. I like the roomy side pocket and the separate shoe compartment. The shoulder strap is fairly comfortable. The smaller handles are supposed to fit together, one inside the other, to make carrying it by hand more comfortable - the only annoying thing is that the handles fit together, but don't \\"stay\\" together, which I think looks a bit sloppy.If you're looking for a roomy gym bag that can fit your gear and other items, like toiletries, hair dryer, makeup, etc., this is a good purchase for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"another good tale","review":"early on, walter mccloud, the main character in this novel, tells his life-long friend susan, \\"in books, death is what often propels the plot...either ignites the action or finishes it.\\" and so death propels this novel, but the sad story of his brother daniel mccloud is nicely woven with the story of walter's dealing with the roller-coaster ride of his sexual orientation awakening, and that of the family estate that embodies the nature of the word \\"home.\\" at times this novel felt a bit wordy, but ultimately this is a very nice story, well-told."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lengthy History of a Boring Man","review":"My first Jane Hamilton book, and from the reviews of Hamilton's other books, regretfully so. I don't have a problem with characters I don't particularly like, but I could barely stand Walter McCloud and his painfully bland and whiny disposition.It's clear Hamilton lacks a true connection with her character as the book drones on as she dwells on Mark's homosexuality and takes his desperation over his brother's death and beats the book into the ground. The plot has very little direction as the character flashes between adulthood and adolescence. All in all, very disappointing. I want to give Jane Hamilton's other books a read, but it may be awhile before I am able to get over the wasted time I spent on A Short History of a Prince."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Talks Like This?","review":"The story would have been interesting if the dialogue had been more believable. But as it was written, nearly anything a character says in this novel becomes an incredible, insightful, three-paragraph-long monologue. You can get away with that in theater, but not in a \\"realistic\\" novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was about as entertaining as watching paint dry","review":"Possibly one of the most boring books ever written and I loved Hamilton's last two works. To the reader in Chicago, I understood the point of this book, it still doesn't mean that it was any good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't listen to the negative reviews of this book!","review":"This is a beautiful book. I say this because I thought a lot about these characters and felt for them. How could you ever forget Susan's visit to Daniel's hospital bed while she's wearing a dress she got at Goodwill? The way in which Hamilton describes Walter's running to the taxi in his ballet tutu really tears at your heartstrings. I don't know about the other readers out there, but I was touched by these characters. I saw depth in his sister as well. Hey guys, she wasn't such an air head if she had the sense to say to Walter \\"I've been wanting to say that if you were ever sick, if you get sick, you know? If you couldn't take care of yourself and didn't have anyone? If that happened, you could come live with Marc and I.\\" This is a story about the bonds between siblings as much as it is Walter's story. As for Walter, you'll just keep hoping for the best for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"third novel disappointing","review":"Jane Hamilton has written two superb novels as everyone knows, The Book of Ruth and A Map of the World. This new one is very disappointing. The \\"big wacky family\\" exists solely in books like this one. The story is blah, not one character really moved me or stayed in my mind. And the central character is dull, pretentious to the max, not believable at any age. He leads the dullest life of a gay man I have ever read in any book. The only interesting thing was his sexual hijinks at age 15, and there wasn't enought of that! This book really is like a third rate TV movie of the week, only without a real theme. Skip this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Ms. Hamilton but I didn't care for it.","review":"I have always loved Jane Hamiltons books but this one just seemed to going nowhere from the beginning. I kept waiting for an event to happen that would turn the book around but it never arrived.The characters were not developed as they were in The Book of Ruth. I found them all boring and felt no attachment to any of them. Sorry everyone, I can not recommend this book at all. However, The Book of Ruth still remains my favorite book ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding novel","review":"I was amazed at Jane Hamilton's ability to write a book which so accurately portrays the experiences of a gay male. Walter reminded me of the heroes in Stephen McCauley's novels, but in many respects Walter is more three-dimensional, and the novel is certainly more substantive than McCauley's work. I continually found passages which reflected my own experiences. I don't know how Hamilton was able to get into her hero's head so completely, but in my opinion, she succeeded brilliantly. The book is an honest but compassionate (and never apologetic) portrayal of a real person who happens to be gay."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I have read all of Jane Hamilton's books and LOVED them for their deep characterization and stirring emotional content. I am also one of those readers that has to finish a book if I start it and this one I couldn't even get through. This book's tone was much different than her other books. I won't say it was more optimistic or positive it was just more apathetic. I suppose they all can't be to the calibur of Map of the World-- her best."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment.","review":"I loved The Book of Ruth and A Map of the World, and eagerly anticipated this book. But that anticipation quickly turned to disappointment as I struggled to maintain my interest, page by page. The characters were not as rich and absorbing as those in the previous books, and the story, at times, hard to believe. This is one of the few books I've given up on and stopped reading. Don't waste your money -- get it from the library since there's a good chance you'll quickly return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rough going, awkward structure","review":"It was hard to keep moving through this one. The back and forth time structure becomes confusing and makes for a ponderous start. Characterization was excellent, I feel like I really got to know and like the characters as people, but there were many times when I wanted to just drop it out of frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious, at best","review":"This is a tedious and thoroughly unfocused novel. It tries to bring to forefront the minutia of everyday lives and give it resonance. Unfortunately, all she achieves is the mundane. The characters lack definition and, more importantly, purpose. Most bewildering of all is Hamilton's choice of telling the story from the viewpoint of a 15-year-old homosexual boy, when she hasn't a clue to the nuance of the character. What would make her create a main character so devoid of any basis in reality is beyond me. After showing such promise with The Book of Ruth, this novel is a tremendous letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I couldn't stand the characters. There wasn't enough plot. I kept hoping the book would get better, but it never did. I despised the main character. He and all of the other characters lacked depth. Yuck! Waste of my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautifully written, humorous, I flat out loved it!","review":"A book that I enjoyed from cover to cover. In this work I did see so much of life as I once knew it. This writter has a wonderful undestanding of human nature, incredible sense of humor and a gift to write about all of these things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoroughly Anticlimactic.","review":"A profound disappointment. Particularly so if you expected the same brilliance she delivered with her two previous novels. This story lacked the insightfulness and poignancy that both A Map of the World and The Book of Ruth were absolutely rich with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great cure for insomnia","review":"I am an avid reader and rarely leave a book unfinished. I am half way through this one and am finding it extremely difficult to finish. I'm trying to force myself to read ten pages a night but usually fall asleep after a couple. Jane Hamilton is one of my favorite writers. I absolutely loved Map of the World and Book of Ruth. Map of the World is one of the best books I have ever read. I was so excited when I found this in the bookstore and grabbed it anticipating another life changing book. What a disappointment! Although it makes some good points, I feel they could be made in one or two chapters, this seems to plod along going nowwhere. Maybe it will pick up and I'll be pleasantly surprised? I am going to try to continue to plod through it but I am not connecting with any of these characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"And the point of this book was???","review":"Possibly one of the most boring books filled with the most unlikable, unconnectable cast of characters I have ever read. The reader has to plod through almost 350 pages of the maudlin Walter whining about his boring life to get to the huge climax when the best thing that has ever happened to him occurs: He inherits this dump that hasn't been cleaned in fifty years so that he can stay connected with his extended family whom he can't seem to tolerate. Please!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't get past a glaring error on the first page!","review":"August 10, 1972 was NOT a Saturday; it was a Thursday. Since this was how the book began, I was, as a \\"methodical\\" Virgo (see page 4), completely thrown off kilter. Why was this error not caught? Was there an editor? Is this \\"poetic license?\\" Does a lack of attention to detail reveal a free spirit or sloppy research? Pondering this mystery left me too tired for the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Short History of All of Us","review":"Although I agree with some of the reviews which find it difficult to believe that a family would gather as the one Hamilton describes, I found in the story a reminder of how often we take important relationships for granted.

Now I use it for reference.But for beginners, this is not a very good book. Although hardware design is somewhat difficult to explain, the book does not analyze subjects in detail or how circuits work. When it does try to explain topics, it does not do so clearly and provides few examples. Unless you have outside help (such as a teacher, professor, teaching assistant, etc.), I would definitely recommend finding another book to learn about hardware design because you will struggle while trying to figure out how things work (if you are a novice)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to use","review":"I suffered immensely trying to use this textbook. The author, while knowledgeable in the field, writes in pedantic, verbose technical jargon full of recursive definitions and unhelpful examples. Often, examples just show a completed procedure without bothering to go over the steps necessary to arrive at the answer. The absence of answers for end-of-chapter exercises is maddening.

In fact, they created huge budget deficits, supported the shipping of real productive enterprise abroad and stimulated the service enterprise that led to today's unstable bubble economy, and made the rich richer and the poor poorer (or imprisoned). Wanniski gets one thing right. This economic doctrine is anti-inflationary and protects the medium-term value of the elite's growing pot of money. And that's it, because that's all it's meant to do. The rest of it is complete charlatanism of the sort employed by 19th century medicine men to convince simple country folk that they now have access to a magic formula."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Excellent Book","review":"What could be a more boring subject for a book than a review of global economics? The book starts out slowly, laying the groundwork, but then takes off. I've been studying Keynes and Friedman for a long time as a hobby. I could never figure out what the difference was between Monetarism and Supply-side Economics, until now. It's a small difference but a very important one.I give Wanniski's work my highest recommendation for clarity, content, and depth of coverage. He lays out the proper explanations of correct monetary and fiscal policies and gives many, many examples of where its worked throughout world history."},{"rating":"1","title":"The REAL Way The World Works","review":"Despite Wanniski and Novak's attempts to rationalize their flawed thesis, the simple fact remains that supply-side economics does not work. Calvin Coolidge, Warren Harding, and Herbert Hoover tried it during the 1920s, and remember what it got us? That's right folks, the Great Depression! Taking money from the poor and giving it to the rich always sounds good to people wallowing in privilege, but how come the poor people asked to hand over their money to these rich fat-cats never see it as such? The answer is because NOTHING ever comes back. Trickle down is a myth.

I laughed, I cried, yes..the type of crying where I needed Kleenex, I held tight to a pillow during the fight scenes. It tapped into all my emotions. This movie was worth watching. So worth watching that my husband and I have plans on buying one for each of our 5 children.There are so many untold stories of the men and women who sacrificed much during WW11.

They are now closer to the awful taste of Hershey's chocolate than anything else, more sweet and waxy than smooth and silky. There are only two Cadbury's products still worth purchasing as far as I'm concerned; the large bars of plain dairy milk, and the Twirl bar.

Not so for me. The systolic readings were 20-30 points high, even after careful reading the instructions, going over it with tech support a couple of times, and crosschecking a few times. The other readings were reasonable, dystolic were 5-6 pts high, and pulse rate maybe 3-5 beats/minute high vs the doctors office readings at the same time. I returned one unit and got another one. Same story, very high against dr measurements. Returned the 2nd one. Too bad it is so inaccurate for me. It is a easy to use unit, good instructions, helpful tech support, and good ergonomics. It also measured 20pts high against the drug store meter, but I didn't trust that as much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unstable","review":"Purchased for my father.

The memory and average functions are useful for reviewing BP trends. The best thing about this monitor is its simplicity: just stick your arm in the cuff and switch it on--in a few seconds your BP is displayed.

I have only had the machine for about a month so I can't speak to its durability."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy home monitor","review":"This is the second model from Omron that I've owned, and it is definitely a couple notches better.

The price from Amazon was very attractive. The items itself was very easy to use. However, my wife felt the cuff was uncomfortable at full inflation. Worse, we could not believe the numbers. After several tries over about 5 days, it always measured high for her; higher than any number she ever got at a doctor's office or drug store BP monitor. And I got numbers lower for my BP than I am used to seeing. So we had not faith in the accuracy of the numbers, and upon her Dr's guidance, returned the unit. Not sure what we will do as my Dr. recommended the Omron brand as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerously inaccurate!","review":"With others, I followed the directions exactly and used it under supervision of the nurses at cardiac rehab. Tried everything to make the readings consistent or correct. The readings were wildly higher than BPs taken by professionals. And they weren't even consistent. Systolic varied, diastolic varied.

She was having a lot of trouble with her blood pressure, and her medications were being adjusted. She followed the directions very carefully. The readings that she got were extremely high and alarmed both her doctor and her. She had to make multiple trips to the office as a result of these readings. She brought the machine with her, to show the doctor how high it was reading, and each time, when he checked it with his machine it was much lower. It is obviously defective, and she contacted the manufacturer several times and got no response. I would recomend not buying this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an accurate reading with this product","review":"This product is very easy to use...however my BP readings were 30 points higher than at my Dr's office.

I am an average size person with average size arms, but there was no way I could use the pediatric cuff.I wish they had sent something larger than the pediatric cuff.I had to order the adult-size cuff for an additional $27.I gave it only four stars because of the wrong pediatric cuff.

I decided on this model for its excellent price/utility ratio: for $25 more I get automatic inflation with intellisense so the inflation could be more consistent, and 60 reading memory so I can track a couple of weeks at a time.

When we called Omron, we were told to send it back (at our expense) and they would look at it and send it back (also at our expense).

I immediately took his blood pressure using our new Omron monitor which showed a normal reading for his blood pressure, but his pulse reading was extremely high.

I bought two of them, one for my son and one for my daughter. The only positive thing is they seem durable. Image quality is crap. Software is crap. I could have bought something great for the money spent on this worthless little plastic piece of garbage. I am sorry I bought them - I cannot recommend this product under any circumstances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift for 5 year old","review":"I purchased the VTech Kidizoom for Christmas for my 5 year old daughter. Absolutely loved it from the get go. I loved it because now she leaves our camera alone. She's busy taking pics everywhere we go. I love that she can take pics & add angel wings, horns, piggy nose, etc. to customize and then turn them into a game if she wants. It helps children become more aware of everyday surroundings and situations. They know they can capture all of these on their \\"toy\\". Extremely durable and easy to wipe clean. Believe me you'll need to often because they won't want to put it down!

First, the flash up close makes everything appear white. Secondly, (and I'm surprised no one mentioned this) my 4 year old son cannot seem to grasp the concept of holding the camera still AFTER he pushes the button. He pushes the button then moves the camera, and then it takes the picture. Pretty big delay there....Other than those two, he really enjoys it, and it seems to really hold a lot of photos. He loves being able to add things to his images like hats, glasses, and backgrounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"vtech kidizoom camera","review":"Gave this to our 4 year old for christmas and he loves it, quickly figured out most of the buttons and we have pictures of all sorts of interesting things!!!! Great to see what is important to him. Picture quality for a kids camera is not too bad, especially if you can get them to hold still. My guy actually got a few good shots. Recommend this one because it also acts as a stepping stone to a better camera later on. Think the instruction manual could have been a little better, i.e. downloading the photos to pc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Toy","review":"I just brought two of these for my 4 year old and my 3 year old for Christmas and they have yet to put them down.

It's a Hit!","review":"My 4 year old son got this for Christmas. He loves messing with my camera so thought he'd enjoy his own. He was at it immediately figuring out the 'how tos' by himself. Between him & his brothers (5 & 7), seemed someone constantly had this item.. be it snapping a photo, shooting a lil video, or playing a game. I was super happy it went over so well!! I read reviews so I knew it was one of the better 'kid cams' but was still impressed with it's durability & ease of use & it's just overall 'cuteness'. As you should expect - it's for kids so it gives kid quality photos which we all enjoyed just the same being that OUR KID(s) took them!! Plus nice to find a toy that won't be forgotten in the bottom of some toy box! I DO recommend this item!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deception all the way around","review":"I would rate negative stars if I could.Deception from seller: The product shown here is NOT a Kidizoom Plus. It is an older model. Try to find it at the Kidizoom page. On a bad day you shouldn't have to pay over $30 for this camera, but to advertise it as a black Friday special for this price is unbelievable.Deception from MFR.: This is NOT a 2.0 megapixel camera. It is a .3 MP camera. It comes with SOFTWARE (for your computer, not a part of the camera) to convert a .3 MP picture to 2.0 MP. That's like putting a dress on a pig.Why stop a 2.0, I could make it 10 MP or more, but I would not have a better picture.I realize this is a toy, but this kind of marketing troubles me."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT","review":"I bought this product for my 5 year old daughter.

So many things fall off of her \\"Favorite Things List\\" after a day or a week, but this camera still goes everywhere with her. She takes a lot of pictures of the floor and the ceiling, and sometimes she holds it backwards and takes close-ups of her face, but overall she takes some great pictures and she is very proud of them.

He was thrilled to receive his very own camera and uses it often. The picture quality isn't the best, but pretty good, especially since it's a children's camera. We love the feature where you can add funny things to the pictures too! Really is a well made, great little camera!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this Camera","review":"We loved this camera. My son got it for Christmas over a year ago and for what it is (a childrens camera) it takes great pictures. I love that you can turn the flash on and off and it also has little overlays for the pictures that are cute. I bought a fisher price camera for him and the pictures are awful - plus you can't turn off the flash it is just automatic.

But my kids both loved the toy. The shocker was how quickly it died. Because it was such an expensive toy we only let them play with it on trips, like on the airplane. Imagine my surprise when this apparently ridiculously durable looking toy, built and weighing like a tank, broke after maybe 5 uses, all under adult supervision. None of the buttons work anymore. No idea what caused it to die, but it's not as if it was dipped in water or dropped or anything. Terribly disappointing. At about $15-20 I'd consider myself satisfied with what we got out of it. At $30-40 I'd consider myself disappointed. At $75-80 I feel completely ripped off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vtech Kidizoom plus","review":"My four year old received this camera for his birthday and he takes it with him everywhere he goes!

They just enjoy taking the pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor way to spend your money!","review":"I bought this item for my 5&7 year old boys who love using mommy & Daddy's cameras. This is the biggest piece of junk. When you look through the view finder the picture is centered, but when you take the picture half the picture is cut off! It was very frustrating to the kids and the parents. Let's not talk about quality. The quality is less than poor. The pictures are grainy, fuzzy and out of focus(no matter what lighting situation). My kids were looking forward to downloading the pictures to the computer to print them off, but they are so grainy it's not worth the money or effort. This may be a good toy for a younger child, but I DO NOT recommend for older kids. POOR CHOICE! Put your money towards a cheap real digital camera!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Camera died in 1 day!","review":"Despite the fabulous reviews for this product we were very disappointed. While we enjoyed it for a day, the thing stopped working exactly 24 hours after it came out of the box. My 4 yo daughter is pretty bummed. I can't say how this will be resolved; I emailed the company as suggested in the product literature and at this point am hopeful they'll simply replace it. We followed the instructions to the letter and checked the trouble-shooting guide as well. I wish I could rate the toy higher but its short life merits my low rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a camera to take real pictures with","review":"I bought 2!! of these cameras for 3 year old daughters for Christmas. They love to take pictures with disposable cameras so I thought this would be a great gift. However, it does not take good pictures at all! If the subject is too close, the image is bleached out. If moving, it is blurry. Out of 100 pictures, none turned out. I even tried taking pictures with it. It took a great amount of skill (and completely still object) to turn out a not-so-great picture. Save your money and buy a disposable camera that can take pictures you can actually develop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Durability!","review":"I bought this camera for my daughter 2 years ago. My 3 kids play with it frequently. It has been dropped on the tile floor many times without breaking. Last week, my 3 year old son put the camera in the bathtub. It was completely submerged. You could see water inside the view finder and on the screen. I was certain it had finally met its demise. However, I took the batteries out and dried it as best I could for 5 days. Today, I put the batteries back in and much to my surprise it STILL WORKS!! Like most reviews say, the picture quality is not good. My daughter gets frustrated with blurry pictures if she is not holding the camera completely still. But, man, is this thing ever tough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after a year of light use","review":"My 4 year old loved the camera - but it died after about a year of relatively light use.

What a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Toddlers!!","review":"I purchased this camera for my toddler who loves taking pics. I checked on the reviews and I liked it as a Christmas Gift for my son. As soon as he unwrapped it, he LOVED it. He has fun with the different animation and photoshop that you can do on the go (it doesn't need a computer). He spends hours taking pictures and videos and playing with all the effects you could add. I added a 1GB SD Card and after a huge \\"busy\\" week he has used only about 20 MB. Now he takes his camera when we travel anywhere and \\"video-tapes\\" the road, the trip, etc. The only problem I found is the no-zoom option(they could add the feature) and taking pics at night because they're blurry."},{"rating":"2","title":"kiddiezoom camera","review":"i bought 2 of these cameras. 1 for my son (age 4) and the other was for his best girl friend (age 6). they are awesome and the pink vs. blue was a big hit. the picture quality isn't great when you take a picture in a dark room but the games and ease of use make up for that. the kids are all mastering playing tic tac toe and the other games offered and figuring out how to put borders on the pics by themselves.i only paid $39.99 when amazon ran a special but i would have paid full price."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to get my kid a camera, not video games.","review":"I am amazed that no one has mentioned the fact that this \\"camera\\" is loaded with video games.

The only problem is that the pictures show up too dark on the screen and can barely be seen (even if the room is light and/or the flash goes off). The screen lights up just fine for the games and other functions but viewing the photos or even trying to see what you're planning to photograph shows up so dark you can barely see anything. Darker items don't show up at all unless they're less than 3 inches from the flash when it goes off. I'm glad I got this item on sale and had a gift certificate. Otherwise I'd be really upset. It's an OK camera for a toddler but definitely not worth the asking price. My daughter (also 4, his twin sister) wants a camera too now but I'll be looking for something else instead of getting her this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Looking, Sharp","review":"I bought this for my parents as a gift and they like them a lot.

In short, the wireless would connect to my router (also Linksys N) for a short period it did provide internet access, but within 5, sometimes 10 minutes, the computer would freeze up. No movement, mouse, keyboard and applications all froze. I spent a couple weeks working off of a number of forums, tried a number of fixes, including bypassing the Linksys management tool, using the Windows wireless manager, but to no avail. I broke down and went back to Frys and picked up a Belkin N today - works like a charm, no lockup, no freezing and the wireless access is up and running again. My best advice, save yourself the headache and pick up a different card - perhaps the problem is related to Windows XP and if your running Vista you may have better luck than I did.

However, I have it hooked up now and it's running very nicely from a second-floor bedroom to the router (WRT310N) in the basement.There are two things to look out for:1. Do not install from the CD. There is a warning in the package for this. This is an XP install. To install on Vista, download the driver from linksys onto another PC so you can put it on a a memory stick and walk it over.The downloaded driver is a self-extracting .exe file (WMP300N_20071019.exe) that contains both Vista AND XP libraries. After you extract it, remove any folders named XP. - Load the driver.2. Make sure to seat the card into the slot carefully and fully.

The Verfremdungseffekt is compounded by the casting of Paul Jesson, that most plebeian of actors, as Coriolanus, the ultimate patrician. This makes the recording a chore to get through, depite a decent performance by Marjorie Yates as Volumnia. One could accept Antony and Cleopatra in a Brechtian mode, since that play is without illusions. But in Coriolanus, military heroism, martial glory and absolute integrity are genuine (if not all-encompassing) values, and are not to be travestied by farting tubas and over-parted actors. Brecht, of course, wrote his own version of Coriolanus.

The plot does not revolve around mis-communication. Instead Cohen lays out the characters, both good and bad, in a straightforward manner using a present tense style of narration that keeps the story going and the pages turning. Throughout she adds period details that bring old New York to life. Those who compare this book to a combination of Edith Wharton, Charles Dickens, Henry James with a little Danielle Steele are not far off the mark.

I agreed with the reading because I know just about where my BMI is for my size. Then I decided to input my ideal height, weight and age as guest #9, just for grins and giggles. So I put these figures in and held on to the handles. I was thinking that it would error out, or something, because surely the \\"electrical current\\" would find me out to be a liar. It didn't. It gave me an ideal BMI and body fat percentage for the data I inputted. This machine is nothing more than a calculator. Don't waste your money.

The Omron tells me that my body fat is the same as when I started. In fact, some of the readings I get are higher than when I started. I have followed the directions to a tee and am still getting different readings every time I use it. In addition, my BMI has remained unchanged. I think the Omron is easy to use and is somewhat accurate, but obviously not as accurate as I had hoped.

The results on this device - for me - have been significantly higher than when I use a four-sight caliper method and the US Navy circumference method. However, I reccomend using this product as a measure of absolute change: if it tells you that you have 25% BF on day 1 and 20% BF on day 120, then you lost 5 points. The truth may be that you went from 21% to 16%. Don't get too hung up on the numbers, but rather the change in the numbers over time.

Just when you think you've got it right it doesn't record any steps. I walked for 3 miles and it only recorded a few hundred steps. Other times it would record way too many steps. Having used other Omron pedometers in the past this one was extremely disappointing. I'm going back to get the HJ-112 eventhough it is bulky. I guess you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Excellent","review":"Easy to use; and a wicked incentive to lose weight. Have lost 20 kilos in just a few months from walking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like it","review":"This is not a very good pedometer. Not consistent, not accurate. I had one much cheaper years ago that did a better job. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Omron pedometer","review":"Great product! Love the details for steps, miles, date and time. This is a great product to use for my 5 mile a day walks, The only problem is the battery life is very limited. I had it less than 3 months and the battery died. I had a hard time finding that particular battery, but lucked out that a similar battery could be used instead. I had a pedometer that was less expensive and of less quality that I had for years and the battery lasted until i broke it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must have gotten the lemon","review":"This is the most grossly inaccurate pedometer ever to the point that it looks as if it were deliberate! I used the Omron HJ-112 pedometer, a very accurate one, for comparison and the HJ-105 was registering twice and sometimes three times as many steps. Based on the rest of the reviews I must have gotten the lemon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Not very accurate,spend your money on the Orman HJ112,very accurate and gives more info."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've never even successfully used it.","review":"I attempted getting it calibrated, switching it different places on my person, etc. I couldn't get it to give me an accurate reading - and haven't successfully used it yet. My husband may have had better luck - I say try a more expensive model, but maybe I'm just not doing it right?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than most","review":"This is the best pedometer I've owned and I've owned a few.

It resets automatically and seems to be more accurate than others I've used."},{"rating":"2","title":"more than I need","review":"No problems with this pedometer, well built and easy operation. After a few months it did not count steps very accurately (as all of them seem to do). I bought a cheaper model without calorie counting and discovered if you attach the pedometer to your shoe tongue instead of your waist it will count accurately. I have been using it this way for over a year with no problems. Only con with this model is if you stop for a while it will restart counting when you restart walking.I need to know my steps for my walk total whether I stop or not. Otherwise a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Bought this for my wife. I figured the good reviews outweighed the bad ones. I was wrong. It completely fell apart after a couple of weeks of her using it. Don't waste your money like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it's just me...","review":"Unfortunately, this item doesn't actually count the steps correctly for me. There's a little switch to help calibrate the pedometer, but no matter how I set the calibration if I walk 50 steps it shows that I walked 4 or 5. It counts based on shaking, so maybe I'm just so smooth the pedometer can't tell I'm walking, but I doubt it. Honestly, I had pretty low expectations, so I'm not shocked."},{"rating":"2","title":"best so far","review":"I have tried a variety of pedometers - in terms of features and design and price this is easily the best - I particularly like the aerobic minutes feature and the belt clip design - I went thru several other pedometers where the clip broke after a few months - this one is a spring clip that seems more reliable. It has seven day memory for all values, calorie counter, sensitivity setting - more features for less money. I have used it for a couple months so far and have no complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seens to work OK, but the Omron HJ-112 is MUCH better","review":"This product has a very \\"toy like\\" feel. The case is flimsy, the buttons feel funny, just toy-like. It only works when positioned horizontally onyour belt. Seems to work OK, but don't dare drop it or it'll break. The light plastic case has a heavy metal weight glued inside.Why not spend $8 more for the superb Omron HJ-112? The HJ-112 has dual pendulums inside so it counts accurately whether on your belt or in your pocket. And it's built like a tank."},{"rating":"2","title":"Omron HJ-105 Pedometer","review":"Handy instrument for counting steps and miles at a reasonable price.

Continually resets in the middle of the day so can't keep track of anything, then started freezing on me. Only thing I could do was readjust the battery but the battery compartment is IMPOSSIBLE to open. Tried with numerous different size screwdrivers and ended up stripping the screw & finally breaking it open just to reset the thing. Now held together by tape which is ridiculous.

SMALL Display. The Calorie Burnt Counter is Kcal vs regular calories. I ran on the treadmill and compared my Calories burned and Distance and it was VERY OFF! Overall the pedometer said I only burned 83 kcal I ran for 30 mins and walked for 15 mins = 45 mins total in which the treadmill stated I burned 400 Calories. You must also calculate the kcal according to your age, but my results did not come close to the treadmill measurements. Dissapointed. I bought this because of the reviews on how accurate it is. But it's not. Have you compared it to something else? a bike or a treadmill?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"When it works, it's fine.

I never did get the thing to work. I have had pedometers before and they have always been easy to operate. This one wasn't. The pedometer doesn't cost enough to go through the hassle of returning it at your cost. It's just easier to buy a new one. However, I suggest that you purchase it in person from a sporting goods or health store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even test it out for a full 24 hours!","review":"The sensitivity settings are inconsistent.

Many thanks to the author Nick Ryan - this vivid account of his experience with the far right took me right out of my comfort zone. Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An important and prescient book","review":"Nick Ryan has written an excellent book that will one day be recognised for its prescience. Courting a web of extremists, he travels in search of explanations for the often sordid and pathetic reality of race haters. There are some truly frightening revelations here: about the 'comradeship' networks of modern Germany, the tortured Christian fundamentalist in Arkansas, the links to the suave Pat Buchanan, the brutality of Combat 18 leader Charlie Sargent. Homeland is an important book, ahead of its time, worthy of comparison with the reportage of Orwell and Paul Theroux at their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silent Partner","review":"Jonathan Kellerman's book Silent Partner deviated from his usual formula for a crime novel as his protagonist was the good doctor himself, Dr. Delaware. It was a nice change as he built suspense as you got further into the novel.

Had to give up and throw it away after little more than half of the book. Maybe Johnthan Kellerman should just hang it up. Wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Readers who know other Jonathan Kellerman novels may be just a little bit disappointed. This one is on the one hand pretty simple as far as the action is concerned. But the plot is not really conceivable, the events are sometimes too far away from any acceptable reality, the psychology is more related to that of a Sidney Sheldon novel than to that of a professional. The ending is illogical, and the origins and the upbringing of Sharon are simply improbable.But nevertheless, the story is suspenseful and by no means boring. But this is the only credit I can give it. Kellerman has done a lot better in his other books - at least those I know. He may be forgiven this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed it, but...","review":"This one is somewhat different than the usual Alex Delaware novel in that Delaware is much more personally involved--so much of the story is his history as well as the dead(?) ex-lover's. A few times I had lapses of memory and did not know of which woman he was speaking--my bad.As with all the other Kellerman novels, it was a quick and enjoyable read. Bring us more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alex Delaware","review":"I liked this one - Jonathan Kellerman really leaves you \\"hanging\\" until the last few pages. He very adroitly recognizes that the reader may not have started with the first book in the \\"Delaware\\" series and deals with this by repeating past relationships without pounding on them. Professionally Kellerman holds a Ph. D., in Clinical Psychology from the University of Southern California and has long experience in working with Psychosocial Programs for children. He is married to the author Faye Kellerman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silent Partner","review":"This was not one of the best written by Kellerman it jumped around and was slizzzze I have read many of his book and this was"},{"rating":"1","title":"Feh!","review":"This is the fourth and last of Kellerman's books that I will read. It is a nasty little book--by little I mean in quality not quantity (it is in fact nearly 500 p. long, too long). Of all the unnecessarily convoluted stories I've the misfortune to read (and it is difficult for me to stop reading a book once I've begun) this is the worst. And for a while it seemed it would never end. I enjoyed the 1st and 3rd in the series, the 2nd less so, and as I read I kept wondering what happened to the author of those books. Oh, well, thankfully there is no dearth of books to read--which is why I won't waste my time on any more of these."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE GREATEST VOICES ON THE PLANET!","review":"One of the gratest voices on the planet.

I am already getting chondroitin sulfate and MSM in a larger dose in another supplement, and I never tried taking collagen before.

I think that O'Brian ranks with Austen, Twain, Forster, etc. regardless of 'genre'. However, Simon Vance just does not do justice to this book. I have not heard his renditions of others in this series, but if his Aubrey voice is consistent, they must all be disasters. Aubrey sounds like one of Monty Python's Twits. Vance also rushes descriptions that deserve much better pacing. He also seems to miss much of the wit hidden in O'Brian's circumlocations -- or is much too subtle at conveying it.

This is in my opinion one of the best in the series, with Captain Aubrey facing not only hostile ships but also the dangers of the Southern seas, including Antarctic storms, icebergs, a near mutiny, and a shipwreck on the deserted island of the title. His colleague Stephen Maturin, spy and naturalist, is at his best, alternately humorous (in the old meaning of the word) and quietly courageous.

Leopard, is chased by the Dutch warship Waakzaamheid through frigid, uncharted waters between Africa and Australia.

There is a very faint taste of strawberry-like flavor but what little flavor I was able to crush out of these things was not worth the work my jaws had to put in to get it. Even as I write this, having tossed the package away 20 minutes ago, I have a rather nasty after-taste even Lifebouy might not get out.

The average is so high, however, that it's well worth picking up if you're a fan of horror, mystical SF, or especially a Lovecraft fan. The stories show the influence of the Great Old Ones in Elizabethan England, the space program, the pine barrens of New Jersey and astral space in dreams. And, in the standout story of the book (H.P.L. by Gahan Wilson), Lovecraft appears as a character, as do Clark Ashton Smith and many, many, many bad things from his works.

But the book as a whole is strangely incoherent. The order of the chapters seems almost random, as the book jumps from topic to disconnected topic. For example, we are given a clear account of how to work matrices...and then are never told or shown WHY we bothered learning it in the first place--we're hustled off to another unrelated topic. So-called theorists in our fad-ridden education departments call this technique \\"spiraling,\\" a tactic designed to keep the little kiddies on their toes and off balance and thus more receptive to exploring new things. Or something like that. In actual practice, however, as well as according to common sense, the result of \\"spiraling\\" is only frustration and confusion. If Cohen would rearrange the order of the chapters and provide some connective tissue, this would probably make it a really good textbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incoherent is the word, all right","review":"I'm an honors math major who had to use this text for a high-school AP math class a few years ago.The first reviewer has hit the nail on the head. A reader could be forgiven for thinking Cohen suffered from ADHD. He's fine at explaining the small picture, but utterly hopeless at fitting all the little bits into any kind of coherent framework. This book is all over the place, bouncing here and there, seemingly at mere whim. It doesn't really matter WHY it's so disorganized--whether the result of some ed-school fad or a publisher's marketing strategy. In the end, it's still disorganized.If your professor takes the trouble to rearrange the order of the chapters and provides plenty of supplemental material, this book might be marginally useful. But I certainly wouldn't recommend it as the primary text for a precalc course. Michael Sullivan's textbook is better organized, if not quite so lucid in its particulars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Math Text","review":"This text is really worthless as far as teaching you precalculus. The text never seems to help you through the critical steps to understanding a concept. There is also a lot of mathematical jargon that non-math savvy students will probably find confusing in understanding precalculus. The only reason to buy it is if your professor assigns problems from it so buy the cheapest one you can if you must have it for a math class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good chapters, poor layout","review":"I see that other reviewers have beaten me to the punch. I, too, found the individual chapters very good and the overall organization confused.

I find many of the bugs on my property very useful and don't want to kill them - the ladybugs that eat aphids, the dragonflies that eat mosquitoes, etc. Then the birds and lizards eat the poisoned bugs and I'm not sure what the consequences of that are, but they couldn't be good.

She also likes to kinda rock on the chair, but that was a simple \\"NO\\", and she stopped. Overall, she loves it and loves having snacks on it and playing (well wiping it clear of all toys).

It's sturdy, easily cleaned, has a rim around the edge to prevent crayons etc falling off, and she's able to move the chairs (and the table) around to wherever she wants them, with ease. They are hollow, and have little plugs in them so you could probably fill them with sand to weigh them down if you were using them outside where it could blow around the yard. I love the colors too.

In naval aircraft such as the F/A-18 there is even instruments for landing on aircraft carriers, all of which are functional. The graphics are pretty good as-well, mainly with the planes. If you're looking for a realistic game this is for you. And don't get upset and call names at it because you're not patient. You will need patience to \\"learn\\" this game.

The actual game play is enjoyable and would place the game in the company of games like Tom Clancy's HAWX. There is a certain Top Gun feeling to the game that would make it an enjoyable entry into airplane game genre. However, the game is kind of buggy. The achievements are standard: beat a level, get an achievement. Unfortunately, getting the achievement seems to freeze the game/system and requires restarting the system and frustratingly replaying the level (the achievement will be saved, but the finished level will not be, so the NEXT time you beat you beat the level, you can proceed without issue).

All it is a face in a military uniform with a very bland voiceover. As for the graphics the closer you get to the ground the scenery gets uglier.

Her husband had no problem with assembly. Both of them say that the bicycle is very well built and still relatively lightweight. She reports that the ride is smooth and that the seat is especially comfortable. But, her favorite thing about the bike is its' girly, pink frivolousness. I consider the cost of this bike definitely puts it in the 'luxury purchase' category, but in this case it was well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Pink Cruiser","review":"I ordered this bike for myself as my Mother's Day present.

I wish I could have ordered the 19 inch since I'm 5'11 but so far it looks like it should work for me. It has been years since I've ridden a bike and I've already taken it for a spin around the block. The paint is awesome and it arrived on time with no damage. The price is a bit high but if it lasts...it is worth it. Hubby was impressed that it is a licensed GM product. Looking forward to riding with my nieces and nephews around the block and on the beach :) Terri"},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is too much","review":"Please don't waste any money on this film. The idea of the film is wonderful but it never delivers. Between the bad acting and the deviations from scripture you hardly recognize the story at all. The writer seems more interested in furthering his anti-Semitic cause then exploring race issues. If you don't know anything about history, scripture or not really interested in either then you might get something out of it, otherwise skip it. My only regret in that this movie bombed is that people may think that no one is interested in seeing biblical characters being portrayed as people of color when the truth is the movie is just bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"I pray for a better and more in depth attempt","review":"I am a black man in America. I saw \\"The Passion\\" by Mel Gibson. In the same respect I saw this movie by Jean-Claude LaMarre. I respected Jean-Claude ever since I first saw him playing a role in Malcom X. Yet, after this film I cannot help but feel saddened by his efforts. After all these years, is Jesus' death for the sins of mankind to be cheapened by the result of racial discrimination? The movie did not give an accurate portrayal of the events that led to the death of Jesus Christ. If anyone argues this point, I beg them to go read a Holy Bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blasphemous at best","review":"The idea of Jesus being black is no more absurd than Jesus being a blue eyed blond. That is not the point. According to the New Testament Jesus of Nazareth was tried and convicted of blasphemy. He claimed to be God which really ticked off the religious leaders of the day. This film throws out that idea entirely and has Jesus being a victim of racial bigotry. The film also reports that the only reason that Jesus was born in a manger is because black folks were not welcomed at the Inn. It dosen't stop there. Jesus is crucified but is not raised from the dead. Just one more misunderstood black man who ain't coming back. This movie will likely appeal to those who are more interested in Tupac than Jesus. The film is the product of modern American political correctness rather than a depiction of Jerusalem 2000 years ago. The only way this could have been made worse if they had subtitled this \\"Jesus--the Original Gangsta\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black But Not Proud Of This Movie","review":"This movie is to focused on race.

Maybe a good production, starring a black man as Jesus, can be made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete and utter mess","review":"Its not the idea that Jesus was a man of color, there are clear indications that he might have been. Its the ridiculous notions and \\"creative liberty\\" that is taken with the scripture. I am so upset and hurt by this sinful depiction of Jesus, his disciples and the events leading up to his death.Sure, if he was black I truly believe that the crucifixion had something to do with him being black, but the reality is that there is no scriptural proof that Judas raped Mary or that Mary was \\"in love\\" with Jesus or that Jesus was a man of worry, fear or indifference.It is these types of destructive \\"interpretations\\" that lead people astray. I am also disgusted that Bishop Jakes was so money motivated that he would allow his movie to be a preview on something that so obviously nullifies scripture for self interpretation and profit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Purchase","review":"I think if you are sincerely looking for an experience of the Cross and the Christ of the Cross you should not spend one cent on this DVD"},{"rating":"2","title":"**A Must See **","review":"The \\"TRUTH\\" will set you free !!

But because he was Jewish and the Greeks and Romans hated the Jews, especially one who claimed to be the King of Kings. The Greek and Roman kings declared that they were God and were worshiped by their subjects. If not, they would be killed. Well, here comes Jesus, not only Jewish, but claiming to sit on a throne higher than theirs. So Jesus was indeed a threat. That's why they killed him. Because bottom line, he called for everyone, kings included, to worship the one true God. Jesus WAS dark skinned, but because he was Jewish. He could have been purple for all I care. But it is important to understand that Jesus said he is for ALL people. We don't have to mess with biblical facts in order to believe in his love and redemption for ALL people. Just accept him as he is, don't go trying to change the truth in order to make him more palatable or stylish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different","review":"This movie is told from a very different point of view of why Jesus was not accepted as the Savior of the Jews.

My 5 year old daughter loves to listen in the car while we drive... if she's tired she wants \\"A Love That Never Grows Old,\\" if she's wanting to boogie she asks for \\"The Devil's Right Hand\\" & put it on repeat!! It is a highly evocative journey in music, reflecting the journey the movie took. All the acoustic pieces are heart-wrenching and beautiful. The vocal pieces, from Willie Nelson's version of the Bob Dylan song \\"He Was a Friend of Mine\\" to Rufus Wainwright's haunting \\"The Maker Makes,\\" are just as amazing. A masterfully crafted CD.

I'm not sure that I've ever been affected by a soundtrack like this before! Listening to this is like watching the movie over and over again. Emmylou Harris was the perfect pick to sing \\"A Love That Will Never Grow Old\\" - the tearfulness in her voice is haunting, touching. The instrumentals, the new music as well as the remakes by Willie Neslon and Rufus Wainwright round out this musical collection, and, with any love story, the Teddy Thompson's \\"I Don't Want To Say Goodbye\\" says it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreaking and Haunting--the Perfect Score and Soundtrack","review":"Brokeback Mountain is a movie that haunts you, gets inside your soul and gnaws away, and generally just doesn't leave you. Part of that mystery and experience is this gorgeous, haunting score and perfectly chosen soundtrack selections. You hear the lean, spare score long after the movie is done. It's as evocative of the rugged, basic world the movie's two main characters inhabit as their spare dialogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant music, but lacking one vital song","review":"I adore this CD. It is gorgeous music, so well done. And if you have seen the film, it will have you bawling all over again, especially during Gustavo Santaolalla's music.This CD is missing one of the most beautiful songs in the movie, however: Rick Garcia's hauntingly gorgeous rendition of \\"Quizas, Quizas, Quizas\\" by Osvaldo Farres. I am grief-stricken that this was left off of the \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" soundtrack. To me, it was the most beautiful version of this song I have ever heard, and it set a stunning scene as Jack Twist strolled through the mysterious nighttime streets of Juarez, Mexico.Fans of the movie will not be disappointed with the other songs, though. The CD is worth the price for \\"No One's Gonna Love You Like Me\\" and Willie Nelson's rendition of \\"He Was A Friend of Mine\\" alone. Bravo to all involved. But if a new CD is issued, please add \\"Quizas Quizas Quizas\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Fit!","review":"Usually I don't buy movie soundtracks, but this one is too good to pass up. And it is a show of support for this remarkable movie. Most of these songs are about deep and true sentiments but the overall feel of the album is not over-sentimental.The lyric of the first tune, \\"A Friend of Mine\\", fits the plot of the movie like it was written for it. The other covers (especially, the whimsical \\"King of the Road\\") are lighter (even fun) tunes that balance out the heavier stuff. The original songs written for this movie are the best -- truly sublime! You can even say \\"A Love That Will Neve Grow Old\\", \\"No One's Gonna Love You Like Me\\" and \\"I Don't Want To Say Goodbye\\" are Jack's songs for Ennis, while \\"I Will Never Let You Go\\" and \\"The Maker Makes\\" are Ennis' songs for Jack. They really evoke the core sentiment of the movie. The instrumental pieces are like the landscape of Wyoming from which these songs of human yearnings take shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unexpected Gem","review":"I am the last one who would buy a country CD-but I loved the movie & the music was just as memorable. I only wish some of the instrumental pieces were longer. I often skip from one instrumental piece to the next. The songs take me back to the amazing scenic beauty of the movie. The music is hauntingly beautiful & mezmerizing."},{"rating":"2","title":"As beautiful as the movie itself..","review":"I love this soundtrack and everytime I listen to it, I'm instantly brought back to Brokeback Mountain. I am usually not too big of a fan of country music, but this this particular score is very soft and easy on the ears. I love the songs as well, especially \\"I Don't Want to Say Goodbye\\" and \\"Devil's Right Hand\\". I'm disappointed the score didn't win a Golden Globe. It definitely deserves a good listening. It's very soothing and I can't stop listening to it. I think this and the Walk the Line soundtrack are two of the best ones to be released in 2005.It's really beautiful and matches the sweeping landscapes of BBM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great soundtrack, even greater film-","review":"When I saw the film, I was stunned.

It complements the film and sets the gut-wrenching mood for many of the films scenes. Sparsely orchestrated, it is not one of those bombastic soundtracks that have become so popular of late.The soundtrack also contains some of the songs used in the film, like the Golden Globe winning song by Santoalalla and Elton John's old lyricist Bernie Taupin and performed by Emmy Lou Harris, plus two great songs by Rufus Wainwright."},{"rating":"1","title":"snore...","review":"It is my opinion that the oscars were rigged. No one who listens to the instrumentals on this soundtrack along with the glorious music of \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" or \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" can make any comparison, unless they have no musical background. It's like comparing the wailing of a hound dog to the strains of a Rachmaninoff masterpiece.Your money could be much better spent, unless you want to be lulled to sleep by monotonous music without a singable melody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great CD","review":"Good soundtrack CD for what will probably go down in history as one of the most overrated, overhyped movies of all time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.","review":"Brad Rowan is happily married and runs a successful business.

The moments of first contact between modern Western European and other world cultures are among the most fascinating episodes in all history and several appear in this book. Here is history as personality rather than process and for this reader this made a complex subject very approachable.

I was impressed by Milton's evaluations of how the island of Run became so important, but less so by his focus on the European side of the story.

Then, it stopped doing heart rate readouts altogether. If I did get a readout, it would be very off. For example, after doing an intense cardio workout, it said my heart rate was 55. Impossible, with how hard I was gasping for air! Other times, right before I even started a workout, it would say I had a heart rate of 220. I guess if you buy cheap, you get cheap stuff. Next time I will definitely buy one with a chest strap, such as ones made by Polar. This was a totally unreliable product--one I started out liking, but now want to smash into pieces because it won't do what it is designed to do!

Silver Insanity is great, lots of unique items, great service and the best prices...see for yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No hallelujahs for this garbage","review":"Without further introductions...First, it should be mentioned somewhere that this is a one-take live recording. Which means every four bars you'll hear a cough or a paper shuffling noise.Second, the tenor soloist sounds like he's singing Puccini at his most melodramatic. Wildly inappropriate for a Baroque piece.And lastly, Harnoncourt's interpretation has much more interpretation than substance. The tempi are at times painfully slow, and the dynamics are profanely exaggerated on multiple occasions.So to sum it up, yes, Messiah is a great piece, but you need a recording that will do it justice. I'd recommend the Boston Baroque one (Handel - Messiah / Clift Robbin Fowler Ledbetter Boston Baroque, Pearlman), but I would imagine almost anything is better than this disgrace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lonnie's early albums are better.","review":"Although just about any album from the master Lonnie Liston Smith is a must have, this album has too many \\"filler\\" type songs on it.

True, Sylvia McNair sings beautifully as always, but the New Age backing by Daniel Kobialka is not to my taste. And there is far more Kobialka than McNair! On several tracks she contributes only a touch of vocalise to the synthetic 'orchestral' texture, and on one track she is absent altogether. Kobialka's music is repetitive, and one track sounds very much like another. Music to make love by, perhaps - I have been unable so far to test its effectiveness for this purpose - but not music to listen to. Lovers of Sylvia McNair's wonderful albums with Andre Previn should make sure that they like this sort of thing before buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good overall text","review":"I took this class with one of the authors, George McGuire.

I was using them in a fashion commensurate with how they should be utilized, and I was not slip knotting them or anything like that. While tearing the band does not render it completely useless (as it can simply be gripped differently), I was nevertheless irritated with the shoddy quality of the bands.Band training is something I think is a good supplement to a well rounded training routine, and I definitely subscribe to their use.

And, like his other books, the text is somewhat technical, but in a sense that it adds great depth to each visual piece. One neat thing that jumps out at the reader who is familiar with the other books in this collection, are the familiarity of certain spaceships. I.e.

Thanks, Craig, for a great gift idea that is helpful and very funny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"So I purchased this as a joke gift for Christmas for my husband.

But it lasts beyond that and really does have some interesting tips. I left it around the house and pick it up to read a chapter every once in a while. It's funny, clever, and educational."},{"rating":"1","title":"For complete idiots","review":"This book is a stinker, a really lame effort. The audience is apparently newly married midwestern ex-frat boys. Written in the breezy jocular tone of such junky magazines as GQ and Details. Extremely shallow. Wallows in the stereotype of men as beer-swilling, farting, football-loving oafs; overworks the tired concept of \\"the war between the sexes.\\" If you like this you are 100% normal and probably watch lots of television."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed with \\"kit\\"","review":"This is not a kit.

My son is 8 years old and the wig was a little too small. He wore it anyway and it was good enough for what he needed it for. I gave two stars because of size. The wig was fine otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wahington Costume","review":"I bought this for a school presentation for my 8 year old who will be be John Hancock and this was the closest I could find. It was a little more than I would like to spend on a costume for school, but for what it id it will do. Please note that the net piece that goes around the head to hold it on is VERY small and barely fits my 8 year olds head. We cut a slit in it to make it not so tight, and it will do for a 5 minute presentation. But if you are using it for anything more than that, or you have a large head, you may want to think twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk, don't waste your time/money","review":"Junk, spend another few dollars for better wig.....frilly scarf was not frilly at all.

We had been needing an extra camera battery for a while and decided (before a long vacation) that this would be a good one. It does have a car charger adapter. We received the package and got it all charged up and ready to go. Within 2 weeks (while on our long vacation), the battery pretty much died. It wouldn't last more than a hand full of shots and we had to keep the display turned off to get those. The charger also would not charge our Sony battery. Then one night after charging, I put the battery in the camera, and the camera gave me an error when it turned on, then turned itself back off. It wouldn't work after that. The name brand items are more expensive, but you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good leather - elegant look","review":"This bag looks pretty, nice red colour, has good quality leather.

If the scores could be qualified, I'd say 5 stars for BTO, zero for the folks who remastered."},{"rating":"1","title":"I still ain't seen nothin' yet.","review":"I was 14 when I saw my 2nd concert. It was far out to get tickets for this show. I had a hard time sleeping waiting till the day I saw BTO. What a waste of good night sleep. This show was a BIG disappointment.

I warned you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"I've had this product for a few months now, and it works exactly as expected. Was easy to install. Does a great job burning (haven't had any coasters yet and is fast).

Definitely recommend this product, especially for the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dvd burner","review":"I've had no problems with the lite on drive. It was easy to install. It burns fast but I haven't been able to find blank dvds that are 20x so I can't say if it'll burn that fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Product","review":"The DVD writer was defective. I wasted a lot of time trying to figure out what was wrong. The company has no toll free customer service number, but expects you to pay to talk to them about their junk product. The online email chat was somewhat helpful, but still left me with a poor impression of the company. I returned the product and bought another company's DVD writer. My time's too valuable to waste trying to deal with a company that doesn't value taking care of its customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING! NOT LITE SCRIBE","review":"After what I thought was careful comparison between the various models, I selected what I thought was the LITEON model with LIGHT SCRIBE labeling.Either myself or Amazon made the mistake- not sure- (only $2 difference and very similar model numbers). Either way, I wound up without the LIGHT SCRIBE feature.I want to stress that there are reviews under THIS MODEL that talk about LIGHT SCRIBE. This model DOES NOT include that feature. Be very careful if you want that feature to get the model that includes it- and read your conformation email carefully!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed Feelings","review":"I have mixed feelings about this drive.

It played music CD's fine, but the DVD sound was bad. So I went on Lite-On's website for a live chat with a customer support representative. The support rep responded quickly to my question and suggested that I needed a dvd codec. He told me to go to Cyberlink's wbsite and download PowerDVD. In other words, he was telling me to pay more money than the drive cost to be able to properly play DVD's on it. I asked him why they didn't include PowerDVD with the drive, but he couldn't answer me. I am returning the drive to Amazon for a refund and getting another one - and it won't be a Lite-On."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but coasters","review":"Tried everything I could, but after making 25 coasters of various media, I just gave up. Experience level - advanced. Media rattled around in tray also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Drive was returned. Did not perform as stated. Took many times longer to create a CD than my old drive. I gave this info with the returned item. It may have been defective or just overly agressive advertising. It was not a 20x, but more like a 2 x."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very easy to install!","review":"This unit was very easy to install. My pc had no problem identifying it. I really liked the fact that I had 2 color options regarding the front/cover plate. The entire installation process took me about 20 minutes, including changing the unit's cover plate! Producing a DVD was no problem (though I didn't use the software that came w/Lite-On). I would have given the product 5 stars, but the Lite-On is a little louder than my cd burner. I don't really care for the Nero software, plus I have yet to use the LightScribe feature. Overall, I'd definitely buy the product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Performance","review":"A wonderful album. The Nocturno is my favorite, and although I don't agree musically with some of Mr. Pyatt's ideas, the technique is great, with a minor exception (listen closely to the longest grace note figure). If you want some different tastes and some rarely heard pieces, get this recording. Although some of the music isn't really pleasant to listen to (in my humble opinion), the nearly flawless and beautiful playing won me over. I think he could have done more with some of it, but it's a lot better than most of us hornists can do, so for the wonderful technique and boost of inspiration, I give it a five star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another bad Gary Daniels movie","review":"Gary Daniels plays a bounty hunter in a futuristic world similiar toThe Road Warrior. His brother in-law's sister is pregnant and her baby has an anti-virus that can help save the world. A guy named Little Ray (Bryan Genesse) wants the woman for himself because he is a bad guy.I can't even describe how horrible this movie is. Gary Daniels is basically playing Isaac Florentine's version of Mad Max. There is a lot of mindless talk and no real story, and a Gary Daniels fight thrown in every 10-15 minutes. The action is not bad, certainly a lot better thanFatal Blade, but it is hard to get into a fight when there is no point to it. Even when they could have had a really cool finale, ther is no creativity involved. The 2 guys just go up in the air and kick eachother like it is a kung fu movie from 1971. I made it all the way through this, but it was very hard. Highly not recommended.1.5/5The DVD from Image Entertainment has good sound and very good picture quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 out of 5 for action only","review":"This has got to be one of Gary Daniels best movies. The story was okay, the acting average, but the action and martial arts was way above average! The only bad thing in this movie was Daniels western theme song which was so annoying. However the shootouts where great especially when Gary Daniels flipped off a wall shooting a guy behind him during the flip! So far I have never seen something like that even in Hong kong movies! So buy this movie for its great sound and great action. P.S. The end fight between Daniels and the villian is top notch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"P. U. What a stinker!","review":"This is a rotten movie. It is a rip off of some old, tired western and a kung fu movie. It has bad acting, bad fight scenes, and no story. If I had the flexibility, I'd kick my own butt for buying this dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fan","review":"For you Gary Daniels fans this is a must see. This is probably the best movie he has in his filmology. You will not be disappointed with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre...","review":"I was very much disappointed with this movie. The plot of the movie at the beginning seems to be interesting. But that doesn't last long. Everything starts to fall down after the widow and her brother-in-law gets acquainted with each other. The ending is another absurdity that needs to be highlighted but due to the review policy restrictions, I'm holding that one out.The fighting scenes are o.k. One note on the fighting scenes though: the director of this movie should have paid more attention to the details as the ropes hanging behind the stuntmen can be clearly seen.Even if you have 10 dollars to spare, don't waste it on this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow what can I say","review":"Well I've never seen the lead actor before and I will probablypass on any future movies of his. He is nice to look at even the bad guy was easy on the eyes. But I would rate this movie a C- (or 2 stars) it is a low budget and came across as such."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy","review":"Piece of junk. It comes with the inserts separate. You have to put them in yourself and when you do, you can barely zip it shut. I might last one month at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality CD from a once truly great band.","review":"Blackfoot is my favorite southern rock band. I had visions of a great live album matching the caliper of the several live cuts on the compliation \\"Rattlesnake Rock and Roll\\". Quite frankly, they should have left this one in the vault. The sound quality is terrible and the performance overall is just not their best. I wish they'd have released \\"Siogo\\" or \\"Highway Song\\" instead, that would be a treasure trove for die-hard fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHOULD HAVE BURIED THIS ONE!","review":"It pains me to give a Blackfoot release a bad review but trust me ,there was no other option on this one.Blackfoot was without a doubt one of the greatest live acts I've ever seen but this recording does them no justice.The fire that Medlocke and Co.always brought to the stage is without a doubt missing here.If it's live Blackfoot at their best you're looking for,then look no further than their first live release 'Highway Song'and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A young adults history of the California Gold Rush.","review":"Axon gives us a short history of the California Gold Rush. He details some brief history of the gold discovery in 1848, talks a little about the 48ers and more about the 49ers, and then moralizes in the last third of this very short book about discrimination, racism, and other aspects. I guess Gordon feels he has to lecture his young readers about the evils of society long gone. Well, I wanted a little more history, and not some morality lecture.In any book, I am looking to learn something. I could have learned more if the author kept on track. He did not, and that is why I rated this book low."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a fabulous example of ethnonography, w/ a variety of recordings","review":"I recommend purchasing this recording -- there's not much like it. A graduate student, whose paper is included as a small type insert to this CD, recorded live Puerto Rican music in a variety of settings, from someone's back yard near the leeward O'ahu coastline, to a January church service in St. Theresa's in Kalihi that some of my family members attended in celebration of El Dia De La Tres Reyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"unfortunate amateurs","review":"This recording is very amateurish at best. Bad music and poor singing at what seems to be a live event with poor audio qualities. I heard the original Kachi-Kachi album of 30years ago and at least they were playing PuertoRican hillbillie music. The accordeons are generally rarely used in Puerto Rican music plus the rhytms The rhythms are totally off, and only some songs recall a Puerto Rican tune. I give them B for the effort of keeping the love and traditions of Puerto Rican music. They are trying hard and having fun, but it sounds like a family get together sing-along. Hawaii has wonderful mucisians. Some pros should attempt to replicate the great sounds of Bomba y Plena and Aguinaldos of the P.R. island. The great Japanese salsa and bomba band \\"La Luz\\" is a great example. They don't speak Spanish but wow can they duplicate the Puerto Rican sound perfectly. I love my Hawaii-Rican people but the people deserve a better effort so they know what the real music sounds like. Aloha!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst product ever...","review":"Can't speak much about actually using this product. When I received it and unboxed it, it was destroyed. Straight from the factory. No damage to the box or during shipment. Pieces were actually broken off the fact and the metal encasement was bent, but no plastic was inside the box. So, it was dropped before it was packaged at the factory, packaged anyway and then subsequently returned to Amazon. Buy from Amazon, just not this company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality and sensor didn't work","review":"I purchased this unit based on the good comments from other reviewers. But it turned out to be a big mistake.Sensor reading was not accurate. It showed 50% humidity while my other odometer indicated 70%. How could it be 50% humidity in the basement in August? Also, it continued to shut down after a few minutes and wouldn't go back on even I set the sensor to much lower level. Besides, it was extremely loud. It sounded like someone was using lawn mawer in the basement. I don't think anyone can stand the noise in the same room. The packaging was very poor, the bottom almost fell apart when I received it.It looks like the sensor of this unit is defective and the quality in gernal is very poor. I have returned this unit to Amazon and purchased a different brand locally. The other brand works well and is much quiter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tripping circuit breaker","review":"We just purchased this dehumidifier after reading the majority of positive views and were very excited to use it, but the unit keeps tripping the circuit breaker after running for about 5-10 minutes.

As soon as it slides back about 1/16\\" the unit thinks the bucket is overfull and starts it's annoying and insistent beeping. No matter how hard or how many times you push the bucket back into the unit, a few minutes later it slips back a bit. This is one of the silliest and most unnecessary design flaws I have ever seen.[edit] Well, I did find a way to make the bucket stay in--most of the time--by wedging some pieces of cardboard under it.

All that space (for interviews, or film, or stats, or sounds, or more photos, or ANYTHING) is filled by a few bad photos and more useless, bland info.On the other hand, it is about the Angels incredible run, and includes World Series Game 6, the greatest game in Angel history.

Not at full price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet but short!","review":"Battle stations Midway is an absolute BLAST to play its amazing how they fused together 1st person shooter and 3rd person. But because of the skill it took to do this they could only produce a small amount of levels 11 to be exact. But after that you can hit the challenges which are special challenges in a specific region of the game. For example,there are 4 ship challenges, 3 plane challenges, and 3 submarine challenges.

The speakers appear to be blue on the picture, but they are actually dark-silverish-black in reality.These speakers are good if your PC doesn't have any or if you don't care much about sound, since it does make up with the FM radio feature and a nifty LCD clock on the other speaker. However, if you are looking for the next-generation, great sounding speakers, you might want to look elsewhere. Don't get me wrong, it does sound good, but not GREAT. Another lacking feature is the taht it doesn't have the AM stations, only FM. The fact that you can use these without the PC sounds good, but these days, you might rarely need it.Bottom Line: Need speakers? This is a good bargain. Looking for those something-special speakers? You might look somewhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good speakers - great price!","review":"When I first saw these speakers I thought it was a little silly to have an FM radio built-in but now that I have them I find myself using them all the time. The cool thing is that I can be listening to the radio and the sounds of my PC still come in over the music. The LCD clock just looks kinda cool too. These speakers are plenty powerful for my office. I've never been able to turn them up all the way but I like how they sound. At $19.99 it's hard to go wrong. I just bought a few more pairs as Christmas gifts.

It just exceeds my expectation... ofcourse i didnt expect a home theatre, surround sound for $10. perfect for any office or cubicle. has just about everything i need.the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the radio tuning is a little hard, after getting used to digital tuning in cars and music systems at home. but thats just me. hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reasonable Sound, Bad Quality","review":"Even though this speakers don't sound awful, the only rating that I feel is appropriate is 2 stars --- the speakers are not durable, the piece of plastic that contains the radio dial came off mine.The LCD clock sounds like a cute idea, but I would guess most people use these speakers next to a computer, which usually displays a clock already. The radio reception is not very good indoors (as could be expected), which makes all the extras these speakers seem to offer rather useless.I've tried several cheap computer speakers, and these are definitely not among the better ones. For good cheap computer speakers check out the Creative SBS260 Speakers (ASIN B0002V9IKK).

It is very raw and I think it gives an idea of what the folk music coffeehouses of the 60s sounded like before Bob Dylan went electric.

I wanted so much to like this record. And with their creative minds writing new, original material for it this should've been a great and memorable record. Despite the fact that the vocal harmonies are there, probably the biggest reason this \\"secret session\\" never saw the light of day until now is the fact that the songs just aren't interesting despite whatever political crap the artists and their respective record companies were going through at the time that delayed its release.

I prefer knife painting and this book has been a great resource to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean color","review":"A good clean copy, almost like new. His instruction is clear and to the point, he doesn't get emotional about it or have cute names for his knives. Painting tends to be a learn by doing and palette knife painting seems to be especially so. Maybe that's why there aren't very many books about it, it's just something you learn by doing it. Having said that this is a very good book and gets you right into the practical application of the craft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific resource...","review":"I was given a very good recommendation to this book, and found it to be quite a valuable resource, showing how to create textures and the many different applications of oil medium.

But it is an ultra-simplicity that goes hand in hand--just as is the case with Mr. Capote, of course--with an enormous passion and poetic sensibility. Mr. White got high on New York City, and his ability to transpose this feeling onto me--and certainly others than me--positions him, with this single short masterpiece, and as far as my literary sensibilities go, among the likes of Ray Bradbury, Lewis Carroll, Thorne Smith and--yes, Truman Capote."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book is New York.","review":"This Book is New York. Some say it's the city's foundation. Sure,... it may be on paper, but so what. It's still New York. Take it or leave it. It's just a fact. Some say it's New York dirt. But that's what makes it so worth reading. It shows a side of the city that some New Yorkers may not know or remember. This is why it's worth your time. Similar to certain films being a love story about the city itself (Manhattan (1979), When Harry Met Sally (1989) and You've Got Mail (1998)) this book also goes with other great books about the city, including two recent ones called \\"Through The Children's Gate\\" (2006) & \\"Seven At The Sevens (2012).

The premise and idea were amazing but I couldn't connect with the characters and there was no world building what so ever. Another problem I had was the lack of development between the characters. They jump in the sack way too fast and I didn't understand why they even loved each other. I feel that the two most important things in a story are the connection to the characters and the reader and the world building. Readers want to be enveloped by a story and be taken away into a world unlike their own, this story did neither. Also the lack of climax made the book fall flat. There was not much excitement in the book, I would not recommend it.This review is also posted on my blog, Midnight book reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely amazing","review":"I have to admit...the first 1/3 of the book I was not all that impressed. The interesting concept of the book is what kept me reading. I am so, so, so glad I kept reading. This book was so creative and full of mystery. There was mystery over two (who really represented four) main characters and the lives they lived. I also loved how the author added in the TRUE character of God and how he is not a mean, evil dictator that enjoys watching us squirm. I would recommend this book to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"aweful","review":"I kept going hoping it would get better and it just got worse and worse.

I would just like to say that I found this book enthralling, and the ending was not what I had expected, but better. This book is very much worth buying. You'll want to read it more than once, there is so much that Ms. Whitcomb stows away for the reader to find later, everything so intricate and meaningful in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well crafted","review":"It's an unusual book, that's for certain. It's a love story told from the point of view of a ghost who haunts artists and poets. There's a good bit more religious feeling in it than I expected, but that's sort of in line with the general realism of the book - the ghost's thoughts and reactions are in-line with the time she lived, which is a nice change after all those romances where the people are just modern voices in old clothes. It's not really a teen romance, despite the bodies being teenaged; the characters are explicitly mature and then some, having lived to adulthood and then dying. The situations are teen, though, coping with school and teachers and the logistical restrictions of family life. There are a few deeply uncomfortable scenes, but they're very well done and completely in line with the story.All in all, it was fantastically written."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different kind of ghost story","review":"I bought this a while back in paperback on a whim, it was on sale and I figured what could I lose - I actually anticipated not liking the book because I had never heard of it before, but I absolutely feel in love with everything about it! Great characters - I actually felt in tune with them, enough action to keep me glued to the book, and a wonderful and innocent romance - something you seldom see in books anymore. Kudos to this author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very intriguing and compelling","review":"I found this book by chance while searching for the novel \\"Ghost Light\\" I came across this book. The first thing that caught my eye was the cover, it captures my attention right away. I then got a sample and after reading that I had to have this book. I really enjoyed the world you entered right away and you immediately want to help seek out all the answers with Helen. I was captivated with the story and dove right in. My only complaint is that it seemed to move very fast, I would have liked to linger in a couple places, maybe get a few more answers. Besides that, I really enjoyed this book. It does what we all try to do, which is find out what is after death and seek many answers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Original! Hard to put down!","review":"What a wonderful book!

The characters were engaging and realistic, the plot moved along at a good pace, and overall it was a lovely novel. I loved Helen's character and her internal struggle and the ending was satisfying.I only hope that anyone else who reads this book doesn't believe all Christians (if any) act as Jenny's parents did.... they were really, really terrible (at least they show an example of exactly what NOT to do). You really do end up hating them..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contemporary meets Classic","review":"A surprisingly beautiful novel. Instead of your average gal meets supernatural boy story, the main characters are ancient and young at once. Their story is complicated, gritty with a raw kind of beauty instead. The writing wraps you into the world of ghosts unlike any other novel I have read. A paranormal romance for adults as well as youth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No safe sex?","review":"**Spoiler Alert**This book had a neat concept that was unsuccessfully followed through on. Not horrible, but nothing that will stick with you.What struck me though was what a horror story the future was going to be for the kids whose bodies the ghosts had been in. James and Helen don't even bother using condoms when having sex with the bodies they are inhabiting. Towards the end it is itimated that the body Helen is in is pregnant which she seems to think is a good thing. You've got to be kidding me. Seems to me that when \\"Jenny\\" regains her body and discovers she is pregnant both she and \\"Billy\\" are going to be in a world of confusion and hurt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read","review":"One of the first books I read that amde me sit back and wonder exactly how LONG a writer must work before the words come together this way.

The story was great, and in many ways, heartwarming. The first half of the book was well developed and VERY well written.

If you want something different to read try this book you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick!!","review":"Yikes! I was hoping to find something as compelling as the Twilight series and unknowingly jumped into something practically the direct opposite. This book is about physical lust and nothing more.

This was a wasted opportunity for the author to set a good example for young adults. By allowing the characters to show some emotional maturity while dealing with the hormone induced teenage lust, the author could have added some depth to the story. Instead they had perfect (and unrealistic) sex, days after meeting...at school. Entire chapters are dedicated to mundane daily tasks with some noteworthy prose stuck in randomly. Lacking in action, intrigue and realism, this book was a waste of a good idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting idea and well written, but conscientious parents need to know . . .","review":"This book is riddled with lust and sex. It is not just mentioned as an aside. It is throughout the book, culminating in the main characters having sex repeatedly. I am about two thirds of the way though the book, but I am not even going to finish it. I feel, as an adult, the content matter is not something I really want to read about. I am horrified this book is marketed to young adults, though I am no longer surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I thought","review":"I was expecting this book to be a lot better than it actually was. the characters were just so frustrating to me and the way everything unfolded just annoyed me. I was really excited to read this novel when I bought it but I soon learned that it was not going to be even half as good. It took me a whole week and a half to finish it when usually a book that size would only take me at most 2 days. Don't buy this book. Instead borrow it from the library if you're really determined to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, heart-wrenching love story.","review":"I love this book. I actually cared about the characters, and the author really knows how to write! Wow, beautifully crafted story. The main characters, James and Helen, act out a fantastic story of forbidden love; more so because each is a spirit that has taken possession of a mortal teen's body. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, I just didn't want it to end. Just ordered her other YA book, \\"Fetch\\", and I have high hopes for it as well. Thank god it had an HEA, or I think I would have bawled my eyes out. Buy this book!

You should read this this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Story","review":"I can't describe the things that were in this story, but I'll try to explain how I felt after finishing it.

You empathize, and sympathize for the characters present state (since I can't say life...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hauntingly Pretty","review":"This was a pleasant surprise as it was a recommended reading from amazon.com. It was written well... stronger and more concise than Stephenie Meyer's work (the reason this book was recommended). The characters were interesting and believable, the story line was suspenseful in a subtle way. The only criticism is mild an only really a criticism if your uptight and don't understand the story, but due to the brief sexual content it is not really suitable for kids under the age of 15 or 16. But to each, your own.Overall, its a great book and I read the ending twice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This has to be the SWEETEST book ever!!","review":"I absolutely LOVE this book. Although it does have some sex scenes (which in my opinion are tastefully written, and make the story MUCH better), that doesn't mean that teenagers shouldn't read it. If the kid comes from a super conservative house then maybe not. But if the kid comes from a normal household, then they can totally handle it.Anyway, the story is wonderfully written. I finished it in one sitting. The ending although bittersweet, and NOT in a bad way.....SPOILER...NO it does not end badly......is absolutely perfect. This love story has to be one of the sweetest things I've ever read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the buy, definitely.","review":"I really liked this book, it was fluid, intrigueing, and compelling until the very end.

Better than 4 but... not sure if it's 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely","review":"A wonderful book with lyrical, poetic prose. I'm not sure that I'd give it to a young adult (perhaps 17/18 and older), but I thought it was beautiful and creative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"Rare is the book that reduces me to tears of joy. It plays nothing like a ghost story- which is a tribute to character development. The ending - is an ending among endings. The reward of this book pays-off: a slant of hopeful, life-giving light from above for those who need a bit of encouragement about our role in eternity. However, while inspirational,this book would never be classified under \\"Inspirational\\" or \\"Religious\\" sections of the book store shelves.This story reminds me of Evening by Diane Minot in sentiment. One of my favorite pieces- death as the universal resolution- a clarifier of what truths are truly important. A Brief History of Death is another \\"afterlife\\" story that comes to mind, though I prefer the continuity of this story better.AND SPOILER ALERT___The \\"ghost\\" characters do not resolve in a puff of nothingness, Thank God, though it gets dicey towards the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, a winner in my eyes","review":"I've read this book twice now and I can honestly say it made me cry both times. Laura Whitcomb's writing style pulled me in and I found myself finishing the book in a day (both times) People complain that it stereotypes Christianity but to me that is far from true (Christianity isn't even the POINT of the novel). But in regards to those comments, sure, it might be stereotypical, but there are both sides to the spectrum of Christianity- some families are definitely like the one in the novel. Back to the important stuff- I highly recommend this novel to anyone in need of a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romance in the afterlife","review":"If you really love the Twilight series, A Certain Slant of Light is right up your alley. This has become one of my all-time favorite novels. Centered around the spirit of Helen as she is connected to a high school English teacher. Helen has been dead for 130 years and no one has noticed her...until one day in class a young boy can both see and hear her! However, the definite twist is that this young boy is no psychic, he has more in common with Helen than anyone would think. This is a great piece of fiction that combines romance, paranormal, family problems, and the afterlife. A terrific read for young adults but also just as enjoyable for older readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"MOST CLICHED BOOK OF YEAR","review":"If I could give A Certain Slant of Light a lower rating I would.This is the most cliched book I have read in years.Most of the modern cliches are in the book:the stupid in a war and responsible for friend's death (ghost),the stupid drowned in a cellar in a light rain (ghost),the stupid drug addict family that truly loves the family members they send to the e.r.,the stupid christian family with the standard bashing,the spirits waiting for centuries to save stupid ghosts and take them to a better place cliche.That is only the beginning of the list.PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY, I wish I had."},{"rating":"2","title":"bomb","review":"enjoyed the book immensely, was different from my normal pics and, lived up to mah expectations"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Certain Slant of Light","review":"This book was on my granddaughters Christmas list as well.

I noticed that dry is was poor and I have a light beard! In the shower it was much better but took many passes. It would loose charge in one week and there is not a portable charger so you have to take the base with you on longer trips. It is very heavy but very well made.

Unfortunately, this shaver was not as good as my ten-year old taped up Norelco. The shaver looks good and seems well built, but it takes a much longer time to shave my one or two day old whiskers. It also leaves a sort of sting that is hard to explain. The manufacturer recommends that you use it with a light coating of shaving gel, but I don't have time for that in the morning. It was easy to clean with water, but a dry brush works just as well. I should have read the Consumer Reports study first before buying this shaver. I would have saved the cost of shipping it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Have","review":"We were given this CD when our first child was born.

Expecting a bad but mindlessly entertaining read, I was quite pleasantly surprised to find it a well-crafted, intense thriller. The story, about an oil company seeking to exploit a new oil find under Loch Ness only to be stymied by the Loch's famous inhabitant, is well written and thoughorly detailed. The characters were well developed and interesting...you actually end up despising the bad guys, and rooting for the good guys. If I were the publisher, I'd re-release this book in a minute. If you like such thriller giants as Steven King and Dean Koontz, by all means, try this book. It's well worth the read, and a real gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting horror novel dealing with old Nessie!","review":"It's been quite a while since I read this book, but from what I can remember, it's about how a bunch of guys searching for the Loch Ness Monster accidentally discover that there is oil under Loch Ness.

Read it and you'll agree."},{"rating":"1","title":"as bad as it gets","review":"Although it's been a few years since I read this book, I still remember it as one of the worst I have ever read. I remember three things in particular:1) A dramatic fight between the hero and villain which COULD have come to a nice dramatic conclusion with an attack by the monster, but which instead fizzled out anticlimactically,2) The author's invention of physical attributes on the monster which have never been described by any witness,3) A Scottish landlady who speaks with an overpowering Yiddish accent.The only moment I liked was when sonar indicated that the monster was moving across the loch to attack a two-man sub; the charcters on the shore could only call to them to escape. The idea of imminent danger with the water's surface undisturbed was an intriguing one. This single scene was not enough to save this terrible book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I thought I was buying a truffle mold, truffles are round and this mold was more oval and oblong.

He used it for a couple of weeks and tried to adjust to it. But, he looked like he got in a fight with a lawnmower and lost. It just butchered his face and he finally just tossed it in the trash and went back to disposables."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK Travel Shaver for the Money","review":"Comes with a pouch. The charger is a little block, no wires. The socket has to support the weight of the charger and shaver. Makes you think it's a travel shaver. It doesn't shave that close, no pull up and cut technology here. Not bad for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressed","review":"I bought this shaver for my husband, who had been using a disposable blade shaver since his Norelco died. He was, as he put it, spectacularly unimpressed. No matter how many times he went over the skin, he could still feel stubble, and he ended up with his skin irritated from his efforts. He used the Panasonic for a couple of weeks, then went back to the blade and was shocked at how effortlessly smooth his face was. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This book was terrible. I couldn't stand another minute of Caitlin and her beyond haughtiness. Sometimes the female lead is a bit haughty. Then you have ones like this, who actually lean forward to the lawyer could see inside her shirt, just so she could get her way. Besides her conceited attitude, and her selfish thinking, she was just plain rude! She really didn't care about anyone's feelings but her own.Wade was a good character, and I was so disgusted by Caitlin, I found myself wishing he would just leave her and go off with the sweet Luanne....That would have been a better story itself!This story might have been halfway decent, had Gregory wrote the scene where the truth comes out, a LOT earlier. Not on the third to last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"GENERIC WESTERN ROMANCE---","review":"Story and characters were rather bland and after finishing, it didn't leave me with a rosy glow...more like a disappointment in the innate evils of man (and woman.) Complete with the ordinary murderers, cattle rustlers, and ranch coveters; this story drug on way too long. It didn't help that I found the hero un endearing and the heroine downright bitchy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I have this on album, was delighted to see it is on CD. This babe rocks! Its right up there with Crimson Glory - Transcendance. This is as good as metal gets! Incredible angry vocals and commanding guitars. One of my all time favorites. Like the others say, the quality is great as well. Any metalhead would love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I had the cassette and now I own the LP, but I can't find the cd. This is \\"metal\\" at it's finest. The best song on it has to be \\"Stoned Again\\". You can't go wrong here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not THE Sword","review":"Decent strait forward Heavy Metal from the 80's. This is NOT The Sword, just Sword. The Sword = Texas, Sword(disbanded) = Quebec. They do not have any shared members. Thank you [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am a fan of \\"The Sword\\" and I hated this","review":"Being a huge fan of the band \\"The Sword\\", (makers of the delicious rock-metal awesomeness \\"Age of Winters\\" and \\"Gods of the Earth\\") I was seriously disappointed with this album. I happened upon it while searching for the sword, and after reading some reviews that reassured me I'd like it a lot, I caved and bought it.Don't make the same mistake.This album would be good for people who grew up in the late 60's or 70's. I weep to remember the sound of my heart breaking when I heard the first few minutes of the cd. I could tell right away that I had made a mistake.DO NOT BUY THIS just because the name is so similar; the music is not at all similar. I say this because there are those who would like it while disliking The Sword. Everyone's preferences are different and I mean no offense to the tastes of others. I'm just saying that I made a mistake and I don't want others like me to make the same mistake.Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"This in NOT the same band that recorded Age Of Winters, etc.!","review":"If you are looking for the third album from The Sword that recorded Age Of Winters and Gods Of The Earth and buy this you will be sadly disappointed as I was. If you're into that 80's retro hair band pop-metal sound then by all means check this version of \\"The Sword\\" out. Amazon should make a note that there are two COMPLETELY different bands here. If you are looking for the third release from the good The Sword, Warp Riders will be available on August 24, 2010. You can buy it from the real The Sword's website. The previews of it totally rock. No, I'm not affiliated with them at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Say what, you guys?","review":"Who's writing all the reviews of this album? I have a feeling at least a couple of them are written by the band. That's the only way to explain it. This album is not good. Are you kidding me? Why listen to this when there is SO MUCH music out there that blows this out of the water? Listen, for what you have to pay for this mediocre CD, you can go out there and get two Megadeth or Judas Priest or Motorhead CDs. So just do that. Pass this one by. You won't miss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over priced","review":"These are $1 a bag at the hair store. Unless the price is including shipping before checkout, if not, then wow that's a lot for the rubberbands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speedy service","review":"The product was shipped very quickly and was just as described. I ordered all these rubber bands for a project about which I knew nothing so any disappointment was not the result of the product but as a result of my lack of knowledge and pre-planning."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"I got this book. .and I was very suprised, that it is actually a very Brilliant book on the Demo scene (first volume covers C64 and Amiga - with PC and the rest in Volume 2).I could not put the book down, and it covers scenes outside of Europe (ie, America, Australia, Middle East, etc..).It is very well researched and written.I recommend this book to anyone interested in computer arts.Oh the memories. so many memories come flooding back.Cant wait till Volume 2 + 3"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rice cooker","review":"this is working really good and I am satisfied with the size and quality of the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have read the series, don't buy this","review":"I was sorely disapointed with this book. I was hoping for the majority of it to be background and detail that wasn't covered in the series. Unfortunately, other than some \\"physical data\\" on many of the star systems, a few in depth histories and one or two other tidbits, most of the information in here is directly from the trilogy, just repackaged. This book was a waste of my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderfully honest and human account of pioneer life","review":"One of the most accessable, yet honest histories I've read. Brooks was a well-respected historian in academic circles, yet with her straightforward style instantly transports the lay reader into the early Mormon frontier."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 50's Christmas","review":"Received the CD in good time and in good condition. A test play of the songs revealed no problems with the disk and the sound quality is a good as original. Very satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"I was intrigued by the gap wire layout in the same handle as the feeler gauges. Sadly, this is a cheap little item. The wires are encased in a piece of thin folded metal, and they pushed through on the first use. The metal piece itself twisted badly where it connects to the handle as well. The feeler gauges are typical, and functional as any other, but there are better sets out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I must admit that my review is pretty biased because I didn't even finish the book, but I did, painfully, get through the first 100 pages. Suze was a fun character but nothing about Lloyd appealed to me. His sequences were a bore to read about.The plot developed slowly but I figured that maybe it was just because I hadn't gotten far enough into the book. I vowed to get to page 100 and assess after I reached that hurdle. By page 100 I still wasn't intrigued.Further, out of curiosity I skipped to the last few chapters and read those to see if the book had gotten any better. Apparently, it hadn't. The ending was pretty cheesy.I'm glad that I didn't waste my time reading the other 200 pages - you shouldn't bother with the book either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must-read","review":"After reading Weekend in Paris I almost gave up on Robyn Sisman. I loved Friends but was disappointed in her writing until I read Summer in the City.The book jumps back and forth between Lloyd in London and Suze in New York. Both characters are trying to find happiness in a weird and wacky world. Suze is a much loved character who resembles Bridget Jones and Becky Bloomwood. While Suze is fumbling around the New York office Lloyd is mastering London with his straight arrow ways. The mishaps that happen during Suze and Lloyd's job swap left me laughing out loud and wanting to read more.If you can't go on a holiday this year you can visit New York and London through Lloyd and Suze's eyes...a trip that won't disappoint. Definitely a must for summer reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that interesting","review":"I thought I would really like the basic premise of this book.A New Yorker and a Londonner \\"exchange\\" jobs in each other's cities and proceed to discover the city they are in and, of course, each other.For some reason, this book did not work. The story felt stilted and disjointed and I did not enjoy any of the characters very much.Unfortunately this book was also extremely boring, never rising above a two star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT EXCECT IT'S MISSING MORE ACTION BETWEEN THEM","review":"SUZE LIVES IN PARIS AND lLoyed lives in the city. they sign up to exchange jobs and lives. they're both getting ajust to their new lives but things are geting complected with their new jobs. they ask each other for help if they need help with their jobs and life prombles. they start to get to know each other in a new way and trust each other. but they still have their prombles in their new jobs which they may lose if they don't ask each other about it and that going to lead to something......read it and find out what it is....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive and satisfying performance.","review":"This performance reveals a side of Brahms' 1st Piano Concerto that one does not normally hear. Most performances present the first movement as very stormy and bombastic, albeit beautifully so. Grimaud and Sanderling, however, take a somewhat slower tempo than most and, in doing so, reveal moments of lyrical tenderness that one is not used to hearing -- yet with no loss of grandeur. The second movement is appropriately lyrical but not excessively slow and the finale presents a stirring conclusion to a highly satisfying performance. Clearly Grimaud is a pianist whose work is worth following."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic","review":"this is an enthralling recording. Her collaboration with Sanderling is wonderous. From the majestic beginning (so long before the piano joins) to the end, my attention is rivited."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book should be read by all women.","review":"This was a gift to me by a friend and I have since given it to several other ladies that I felt would like the book. It is a great inspiration to me and I have read it several times. Each reading, I get something else out of it.. I would recommend it to anybody that needs a lift."},{"rating":"2","title":"b.b. king, you dog","review":"for anyone who has watched an older and more tired b.b. king perform the last couple years the younger generation might wonder what all the fuss was about. well this album from 1978 will give anyone a textbook lesson on b.b. king. his guitar tone is biting and nasty and this is a time when he really cared about playing the guitar. he makes his guitar sing, his makes multiple bends on one note and even shows some fast licks which is not normally a b.b. trademark.also on the album is johnny winter who does a marvelously restrained lead on the song going down slow. if you only own one b.b. king album this should be the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful lay commentary with meat for scholars","review":"Fast moving, well-written commentary that blends Dr. Youngblood's insight of the Hebrew language with archeological and cultural knowledge of the Patriarchal period. The book demonstrates that not only is the Book of Genesis true, it is also beautiful.A few highpoints: (1) Jesus in John 1:51 refers to Gen 28:12 and the Tower of Babel from Gen 11. (2) The humor of Gen 31:34. (3) Poignant description of the Cain's progression of sin. (4)The Flood truly did cover the lands known by the author of Genesis, but did not cover the entire globe.Thoroughly God-honoring, possibly some controversial sections, a great book if you seek to understand more than the \\"Sunday-School answer\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Web Editing Program","review":"I have used S J Namo Webeditor software for many years on a Microsoft PC and it is excellent. I recently switched over to a Apple iMAC OSX and can only hope that Namo will produce the same quality software to run on a iMAC without the need to run a Parallels or Boot Camp. Wide open market for Namo as there are no competitors who make a competitive Apple program."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT","review":"This is absolutely the WORST product of its kind on the market that I have ever tried. Constantly crashes, slow performance, will not save a file on your server without a huge hassle (fails to save your changes or simple deletes them during upload) and easily triggers servers like 1&1 to shut you out, thinking you are a hacker when you need to upload corrections to your file, such as when upload a file, test it on the web, see you made a typo & need to correct it. Typically you get shut out then Namo crashes, so you lose your work and have to start over again.I have wasted so many hours messing with Namo it is sickening.
