Is the political fix alive and well in New Orleans? Yes, it's published by the Louisiana State University.

In his own words, the war of 1948 is not yet over, and the danger of further ethnic cleansing (aka 'transfer')has never been greater."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsense","review":"Ariel Sharon has been responsible for evicting all the Jews from Yamit. Now he's declared that he'll evict all the Jews from the Gaza strip. And I suppose that's ethnic cleansing. But it is hardly politicide.However, that isn't the charge Kimmerling makes. In Kimmerling's story, it is the Arabs who are being destroyed. By Sharon and Israel! The fact that Arabs are increasing in numbers both in Israel and the West Bank does not seem to make any difference to the author. And even if Sharon were expelling Arabs, that would hardly count as \\"politicide\\" against the Arab people.The point of this book appears to be to confuse us readers and distract us from real human rights violations in the region."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Christian Book","review":"Although this book was a bit slow in starting, once it finally got going, I rather enjoyed it. It is the story of a young girl who is forced by her cold and distant mother to travel West with a family she does not trust. She knows she is expected to marry the son, and she is afraid to because he is such a vile person. On the other hand, she is afraid not to, because she doesn't know what would become of his infant daughter (the child's mother has just died). She makes many discoveries about herself and her history, some of which were rather obvious, though others were very surprising. Some twists were a bit too coincidental to be believable, but the book certainly doesn't end the way the reader expects. I would recommend this book to those who enjoy pioneer romances, because, although the book did not really suit my own taste, it was good for what it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"unsatisfied with provider","review":"I can't rate this product since after two tries I still did not receive it ...

Remember Reality","review":"As an ER/Trauma nurse I have seen and been involved in many, many cardiac arrests. Here is some information that you need to know 1) You must still perform adequate CPR, if not brain death occurs within 4 minutes of oxygen deprivation to the brain! 2) Even with trained personnel, CPR, a defibrillator and Advanced Cardiac Life Support (medications) the survival rate is very, very low.I am not telling you this to discourage purchasing this AED it is a wonderful unit I have been trained on it and had to use it once. I am letting you know that if you are willing to spend over $1000 on a defibrillator (especially for a private home)then a good idea would be to spend another $50 and take a basic CPR class. I hope that no one that buys this ever has to use it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally voice and computer instructed-great","review":"This device can make a huge difference. I read the instructions and there is a practice unit. It has a computer monitor that determines if electrical shock is needed reducing error.

The iphone or ipad can wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"AED's Save Lives!!","review":"I just did CPR training today and we also trained on an AED. They are incredible and VERY easy to use. If one of your family members or loved ones has a condition requiring one of these or has leanings toward potential problems, you should have one of these. You should also take the CPR training to enhance what these wonderful machines can do as well. These work wonders when TIME is of the essence! : )"},{"rating":"2","title":"How much is your LIFE worth?","review":"It's great these are finally available for the public.This is a very easy to use piece of equipment.

It lets you know tonot touch the individual.If it seems like a lot of money, without one money may become un-necessary.I like the idea of 4-6 neighbors going in on it, and keeping it in a common place.One where no one is to far from the machine. You only have a about a minute andhalf.So I guess it my come down to the old axiom:: It's your money or your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifesaving Devices","review":"Sudden heart stoppage is a common cause of death. CPR and defibrillation are techniques that can start the heart again and give the patient time to get needed help at a hospital. This unit is an external defibrillator that can start the heart with the help of another trained person who is available immediately within a few minutes to intervene and start the heart again. All persons should see their doctor to have the risk evaluated. In addition to the the external defibrillator there are also implanted defibrillators available. Only a medical professional can advise you what is best. There is a definite advantage to the implanted defibrillators in that they act automatically without the immediate intervention of another person."},{"rating":"1","title":"No water resistance better off with zoll aed","review":"It seems too good to be true. The device seems great on the surface but looking close it does not offer a significant degree of water resistance.The FR2 or Zoll AED are units that are a bit better.

I work as a Hospital Educator. I believe that it is wrong to sell this device to anyone who does not have a Rx from a physician and recieved training to the level of BLS Instructor. The greatest risk with AEDs is to the rescuer. If an individual needs one of these at home, why have they not been fitted with an implantable?This is a very dangerous device when used by the untrained."},{"rating":"2","title":"$1500 buys a lot of other lifesavers too...","review":"There is no question that AEDs work great and save lives. If you have the means, I highly suggest picking one up.Something to consider though, is that $1500 would buy you a pretty nice treadmill, a lot of months at a health club, or many boxes of nicotine patches to quit smoking. You will be better served in the long run if you invest your time in PREVENTING cardiac arrest in the first place by cutting your risk factors.. exercise and smoking are two of the biggest.For those with confirmed history of cardiac problems, this may be a good purchase. Other people may want to consider some of these other suggestions. Don't take my word though, talk to your own physician before you make an investment like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excited to see this product available to average consumers","review":"I have been a paramedic for 8 years. I have worked on countless cardiac arrest victims. The overall survival rate for victims of cardiac arrest is very low, but EVERY single person that we have successfully been able to revive has been through the use of a defibrilator. Though the comments made by a few others about proper medical care with medications hold some value, the definitive care for a patient in ventricular fibrillation (the most common initial electrical rhythm in cardiac arrest) is defibrilation. That is exactly what this product does. These type of products are essentially fool-proof. Anybody can learn to use one in less than 5 minutes. I strongly urge anyone reading this review to learn CPR and purchase this device. It may be several minutes before I can get to your home while your loved one is laying on the floor with no heartbeat. Give them the best chance of survival that you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"For All Rock Fans","review":"This is really an X-Mas treat for all Rock fans, as well as Dion followers.

Fantastic script Delon's performance in the film is one of his best even if his english is sometimes off a bit. the highlight of the film is the chase sequence between Lancaster & Delon throughout the Streets and Alleyways Of Venice. It's a captivating spy film done with the right amount of action and suspense. Most Of Today's spy films don't even come to this masterpiece. And even if they could they would still fail.

Rich foundations, working under a 501(c)(3) cloak, funded research into an \\"aesthetically acceptable\\" contraceptive to market to Catholics. This issued in the estrogen-progesterone pill, which was shilled by a Catholic physician, John Rock. At the same time, Fr. Hesburgh and other academics, hungering for the foundations' research money, set up Notre Dame and other universities as centers of dissent from traditional Christian (not just Catholic) teaching on artificial contraception.The description of the destruction of Philadelphia's inner city by block-busting, intentionally engineered by East-coast liberals, is worth the price of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, quick, more biography than philosophy","review":"Even though you should be able to read it in well under 90 minutes, it does deliver what it says.

The books obviously don't purport to be anything but what they are: an entertaining, high level view of basic concepts and life history.The author shows in this book how Machiavelli's life and times may have affected his writings. I have other books that delve into Machiavelli's philosophy, but none of them mention his personal circumstances and history, which surely would affect his writing and philosophy. These books are good in that they put these great thinkers in a social and historical context which many books fail to do.I enjoyed the books I've read by this author a great deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for quick bio, worthless otherwise","review":"It is impossible to understand Machiavelli in 90 minutes, or even 90 days, though I have no doubt that books like this sell.

This was one of the earliest classical recordings I ever purchased (my collection has since grown considerably), and it's probably the one I love the best--although I confess that I don't just love it for its beauty, but because the first two pieces of the Concerto for Violin and Orchestra--the Allegro and Lento cantabile--were used in Billy Wilder's 1971 film, \\"The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes,\\" one of my favorite movies(I would love to find an entire score of the film). Actually, reading Sherlock Holmes stories made me curious about classical music!That said, I was very impressed by Mr. McDuffie's performance, and I'm considering buying other recordings where he is the principle artist.

The violin tone is strident and forced. The technique is mostly there, but it is not effortless and singing. The recording is far too bright, and the instrumentalists are spatially located right in front of the listener's nose...far too forward. It reminds me of the old Columbia recordings with microphones down the soloist's throat. The tempo of the Violin Concerto is not as indicated and on the slow side.

Imagine my joy in discovering that a Concerto for Violin composed by Rozsa is now available! Alas, it lacks the expressive power of Rozsa's film score. It simply fails to establish and sustain a captivating melody. I think Rozsa's best music was written for the movies, and recommend The Epic Film Music of Miklos Rozsa.

There is next to nothing about what to do in the parks or about the scenery which one can expect. The only message of the tape is that parks are refuges for wild animals. At least 40 minutes out of an hour you watch wolves, bears, birds, goats, and the like. I do not mind the animals, but there is much more to the parks than the wild life! Unfortunately, those few glimpses of scenery which made it into the video are so miserably filmed that the only conclusion one can make after watching this video is that Canadian National parks have absolutely nothing interesting or remarkable to offer. I have never seen a more misleading video than this one. Stay away from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luscious Indeed!","review":"This small book packs in a large number of recipes.

You think you're at the start of a recipe only to find out that part of it was on a previous page without any separation from the preceding recipe. Second, the recipes are idiotically written. For example, I tried making \\"Mom's Chocolate Angel Pie- And Then Some,\\" which should be amended to be called \\"...And Then Some Wasted Ingredients and Time.\\" Maybe the author didn't remember the recipe from her mom correctly, but it starts by telling you to cook the meringue at 225, which is just warm enough to leave you with sticky egg white pudding. Then, and this is the real crime: It actually tells you to melt the chocolate in a pot with 1/4 cup water! Everyone who knows how to cook knows that this would make the chocolate seize up.

You do need alot of tools. I also don't recommend doing it alone and either with someone's help or get professionals to do it. It would have been a good idea for Amazon to have offered that option. It does go up and down easily ie my 9 year can do it. The catch is that it won't go too low. The adjustment bar is short one hole for that to happen. Furthermore, I can't vouch for it for adults slam dunking contests BUT for kids who just want to shoot hoops, it is a great deal. Overall, if you dont mind spending 6-7 hours alone setting it up, it is a good hoop system and looks nice too. By the way, it is made by Huffy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good starter hoop","review":"I was a little disappointed, the backboard is pretty thin and the support bars that go from the pole to the plastic base and the screw-holes in the base themselves seem like they could easily break with time.

If my son continues to play bball, I will upgrade to a much more study setup.As for the directions, they were slightly confusing.

It's honestly very laid back and you just have to wait for the end to come. The whole way through you're given some clues, but not nearly enough to figure out the whodunnit until the very end, and the ending is a surprise that I wasn't ready for.It's about Jack Gramm, a forensic psychiatrist, who also works with the FBI on high profile cases. In addition to that he also teaches at the local university.But he's on someone's hit list and he has to figure it out or he'll die in 88 minutes. He goes from place to place, person to person, trying to figure out who it is, why, anything to keep from dying in the alloted time. He can trust no one, everyone is a suspect. Along the way you figure out the meaning of the 88 minutes.It's interesting, but I don't think I could watch this over and over. Maybe in a few years or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away!","review":"There is nothing positive to say about this movie... not even Pacino can save it.But what truly depresses me is thinking of this: How can a movie so bad get made? And how does such a wonderful actor become involved?"},{"rating":"1","title":"88 minutes of my life wasted","review":"I had some friends over for a movie night and of all the movie choices we had to pick from we ended up watching this one. All four of us looked at each other at the end of the movie and agreed, what a waste of time that was. The movie had some of the worst acting we have seen although I think it can be attributed to a poor script as the movie does have a talented cast. The movie was not much of a thriller as most of it was predictable including the killer. The movie spent way too much time with Pacino talking into his cell phone. What made it really annoying was everytime he used his cell phone there was no lag time for waiting for it to ring. He would just open his phone, press one button, and then start talking. There were too many times where you were left saying, 'that is unrealistic'. Save your money and stay away from this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much to Bear","review":"A new suspect turns up every 3-minutes until they all seem to run together. A new body is found hanging from a ceiling every 10-minutes, which tends to numb and desensitize the viewer. Finally, the cell phones never stop ringing and the frenzied characters continue to run amok. Not to mention the requisite exploding car, the screaming, and the crashing of glass plate windows. None of which add up to a meaningful or enjoyable viewing experience. Rather, this turns out to be an unfortunate waste of Pacino's talent and screen presence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste 88 minutes!","review":"Brief review as it doesn't warrant many words:One of the worst films Al Pacino has ever made. Simply terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Illogical and Downright Silly","review":"\\"88 Minutes\\" is one of the worst \\"thriller\\" movies I have seen in a long time. Al Pacino rants and raves and weaves in and out of ludicrous situations and characters (mostly young women) who can't bring any believability to the plot. Everything is overdone or overwrought - including Pacino. He is constantly startled and running from one unbelievable situation to the next. The whole idea of 88 minutes to die is contrived and nonsensical. It had every cliche and trick in the book on serial killers. The ridiculous twists and turns were laughable.Whoever wrote and edited this film obviously were banking on Pacino to save it. Pacino can do a lot, but in this romp he was running from place to place while a superhuman assistant was getting anything he asked done in a matter of minutes. It was implausible! I cringed watching him trying to make a film that had nothing but bad lines become an interesting thriller.Don't waste your time watching this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film brought to you by MSNBC","review":"Al Pacino sleepwalks through the role of a go-to crime fighter named Jack Gramm who races against the clock to stop a murder - his own.The script (such that it is) is cliche-riddled with all the sloppiness of a drive-by shooting. The predictable culprit taunts our bored-looking protagonist - whom everyone in the picture can immediately identify - with a faux-Jigsaw computerized voice in a failed effort to replicate Dennis Hopper's \\"Pop quiz, hotshot!\\" from Speed: \\"Tick tock, doc!\\"The cherry on top of it all is either a well-placed stegosaurus toy during an attempt by Al Pacino to deliver a serious, lengthy monologue or this dialogue exchange:Jack: \\"Somebody hired Sara Pollard to be with me last night, then killed her. Took my semen, deposited it into Dale Morris.\\"Frank: \\"Do you have any idea how absurd that sounds?\\"Jack: \\"No, it's not absurd!\\"88 Minutes is over-the-top camp that just barely passes for fun if the audience can give in to its unintentional hilarity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tic Toc Doc","review":"This movie was predictable and beneath Al Pacino. He must have needed a pay day. As a matter of fact he must have needed a few pay days with some of the movies he has been choosing lately. This movie was just blah and nothing special at all. It took me all of about 20 minutes to figure out who the secret killer was. They tried to throw you in a bunch of different characters directions but when you come to realize there is an actor/actress in the movie that has a pretty big name and has only had a small part early they it might make you think, \\"Ok, why was he or she in this and why haven't I seen the character again very much?\\"Its a dog. Maybe worth watching once if you are bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"88 minutes of your life you will never get back. Sorry!!!","review":"I love this actor. I would go so far as to say that this is one of his best. However, in the interests of fairness, I must say that this movie is a waste of time. It is so bad that I even had to cringe when I think about how much of my life was lost watching it. I have to just say this because the script was weak, the acting was bad, and the editing was just plain awful. I mean really awful. Save yourself the agony of watching this dog by doing dishes or dusting. It is really that bad, so just avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Travesty of Travesties","review":"This might be a gut reaction after just finishing the movie three minutes ago, but: This is one of the worst movies ever made.Miserable writing, ridiculous acting, idiotic plotline, and ruinous casting. The plot is so full of holes that its constituent parts don't even attach.It doesn't get worse than this. Watch only under threat of physical violence. Stay away. Stay very far away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous.","review":"88 Minutes starring Al Pacino is complete garbage. They must have paid Pacino a lot of cash because I can't see this guy thinking, wow this is an awesome script. Leelee Sobieski is wasted in this film and even Alicia Witt looks like she's bored out of her skull. The premise is so bad and what's with all the nudity? You won't believe how lame the ending is, keep clear from this train wreck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one ...","review":"This poorly made movie is basically Al Pacino running around shouting into a cell phone. This movie has no character development, an absolutely bizarre timeline, and simply makes very little sense. In another review, someone wrote, \\"Your main character should never be a moron.\\" I couldn't agree more. Pacino's character is supposed to be a world-class forensic psychiatrist, yet he is constantly making insane decisions, has incredibly poor boundaries with his students, and show very little insight.The premise of the movie was good. It could have been a terrific thriller. Instead, it was merely a silly, overly-violent waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pacino Goes Through the Motions","review":"Made-for-TV dreck masquerading as a theatrical feature. Straitjacketed by Jon Avnet's lethargic direction, the usually formidable Al Pacino punches the time clock as a forensic psychiatrist in this so-called \\"thriller.\\" Did anyone bother to read the script before shooting the first frame? A waste of your hard-earned 108 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best minute was the 89th","review":"Yek! Pacino slipped this one in without anyone picking up on it. Good for him because this flick is a cliched bag o'you-know-what,like watching a melodrama from the '50s complete with strings for tense scenes and camera switching among actors as the whodunnit? questions unfolds. Was it the embittered student? the sensitive lesbian? the jailed, evil crook?Dun, dun, duuuuuun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aging Al Pacino runs for 88 minutes with his hair flapping","review":"Another one of those thrillers that tries to make up for the bad script by employing the high caliber actors like Al Pacino an LeeLee Sobieski. Pacino plays university pofessor/forensic psychologist who profiles high visibility court cases and sociopathic criminals so that jury can reach their verdicts about the accused. Until one day, he receives a phone call letting him know that he has 88 minutes left to live. The usual happens - everyone is a suspect - his graduate students, collegues at the university and law enforcement, security guards and people he employs at his private office. For the next 60 minutes we see him running all over Seattle in attempt to unrevel the mystery of his would be assassin. In is almost painful to watch Pacino run, up and down street, run up and down stairs with his puffed up hair flapping all over the place. It is too bad that all of these actors had to be assembled for such a sad, sad and unbelieveble movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pacino Movie","review":"One of the best things of this movie is you have no idea where it is going. It was a great suspense thriller that kept me trying to figure things out through the entire movie. I had my suspicions of \\"whodunnit\\" through the film and was proven wrong on a couple of occasions. Pacino's acting is incredible as usual and would highly recomment this film to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"C R A P P O L A !","review":"It's no wonder that this stale predictable \\"thriller\\" was shelved for a few years. Pacino(with the worst hairdo I've seen in years)has become a self parody and doesn't get any help from a sleepwalking cast in this extremely tedious film. I felt as if Al Pacino was shouting at everyone to wake them up! I guess it's not the worst film I've ever seen, but there are just too many better films of this nature to waste any time on this one.......oh yeah and you can see the ending coming a mile away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste for Pacino","review":"This was a stupid movie. Al Pacino's talents are way above this script and plot. Had Keanu Reaves or Tom Cruise been in it, I'd probably have had enough sense to stop watching it after the first ten minutes, as they are as one dimensional and as trite as this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only it would have lasted just 88 minutes.","review":"That was 88+ minutes that I will never get back. Very disappointing from Al Pacino. Will he accept just any role now? The idea and premis were good but the execution was horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, it is that bad","review":"You've heard it's bad. The movie critics said it, people who saw it said it, Amazon reviewers said it. But it's Al Pacino and Jon Avnet, so you wonder, how bad can it be? You buy it or rent it, and sit through one of the most tedious and pathetic movies ever made. The plot is ridiculous; the writing, atrocious, and not even the most talented actor and director on the planet could save this ridiculous film. The only interesting question regarding this movie is, how did it get made? Why did Avnet and Pacino agree to work with one of the worst screenplay ever written? I'd really like to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, I can't believe that some people actually liked this movie...","review":"This movie was just bad. It doesn't even deserve the one star I was forced to give it. The only good think in it was Pacino, and even he was sub-par.The story was simply a rehash of every other \\"out of time\\" movie. Nothing new happened, there were too many characters. So many that there was no way for each of them to contribute to the film in a meaningful way.The acting was bad and the script poorly written. Some lines were just so unbelievable that I wanted to turn the movie off.The biggest problem is that the characters were so badly written that you are never able to connect with any of them. You simply don't care when any of them dies, or gets hurt, or anything.The best part of this movie was the credits... That's about it.Looks to me like it's time Pacino either retired, or raised his standards a whole lot.Don't waste your time or money on this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"Al Pacino is an old geezer and he is attracting all these young women-No Way. When will Hollywood learn that women watch movies too and quit putting wrinkled old geezer actors with young women actors?? On that count alone this movie is an incredible stinker. Add the ridiculous plot and implausable situations and well don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"I was shopping at Target when I spotted the new movie with Al Pacino.Got it.Watched it. Did not like it. Checked customer reviews at Amazon and was surprised that some people gave it five stars. From the start, One can see the story was badly put together and the direction did not help. I do not recommend you buy this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gratuitous violence and plot holes galore","review":"This piece of trash revolves around the MO of the murderer: extremely bloody, sordid, without pity, voyeuristic to some. For most viewers, it's a method of execution that they will not quickly forget; somewhat resembling a slaughterhouse gone wrong, when the animal is not mercifully killed ahead of time. (I keep thinking that some sickos in our society get their ideas from garbage like this.) As for the rest of the movie, as other reviewers have pointed out, there are plot holes galore. The murderer would have to be invisible not to be seen when writing down the decreasing numbers of minutes. You completely have to suspend belief. It's a movie that you'll hate yourself for watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable thriller","review":"In this movie, Al Pacino is a forensic psychologist who has a way with women. He served as an expert witness on a murder case and he was largely responsible for putting the accused man into prison. On the day that the man is due to be executed, a copycat murder takes place which suggests that the man has been falsely imprisoned. At the same time, Pacino receives a phone call telling him that he has only 88 minutes to live. For the rest of the movie, Pacino races against time as numerous red herrings are thrown at the audience.After glancing at some of the other reviews, it is evident that many people disagree with me that this is an entertaining thriller. My husband and I enjoyed it and felt that we were definitely entertained for 88 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Al, please, never do this again","review":"One word: Pathetic. Gluing dust bunnies to Al's head, shooting him full of botox, and taping his eyelids up occasionally to make it look ... vaguely... like he was awake for this movie doesn't even come close to being worth a buck, never mind what I wasted watching this moronic excuse for a movie. OK, I'll go 50 cents for the close ups of Al panning away as he started shuffling away like a lunatic geriatric escaping from an old folk's home, then cutting to some younger ... ha, ha. ... stunt double that could actually put one foot in front of another, even with dust bunnies glued to their head. Otherwise... stupid plot, horrible acting, and an embarrassment for an actor I had some respect for before this movie.

Definitely one of my favorites! A must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable","review":"This was a good movie. It was kind of predictable as to whom the killer was going to be, but I still found the movie enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy Film Making","review":"Not a total disaster, but there is so much wrong with this movie that it's hard to know where to even begin. (Afraid there may be some spoilers here.) The script completely lacks any credibility at all - the events that occur between the time Pacino receives the life-threatening phone call and the \\"resolution\\" could not have possibly taken place in just 88 minutes. Come on - it takes a lot more than 10 minutes to go cross town in any city, no matter how small, let alone in Seattle. Too many people know things they have no business knowing (how did Pacino's student know that Sarah was dead when the body was just discovered?) Where was the continuity person - in one scene it's raining pretty hard and a couple of blocks later the sun is shining. For a man who supposedly has only 88 minutes to live, Pacino seems awfully complaisant, and calm enough to explain key plot elements that the script writer couldn't figure out how to otherwise introduce. It's just sloppy film-making."},{"rating":"1","title":"As bad as Pacino's hairstyle","review":"I agree with everyone who's said this movie was bad, stunk, predictable, etc. Pacino running around with a Phil Spector-like \\"hairdo\\" was laughable. Alicia Witt, playing one of his students spouted out her lines as if she were reading at an audition. She gave a particularly atrocious acting job in this stinker, that I was really hoping she'd be the next victim to die. The little parts where Pacino is freaking-out, staring at his students, wondering if any one of them was involved in framing him was something out of a You Tube parody. Racing around town in a cab, with the cab driver calmly sitting in the back seat making his hundreds of bucks so that.............oh fergit it.

The picture quality isn't great, but it's on a par with many of the series from the same time period. Perhaps these episodes were reproduced from VHS copies. I rate the series four stars, but the product here I give only one star. If you want an uncut series, this doesn't seem to be for you.

Okay, the song \\"Reproduction\\" was fun, but the rest were pretty terrible...the songs aren't even half as good as \\"Summer Nights\\" or \\"Greased Lightnin'\\" from the original Grease.Overall, Grease 2 was really terrible.

We went to the theater over and over again, knew all the songs by heart and performed them for anyone we could get to stop for long enough. I swear, Cool Rider was my dating theme song all through my adolescence (much to my detriment sometimes, I think LOL). I bought this on DVD pretty much the moment it was released, and my best friend from that time and I both squealed on the phone to each other for about an hour... before we started singing. It may not be a \\"great film\\" in the academic or critical sense, but it's one of the great films of my heart. I only wish it were popular enough to get a \\"deluxe\\" edition with some cut scenes or commentary. I'd snap that one up in a moment as well.

I watched this movie because I was curious about the sequel to, \\"Grease.\\" Now I wish I hadn't wasted my time. I could see that this was pretty much a no-budget film, and that's why the sets looked so fake. The sound was awful. I noticed that even the songs were muffled, because the sound was so poor.

The English guy does the job of being cool, but only average. Nonetheless I gave it 2 stars for those 2 people in it. :)I am the kinda reviewer that's not very critical. I try to get as much out of films, albums and the like as possible.I thought they already explored all the feelings, emotions, romance from Rydell High in the first one!The original cast members in this \\"sequel\\" (Not really a sequel -- Just a spinoff) made the movie merge from the original and the first!

By the time the bowling ally song came up, I had to pause the movie and go take a bath because I felt so dirty. I actually had to wash my eyes and ears with soap.

Michelle Pfeiffer is a weak lead, but she had to follow Newton-John, so she was OK. Maxwell Caulfield didn't really work for me and his accent really got irritating. Was it meant to be British? The T-Birds have really gone off the rails. They tried to kill Michael (Caulfield).

I got this DVD the day before yesterday from Walmart for $5.99 and I thought John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John were going to be in this one and I thought the plot was that it showed what Danny and Sandy did after they graduated High School in the first movie but instead this movie is about another class and it takes place in 1961. The songs don't even sound like '60s, they sound like '80s and Michelle Pfeiffer wears more modern clothes. And The T-Birds are more stupid than the original ones by being more insulting. The only song I liked was that song the class sang with the Science teacher \\"Reproduction\\". The first movie is way better than this. No wonder they didn't make Grease 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Musical!","review":"I was just a baby when this movie came out. I saw it when I was around two and till this day I've seen it 1000 times. I don't care what anyone says! Grease 2 is a good movie! I am not afraid to say it. I think it was ten times better than the first Grease. In Grease 2 there was more fun and laughs and better songs. The first Grease was quite boring and doesn't live up to the so-called classic title it receives. Of course Grease 2 isn't the best movie ever made but it's a darn good sequel! In over twenty years it is still one of my most enjoyable films. Adrien Zmed was such a babe back then. SIGH! I'm getting the DVD for Christmas. You should too! Grease 2 is fun for the entire family.

Her little boy toy kinda resembles James Dean, his voice his pretty darn good but geez what a horrific storyline! Why did they make a Grease 2 anyway?

Just goes to show you -- you gotta start with a good story and especially a good score if you are going to make a good musical. This movie, which features some of the most awful musical numbers ever put on film, alongside wooden, annoying performances by Lorna Luft, Maxwell Caulfield (who has a pronounced lisp), and even Michele Pfieffer, who seems out of control and trying waaaaay too hard to be tough, deserved the chilly reception it got when it was first released, and is one of the many movies that leaves you wondering: HOW DID THEY LET $10 MILLION DOLLARS GO DOWN THE DRAIN FOR THIS?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is dope!","review":"I love this movie!

I actually liked the first \\"Grease\\" movie - despite it's obvious \\"corniness.\\" The music was good, the acting was decent, and it was entertaining. \\"Grease 2\\" was possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. Aside from the obvious conflicts between musical styles (this is supposed to be set when ???), the acting is awful, the entire visual presentation is obsurd and inconsistent, and overall the movie is torture to watch. As far as I can tell, the only people who really like this movie are 30-something GenX females who loved to sing-a-long with the original \\"Grease\\" soundtrack at their middle school sleepovers. Even Michelle Pfeiffer is embarassed by it. I think most high school musicals are more entertaining to watch - at least there the actors are not getting paid.I must maintain my anonymity, as my wife LOVES this movie.Sincerely,Not Danny Zucko"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I wanted but a good movie","review":"When I first heard that they where makeing a Grease 2 I thought it was going to pick up right where Grease left off. But instead it went back to Rydel High with a complet new cast exsept for Frenchie and if you look closely in certan scens you see the former T-Bird (but not as a T-Bird in fact he is barly seen and doesnt talk at all) also Ugine from Grease returns to, Exsept this time it is more of a better plot more instead of Grase witch basicly is more of singing and the plot just kinda drifts with it. But Grease 2 has more of story plots instead of just singing.The Credicts hated it but I still liked it personaly, BUt I cant see why it wasent even a idea to make a Grease 3!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"Athough GREASE is an incredible movie and a real classic, GREASE 2 is not as bad as people claim. I actually really like this movie and think that one reason it is so good is because it is not a carbon copy of the original. I think it has a funnier twist and really holds it's own once it is given a chance. The songs are good enough and the opening dance number is a great one. It is definitely worth watching more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"A guilty pleasure, innocent fun","review":"Although Grease 2 has none of the fame or critical acclaim of the original, it is still a catchy, if somewhat cheesy musical. The best songs are those involving the entire cast. The rousing \\"Back to School\\", \\"Score Tonight\\", and the finale, \\"We'll Be Together\\" are all great songs. Michelle Pfeiffer, in the main female role has a surprisingly strong voice.The story line is as follows: Tough biker chick Michelle Pfeiffer falls in love with a mysterious biker who fascinates the whole school. The biker actually turns out to be the school nerd whom everyone ignores, played by Maxwell Caulfield.Don't compare this film to the original Grease. There's no reason to! Just sit back and enjoy the guilty pleasure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"Yeah, Okay. It has been said the second coming is not as great as the first. Disagree. Grease 2 Hit a number 1 in my book. It has the characters we have all dreamed of being at one time or another, especially Michael, he wants the girl that doesn't want him, until finally he goes over the top to win her heart and succeeds. The movie doesn't really start out this way until about halfway through and then you figure it out. The hero reveals himself in a way that kind of makes you say \\"what, that's it?\\" But you soon realize there was no better way to do it than to just do it. The performances were great, the music was upbeat and followed the story quite well. It takes you into an alternate reality that you somehow wish you could be a part of, but only to an extent.

You get a little bit of everything in this movie.Not much like the first, some of the same characters, but still that same feeling of high school back when! And it has Michelle Pfeiffer in it in one of her earliest roles! She does a tremendous job!A great movie for so many occaisions! Watch it! I bet you'll love it just as much as I do.

EVER! Michelle P. is surprisingly good given the overall stupidity of the script and music. But she alone cannot save this movie. The few redeeming qualities of this film are that it IS hysterical in a campy, \\"what were they thinking\\" kind of way. Also, a humorous blast from the past if you are over 25. I was about 12 when this came out in theaters. I was so excited given that I was a Sandy and Danny groupie back in elementary school. I even bought the soundtrack immediately after watching the movie. Looking at it years later I have to ask, \\"What was I thinking??\\" No comparison to the original Grease, a true classic.

He did such a great job playing the role of Michael (Mr. Shakespeare writing-Cool Rider-Carrington). Even though, this was a poor sequel - I still like it because of the set and the continuing themes that are evident. My favorite scenes/songs are the \\"Cool Rider\\" and \\"Who's that Guy?\\" scenes/songs. You should try watching it - you may be pleasantly surprised.

Every other movie was Grease 2 and each time it got better and better. As everyone has said this is not a good movie. It's terrible (everyone seems to have forgotten the Calendar Girls!), but it's addictive -- like Diet Coke. The opening back-to-school scene and Michelle Pfiefer singing \\"Cool Rider\\" (climbing a ladder in leather pants!) and incredible, but my favorite scene has got to be \\"Reproduction\\" -- the most shameless (and funny) musical scene ever recorded. This is definitely a movie that has to be scene more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This movie gets played so much that we rarely get the chance to get the songs out of our heads.

In the sequel, a new crop of seniors attends Rydell High in early 1961 and Michael Carrington(Maxwell Caufield, Dynasty)is the new kid on campus. As fate would have it, he is smitten by the tough leader of the Pink Ladies Stephanie Zimone(Michelle Pfieffer, Hairspray). But in order to win her heart, Michael has to take on the leader of the T-Birds(Adrian Zmed, T.J. Hooker)and prove to the entire school that he is the coolest dude around. Some of the original cast are featured in Grease 2, like Didi Conn(Benson, Shining Time Station)reprising her role as frenchy. The music was fun and upbeat and comedy was kind of alright but it did little to diminish the quality of the movie. Grease 2 does not have any special features like a behind-the-scenes look of the film or deleted scenes, but it is still a good movie to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grease 2","review":"I love this movie.

After watching about 20 to 30 minutes, through a very short and unbiblical scene of the battle between David and Goliath, we were shocked to see frontal female nudity. No, I am not overreacting! This was not a passing glance or a flash by on camera. The scene was focused on this image and was in danger of lasting longer than the afore mentioned famous battle, before we gained our composure and turned it off. Don't let the PG-13 rating decieve you. I did. Nowhere on the tape, dust cover, or this web site is nudity in this film mentioned. This tape is definitly going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucked!","review":"This movie sucked! Everything about it was terrible.

Richard Gere was horribly miscast. His New York accent in ancient Israel is giggle inducing. The sets look fine and the other actors do a decent job, but the actress playing Bathsheba was a let down--David destroyed himself and ruined his kingdom for this woman--- but the character is played in such a low key manner the veiwer never is made to see why. Another unintentionally funny scene is when Gere strips down to a loin cloth and does a disco routine before the Ark of the Covenant. All in all, this was not a high point in Richard Gere's up and down career."},{"rating":"1","title":"king david","review":"Really upset, paid to watch, movie wouldn't work. What a scam!

I find the story of David fascinating. David loved God, fought valiantly to win back Israel's land, and wrote hundreds of Psalms. David's unshakable faith, trust, and love for God are what come to mind. Yet David committed adultery then murder to cover it up. And God still blessed David mightily.Somehow this was lost in the movie.

Without seeing it first, I gathered a bunch of women together to view it. We were all so disappointed. Content, acting, background, gratuitous scenes, and lack of cohesion to the original script--the Bible--gives it a bad taste in my mouth. I wish I could recommend this with such enthusiasm as it was recommended to me, but I cannot. If purchased anyway, please do so with caution if you plan on watching it with children present.

If you are therefore interested in reading three-to-four-hundred pages about death, rape, cancer, murder, abortion, hate, bigotry, mental illness, and similarly distressing topics, this is a book for you. This was a class textbook, so I was obliged (?) to read it, but by page five hundred, the selected depressing passages far overshadowed any value I might have otherwise gained about creative writing. It is implausible to me that she could not find equally good examples of a more pleasing nature. I cannot recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Functional","review":"This book has great insight into what it takes to be a creative author. My only complaint is the content of some of the sample stories. I realize they are very well written and serve the intended purpose.

Unless I turn off both of my computers in my studio, I can't hear it. And these are not loud computers. With everything turned on in my studio the SPL doesnt register anything above 50 dBs where I sit.

I suggest reading Irving Sandler's 'American art of the 1960s' for something as informative and enjoyable but with some opinions and insight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful to my understanding of Yoga","review":"Beth Shaw's Yogafit shows how to use Yoga to improve your balance and health with easy to understand writing.

Beth Shaw makes yoga accessible to the reader- no religion, no sanscrit, no fluff - just the basics to get a good program going. If only more yoga books were so friendly and easy to follow. A great gift for the novice - no pretzel poses or weird moves . Yes YogaFit !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I thought the book was fabulous. I am a beginner and the book combined with the video was perfect for me. I didn't find it hard to follow at all. I have bought other videos and books since then and I have completely wasted my money because nothing compares to the YogaFit gear I have. It's user friendly, detailed enough to not confuse me too much and doesn't invlove any of the traitional yoga words or chanting. I like that's it's in a fitness format and so I give it a thumbs up! I was looking for something fun and non-traditional and I certainly found it! I definitely recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved the book","review":"Wow, I have to say that I thought this was a book review and not an \\"I hate YogaFit\\" message board. I find it very sad that someone feels the need to attack someone on amazon.com. I am glad I didn't believe the bad reviews and got the book anyway. I found that not only is the book great at giving a very user-friendly detailed description of common yoga poses but it was so great that I decided to take a YogaFit teacher training. I am trained through Level 3 and let me just say...Beth Shaw is NOT anorexic. I met her after a Master Class at a Spinning Conference. If I had to take a guess I would say she weighs about 150lbs and she is pure muscle. Obviously someone out there is anorexic and likes to believe everyone who is in shape is anorexic too. It a serious disease and it's very immature for someone to make that type of posting on this website.

I also think the variety of coasters presented is quite varied featuring well known, and not so well known, rides from all around the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gun","review":"This is an amazing gun it is very powerful. On semi auto it is dead accurate. On full auto it gives a new meaning to spray and pray. I reccomend buying the extended magazine clip without it on full auto the gun uses a clip in about a second. This gun has a great kick and sound especially on full auto. I have used and owned many gas guns and this is by far the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best GBB on the market","review":"This pistol is quite possibly the best on the market. It's accurate & powerful. The full-auto just blows everything away. I have a Classic Army M4 RIS with a high-torque motor, and this thing still shoots about 4.5 rps faster.Needless to say, it's a super-smooth firing gun, it gives kick, but with reasonable recoil. Ultra-fast trigger response. Most KWA/KSC glock mags work for it, in exception to the G26C Mini-mags. If you do buy this gun, I recommend that you invest in a mad bull propane adaptor. It fits onto the little coleman propane tanks and is a lot cheaper than buying green gas. 1/8th the price to be exact.The only difference between Propane and Green Gas, is that green gas has a bit of silicone oil in it. So if you do go with the propane option, which I highly recommend, just dab a bit of silicone oil on the O-ring at the bottom of the mag, every other clip or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Selector Switch Insanity!","review":"I bought this gun with high expectations. After the first 2 magazines, the pin holding the selector switch flew out of the back of the slide, causing the rear slide and its 1mm metal ball bearing to fall out. After finding all of the parts, put it all back toghether, but the gun pulled the same trick. I found out that I needed to tighten a screw under the rear sight, but the sight is stuck TOTALLY fast, it won't budge!

CHOKEHOLD dispels conventional publishing wisdom that all wrestling books are written for juvenile, mouth-breathing fans.

If you are entering into programming field..start with this book. You will never forget \\"How to Solve it by computers\\" in your entire life. This book has no shelf life.

He proposes a 'new' set of grading standards that the general collecting community didn't pick up. His 'Accugrade' system had subgrades for various aspects of Silver dollar appearance. The main grading services such as PCGS and NGC chose different grading standards which were generally tougher than Mr Hager's. So an 'Accugrade MS 65 Prooflike' dollar usually sells for much less than a 'PCGS MS65'. Often an 'Accugrade Prooflike' won't be qualified as a PCGS Prooflike in most of the comparisons that I have seen. In any event the book is still useful as a reference on Prooflike and Proof dollars even if you ignore the grading aspects of this book. Just don't pay $100 like I did when this book came out, $20 for a new one is more reasonable considering its content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Seasonal DVD","review":"If I didn't already have a special place in my hear for Little Bear, this DVD would put him there.

My husband plays a large role in our son's life so it was nice to see an increased role on Father Bear's part.

The movie lasts over an hour so you dont have to keep changing the movie as some childrens dvd movies are only 30-45 minutes long. My children have LOVED little bear for all of the years I have taught. The life lessons he teaches are ones every parent is proud for their children to learn.

Therefore I did not have high expectations for reading this book. I was very pleasantly surprised. This is a great book, and the scientific references are not bad either (most natural remedy-based books have either no references or unreputable references). I especially liked her section on the role of histamine in mental disorders. Histamine plays a much larger role in mental illness than the conventional doctors currently think. For example, only 20-25% of Americans have allergies, yet 85% of depressed patients have allergies---a four-fold difference, and very statistically significant. Histamine may also contribute to anxiety and ADD.

This is not the level of work we have become accustomed from Mr. Coonts and hopefully it won't continue. Maybe he is teaching Mr. DeFelice the art of writing High Tech, if so it needs to be kept in the classroom not on bookshelves.The characters are flat, the dialogue is predictable and the pace is like watching paint dry.

The lamp adds a nice glow to the living room and the low and high setting is a nice touch.

In a time where so many people consider \\"pop\\" to be a dirty word (thanks to the neverending stream of boy bands and pop \\"divas\\"), this album saves the day with its catchy riffs, unaffected humour and freespirited pure pop goodness.An album that will appeal to any age, but with references that will certainly resonate more soundly with listeners who experienced the 70s and/or the 80s in all their glory. For those of us who danced to Haysi Fantayzee ('Vivian'), got \\"Pac-Man fever\\", adored the A-Team and CHiPS ('For You') and lived through the big-haired heavy metal heyday of the 80s (\`Pantera Fans in Love'), this album is the perfect trip down memory lane."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"This album was a disappointment for me. Their self-titled debut is one of my favorite albums, but their follow up doesn't add any new ideas. Courtney replaces Van Halen, Pervert replaces Sorry, and the album is much more produced sounding without any edge, which is rather surprising as they moved from major label Arista to indie Honest Don's. Either way, though, the songs are not as clever, this album is just trying to juice ideas and some success for all they can get.

Jon explores different styles in that cd, a little pop, a few good music, but it is not essential. The cd of Asia, live, unhappily don't maintain the power of the studio versions, and leaves a lot to want. The last and weaker of everybody, of Marillion, is a total frustration.

I was just out of high school and utterly non-political. Yet I can remember thinking what a bitter harridan she had to be.I can only recall one line from her book. She commented that LBJ made a call on his car phone (which was a really big deal in those days!) \\"apparently without spilling his beer or slowing to the legal limit\\". I am quoting from memory, but that should be pretty close. I stopped reading at about that point.Phylis Schafly is sort of an Ann Coulter without the wit, humor, accuracy, intelligence, and engaging personality.

Well, I finished the book in three days...but had I had more time...would've loved to sit down and read it in one sitting. This is the first book I have read from Francine Rivers, and I am hooked.

It was totally predictable and unrealistic. It's a sensitive, emotional topic and deserved a more real-world telling. I do think Rivers did a good job of presenting the issue, but I often had to force myself to keep reading. Rivers did continue her tradition of excellent character development, but again, I wanted a surprise, or maybe just a hint of suspense, to keep me reading. A surprisingly unsatisfying book for Rivers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful controversial reading","review":"Any story about rape and abortion is bound to be controversial in these times, but Rivers has done a remarkable job of making nearly every character sympathetic and human. In fact, the two most unsympathetic characters are \\"good\\" Christians in this book, showing that Rivers has little bias. The writing is impeccable and the characters strong and three-dimensional. I felt that Dynah lost a little of her depth after she finally makes her decision, but I think that's due to the focus on other characters. Ultimately, this is a story about hope and how the Lord can take horrible things and make them into good and bring healing to so many. Rivers has a great ear for writing our inner dialogue with God. When we yell at him, accuse him, and beg him for mercy, she's got it all down."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Atonement Child Review By Monika Sharp","review":"The book The Atonement Child was a very good book.

We never see the rapist prosecuted, or even see the police TRY to find him. We never see Joe even angered at the fact that this woman he has supposedly been in love with since day one, has been brutalized.Bad things happen even to saints. Ms. Rivers needs to get a little more reality based. This was a huge letdown after reading Redeeming Love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic!","review":"I have discovered Francine Rivers by reading Mark of the Lion series which was a masterpiece for me. By picking up \\"The Atonement Child\\", I was expecting the book to be great. But the book was far away from the real life. The heroine who was raped and became pregnant from that rape was somehow distant from the whole situation like that did not involve her but someone else. I did not feel the heroine suffering at all. I did not feel any emotions in that book. I was expecting more to the story. The writer before writing about the subject should have consulted people who found themselves in similar situations if she was not able to picture herself in similar situation just for the book. The book was predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real page-turner!","review":"Believable people wrestle with today's issues and emotions precipitated by a child conceived in rape.

Dynah the heroine of the story was praying every second and it really seemed fake and boring. The whole story was not the way young college student's act or talk, even at Christian Colleges.

Because of the author's bias she never really deals with both sides of the issue in a realistic way. Within the first few chapters it becomes predictable and clearly judgemental. This book could actually be hurtful to a woman who had experienced such a situation.The characters are one-dimensional and quickly portrayed as perfect or evil depending on their stance on abortion.This is a soap-box book and nothing more. It is certainly lacking the quality of her other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy reading.....maybe it was just me........","review":"This was my first Francine Rivers book, and believe me, I thought I would NEVER get to anything happy and bearable...I found myself angry at all the \\"good\\" people who turned against the victim.....maybe I was looking for relaxation and got too much contemplation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful","review":"I finished this book only because it was a selection of my book club. Frankly I did not care what happened to any of these people (as if I couldn't figure it out for myself by a quarter of the way through it).

The story primarily focuses on a young Christian women in college, who got raped when she was walking home from work.

The characters were portrayed very well and this impacted me deeply. I felt like I got to know Dinah through all of her pain and I found myself thinking about her for ages after I finished reading the book. I'm so glad that a very controversial subject was handled so openly and I found myself having to really search myself on the issue of abortion. Half way through the book I sat and cried. I learned through this book that no matter what life throws at us, God's Word stands. As a Christian I know that abortion is not God's will, yet I was unsure as to why. Dinah's baby was not some monsters kid, she was a child of God and precious in his sight. I was very moved by the book and would recommend it. Be prepared to be challenged!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Reading","review":"I read this book a few years ago, and still remember it quite well. The beginning was hard to wade through (Dynah's life sounds so perfect, wonderful, and sheltered, that even if you hadn't read the back, you know that disaster will soon strike her life!), but after that it got better. I especially appreciated the way the hypocrisy of her college was pinpointed; being commited to purity is good, but I've seen far too many Christian organizations follow the letter of this law to such an extreme that they forget the point. I also loved watching the way Dynah struggled with her situation, and the different phases she went through. Her commitment to making her own decision rather than giving in against her will to what others wanted for her showed remarkable courage, especially considering the sheltered, nearly conflict-free life she had led before her rape. She is definitely an admirable heroine."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great read","review":"This book is on that touches hearts and changes minds.

It is an engaging read and deals thoroughly with the subject of abortion, treating it biblically and compassionately. The only way that the killing of unborn children will cease in our nation is for individuals to become convinced of the horrors of abortion. The best way to convince individuals is through popular media and entertainment such as literature and film. Harriet Beecher Stowe proved this in relation to slavery with Uncle Tom's Cabin. Francine Rivers contributes in the same way with The Atonement Child, in which she does a wonderful job of balancing bold truth with hope and healing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Francine Rivers at her best!","review":"Francine Rivers proves to me again why she is my favorite author!

It seemed that all of the characters except for Joe, were christians who didn't really know God's character and what the Bible says. This disappointed me.

The characters are pasteboard, and the idea of generational retribution as an explanation for otherwise random evil is shallow and predicated on a superficial reading of the Old Testament. (And the symbolic character names...please.) Also, because abortion is the \\"issue,\\" rape and its aftermath are glossed over, with the rapist exonerated of his wrongdoing. I was looking forward to a book that tackled these issues with honesty and depth. But The Atonement Child actively offended me.

After watching \\"The Devil in Daniel Johnston\\" I was compelled to pick up some of his music. His work is extremely raw and revealing. There is a level of intimacy seldom conveyed in recorded music. It is not something that you would or could listen to constantly but it is powerful while you do. My emotional response when listening has ranged from outright joy to subtle embarrassment. Again, you will inevitably be taken aback by the vulnerability in the music, especially on tracks like \\"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Your Grievances\\" where an upbeat Daniel encourages \\"everyone\\" to join in although he is most likely alone in his sister's garage pounding out the tune on a toy organ.

Very happy with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"PMK190 Review","review":"I have been running this pump for about a month straight now and have done cleanings on the filters once a week. It trips my breaker everytime I plug/unplug it. The filter is removing algae from my pond (190 gallon), but my pond is far from being clear. I have also been using algicide... It may be time to spend the $$$ for a UV filter. The filter maybe good for a smaller pond, but so far its performance is unsatisfactory at best in mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"The pump is exactly what I needed for my small pond. Works great and the fountain has great eye appeal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing quality and performance","review":"I purchased the first PMK190 Pump and it did not pump properly. The magnetic pump made a lot of noise: apparently the only moving part was faulty. As a result it did not produce a fountain out of the fountain head but just a slow stream of water. I returned the item and the second one was not a lot better. Although it pumped more water and was slightly less noisy it still did not produce a decent bell shaped form. The fountain head is non adjustable so I assume also this pump does not deliver the capacity to create the fountain as displayed on the packaging. The filters are very cheap and the rest of the construction also feels cheap. I will return the second one as well and get a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"This is a toy at best. The pump is wholly inadequate. It is able to produce an arched umbrella of water at the top of the 20\\" or so fountain top to about 2\\" in diameter. 24 hours later it is not pumping at all. After a thorough cleaning it still does not pump water all the way to the top of the fountain stick. I was expecting a larger unit it was surprisingly tiny. I will be returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 problems right away","review":"I bought this product yesterday from a store, just wanted to warn others. Maybe mine was a manufacturing fluke, but there are 2 problems right off the bat. The lid to the casing that holds the filters doesn't latch shut, so I can't hold it from the handle, the whole thing opens up. Second, it's a good thing the bonus fountain head is \\"free\\" because mine did not make a nice dome shape, it sprayed directly out, reaching 5 feet in all directions. So, I secured the casing shut with zip ties and took off the fountain head, so it just bubbles out, but that works for now. it's been running for a couple of hours and going strong, just disappointed I had to alter 2 parts because of bad design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Sad","review":"I was happy to order this product. It got here quick. Saddly after 5 minutes the pump blew. I called pondmaster who refused to honor the warrenty due to the amount of rebuilt equipment comming from sellers on Amazon and Ebay. The seller has said they will return the money and refused to exchange for another product. I paid $10 for return shipping (wich will not be refunded to me) and still no word from the seller.

I believe the author believes his own theories a little too much. He also comes across as very angry which dimenishes the enjoyment of readimg this book, but over all it does has some interesting views. The Bible has a lot of codes ands is open to interpretation.

However, the humor makes it worth the price. But back to criticism...One of the frequent quotes cited from Harwood is on the physical appearance of a historical Jesus. He paraphrases an impossible to verify 'work' of Josephus. But even the Testimonium Flavianum, which is another Josephus passage of far more credibility has proven itself an unlikely source of extra-biblical Christian evidence, and probably a pious interpolation. Yet in Harwood's mind this and far less compelling conjecture is good as gold. I'd recommend the interested reader find a decent translation of the meagre texts drawn upon by scholars and would-be scholars and make their own judgement. Still, unless some great archaeological discovery is made in the future, there's very little to be added to Abrahamic scholarship that isn't composed as simple polemic."},{"rating":"1","title":"great research, awful editing, needs work","review":"Malone's research is excellent. While other books focus only on the \\"notable\\" women of the Middle Ages, Malone provides insight into how ordinary medieval women might have experienced life in the 11th to 17th centuries. She includes lesser-known figures like Guglielma of Milan in addition to the well-known ones like Hildegard of Bingen, Catherine of Siena, and more. Malone also doesn't hesitate to point out gender biases in current scholarship regarding church history.However, the book is full of typos.

Historical fiction books bore me, and they never seem to contain the excitement found in contemporary fiction. Sarah, Plain and Tall, while more character-centric than most historical fiction books, still just didn't catch my interest. I was just glad that unlike many historical fiction books, this one actually didn't shove random historical facts down the readers' throats in massive clumps--the historical details were there, but very subtle. Still, the plot was too plain, with not enough branches and wacky plot twists. Everything was hopelessly predictable, and I know children's authors can do much better than that. That being said, I'd still like to read the sequels (never can pass up a good sequel!) to learn more about the characters, especially since the books are such quick reads."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"plain\\" describes this book very well.","review":"this book is so plain! that's where they got the name. it really is. don't put any little kids through the torture of reading this horrible book. it scarred me for life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"I did not like this book.

Now having recently reread the book, I'm surprised that more books like it are not being written.SARAH, PLAIN AND TALL is short and very, very sweet. It's a story about love, loss, longing, and family. It's also about growth and change. There is not a lot of detail; just a simple heartfelt story.

This book talks a lot about life and death.I like this book because it tells you to love no matter what happens.

Caleb, the little boy, was funny because he asked many questions. The book has interesting parts and sad parts. For example Anna was sad because she missed her mom. Sarah loved the animals and she was sad when something happened to the baby sheep. I think Jacob really falls in love with Sarah. This book was very interesting about Anna, Caleb, Jacob, Sarah, and the animals. Do you think Jacob will marry Sarah?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best","review":"When I first read this book, I was around 7 and even then it wasn't enjoyable to me. I felt it was very plain and basic with too simple language, although the story did have a nice feeling to it. Te characters were ok, and the entire book felt just that - ok. If I recommended this book, it would be for very young readers, like ages 5 to 7 or something, or for kids who have a harder time reading as an easier book. All in all, not bad, not good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing and Heart-Warming!","review":"Sarah, Plain and Tall is a wonderful, heart-warming book.

The author's name was Patricia MacLachen. The character's names were Caleb, Sarah, Anna, and Papa. I though the book was very interesting.It first started when Caleb was siting by the fire. He was asking questions about Mama singing songs. Anna was explaining to him about when he was born. Their mama died. Sarah answered Papa's letter and came to live with them. Sarah taught Caleb how to swim. If anybody gets the book, they will really enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The trouble with this book is there isn't much excitement.","review":"This was a boring book. A few parts were good, like when the kids were meeting Sarah and when Sarah almost left. But most of it was pretty boring. I mean, all that happens is Anna,Caleb, and Anna and Caleb's father meets Sarah, Sarah works in the house, Sarah gets used to the house, and Anna and Caleb's father marries Sarah. I mean, it's pretty predictable. I find books that are very predictable quite boring. If you like books that not much happens in, read this book. But I don't think very many people like this kind of book, so you probably wouldn't like it. It's aufully boring. So, if you love boring books, this is the book for you! Personally, I hate boring books. I also hate books that are to predictable because you know what is going to happen, so what is the point to reading it? And I don't like unexciting books 'cause you get bored with them easily. This is one of the few books I read and didn't like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I had expected...","review":"A couple of years ago I read this book to my then 9 year old daughter. I figured since it had won the Newbery Medal we would love it--wrong. I was quite disappointed by it and I knew my daughter wasn't crazy about it. We were both, quite frankly, bored by it. My daughter is a gifted reader--she reads across a variety of different genre, reads books, newspapers, magazines, etc. She couldn't understand how this book had won the Newbery Medal--I couldn't either. If I hadn't read other's reviews on it I would say that I could barely remember what the story was about! A wonderful book should stay with you. A wonderful award-winning book has fully developed characters that you really get to know inside and out. This book was not terrible but for me and my girl it was just so-so. You're so much better off with the Laura Ingalls Wilder's Little House on the Prairie or Old Yeller.

Very interesting story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"not as strong as i remember it","review":"Like many people, I read this book first when I was a small child. And it has been maybe 20 years since I've seen it. I picked it up to reread it (doesn't take long) and I found that it wasn't as strong of a book as I remember it to be. I'm not talking about the simple language, after all, it is written for a child. Rather, the characters are one dimensional. And the children seem far to quick to accept Sarah as their new mother.But, it is a children's book, and doesn't have to stand up to the close scrutiny one gives an adult's book. It is a touching story about love and the creation of a family. It helps to teach accpetance, even love of a stepparent. I do recommend this for the kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sarah, Plain and Tall","review":"I am enrolled in a children's literature class at West Virginia State College. My teacher has recently given our class an assignment to read a Newbery Award Winner book. I chose to read this wonderfully written and touching book about two children and their father who is trying to find a wife by placing an ad in the paper.

But before doing so, I had to take a peek to see what all the five-star reviews were about. This is a read that I'm sure your children would love. It's the kind of read that will keep your child fixated on the pages. Not many books can do that. It's an innocent and old-fashion story that doesn't have the typical witches, goblins and other thngs that hooks children in order to increase book sales.

It is a waste of money. It is exactly the same as Back Street Stories, except it has an American narrator instead of a British one. So, I guess it makes this video better than the other one if you don't want to hear that thick British accent. I was really disappointed about the video because for most of it, other people are being interviewed, not the Boys. Also, the interviews with the Boys are really short and they basically say things that any BSB fan already knows. The only thing good/interesting about the video is that it shows footage of them when they were just starting out, (Nick was soooo young!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Up To You!","review":"I bought this video a few Months ago and was disappointed, but yet I wasn't. I enjoyed seeing the boys young, and was really happy to see Kevin being silly, because now he seem a little up tight. I thought it should have had more interviews with the guys, or at least showed more scenes with them. It was also a little hard to understand what the narrator was saying, because she was English: so If your going to buy it, buy the one with the Amercian narrator. I have only watched this BSB video once, because it wasn't that great, but if your a collector of BSB material than buy it. If you want a video that shows the boys than don't buy it. It's up to you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"You can still be a true BSB fan WITHOUT purchasing this video. Sure, its got the Boys in it, but not enough to keep a fan satisfied.

Also, the landing portion of the Apollo 14 includes made-up dialogue that never occurred, possibly an attempt to portray the excitement and dramatize the tension of problems that developed.

There seems to be a suggestion running through the film that the shadowy Russian government is up to some shady doings behind the scenes - operating secret cloning facilities, selling decades-old frozen meat etc. - but the movie is so formless and incomprehensible that I doubt anyone could figure out what anybody\`s really up to here.Despite decent acting and a few incisively directed scenes, \\"4\\" is a two-hour long endurance contest that should be avoided at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke in under a month","review":"Was not happy with new line as soon as I received it.

However, there is a learning curve to complete success. I fold the first few inches of the bag back so no liquids, oils or fats touch it to hinder sealing. When filled, pull the edge up and seal. Once I started doing that there was never an issue. Also, if you are freezing a high liquid food (soup, sauces) it is best to place the bag upright in the freezer to freeze solid first.

After sealing maybe a dozen bags worth of food, it stopped sealing entirely. Even if I held it down the entire time, it wouldn't switch to automatic, and it would not trigger the heat sealer.

Worked beautifully the first and second usage, sealed about 6-8 bags first session, then two weeks later another 6-8 bags.

Fourth time, very weak vacuum, can't seal at all.Waskness of the unit when it first worked: very loud, but a Foodsaver replacement was just as loud. To seal the open end of bag cut from a roll it must pull a vacuum, otherwise it won't turn on heat for sealing so pump runs whenever you use it.

Tried it two more times and still did not work. That was in August. At the initial use I read the manual three times before using it. Tried the troubleshooting got frustrated and put it away.Pulled it out again tonight to use and now it won't even heat up to seal the bag. Had my boyfriend try it and it did not work for him.

The second time I used it, the thing didnt want to seal properly it would read that it was done but when I released the seal I could see air re entering the bags. If I re sealed it a couple of times eventually it would seal though. The third time I used seal a meal it would just run on and on and not seal at all. disgusted I unplugged it and planned on returning it. a couple of days later I plugged it back in just for kicks and it worked properly. I hoped it would continue to so but the other day I went to use it to seal up 30 lbs of fresh fish filets and it didnt work again.I unplugged it and went out and bought a kenmore brand which cost more but at least has a two year warranty. as for the seal a meal? well it has a date with the target range and a 357 tomorrow morning!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the postage","review":"When we first got this my wife had trouble using it and I thought she was not doin it right so I got it to work.

A child could not do it. Then it will pump out the air and seal the bag quickly...Meat is getting expensive. You must take advantage of sales. Beef will last over a year in the vac pack.

This past weekend, our local grocery had a meat sale where we purchased over 100 lbs. of various beef, chicken and pork. In less than an hour, I had all of it sealed tight and in the freezer. I find that with most electric kitchen \\"gadgets\\" it is usually the user of the product, and not the product itself, on which problems should be blamed.

It worked fairly well at first, then it became harder and harder to make it work. I went through all the trouble-shooting whoo ha with it, made sure I was letting it cool sufficiently between uses and so on, but it just kept going downhill. I put it away for a while and just got it back out today. The thing makes noise but does nothing else. I took the gaskets out and made sure they were put back in properly, but nothing. It makes noises and does nothing else. I did not want to have to buy one every year, I'm not into disposable things. I tried to find new gaskets for it, although there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with these, but they are not to be had, anywhere.

Still in service at my old house. I took no chances on the only metal pieces(the hoop and bracket)-I put 4 coats of rustoleum on them right out of the box -just as a precaution.

It continually falls in to the pool. Designated areas for water fill leak.. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT","review":"I highly recommend the Cool Jam Pro Poolside Basketball system. It is every bit as good as some other poolside systems but costs hundreds of dollars less. It is sturdy, doesn't wobble and missed shots return to the pool. It is incredibly easy to assemble, it basically snaps together and the hardware is enclosed to attach the rim to the backboard. My only issue was that 2 washers were missing from the bag of hardware...it was no big deal since I had the same size washers, but it could have necessitated a trip to the hardware store. I used one day shipping, it arrived the next day and my kids were playing with it in the pool 15 minutes later. You can't go wrong with this basketball system, and you will save $300-$500 over similar poolside systems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Made and Rust Proof","review":"The goal is very well made and sturdy. I like the fact that everything except the rim is high impact polyethylene. My previous pool goal had to be repainted a couple of times due to rust. My only issue with the Cool Jam is the way the rim attaches to the backboard. It appears that the rim will sag over time because the backboard is somewhat flexible in that area. I may replace the current rim with a sturdier break-away rim."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"After lots of searching for a replacement for our pool basketball set, we decided on this one! It was s and so easy to assemble that my 12 year old did it with just a little help. VERY sturdy and no metal parts on the bottom of the set to rust onto my pool deck.

I was expecting the typically wordy, overly-technical writing that so many similar books suffer from, but THE LAST MILE was written in a language I could not only understand, but learn from. Broadband will soon be taking businesses by storm and I am now one step closer to taking part in all that it has to offer. By demystifying the unknown, I feel better equipped to move forward. This is a terrific book for anyone who wants to expand their realm of understanding and not get left behind in our new economy."},{"rating":"1","title":"How many times can you state the obvious?","review":"What did this book tell me:1.

Where is it going and how can I understand this supersonic train? THE LAST MILE gives the reader a very clear idea what is in the future for internet applications. This is a book for everyone - from a technology side it is well researched, and written so that anyone can understand what is happening and where it is all going. I highly recommend this book, and I think it appeals to a wide range of readers - those who are in the field, to any business big or small who already uses internet and wants a leading advantage, and even to those who are just learning the concept of the cyber-age and all it's implications. It's a great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I was really disappointed by this book. It did a poor job of going into detail (I wasn't looking for too much detail) of broadband technologies in use today. It also barely even touched wireless broaband to the home or to enterprises. Furthermore, the information was dated even though the hardcopy version I bought had a copyright date of 2001. Clearly, the book must've been written in late 1999 or early 2000. In this rapidly changing industry, that's too long ago. I also have to agree with another reader that I can't tell who this book was intended for? What was the target audience?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really superficial","review":"Anyone who uses the internet at all on a dial-up ISP knows intuitively that the lack of broadband is what keeps the web from reaching full potential. AOL who has built its business on catering to teenieboppers at $20 bucks a pop, and has apparently found it to be in its strategic interest to continue the slooooo unreliable access, contributed to the long delay in broadband access to residential customers. We all know that it's happening, and even AOL with it's lash-up with TW can not stop it.This book adds little to one's knowledge of broadband. I feel certain that given their background, the authors must know a lot about their subject, but it's difficult to perceive a more superficial treatment of the subject. If the best you can do is explain broadband in terms of plumbing, skip it altogether. My advice concerning this book: skip it altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"novice authors, little knowledge","review":"I was quite surprised how much of a dry, uninformative, redundant book this was. I realize that there were two authors, I don't believe they communicated with each other as many subjects were absolutely repeated several times. In fact the first author referred to Kosmo and the second author referred to Kozmo (both referring to the same company). I brought very little new knowledge from reading this book and would recommend something written by people informed a little more about the subject.Authors were obviously very excited about the subject (and their old company macromedia) however they veered off into subjects that basically repeated any other internet related business book that exists. We get it, the internet is changing the world, you're a little late to the dance! I have to say that they didn't use the book to tout their organization and try to win business (if they did mean to do that, they did a very poor job), which is admirable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"If you understand academia you will probably get a lot of in jokes. The funniest of the trilogy. I laughed until it hurt. You buy the three in one volume - The 2 1/2 Pillars of Wisdom. It is more cost effective.

A few months later when visiting her, I found the book in with her recycle newspapers and asked her what she thought of the book. \\"Well, I don't really know what it was about, it didn't make any sense.\\" So I took the book home and read it.Alexander McCall Smith is pretty light, fun reading and as such is a nice interlude.Dr. von Igelfeld, a philologist, is mistaken for a veterinarian with an emphasis on sausage dogs and is asked to America from England to give a talk. It is not until moments before the speech that he realizes the mistake that has been made and valiantly gives a speech anyway.This is just the beginning. He has many more crazy things happen in his life, like assisting at amputating an injured leg of a sausage dog but amputates the wrong one, three times! Until the poor thing has one leg left.Really a just for fun read which is a great thing now and then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Me","review":"I love Alexander McCall Smith, but I was unable or unwilling to finish this book, even though it is a small one and easy to carry on the bus.

This is overmixed, studio refined, gimmicky and uninspiring. May I say it is like as if Loreena McKennit thought it may be a good idea to change and become like Karen Carpenter, or Mylee Cyrus. There is a woman on this cd trying to mystically chant like Enya - it doesn't work. Reminds me of Yoko Ono's orgasm impresssion from Lennon-Ono Double Fantasy. Very trying for a worship cd.

Of courses being a moral film in the time so censorship the females must be punished so, they are dragged off by a giant; thus, they leave a hand full of girls to be brought up without males by a wise old woman.We come to the opening scene where the women not knowing what they are missing have to dance to exhaustion (we get exhausted watching).Soon after being told that men can be useful for propagating, they set out to subdue some feeble men for this nefarious purpose.In the process, we see the invention of fire and its consequences.I recommend that this film should not fall in the hands of women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliches and bad acting","review":"Only get this if you have *all* other tango movies.

Prototypes is easily the most accessible thing he's recorded, but that's not saying much. What it does say is that he's come back from the outer limits of sound treatments and DSP gadgetry to create a strangely musical hybrid of fuzzy pops, clicks, chimes and blips which is less like an album of songs and more a series of meditations on technology.It is notable that Nicolai was one of the first to really exploit the possibilities of minimal electronic glitches. His work with Mika Vainio as well as his solo work has continually challenged conventions of what is and what is not musical or artful. In light of the burgeoning \\"clicks_+_cuts\\" phenomenon, this Alva Noto release is less of a bandwagon-jumper and more of a veteran stepping up to the challenge once more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tracklist","review":"Tracklist01.

They're at a high point here as far as instrumental firepower - the band is really kicking it up. The guitars are as great as they had been previously, and the drums and bass take it up a notch here. The instrumental hooks here (the shifts of rhythm especially) are catchier than the vocal hooks.What is McCullough on about in most of these songs? What is the foreboding really all about?

No natural discourse would sound like this -- and her imagination when it comes to speaking \\"in the heat of the moment\\" is seriously lacking. Furthermore, the novel has some extremely perverse sexuality that could be disturbing to some readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh....awful!","review":"Did not like this book...had to put it down after the first chapter. the story was all over the place that I still don't know what was the plot to this book.

But where Brainiac melded pop, punk, and new wave, Enon strides comfortably into techno (For the Sum of it) and even some classic soul (\\"Rubber Car\\") in addition to the the new wave pop/punk axis. \\"Cruel,\\" with breathy vocals and somber tone sounds like something Elysian Fields might do, and \\"Conjugate the Verbs\\" would make every critics top 10 list if Beck had done it. The worst thing about this album is that it is over so quickly - it clocks in at around 35 minutes. Hopefully Enon can keep producing records of this quality. If they do, they seem destined to have the same kind of underground influence as Brainiac and Man...Or Astroman?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sonic Smorgasborg","review":"A near-perfect album, blending sonic guitars, accoustics, jazzy/avante garde drumming, heavy aggressive bass, and sweet singing.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Bennett\\" Fits Fine 'tween \\"Backstreet\\" and \\"Brittney,\\" Kids","review":"Tony Bennett, at this point in his legendary career, is nearly incapable of making a poor album. Here, singing about, to, and for children, his work is especially elegant and empathetic. The title song, written by the Bergmans, is a jazzy piece of childhood nostalgia. His versions of \\"All God's Chillen' Got Rhythm,\\" (featuring a killer brush drum solo!) \\"Paper Moon,\\" and his versions of the Disney songs swing sweetly with help from the Ralph Sharon Trio. The final, unlisted track on my copy of the CD is \\"Christmas in Herald Square,\\" a New York sequel of sorts to \\"The Christmas Song.\\" Bennett sings it beautifully. \\"The Playground\\" is a wonderful place for children and adults to spend time. It's an album Frank Sinatra never got the chance to do and Dean Martin, well...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A warm, enjoyable concept album","review":"All in all, this is an excellent album. What Tony Bennett lacks in vocal range (he is getting up there in age), he more than makes up for with his warm and charming delivery. For kids, this should be a delight. For adult jazz fans, this is simply a very good concept album. I agree that the duets are a bit of a stretch in some cases. However, they fit the child album concept and are few and far between. Songs that I especially enjoy are Dat Dere and The Playground. (Dat Dere alone may be worth the price of the disc.) This is an essential release for the Tony Bennett fan, and a very nice addition for jazz fans and children alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!

Perhaps that's why he's been able to live to be a hundred years old. With these he can combine the serenity of the garden and the realization that you are planting something that will provide a future pleasure, with the poetry he gets to express his feeling better than simple prose can do.This book contains a series of, well, I guess you'd call them essays, reflecting on a century of gardening, of poetry, of life. These were distilled from a series of converstions between Mr. Kunitz and Ms. Lentine. They have never been previously published.The poetry, the essays, show a vibrant man, comfortable and serene in his view of the world.

He deserves more than one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book miseducates the reader's soul","review":"How can any work be so dreary and unpoetic and at once so imprecise and unanalytical? The answer: Read Proust! While failing in describing the sensory world with hallucinatory clarity and beauty, Proust simultaneously presents his characters (all quite forgettable) as if under a broken microscope, not revealing in any luminous detail the complex interplay of memory, desire, conscience and habit in their divided hearts. The narrator (a young and bitter Proust, more or less) divides the work roughly between a nostalgic portrait of childhood summers at his family's country home, and a morbidly funny record of an older friend's humiliating courtship of a notorious prostitute and subsequent crucifixion by jealousy. Proust does not have a cruel wit, supernatural eye for paradox,taste for the most delicious ironies or above all an all-encompassing wisdom that borders on the mystical - forgiving nothing, forgetting all."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Most Over Rated Novels of All Time","review":"I'm glad that this book has generated so much controversy, even if most of it has been the brilliant comments of one or two people who are amazingly capable of expressing original views. For most of us, repeating someone's comments but replacing positives with negatives was something funny and something that lightened up the mood; something especially needed when discussing such dreary literature. It definately qualifies as valid criticism. Swann's Way is undoubtedly a work of perversion.

His childhood is a mean to give birth to a gallery of charming characters and strong sensations that flow in a continuous stream. His exquisite and delicate prose transports us to our own childhood. He lets us perceive the beauty of simple things stimulating all our senses.(It is strange how a simple translation can give a book's title more than its original sense. \\"Du coté de chez Swann\\" or \\"Por el camino de Swann\\" -the former being the original title and the later the spanish translation- tell us simply that we are going to introduce ourselves in a beautiful promenade along a little ville called Combray. However, the english tittle \\"Swann's way\\" creates in the reader's mind an expectation about the main character that does not come up even in the original tittle.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Swanns Way by Marcel Proust","review":"One of the most fascinating and beautiful books I've ever read, Proust had a knack for taking the smallest detail and making it meaningful and beautiful. His sentence structure is very different from anything I've ever read before and his writing style is very dense(somebody once told me that it was like swimming through mayonaise) He is one of most original writers of this century and certainly one of the most poetic.

The problem is, this album (long out of print) came out just as cassettes were giving way to CDs, so while CDs of it were made, they are apparently as scarce as hens' teeth.Fortunately, the CD that you'll buy from this page is not some unprofessional dub, as I feared. I thought that perhaps the thing had NEVER been released on CD, and that what you were looking at here was some mountebank's attempt to dub his cassette onto a CD format.

They can't work miracles, obviously -- the audio isn't going to pop in a way it never did before -- but the colours in the picture, and the quality of the picture are way beyond what I would have expected for a movie like this.Obviously, it's not going to look as good as a brand-new release, but it's easily the best transfer of this movie to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"An 80's Classic on DVD","review":"The quality is as good as it was in the 80's and the DVD is a great quality and value for the price.

Can a group of kids on bikes thwart the robbers and the police?Ho-hum. Nothing like scenes of kids riding bicycles, popping wheelies, and out smarting adults.I am not sure kids today would even be interested in this film.

I recommend the movie for any youngster but be very careful who you order from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stitch Patterns Galore","review":"Step by step illustrations on learning how to crochet on the double, the pattern stitches are broken down into sections making it easy for you to find what you are looking for or you can just flip through the book for lots of inspiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I got it a few weeks ago and I love it.

Its great to hear her singing songs from musicals instead of simple nursery rhymes. It awakened a sense of interest in viewing musicals both on stage and on video that I think has been very beneficial to her. Not only that, but it is actually an enjoyable CD to listen to for her, her 1 year old brother, her parents and even her grandparents!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but flimsy","review":"The neck is on the small side, so those with alrger babies probably would find the neck too tight.These are super cute, and the lining does slow wetness from getting to the clothes, but not as much as I had hoped. My main beef though is that when velcro sticks to the terry in the wash (which is inevitable), the terry tears, so all of them have ripped up areas with the threads hanging out. They're very thin terry. Do not recommend unless you pop them on for pictures when you absolutely need a bib (these are definitely picture-worthy), taking them off right after - and you are willing to wash them by hand so that the fabric doesn't get ripped up by velcro."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible bibs","review":"I bought these bibs hoping they would be good for up to 12 months. My baby is an average size 5 months and the neckline of the bib is too narrow and makes it very uncomfortable to wear.

Something no home should be without."},{"rating":"2","title":"A surprise discovery with immense power.","review":"Until I came across the \\"Heart of Oak\\" series I had never heard of this compelling Conrad work. The editors have plucked from obscurity a psychological drama that is beautiful in its language, haunting in its imagery, and compelling to read. A real page-turner from the master."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not read since my school days","review":"This novel formed part of my english literature curriculum almost 40 years ago. That was the last time I read the novel. Conrad put much of his own experience into the book. He descibes with great power the life of Peyrol, a brother of the coast, returning home after a life spent at sea. Retirement is planned, but this is not to be through one final call to duty. Brilliantly atmospheric style brings to life the characters and countryside. Well worth revisiting for the first time since my school days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Without Even a Pretense of Objectivity","review":"The by-line says it all: This video has no doubt whatsoever that Einhorn killed Maddux. Never mind that the evidence is all circumstantial. Not to bother that the forensic evidence makes no sense. Forget the possibility that there was ample oppotunity for Maddux' body to be planted in Einhorn's apartment. The prosecution jumped to the immediate conclusion that Einhorn was the perpetrator; no other leads were ever pursued. His appeal is now being jeopardized by inept representation by the public defender's office."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the price","review":"i agree with the point made about \\"neo-Flamenco\\", but there are diamonds in the rough here. Camarón with Tomatito, Miguel Poveda, Enrique Morente (one of my favorite recent cantaores) with Pepe Habichuela, Pepe also does a beautiful solo \\"Granadina\\", Gerardo Núñez with El Indio Gitano. It even has a piece by Pastora Pavón \\"La niña de los peines\\" her popular decades were the 1930's and 40's she was/is revered by all of us as a great female pioneer in Flamenco. And a Sevillana by Martirio, not the most traditional, but she never was nor wanted to be. Does it contain modern music? Does it have some Jazzy and Junky pieces not fashioned to be called Flamenco? ¡YES!, but for the money buy it. would i have bought it if it were $30-$40... probably not. but that is because i have plenty of music from many of these artists, of which, some you can not buy here in the states. It is entitled, \\"Beginners Guide...\\" which is what it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW...Just WOW!!!!","review":"I picked up this game the other day already playing the first one.

There is all a-lot more missions in this one.This is a must buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"no service","review":"Never received the game and did not get my money back. Emailed company never got response. Very unhappy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth a dime","review":"This game is a joke.Especially compared to ANY of the Call of Duty or Medal of Honor. What were they thinking? You spend more time giving commands than you do in actual combat. Not worth the time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is not that great","review":"I purchased this item in the hopes it would be as good as Call of Duty only from another company. I had heard good reviews from other sources. Once I opened the game and started playing, the more I started to regrett my purchase. First I had to lower of level of video in the game inorder to play it. Yes the graphics are great.I am annoyed by having to keep a watch over other computer generated people. I can not focus on my objective because I have to take care of the squad. Although I think the langauge is correct for battle, it may be too strong for some. I also agree with the other reviewer that the shooting is not accurate and shooting at the same person 10-20 times is hard to do.After playing both Call of Duty and Call of Duty 2, I am not impressed with BOA:EIB at all. I will stay with the COD series unless BOA omproves. I do know that they are two different companies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Deceiving!!!","review":"WARNING! This is not a true first-person shooter! The screenshots may look cool, but DO NOT be fooled! This is more like an RPG if anything. Instead of running around blasting the crap out of the Germans, you have to babysit the dumbest A.I. characters in the world. While you're busy trying to command the idiots to take cover, you've already been shot in the head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You Gearbox","review":"This game is way better - WAY BETTER - than Road to Hill 30. There have been many improvements. The levels are larger, the enemies are smarter, and there's co-op play. It also features a skirmish mode that lets you play as Germans and Americans.The greatest thing about this game is the improved enemy AI. In the last game, I was dissappointed that the enemy just sat behind cover and popped up and shot every once and a while. In this game, you have to be way more careful. The enemy will actually manuever around you and flank you if you don't watch out. So this game combines both elements of offense and defense.Overall, its a great game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different take on the WWII first-person shooter","review":"Overall, this game is great. It brings to the table what the first game in the series introduced, the ability to command additional AI units. There is a lot of additional strategy involved (i.e. flanking, suppressing fire, armor units, etc.). The gameplay can be somewhat difficult at first, though, and certain missions, or sections therein, are extremely difficult to overcome without taking gratuitous losses.Still, this is a rather unique game in the AI on both sides (US and German), and becomes a very fun challenge to get through. I also found it's replayability to be higher than some. Instead of fanciful 'you-versus-the-Axis' shooters, this one requires trust in your comrades, tactical prowess and a slight amount of heroism on your part. Almost a 5-star game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Concept but flawed execution","review":"I ordered these CD's for my 8 year old Dyslexic son. Although the content is great for teaching sounds of letters and phonomes, it lacked the ability to keep either of my children interested for more than 5 minutes. I'm sure he could learn a great deal from these if they were interesting but I found Spelling blaster and Reading Rabbit much more useful. I found myself board out of my skull trying to work with him on these and I don't bore easily. I then tried to use them to teach my 3 year old and had the same results. If your child is able to concentrate for long periods of time these CD's would be very useful. I was also not able to adjust and skip the lower levels to get to where my sons level was. We never made it to the useful part. The idea is great, but it needs some type of fun and reward system to make it work."},{"rating":"2","title":"It worked for our son!","review":"Despite a few software flukes, this program worked well for our son. He was reading before he turned five, with little effort on our part, except encouragement to keep on playing the games. I have looked at other phonics programs that cost more and prefer this to the Phonics Game, Fast-track Phonics, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Color phonics was a bore","review":"I tried this software on 3 of my children. They thought it was cute for about 5 minutes, but after that it was the same and very monotonous. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn&#65533;t keep me awake","review":"This book was so basic and boring I couldn't stay interested for more than two pages. Lots of fluff little content. After forcing myself to read the majority of the first 6 chapters I resorted to the on line documentation from Microsoft. The book leaves out how the product actually works. IE (Data Flow and Evaluation) The book focuses how the product relates to mouse clicks, dialog boxes, and installation routines. If you have no router / administration experience and don't care to know how the product works but need to install ISA server this would be an excellent book. For seasoned administrators trying to incorporate ISA Server into a pre existing security concept you'll find this book isn't even heavy enough to be a doorstop. In short the title \\"Configuration and Administration\\" is very accurate. It will tell you where and how to click but if you want to know more either read the on line documentation or wait for the next book to hit print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptable!","review":"This book guides you through the basics of how to install the ISA Server software. From there, it provides a very top-level informational base of what it should do and the theories of why it should work. There are absoulutely no practical examples, troubleshooting tips, or other information that you could not find on Microsoft's support site. It's a waste of time and energy. All in all, the book cover alone should give it away!On the other hand, if you have absoulutely no clue on what you are doing, this book can provide you with the basic ABC's of ISA. But again, if you are an experienced IT professional--definately pass!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Helpful","review":"This is a VERY high level book. You can get more technical information using the \\"What's This\\" function in the program (i.e. right-click on a field label). I think this book was a rush job to be one of the first ISA books available. The author obviously doesn't have a lot of experience or an in-depth knowledge of this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remixed to hell","review":"The words on the case 'remixed to hell' says it all. The album is just a so electronically remixed(or better yet, deformed) version of the metal tribute album 'Dragon Attack'. The vocals are exactly the same in both of the albums, hence there're no original Queen recordings or Freddie's vocal or whatsoever left in the tracks. Buy it if you like dansably ruined metal. But a classical Queen fan would probably not know how to react this total 'hell'. Even an avid collector can possibly live without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tributes: good and bad","review":"If you love Queen but are a little bored of the 5 songs that they play on the radio, this is a good diversion. It's one of the better Tribute albums I've come across, mostly because it's NOT the original versions or someone TRYING to be Freddie in a bad way.Other Artists put their spin on A&B; Side classics done mostly in a Metal or Techno version, but is not limited to these. Most of the remixes are very well done: It's Late, We Will Rock You. Some I would even dare to say are better remixes than the \\"Bonus Tracks\\" on re-released Queen CDs, but a few of them have to be taken with a grain of salt: Save Me.I bought this brand new years ago and enjoyed it before it was stolen. It's only been recently that this rare album has become more available. Even if you're a purist when it comes to Queen, this definitely deserves a listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"FOR EXTEME HARDCORE COLLECTORS ONLY (maybe not even that)","review":"I found this a very bad Tibute. Dragon Attack pushed me to the limits, but I still liked it. On this CD they took the Dragon attack songs and remixed them.....I HATED IT. If you're going to call it a tribute at least make the songs decent. It is only for extreme hardcore collectors, or fans of remixes. Anything even related to Queen has never given me a bigger knot in my stomach. Although some mixes are okay (Save Me, probably the only one)the rest are MIXED and MIXED and MIXED I HATE IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than the originals but that's not saying much..","review":"Considering how bad the metal tribute album \\"Dragon Attack\\" was...remixing/reworking them seems like a good idea. Unfortunately, the \\"singing\\" was left in on the tracks.Some end up working really well like \\"Get Down, Make Love\\" and \\"Killer Queen\\" sounds like a mix between early David Bowie vocals and trippy electronica musical backing.However NO remixing can overcome the HORRIBLE vocals on songs like \\"We Will Rock You\\".I'm still waiting for proper and *talented* remixers/producers to give the original Queen tracks an updated sound.....I won't hold my breath though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Realistic Story","review":"I found this film to be a very realistic example of lifes issues that a family sometimes experiences.A husband and wife drifting apart,teenage children growing up.All of a sudden a tradgedy happens and the blaming and anger and other emotions start to pile up and the pressures of people who don't really know each other as good as they thought they did starts to surface.Can they keep it together and pull through?Well I'll just say I recommend people watch it,because in our present daily lives maybe everyone can be inspired by this great film!Go ahead and see for yourself--the whole cast was great,especially Ms.DeMornay!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A GOOD HISTORICAL ACCOUNT, BUT LACKS EXCITEMENT","review":"I had expected that the author would reveal a lot of what Tokyo Rose actually broadcast and, especially, the effect it had or was expected to have on our troops in the Pacific War. Plus, obviously, some followup on how she was eventually arrested in the U.S., etc. This text is a very good historical and legal account about Tokyo Rose (the one chosen for this book), her biography, her time in Japan, how she got involved, how she was arrested in the U.S. and so on, but the narrative is so detailed that it becomes boring and tends to lose the general reader's interest. On the other hand, if you are interested in Tokyo Rose's life and personal problems, and demand a lot of very detailed and specific biographical and prosecutorial information, this is the book for you. Sorry, not what I was looking for..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written with liberal bias","review":"From the Forward by Ramsey Clark to the end of the book one can not help but be startled by the very liberal bias of the writing. It reads like a \\"do you still beat your wife?\\" question. Howe uses his literary pulpit to preach a liberal sermon. This is the fourth book he published in the first six months of 1993 -- seems like a rush to judgement. While his conclusions may be correct, his poorly concealed radical disposition destroys the credibility of his arguments. A big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"creative Zen skin","review":"The skin is great...fits nicely.

I have to say, this CD still sounds to me as fresh and rich as the day I got it. Incredibly rich, these songs can be listened to again and again without boredom. No surprise given that Ferrante and Lorber *both* wrote and played pieces on this album.They just don't make music like this anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tavener at his best here, too","review":"This was my first Tavener CD. There have been nearly 30 since then. It remains one of my favorites. I have found passages of it haunting and indispensable. Very sadly, Tavener's more recent music, such as Ikon of Eros, shows a surrender to spiritual and musical gaucherie. If you are new to Tavener, by all means begin with this CD or with Ikon of Light (either recording, though the Harry Christophers one is my favorite) or Thunder Entered Her. Avoid Ikon of Eros, Fall and Resurrection, or Innocence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value . . but . .","review":"I purchased 3 sets during Amazon's pre-Christmas sale, and they were very popular with 4 and 5 year olds. However, if I had it to do over I'd remove the ballerina shoes before giving this set to a child. Even adults have difficulty stuffing Madeline's feet into them; they are just cut too small. In fact, if you'd like to keep the black shoes and socks tacked onto the doll for awhile, I'd put the ballerina tights away for later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madeline is so sweet!

It had neither. In addition the prduction was poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but not great","review":"This book provides a wide seletion of type designs. Most of them are excellent. But honestly, I feel that the author holds back a lot of important details. For example, usually there are no specific color values (just light red, dark yellow, ...), this is really disturbing, 'cause even a small difference in color values may give you a completely different results. Also, I don't know why he never tell which font he is using, and I have to spend my time searching through my font list. This book is about type but it never digs deep into basic design principles of fonts and their effects (like modern, sans serif, script and such).I learn quite an amount from this book, but waste a great amount of time experimenting different color values and fonts. The time that I could have spent to read many more books about Photoshop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"This gorgeous book is jam packed with photorealistic effects which are also included on the CD. This book is written for Photoshop 6 and 7 for PC and Mac.The tutorials range from downright easy to extremely complex. The book begins with an overview of using type in Photoshop. The book is heavily illustrated throughout. The layout is clean and sharp and is packed with information. There are a lot of dialog boxes showing the settings used in the tutorials.You'll find various realistic metal effects, gorgeous polished chrome including realistic reflections, and every imaginable texture or effect. These effects are very professional looking.There is also an encylopedia section with 72 different effects and an appendix showing all the Photoshop built-in filters and type effects. I found this book a great inspiration and easy to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Instructions are sometimes incomplete or vague","review":"I have to go against the grain here. Other reviewers seem to like this book, but I don't think it's that great. I am an intermediate level Photoshop user and I feel that for what is essentially a \\"cook book\\" that some of the steps are missing or vague. Instructions like \\"adjust to get the desired effect\\" mean nothing. If I see an example of the effect I like in the book I want to know EXACTLY how to do it and not be left to guess. It is not what I consider a step-by-step book and some of the instructions tell you to do something and assume you know what to do. If you are a beginner, stay away from this book. If you are an intermediate user you may have some luck, but I'd look at other Photoshop type effets books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too little information","review":"The book is ok if you are an experienced user. If you are new to photoshop, I fear you will be lost. The author makes it very difficult to duplicate the samples by not saying what size and resolution canvas he is using, and is very vague on issues such as \\"use a little blur\\" etc. Blurring the alpha channel is what helps cause the beveled and raised effects, and without some type of number to go off of, I had a very difficult time trying to duplicate his samples.I did enjoy coming up with my own new and unique effects of of some of his suggestions, but over all I felt the book needs more detail to be useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frantastic book!!","review":"It is wonderful.

The weaknesses - there is no commentary on three songs on 'The Joshua Tree', \\"One Tree Hill\\", \\"In God's Country\\", and \\"Trip Through Your Wires\\" and the awkward inclusion of the full video versions of \\"The Sweetest Thing\\" (remixed in 1998) and \\"Running to Stand Still\\" (circa 1993 Zoo TV).Having read the book \\"Until the End of the World\\", I hope they take a second try at this format with the making of their other classic, 'Achtung Baby'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why release this?","review":"Thankfully I received this item as a gift and didn't pay for it.

They work just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the price.","review":"I bought them because you cannot beat the price. I figured I could get a minimum of a year out them. Have used them a couple of times and I am impressed, sure they are cheap and not the greatest but heck they were 10 bucks. I really like them and I am goin to order a couple more for the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't fit over eyeglasses","review":"I'm new to shooting, and bought these because I assumed they would fit over my eyeglasses. Every pair of safety glasses outside of shooting that I've ever seen do fit over my eyeglasses. No matter. These don't, and aren't advertised that they do. They don't cost much, so I'll trade them for a handful of rounds. Just a head's up........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good deal","review":"Not bad for the price. Arrived quickly and undamaged. Fit nicely under my protective headset. I've only used them twice so far but I would buy them again if I needed them."},{"rating":"2","title":"So easy to adjust these.","review":"These glasses fit great. They are easy to adjust. The ones I ordered came in with a scuff at the bottom. I contacted the seller and they were very quick in responding and sent me another one that was perfect. I think it was a manufacture defect because the package was new. Very satisfied with the glasses, the price, and the service."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Dad loves these","review":"My Dad really likes these glasses. I just wish they came with a case (He said there wasnt one). Other than that, if hes happy so am I."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad","review":"These came fast, as always with things sold by Amazon.They fit great. Go on a little tight but not that tight it will bother you way, the good, it won't fall off way is more accurate :)No scratches on the lenses yet. They seem to be semi anti-fog as I can blow hot breath at them and they don't just fog up and stay like that like other cheaper ones do.Overall I would say they are probably better than the $10 ones you can get from walmart, plus on Amazon you can pick your own color when you order which is a plus, and I never liked walmart so would rather give Amazon the same $$ any day!Overall I would get them again. I have not yet went to a range to get to use them but they are glasses, I am sure they do fine lol"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"WILL NOT PROVIDE PROTECTION AGAINST SEVERE IMPACT HAZARDS\\"","review":"Above are the words concerning how effective these will be as protection from shooting hazards: NONE! The disclaimer on the back of the package should disqualify these as being able to be advertised as \\"Protective Shooting Glasses,\\" they aren't! The ANSI Z78.1 safety standard is a bare minimum, and does not meet the rigor or safety requirements of shooting environments, and we are all misled when these are being advertised as something they definitely are not! As regular, cheap semi-protection from the sun, wind, and bugs, they'll work very well, and are very adjustable: telescoping earpiece, ratcheting temple pivot...pretty cool. Nice glasses for not much dinero...but highly misrepresented. I will keep them just because I like them, but I will not wear them while shooting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAP (and not in a good way)","review":"I usually don't complain about products, but I had to write a review. Seeing how positive all the reviews are, I decided to give it a try, order it sight unseen. I suppose my expectations weren't that high given its price, but I can't justify spending any money on something that's this bad. Essentially, it looks and feels like a $1 shade that you'd get from a gas station or something. I mean, come on people, how could you even consider 5 start for this? The edges are all very rough, and I can't even call those \\"lens\\". It really feels like it's made from recycled plastic bottles at home! Anyway, I hope this review will either encourage Radians to improve their product quality & design, or have potential customers from buying altogether. FYI, when I got curious and did some research on the company, it looks as though it's a generic OEM that markets under different brands. Again, I'm surprised other brands decided to associate with this manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"ok","review":"These aren't my favorite but they fit right for anybody, and are very adjustable. I just don't like the red though it is much harder to see in. So... don't get the red."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy!","review":"Several things about these glasses stand out, but the price for what you get is the real reason I bought them. They are comfortable to wear, and the lenses don't distort your vision. The only draw-back is not having a protective pouch to carry them, but a small Crown Royal bag someone gave me works perfectly for that -- just don't mix alcohol and firearms!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shooting glasses","review":"I gave these glasses 4 stars because they leave about a 1/2\\" gap in the center top while the lower lens is up on my cheek bones. Also seem as though they would fit better on a narrower face. Good lens though. Does not fog easily and should be interchangable to other color lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understanding philosophy","review":"The main aim of the author is to introduce philosophy to the reader by simply showing him/her that philosophy is really just what a person \\"thinks\\" about something. He then talks about different issues and states what different philosophers \\"think\\" about these issues. I think this is a very effective way of introducing philosophy to those that have not studied it. However, the title of the book is misleading because it is very hard to introduce Kant's ideas (for example) in a simple way. This is not due to some fault of the writer, but because of the fact that some philosophers thought of things in a very complicated way. I didnt give it five stars because there are a number of important philosophers that the author never mentions. Maybe he was trying to keep it as brief as possible, but an extra thirty pages wouldnt have done any harm!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful survey of Philosophy","review":"I am reading Philosophy Made Simple for a discussion class on the basics of philosophy. The book covers the fundamentals of philosophy over the centuries in simple straight-forward language. It is easy to understand. Although it covers most all the big names in philosophy, occasionally some fairly important people are not mentioned. It is not comprehensive. It does have a nice breezy (but not condescending) tone. I will keep it for my library."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good read but not at all simple","review":"as always, fast shipping and good condition for a used book. the content of the book it self is very informative but you should read something on a more introductory level first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great information, poor layout","review":"I bought this for my school's debate team and while it is covers a lot of information, it is hard to find specific philosophies. It covers a wide range of ideas, both major and minor. It's definitely a good read for someone beginning to delve into philosophical ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Humpf?","review":"Only 46 min playing time? Some songs sound like Kings X, the rest somewhat mixed bag. This one I like less than \\"When Pus Comes to Shove\\". It feels a bit like a forced construction. Put together in a hurry. Parts of it are great, but other parts seem uninspired to me. Well, all in all, it is not bad. Still strong above average. But somehow I have the feeling, it would have been better, they worked a year longer on it providing another 70+ min masterpiece with no flaws. They are able to do it, but this one missed it. Well, musical taste may differ. Sometimes I even don't trust my own musical taste. So I recommend you still check it out. There are chances, that you like it, because, as I said, it is not bad at all. I just missed my personal expectations. And I sure will give the next Platypus a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck, wtf?","review":"here it is plain and simple: [bad] songs, [bad] singing, YET, 2 awesome instrumentals... synopsis: waste of money. get the 2 instrumentals from a friend... i sold my copy within a week, peace..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting and moody record","review":"This recording exploits the talents of this \\"jam band\\". I found Ice Cycles very enjoyable and interesting in that the album takes many turns and will leave you wondering what next!?!? There are great songs, good songs, and so-so songs but the musicianship is always there and is a definite buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deep Freeze","review":"Ice Cycles is a lumbering behemoth rarely breaking stride, slogging it's way without direction. Platypus is best when they forego the vocals, only then does the band stretch their musical legs and pick up the pace. Lyrically this album walks the same path brethern Dream Theater has taken, choosing the gothic-anguish-pain-saddness motif, which only adds to heavy footed feel of this CD. The musicianship of the band gave way for a pop-buzz metal feel. These guys are capable of much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark.","review":"Without a doubt, Dream Theater are the biggest giant overshadowing this side-project, which also includes members of the Dixie Dregs, Winger, and King's X. For listeners of Dream Theater, Platypus appeals to fans of Myung and Sherinian most. It will probably prove to be a good record to listen to when you want to hear something that contains grade-A musicianship but isn't necessarily spazzing out the way bands like Dream Theater often do in terms of time, signatures, etc. If you're in the mood for straight-ahead rock and roll with rock-solid performing, this is the band for you. The lyrics tend to focus on a rocky relationship Ty Tabor had recently been in, so it'll appeal to your melancholy moods as well. I particularly enjoy Rod's drumming on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than first disc","review":"I should've gotten this along time ago. Well better late than never. This disc is much better than \\"Pus Comes To Shove\\". \\"Oh God\\" is a really great track heavier and darker than anything on the first disc. \\"Cry\\" is another great song Ty Tabor's vocals are excellent. I'd have to say my favorite tracks has to be tracks have to be \\"Better Left Unsaid\\" and \\"Partial To The Bean\\". It's an epic yet it's not overblown. Do yourself a favor and pick this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this product!","review":"If you are seriously interested in finding relief for your chronic constipation DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Basically, this is a pamphlet from the late 1800's with the most ridiculous, outdated advice on how to \\"cure\\" constipation. I threw this pamphlet away by the end of day two. Why I kept it that long I don't know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough compilation","review":"From 1977-1980, Chic was undoubtedly one of the hottest acts in music. Lumped somewhat unfairly into the disco category, Chic's influence grew far beyond disco into pop, rock, modern dance music and of course, hip-hop.This two-disc collection covers their peak period as well as their post-1980 period.Disc One is obviously the attraction here since it features all of Chic's biggest hits including \\"I Want Your Love\\", \\"Good Times\\" and \\"Le Freak\\" as well as the much-sampled \\"Chic Cheer\\".Disc Two may be of less interest since it covers Chic's post-disco material, but at least featuring these songs does make this a definitive collection of Chic's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I went to the local record store looking for a Cut Copy album, and this was all they had! At first, I was upset because I wanted \\"In Ghost Colors\\", and this place didnt have it. I purchased this, and I was not disappointed in the least. If you like 80's influenced synth dance music, then this is for you! It is an amazing compilation.It hasnt left my cd player in about a year. EVERY SONG IS GOOD! I highly recommend this to any electro fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Makita portable saw","review":"I have a Makita 2708 portable table saw mounted in a Rousseau Porta-Mak table (I don't have a shop, and don't have room for a regular table saw). Based on the description and the reviews here, this looked like a great addition to my setup. But despite the description saying this will work for ANY saw (even says so in big print on the box), the fact is that it won't work for mine. Apparently the Makita portable uses a non-standard miter gauge that's smaller than the minimum on the Incra.If you have a similar saw, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incra MiterExpress","review":"This is good for making angle cuts on wide pieces.

From the haunting piano of 'Rumours about Angels' to the deeply infectious electronic grooves of 'Chemicals' and 'Butterfly:Dance!', there is not one song on this album which is out of place or in any way a filler. Without a doubt, this was the unexpected 'Album of 2000', blowing Marilyn Manson's latest effort, good as it was, clear out of the water. It didn't leave my CD player for weeks. Their recent tour helped raise their profile massivley, and one can only hope that they continue to play outside of their native Germany again in the near future, as they are quite clearly onto something here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark and Beautyful","review":"This is definately one of my favorite albums.Take the darkwave feeling from the music of 'The Sisters of Mercy' and mix it with the beautyful keybord based soundscapes of 'Depeche Mode' then add the brilliant lyrics and vocal work of Adrian Hates, and you'll have a masterpeice-album like 'One of 18 Angels'. Around 70 minuttes accompanied with catching melodies and mind-challenging dark poetry is what you get when you feed this one into the CD-player."},{"rating":"1","title":"IS THERE LIFE AFTER CASH MONEY?","review":"FIRST OF ALL THIS IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO B.G.'S BEST WORK, COMPARED TO HIS OLDER STUFF, OR EVEN LIFE AFTER CASH MONEY, THIS ALBUM IS GARBAGE, AND THAT IS WHY IT DID NOT GO PLATINUM, AND DISSIN LIL WAYNE AND BABY, COME ON, THEY ARE THE U.P.T.

B.G. is by far the only gangsta rapper that is actually gangsta.

This album is a classic for all fans of gangsta rap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"This Album is definitely nicely put together, but theres a couple of things I have to point out. First, the beat sounds different in Cash Money, and it is definitely not bad. Second, Turk and Juvenile are not in this, and he revolves around his new Chopper City records crew, and eventhough BG's Gangsta style is good, it gets repetitive after 47 songs. Third,it is very hard 2 do a double album, so that cuts down the quality on some songs, 4 example \\"Keepin It Gangsta\\" its production is nowhere near CASH MONEY production,it sounds like it is produced in a basement, but don't get me wrong, it is a great album and definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"B.G.

Ive always liked the Cash Money Millionaires and this CD doesn't even compare to any of theirs. Babys Birdmand CD and Lil Wayne 500 Degreez CD is way better than this. Ill admit there is a few good songs on the 2 disc set like \\"hottest of the hot\\" but not enough to make a good CD. He just keeps on repeating the same things it seems like and gets very old. The first song where he is dogging on Baby, Lil Wayne, and Mannie Fresh is stupid because the funny thing is there all richer than he'll ever be so he shouldn't be dogging on someone he can't even come close to comparing to.Not worth the money at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah, he's back...","review":"Without a doubt, BG's back and producing good music.

I like six cuts on this title Keep It Gangsta, Real ***** Real *******,Shoot 'Em Up Bang Bang, Hottest Of The Hot, The Second Line, and Reality Check. With the right beats BG can be the Number #1 Stunner. He has the god given talent to make gangsta rap rhymes into stories of his own life. He's still bout his cashmoney.

Decent features and price....but definitely not worth the trouble when you can get a SanDisk for an extra 30 dollars.

In the book \\"Skippy...In the Doghouse,\\" Judy introduces Skippy's character by showing him writing on the walls and disrespecting his mother by saying \\"you're not the boss of me.\\" Throughout the book, she brings Hispanic stereotypes to life. It's disgusting and underscores how so many children are learning how to discriminate in early childhood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Copy of the original Skippyjon Jones","review":"My family loved the original Skippyjon Jones book so much that of course we tried this sequel... but found that it was practically a page-for-page copy of the original. I guess when you've found a formula that works, you try to duplicate it to achieve the same success, but I think it's shameful to publish a follow-up with so little imagination or heart.

Even at the end the Skippyjon is still being defiant and is never once remorseful for his actions.

I have never been proven so wrong in my life. I received this album as a gift and I like it much better than all the cds that I asked for. They are a one of a kind band in a league of their own. Evey one of these songs are outstanding and catchy, but I've never heard another band like these guys. My favorite songs are Ladies and Gentleman, You Owe Me An IOU, Jingle Jangle & Pickin' It Up but thats just my opinion any of these songs could be considered the best.. they are all that good. I definately don't think this band is for everybody but they are for me and if you like light music that you can sing along to, then this is for you as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot stuff, yeah!","review":"This is one great recording.

Much like the Killers & The Strokes (clear inspirations), their blend of garage rock & pop hooks is infectious. Their talent is undeniable, and their latest picks up where Make up the Breakdown left off. However, this time around they have really stepped their game up. \\"Goodnight, Goodnight\\" would be comfortable alongside \\"Bandages\\" or \\"No Not Now\\". I was expecting the album to falter twards the end, but I was pleasently surprised to see that they were able to maintain the pace that \\"Ladies & Gentleman\\", \\"You Owe Me an IOU\\" & \\"Running out of Time\\" set at the beginning. The album title is a clear indication that this band is on the way up, and while they may get stopped at every other level as long as they stare clear of the ground floor I have no complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Hot Heat is pretty Hot with this CD!","review":"Well, as most of you know by now, there are two great music videos out on this CD. That is how I came to find Hot Hot Heat--I missed them the first time around. I can see that people are saying it \\"got stuck in my head\\" but some of y'all are saying it is because they were bad or bland or blah blah blah. I must disagree. This CD is literally pumping.-Goodnight GoodnightThis song has this really cool beat in the back ground. The drums hit on the every other beat during the verses. So while the singing is going on (which is very pumpy with an interesting beat it's self) it adds a nice twist.But considering I now am running out of time, I'll just say. These songs are absolutely wonderful. It has the niceness of a poppy voice but with rock in it. And when the keys are in the music, it is always a nice Easter Egg. This CD is absolutely excellent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really I can't understand why these guys are popular","review":"Not to make anyone upset, but truthfully I can't stand these guys' music.

Stop and actually listen to them, they stink."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Step Backwards","review":"I've listened to this cd several times since I purchased it, wanting to give it a fair chance, but I'm just so disappointed.Make Up the Breakdown was phenomenal.Elevator is just bland. It seems so \\"polished\\" and it's lost everything that made MUTB such a great album. Elevator is very \\"bubblegummy\\" and seems to be geared towards 15-year-old girls. I guess if you're a 15 year-old-girl, you'll like it, but as an almost 30 year-old male, I was looking for something more rough around the edges. Elevator is too teen-pop for me.No, I didn't want Hot Hot Heat to make the same album, but I didn't want them to go all soft and sell-out either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Restrained and overproduced","review":"You can call me grumpy or intractable, but the fact remains: very little of what made HHH's last CD, \\"Make Up the Breakdown,\\" so toe-tappingly memorable is here. Most notably missing is the keyboard flourishes and incredible rhythm section, especially that popping bass, that made uptight white kids like me just want to bust out and dance. The Heat are restrained here, and whether by choice or by producer we'll never know, but it's a shame either way."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOT HOT SONGZZZZZ","review":"OK, so i don't really remember what songs were on this cd, i purchased 3 hot hot heat cd's off here at the same time, but they were all good."},{"rating":"2","title":"COLLECTION OF HITS","review":"This album is one of my top 10 albums of all time (and i listen music a LOT). I realized it even more how great this album is after listening to their latest release \\"Happiness LTD\\" , this one is WAY better. It doesnt have the identity crisis the later album has (oh emo is the trend, why dont we write emo lyrics too and make some ballads?!?!) no no no, if i wanted to get emotional and listen to some deep, effective, slow music id listen to Coldplay, Elliot Smith, or Bright Eyes, not HOT HOT HEAT.They are great at doing fun, upbeat songs and they should go on that.As for this album, it is one of the VERY RARE albums that i dont skip a single track. Theyre all AMAZING, from start to finish. With the first track \\"Running Out Of Time\\" youll start dancing and you wont sit until \\"Elevator\\" where things go a little slower, (but its still an amazing track)So if you like fun upbeat, FEEL GOOD music, go BUY THIS ALBUM!!!If you like Fratellis, Ok Go, youll most likely like this band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music - lame story plot","review":"I LOVED this as a kid, and since I still enjoy things from my childhood, I ordered it.My kids love it (3 1/2 yrs and 5 yrs), but now that I'm an adult I think the story is a bit lame... but it is a well done lame story. ;-) We listen to it often here.

His life-long journey begins when he moves to the beautiful countryside of Yorkshire England to work for Dr. Farnon. Dr Farnon is a respected veterinarian in the area and becomes James' mentor. James learns very quickly that there are many ups and downs in his vocation. Angry farmers, stubborn animals, and 3:30 house calls are just the start of his fun. His compassion is very evident in this book. He is a great role model for anyone. I was interested in reading this book because I am pursuing a goal to be a veterinarian myself. This book gives me very useful insight on how I could live my own life. I would recommend All Creatures Great and Small to anyone interested in reading a heartwarming story about animals."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've read and re-read this book","review":"I first read this book when I was in elementary school, and that launched me into the wonderful world of James Herriot.The reason I love this (and the other books in the series) is because the author creates a wonderful picture of the beauty of life in the Yorkshire Dales. I love his writing style! Every character in his book is interesting or amusing, including his own character. Even the animals have very interesting personalities.Unless you are terribly squeamish (because there is some vivid detail about veterinary procedures), I highly recommend that you read this book. I think it would be a very enjoyable read for almost anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Creatures Great and Small","review":"James Herriot wrote these amazing books and still today, they ring true with joyous warmth, humor, and sadness.

It is well-made, and is unique in its ability to render the sky picture at different latitudes, including the southern hemisphere. Included with the StellarScope is a small flashlight which is needed to illuminate the star reticle when the device is used outdoors at night. I think a conventional planisphere is a better choice for most users because the sky picture is larger and is better suited to use by a student and their teacher.StellarScopes and planispheres are not really toys in that they have no play value. However, they definitely are useful aids to learning to recognize important features of the night sky as it changes throughout the year, and are suitable for beginning observers at any age. Some clever teachers have their students make their own simple planispheres with custom features emphasizing different aspects of the night sky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stellerscope","review":"Its nothing like a telescope...

The transition was based on social pressures, not scientific superiority. This book is a well footnoted historical account of the problems and costs of the transition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Thriller from the master of horror.","review":"One viewing of Argentos first film and you can tell he was destined to become one of the greatest horror directors who ever lived. Getting his first job directing from his father (who was a big time producer at the time), The Bird with the Crystal Plumage uses all the great techniques that made his later films so great. The Dream-like cinematography, the use of bright colors and lighting, and of course the stylistic death sequences. Where Bird really shines though is the writing. Considering Argento was a writer before he became a director this is no surprise. It's obvious that Argento took more than a couple cues from Hitchcock, but he takes a lot of Hitchcocks techniques and makes them his own with a more stylistic, dark, and violent tone. Bird is not Argentos best film but essential viewing for any die-hard Argentophiles like myself. BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stylish Horror","review":"Often reviews describe the Bird with the Crystal Plumage as Dario Argento developing his style. In fact, it is a classic of the horror genre and an obvious influence on John Carpenter. Though somewhat closer to suspense than horror the cinematography of the scenes with the killer attacking with a knife are jolting and shocking and with the (for the times) explicit scenes restored you have a classic film right there. Later films by Argento would be mired down in style over substance. The Bird with the Crystal Plumage, although obviously influenced by Hitchcock was taking Mario Bava to a new level and a blue print for the European horror film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stylish and surprising thriller","review":"Mr. Stylish Himself Dario Argento debuted with this eerie and edgy little thriller/mystery about a writer living in Rome who witnesses an attempted murder in an art gallery while walking home one night. With the feeling that he is missing something in the scene he begins his own investigation, parts of which are a painting made before the first murder depicting a man in a black rain coat murdering a young woman, an eccentric old artist, a stuttering, lovable man who swears he isn't a pimp, and a clicking sound recording during one of the killer's threatening phone calls to him. Everything wraps up to a very good and very surprising ending. Has good photography and music, as well as a talented cast of lesser known European actors."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Completists Only","review":"This Argento mystery isn't bad but I enjoyed SUSPIRIA and TENEBRE much more (they were more colorful, gorier and crazier!). Much of what Argento became famous for is found here, his first directorial effort: characters who say and do bizarre things inappropriate to their circumstances (the day after Suzy Kendall is attacked in their apartment, she and her lover are there going about their business with the door unlocked!), a convoluted mystery, good-looking women victims. All that is missing is the intense, colorful gore. Finally, let's not leave out the unintentional hilarity of the detective bringing along the writer on the investigations!"},{"rating":"1","title":"plain out [bad]","review":"I wish I would have listened to my inuition about older films like this: they're never as good as they used to be. I've heard from many old timers that Dario Argento created these really cool suspenseful films that had an oddball twist in the end. Comparisons to the Sixth Sense were often made. Damnit! This movie is SO FAR below the standards of film cinema that have emerged in recent years that I would be [angry] if I had to watch it free on TV!If you're under 30, please do not watch these older films unless to satisfy your curiosity. Hitchcock was great during his time, but watching Psycho bored the hell out of me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Art Gallery Scene Ever","review":"This is one of my favourite films and I can't believe how long I waited before buying it on DVD. I particularly like the use of sound (& silence) in the art gallery scene. The atmosphere of the film is really of the period and the music score by Ennio Morricone is great. The transfer of this NTSC disc is a bit grainy but it's still a lot better quality than my old laserdisc & VHS and the DVD is in original 2.35:1 format enhanced for 16x9 TV. My 4 star rating merely reflects the quality of the transfer and not the content of the movie which is pure Argento and gets a 5!The UK version is apparently still cut (it was completely unobtainable for a period in the UK) so I probably won't bother getting it on Blu-ray as I'm not sure if my machine can play US Blu-rays."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good DVD of Argento's First Film","review":"Having seen Argento's directorial debut many times on laserdisc, video, film screenings and television broadcasts I have to say that it has never, ever looked this good. The colors are no longer washed out but crisp and vibrant and the anamorphic widescreen is clear, rich in detail and free from digital artifacts. Though the film is presented in its uncut glory, a few seconds of the once edited murder scenes are in noticeably poorer shape than the rest of the transfer. It's not very distracting and shouldn't prevent you from getting this otherwise fine disc. Viva Argento!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A brillant debut!!!","review":"I saw this movie after seeing many other films from the master of horror Dario Argento and I was a little scared about this one but surprisingly I found it very interesting for a first picture from a new director. The cold colors, the calculating plot and suspense keep you into a nail bitting tension from the start to the end. The only bad thing from the movie is probably the english traduction but this is very often from foreign motion pictures. It\`s a must for the fans of Dario but also a great thriller for the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply awesome!","review":"I got this toy as a gift for my 2nd son when he was 6 months old.

Presumably some bright spark at the Hammer studios hit upon a cast off script for \\"The Avengers\\" and crudely grafted the undead Count into the role of chief villain. The attempt to hybridise the spy and gothic horror genres is a dismal failure.A low budget, poor special effects, a sound track which is frankly offensive and serves even more effectively than the 1970s decor to render the gothic monster Dracula ridiculous, and some lousy acting combine with the pathetic plot to produce a horror film which is laughably bad, and a sad ending to a series which had in its earlier stages seen some fine cinematic moments.Should any definitive proof of the low standard of this film be required it is enough to reveal that, in the final denouement, Count Dracula is ultimately destroyed by becoming entangled in some shrubbery. A more ludicrous ending could not have been devised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dracula -the Satanic Rites of DULLSVILLE","review":"No wonder Hammer films went out of business cranking out losers like this--a terrible script, stupid plot (Dracula is working on a fiendish plot to destroy the world with a deadly 'virus' called bubonic plague bacillus [note that's a bacteria]) because, I guess, drac is tired of living so he wants to bring the whole world down with him.

He has a host of eeevil helpers, including chained-up vampire babes in the basement! Lots of fanged action! There are also satanic snipers, a mad scientist, motorcycle-riding hitmen, a naked sacrifice, etc.,etc., etc. Not to mention the fact that both Christopher Lee (Drac) and Peter Cushing (Van Helsing) are awesome! Plus, as an added bonus to any / all AB-FAB fans out there, Joanna Lumley (Patsy) plays Van Helsing's beautiful, red-headed granddaughter, Jessica! Now, I got that out of the way to warn folks that this DVD has another title.

Hope this helps someone to NOT buy two copies of the same movie..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the Hammer-Dracula series","review":"Let's see...Dracula is hardley in this movie to start off with, there is very little vampire action, the plot is complete nonsense and features a totaly unnecessary occult sub-plot (which was used purely for the fact that Satanism and the occult was popular during the 60's-70's), and features the weakest ending possible...Yet somehow, this movie IS entertaining and worth getting if you're a hardcore Dracula/Christopher Lee fan, or you find weird/obscure/bad horror movies fun.The good news is, Peter Cushing is in the movie alongside Lee, so that helps, and there are literally dozens of cheap bargan bin issues of this movie on DVD available. I got mine for only $3 and it was in widescreen taboot!

At least in satanic rites you get the wonderful portentious intonements of Peter cushing \\"this evil is more addictive than heroin\\" \\"this plague is more virulent than the black death\\" etc etc, wonderful, especially his explanation of how Earth is destined for an imminent catastrophe \\"where the circles meet\\". Haha, great 70s music, surprisingly good cast and atmospheric direction makes this great fun. So its rubbish, i can think of many hammers that are both awful AND boring... Now thats a real crime.

Low production values, a flimsy plot and, on the whole, horrific acting contrive to make this the WORST candidate imaginable for priority DVD release. Where's the fantastic 'Horror of Dracula'? Languishing still on VHS, that's where.Were it not for the scene where Joanna Lumley (Patsy, of 'Absolutely Fabulous') is menaced by several lingerie-clad Vampire Lesbians of Sodom, this would have been a complete wash.

Dracula gets hold of a viral plague that can wipe out the Earth's population? So, if he unleashes this plague, who's going to be left for him to feed on?Dracula belongs in the 1800's, not the 20th century. Even having Professor Van Helsing in this film does not help matters.

It was time to hang it up for sure.An all-time Hammer turkey to avoid all together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shakes and Jumps","review":"I like the cast and story, but my complaint lies with the picture quality. The first few scenes appear to shake a bit as if the camera wasn't steady. There are also a few jumps in the footage. One second a character is standing in one spot, the next he's moved a little.

The main pole for this hoop comes in three pieces, allowing the middle piece to be removed to lower the hoop considerably.We currently have it setup at eye level for our three year old, but while assembling the hoop I had it set just above my head. That's a pretty good range.The components are pretty basic and it wouldn't work well for older kids who play harder basketball. This should see kids from two years up to probably 11 or 12. Its certainly better for the kids than our Little Tykes hoop that fell apart much more easily. Instead the kids really like this hoop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value and a great starter basketball hoop!","review":"I just received this Huffy 32-inch backboard from Amazon today. The quality is excellent for the price - I feel like I got a great deal. The whole thing is well made, sturdy and looks like it's going to hold up very well. It took me about 15 minutes to put it together. The instructions say to use two people, but I had no problem doing it myself. The instructions were actually very easy to read and understand - another nice surprise. My kids are 5 and 6 years old and this hoop is perfect for them. The height is very easy to adjust, so this should last us for awhile. The only feature that I would have liked to see would be wheels on the bottom for moving it around, but at this price you can't have everything. I ended up using a hand truck to move it in and out of the garage and that worked just fine. In conclusion - don't believe the negative reviews on here - this thing is well made and a bargain to boot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as sturdy as it looks","review":"This was easily put together.

They are merely sketch maps without any location detail--I would have liked to have seen more detailed cartography with, perhaps, landforms included.

In this book, the shell of Oates is still there, but the deeper layers that had kept her stories from tumbling into sick, voyeuristic, violence-porn are glaringly absent. This book fails to explore anything deep or worthwhile and conveys only ugliness and evil. Many of the stories seem to come from some well of hatred toward women that is truly disturbing. In the past, reading Oates' stories was always worth the trip. No longer. Something has changed and not for the better. I would not advise anyone to read these stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, creepy stories and very sinister tales...","review":"This was my 1st experience reading anything written by Joyce Carol Oates and I was extremely disappointed after hearing so many glowing reviews regarding her writing.

As are these stories. A women commits the capital crime of being married to an older wealthy man. In addition, she is often exasperated with the fawning and usually hypocritical \\"service providers\\" with whom she interacts. After Oates exhausts the dictionary heaping scorn on this character--over and over again until the repetition turns the reader numb--Oates has her tortured to death in the back room of a Madison Avenue boutique. Once a provocative and original writer, Oates now writes with the screechy, scolding tone of a bitter crone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful sound quality for a live album!","review":"I have only fairly recently got into Nosferatu.

They have a style and sound all their own, with both Louis and Dominic's vocals being equally good. (Though I prefer Louis slightly because he sounds SO good on the recent one, Wonderland.) This live cd was the last one I bought and I was VERY disappointed. The sound quality is AWFUL and sounds on some tracks like a very bad bootleg. It sounds as if it was all recorded on a cheap old tape recorder in someone's pocket in the audience - and at the back of the room! It's so poor I wouldn't even bother to listen to it again.

I've probably purchased it since then, 5 or 6 times as one way or another I've lost or broken them, but I've always had to have it in my collection.I was sitting around partying the other night and I put it on and was amazed that I still knew every note and could even still play all the harmonica pieces.A true classic that as far as I know nobody ever heard, well that's what I thought until I read the other reviews. I'm glad to see I have better taste than I even knew.Like somebody said, once you hear these versions of many of his most famous songs, you won't be satisfied with any other version.What more can I say? It's just simply great."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing...","review":"Neil Young inspires many thoughts for me. Poet, activist, musician, individual, to name a few. His works over the years have touched many, and this album is no different. Every song on this album is special in its own right, a story in itself. Neil Young has inspired so many people to become musicians or to just pick up a guitar and just hack. He has been a muscial fixture for nearly 30 years, check out this look into what makes him so special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential","review":"Buy this cd and put it in your collection. If you're reading this then you have some sort of interest in Mr Young. If you have none of his work then this is a good a place as any to start. There is a lot of ground covered on this single cd (originally double album). There's a ton of acoustic work and it's great because you can tell the audience has grown up on his music and they're into every note Neil plays.Then there's the electric part. Many of these songs are on his other live releases. And while they are all good this set is the standard by which they should all be measured. Neil lays down the best versions of Cortez the Killer and Powderfinger ever recorded. Crazy Horse (his backing band) finds a groove they would never find again.Simply put: this is the essential live Neil collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it for 'Powderfinger' alone","review":"Frankly, I'd fork out the asking price just for the great version of this song that's found here. Other excellent tracks as well, all delivered in the compelling Young voice - a triumph of honest emotion over technical imperfection."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST LIVE CD\`S","review":"THIS IS NEIL,BOTH SIDES OF HIM AT HIS BEST.WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS HIS HARD ROCK SIDE AND HIS MELLOW SIDE.THIS CD IS TRULY A CLASSIC.NEIL STARTS OUT WITH VERY MELLOW AND ACOUSTIC SONGS SUGAR MOUNTAIN AND STAYS MELLOW UP TO MY MY HEY HEY.THEN HE HITS YOU WITH WHEN YOU DANCE I CAN REALLY LOVE,A CLASSIC.THE CD JAMS THE REST OF THE WAY WITH CRAZY HORSE HAMMERING OUT ONE STRONG SONG AFTER ANOTHER.I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT NEIL AND CRAZY HORSE MAKE FOR THE BEST NEIL CD\`S.IF YOU DON\`T BUY ANOTHER LIVE CD,MAKE THIS IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Directory of Scottish Settlers in North America, 1625 to","review":"I was very disappointed in this book.

Why? Because one of the main characters is Charlie Engle, an arrogant a-hole.

I am going to replace it with a different brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great starter Tablet. Confusing setup.","review":"The setup is confusing. Once you get it going it is fantastic. The pen pressure feature makes it feel like you are actually using pencil & paper. It opens and closes other programs you can choose. Overall it was well worth the sale price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware.","review":"I'll start by saying this tablet is very basic, and if basic is all you need you can't beat the price. Be forewarned, though, the manual included is very ...lackluster & in broken english. Also, good luck with finding a website, manufacturer phone number, or address where you can write to. Don't lose the program disc, or buy one of these that's missing the disc.I can draw with this tablet in Corel 9, but I don't have any of the pressure sensitivity. I think the instructions try to tell me as much since I'm using XP, but it's hard to tell. No sensitivity with Windows Paint, either.

The sentences are clear and concise, so that early readers will be able to follow along. We learn that he showed artistic promise at an early age, and that his parents supported him in his endeavors. Little things that happened to him as a child are described and give us an idea of his early childhood influences.Diego didn't like everything he saw. That's why he helped the poor people fight their war for equality. They were fighting for fair wages and a better life. Diego loved his people more than anything, almost...The thing he loved most was painting.The illustrations are done in bold, vivid colors, and are very reminiscent of Rivera's style."},{"rating":"2","title":"great choice","review":"This book tells the story of Diego Rivera in a simple yet acurate fashion allowing children to follow along.

David does a brilliant job of bringing what he calls \\"emotioneering\\" to the gaming experience, finding literally hundreds of techniques to insure that players find deeper emotional gratification with the game play and the characters they're identifying with. David has great knowledge of games as well as television and movies upon which he draws. It's a great read - I found myself laughing, getting insights, and just having a great time with David's writing style and wit. I recommend this book highly to gamers, designers, writers, and anyone who wants to know more about what makes a great entertainment experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing!!!","review":"This book feels like a big PR piece for the writer who sounds like an egomanic. He does not even seem to understand the whole idea of game play! Some sort of washed up screenwriting teachier trying to apply his ideas to game development. I found this book almost unreadable - the ego and references to his life really get in the way.

I think how they could of done better is to eliminate michelle from the studio and there rememberance. Just straight up tell her not to even sing gospel either. Kelly needs to stop tryin to sound like Beyonce. Regardless she will forever be in Beyonce's shadow. Michelle will be remembered as the ugly non singing one.

Lose My Breath, Through With Love and Girl were the only good songs on the CD. They're very very talented ladies with voices but the music did not reflect that at all.

This album is Beyonce's attempt to get another grammy. It is just plain boring, and repetetive. Kelly's voice is very bland, and I wont say what Michelle sounds like. She is basically trying to sing. Their ghetto image is making me sick. It is very boring. Their lyrics are bad, and soldier's main theme is about beins street.

Unfortunately, I've been hearing that \\"Cater 2 U\\" will be released. Why? Anyway, I'd suggest getting a burned copy of this one. I bought mine on sale. I guess that's a good thing.

Standout tracks: Lose My Breath, Soldier, Cater 2 U, Bad HAbit and Through With Love. I thought the bonus CD was pretty weak as well.....Throwing Survivor with Da Brat and Independent Women PT. 2 on there...come on.....those 2 songs are 3 years old. All in all, a CD that did not make me lose MY breath!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Job","review":"I think Destinys Child did a good job on this album. The only reason I did not give them a 5 was because they couldve had more than 11 songs. I think the problem with most people is that they are concentrating on the mere fact that the CD was made in only 3 weeks, and because their are alot of love songs. If thats the reason you dont like the CD than say so; everyone is not into the love song thing and thats OK. Dont hate on them because they went a little more grown and sexy on everyone. You can truly hear all of their voices and talent and not just only Beyonce's. All of their past albums Kelly and Michelle were just background singers, now things have changed and I think thats great, (even though Michelles voice can get a little annoying. Overall I think they deserve no less than 3 1/2 stars. You have to give credit where credit is due."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their Best","review":"This album has only five songs I like on it ( Free, Lose my breath , Game over(bonus Track) , & Soilder). the beats a terrible. if you do buy this album, buy the album with the bonus tracks, something extra is just what this album needs.

Bad idea. I should have gone to Amazon and listened to the whole album first.The songs are generic R&B; songs and the lyrics in some of them are enough to make me want to throw up. Just listen to \\"T-Shirt.\\" All I could do while listening to this CD was roll my eyes and ask \\"Why?\\"They are amazing women with stellar voices and while I like their slow songs, I wish they would have had more upbeat ones.I hope in a few years they come out with another album that has the sounds I think most of their listeners are looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened ?????????","review":"This CD was a definate OOOKKKAAAYYYYY.

Michelle hardly does any vocals on the CD except for a making an appearance on a few songs and a few runs. I would have expected this CD to be better...especially since they all did their individual thing and then wanted to do the group thing again.

The 1st single that is on over kill on MTV is average at best. This might as well have been Beyonce's 2nd solo album as she is all over this album. And not in a good way, where there were once fun pop songs, have been replaced with really bad dance tracks. This is not a club album, but we can tell they wanted it to be.As for David Ogletree's review of this album, while I dont have a problem with you liking this album. You must be crazy to state that this group has sold over 40million albums worldwide.

It is a VERY nice CD.\\"Lose My Breath\\" \\"Soldier\\" and \\"If\\" are the hottest cuts. In fact, \\"If\\" is the one song that will remind any listener about why DC is so successful. Their individually unique voices blend powerfully and amazingly well, so much that it's chilling. This is a classic DC CD worth having, and I definitely recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Album of 2004","review":"If there's one mainstream album to avoid this year, it's this one. It's quite the stinker. Lose my breath is an average destiny's child single that's neither daring nor memorable. Soldier, the followup single to Lose my breath, is ok. By far the most disappointing work by the group to date. Nice try but Beyonce has officially abandoned the group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 2 good songs, wish I could get my money back!","review":"This CD was a HUGE disappointment, Soldier and Lose My Breath are the only good songs.

But, i let it grow on me and its the only song ony the CD that i like. I don't like the message that Cater 2 U conveys, but i like the rhythm, harmony, and beat. U can tell the Cd was made in 3 weeks. I think the only reason they made this album was to fulfill their promise 2 each other and 2 the fans, not because their hear twas in it. I mean, wut need do they have 2 be 2gether? They're engaged, and Beyonce's solo career is at the top of its game. I'm still fans of the girls, but i think its time to let Destiny's Child go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, after a while...","review":"First it sounds simple and boring, but after a while you realize that it continues to grow.

I was much impressed by their first single because it's the sort of tune to get up and shake your booty with but alas that's where the booty shaking ends. Don't get me wrong, I like slow grooves but when I think of DC I always think of kick-ass upbeat songs which advocates the empowerment of women and letting your hair down to party with your girlfriends and that element which I expected from DC was lacking from this album. So if you like the upbeat DC songs go buy the \\"lose my breath\\" single and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment !!!!!","review":"I am a Destiny's Child fan and I was very disappointed with this CD. I rate it 1 star and that is being nice. The only good songs were the ones played on the radio and Cater 2 U. I must say that this is the reason why people burn and download music illegally on the internet. I expected so much more from these girls. A pure waste of my $12. But I guess that is the music business for you.... artists still get paid even if their music is B.S. Needless to say that I am still a DC fan and I pray that their album will be better next time around. Don't waste your money on this CD. Buyers beware!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Onto Beyonce","review":"They should have let Rodney Jerkins produce most of the tracks...After Lose My Breathe, they lost their breathe...All the other songs are so slow and although some are good, the album doesn't flow...As far as them supposedly maturing? They are all in their low to mid 20's, multimillionaires, with no kids...Lets have some fun girls enough of the sad stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down....","review":"I was really looking forward to this cd and thought it was going to be full of fast paced sounds like their single \\"Loose my breath\\" but after the first two songs which happen to be the two out right now the rest of the cd is not good. They have beats that don't go with the specific songs and there is nothing but slow songs. Plus the lyrics in the songs? I mean why sing about wearing your man's t-shirt and what you will do for him. Plus all of the songs are mostly the hook just being sung over and over again. Just like their last Cd Survivor this cd was not worth it. I expected better from them. If you want to listen to slow songs with beats that are way off and too cartoon like then buy this album. Otherwise you are better off downloading their two main singles and be done with it. The reason they deserved two stars is because they are a great group..they just didn't have it on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serves a Purpose - Four Stars","review":"Most of the songs on this R&B; album are about doomed relationships. Some songs sorrowful and soulful (and sung beautifully with conviction), others upbeat and feisty.\\"Girl\\" is a quality song as is \\"Lose My Breath\\" which were both released as singles. These are just two of the many good songs on this album. It is definately worth buying.A very deep, mature album that reminds me of a wise older sister and her friends telling her broken-hearted little sister how she deserves to be treated by a man.It's very soothing actually but once it's done it's job it can get boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS A TRAIN WRECK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"THIS TRAIN HAS BEEN LEAVING THE TRACK SINCE BEYONCE RELEASED HER FIRST SOLO ALBUM!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go DC!!!","review":"Most people that write bad reviews on Destiny's Child or Beyonce are usually haters.

Whilst my expectations weren't too high anyway, this albumm came as an utter shock to me. Where are the beat grinding tracks? The groovy melodies? Where is destiny's Child?This album seems like an attempt to intentionally lose their fanbase, just so beyonce can guiltlessly pursue her solo aspirations. That, or beyonce just simply wants to keep all the best material for herself. Save your money, cause this just isn't worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"UN ALBUM FEU DE PAILLE!!!!!!","review":"Franchement de tout les albums de destiny child Destiny Fulfilled est le pire. Il y a seulement deux chansons de bonnes sur ce disque dont le premier single lose my breath et soldier.C'est très décevant quand on écoute les autres albums si bien produits et très variés.En bref, il y a deux chansons accrocheuses et le reste est composé de ballades ridicules et qui sonnent faux.POURQUOI CE RETOUR?"},{"rating":"2","title":"clarification","review":"this version of \\"destiny fulfilled\\" is a 2-cd setdisc 101 - lose my breath02 - soldier (feat t.i. & lil wayne)03 - cater 2 u04 - t-shirt05 - is she the reason06 - girl07 - bad habit08 - if09 - free10 - through with love11 - lovedisc 201 - my man02 - 2 step03 - survivor (remix feat. da brat - extended version)04 - what's it gonna be05 - independent women part II"},{"rating":"2","title":"MY FAV DC ALBUM","review":"All I can say is that they went out with a bang. Each song is perfect. The input from each of the band's members makes the album perfect. Their voices together along with beyonce's writing is unstopable. The album has love songs, breakup songs, party songs, friendship encouraging songs\\" so you can listen to it no matter what mood your in. In my opinion, if Beyonce had shared the mic in previous albums, the probably wuld be the top-selling group of all time. Highlights include \\"Lose My Breath\\", \\"Cater 2 U\\", \\"T-Shirt\\", \\"If\\", and \\"Free\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it a minute...","review":"Yes, it took a minute for this CD to grow on me. I listened to the first 2 tracks and half-listened to the rest of the tracks. I gave it another chance and actually listened to the lyrics and actually visited their website where they talked about the behind-the-scenes on the making of the CD... that grabbed my attention.My favorite tracks are: Cater 2 U, Is She the Reason, Free, and Through With Love --- that one is a gospel-type rendition of them leaving the men alone that don't appreciate and focusing on God.I am now a bit more impressed with this CD. I do recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"Their new cd pulls me in almost effortlessly... \\"Survivor\\" and their previous releases didn't have the same effect on me. This album is a keeper! It's got a deeper, confident sound. Some of their songs are absolutely beautiful and even moving, like Cater 2 U, T-shirt, Is she the reason, and Love... A work of art. God bless those girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better off Solo or try again","review":"I was very very dissappointed with this purchase.2nd to last song i really really like especially the end. All three of the girls have capable voices and im not hating on them at all. This album however is in fact a waste of my money. Beyonce must have used all the good songs on dangerously in love, this album was slightly less than mediocore, especially considering the previous DC albums have been top notch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Bullsh*t","review":"I can't even begin to describe how bad this sucks. Why did they even make it?! It was just an excuse for Beyonce to once again take lead in MOST of the songs and sing about her relationship with Jay-Z!! What the hell happened to being indenpendent women?! This CD is not even worth burnin! Keep your money people because it's a complete waste of money, not to mention your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"no thanks","review":"Yeah DC actually got back together. I applaude them for getting back together cause I thought it was over but anyways let me commment on the music. Lose my breath is great hearing it the first time then you actually listen to the words : GROSS!the rest of the songs suck so bad. Soldier is so corny and GirlI don;t even like. Dumb song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Destined to be remembered as an En Vogue Rip Off","review":"I have played this over and over and for the life of me I cannot imagine the record company releasing this piece of [...]. The single \\"Lose My Mind\\" is outstanding (and a bit slutty - but that's always fun) - but the rest of this record is just plain bad. I can't fathom them milking \\"Soldier\\" as a second single (talk about taking advantage). I actually had high hopes for this recording - but no matter how you cut the cake - this one crumbles. The ballads are so boring that you just want to take it off - which I am sure most people are doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like Destiny's garbage..........","review":"Im giving this album 2 stars for \\"Soldier\\",\\"Through with love\\" and \\"Lose my breath\\" the rest of the songs are nothing special at all.......I have been a fan of DC3 since they first came out, I wanna know WHAT HAPPEND!?......They take only 3 weeks to record this album and it shows very much, this is nowhere near as good as their previous albums, and theirs only 1 upbeat song.......Their doing exactly what Beyonce did with her album \\"Dangerously in love\\"..and speaking of her in the background vocals for alot of the songs she's on it and u can only hear her voice, i feel really bad for kelly and michelle........DC3 is releasing all the good singles first so that people will buy the album, well guess what?.....the laugh is gonna be on them cause this album is a joke, and i've lost ALOT of respect for them......"},{"rating":"1","title":"They ain't so Badd","review":"But they ain't so good either. Hmmm, what that smell.... Has Beens maybe? Sorry but all that posing and vocal exercising (some might call it singing) just don't cut it. Beyonce should stick with acting at least she's good and tolerable at that. Kelly can find a new manager and relaunch her ca-rear! Who ever the \\"rent-a-throat\\" third member is better make sure her resume is current."},{"rating":"1","title":"Destiny Fulfilled","review":"I bought this disc after hearing the first single, Lose My Breathe & also hearing that Rodney Jerkins was involved in the project...only to discover that this is the only song he worked on. This album is as unevenly paced/produced as Beyonce's DIL!I feel like I was again bamboozled by the release of strong dance music only to find that the majority of the album is made up of mid-tempo r&b; grooves.I stand by my opinion that the best DC album is The Writings on the Wall - because some of the hottest songwriters & producers of that time worked on the album...Beyonce's songwriting skills are along par with Ashanti - both write simplistic songs but happen to get great beats to go along with them.The only songs that stand out to me are: Lose My Breath, Free, Soldier and Love. The rest makes the album sound like exactly what it is - a rush job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Than Fulfilling","review":"Let me start off by saying that this is NOT a bad album. It's just a little misguided. This album is full of songs that are just \\"ok\\", not bad just \\"ok\\". It feels like they were saving the best for maybe their next album (or maybe Beyonce's next solo record), but songs like the infectious \\"Soldier\\", \\"Lose My Breath\\", and \\"Cater 2 U\\" bring back the classic R&B greatness of Destiny's Child. With constant slow ballads that draw out most of the album, you find yourself craving for more uptempo tracks like the first two songs from the album. The biggest surprise of all is that it is not Kelly or Beyonce (the obvious choice) who shines through the most, but it is in Michelle's raspy, sometimes child-like vocals that bring Destiny's Child to another level. Hardcore fans will eat up this album, the occasional Destiny's Child fan will enjoy most of the album, but if you had no desire in Destiny's Child before, then this album will not curve you on their side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Destiny...DONE","review":"After hearing albums like \\"The Writings on The Wall\\" and \\"Survivor\\" you would think this comeback album is HOT but this is Destiny's Child worst album ever. This album is very short and not worth buying, the only good track on here really is \\"soldier\\". Destiny's Child shows on this CD that this album was REALLY rushed! This CD has nothing similar to anything on any of the ladies other albums or any of their solo albums. Destiny's Child should go solo again and stay that way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm glad","review":"That the group is splitting, its such a joy that they wont be making their infernal music anymore. This album is melodramatic, and mediocre. Buy it if you are really obsessed, but if you are a normal person, dont buy it, you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Destiny Dead","review":"I am listening to Lose My Breath right now. it is pretty much just a slut-off, and it's about them telling off stupid teens, but the video is three sets of Beyonce,Kelly,and Michelle in a dance fight with two sets in street clothes and purple suits until the real girls in mink and bras show up and whoop there butts. and the other girls do a cool rotine and blow there breath while the other sa \\"you have no bissness in this Blah Blah you are dissmissed\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Slightly lacking...","review":"... but just slightly.

I'LL ADMIT ITS A COUPLE OF SONGS O\\\\ON THE CD THAT I LIKE, BUT THATS IT"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star for one decent song","review":"Lose my breath is a pretty good song but gets old after hearing it a lot. The rest of the c.d. sucks. I can't stand how Beyonce takes over every single song. Every song sounds the same, and there's nothing good to dance to. I hope they never come out with another c.d. in the future. Don't waste your money on this piece of crap c.d. I'd say just burn the decent songs onto a c.d. but that will probably not even get listened to much either. I would say save your money and buy Gwen Stefani's new c.d. next week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Away Please!!!","review":"This is why the music industry is suffering poor sales and fewer listeners. When will this pop trash cease?! Destiny's child time has come and gone as the \\"real listening\\" publice years for true artist who understand the structure of music and truly have voices with experience in instrumentation. These girls are concocted mainstream junk. This album is for people aged 5-19 and mostly females. When will the real artist gets signed again. If you really love music, skip this and don't listen to it on radio either."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Wonder The Broke Up","review":"On this CD, Destiny's Child shows that they no longer have the \\"it\\" factor. Mid-tempo song after Mid-tempo song shows that they feel they need to slow down their sound to seem more mature. Lose My Breath is basically the only good song on the CD. Destiny's Child used to sing songs with a \\"I am woman hear me roar\\" theme but now their songs are more submissive \\"let me serve you\\" type songs. What happened!? it makes no sense to me. I just hope the they have more luck apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same DC we once knew...","review":"This CD just doesn't have the same flare as the others. You can tell they are growing up and so are their tones and lyrics. The whole CD sounds like it was taped in a few hours or separate sessions and they just put the mess together. But each member is in a new place in their life that it really shows in the songs and lack of cohesiveness. Its a shame that its easy to dislike more songs than like them. I hope this is their last CD... for their sake."},{"rating":"1","title":"it sucked","review":"this is not a good cd it could be a lot gooder then what it is and michelle has to go she is not good at all she sucks and hope that all of u that c this thinks so as well she just do not fit in wit beyonce& kelly so put home girl out ok and why do she saing so much on this album? the only songs i like a lot is t-shirt and is she the reason and soldier is ok but the 1 on the radeio is the good one the 1 on the cd is to long and girl is ok and love thats it dont buy this cd it will put u to sleep it just not good"},{"rating":"2","title":"*...Baby Boy, make me lose my breath....*","review":"Yo I love da song Lose My Breath they played it at this club and during dat song I got a dub from this mad hott girl... but enough bout that. I really dont know alot about the rest of the album, i never heard it, but lose my breath is really good,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Letoya and Letavia u are missed still","review":"This cd was rushed you can definately tell, Kelly's song is one of the better ones lyrically and sound wise, but if, and free are good because I like the vibe. Michelle was made a fool of because she was allowed to sing a smidget more on this album all together she song about two verses and they were the verses that Beyonce felt she might mess up on so she allowed michelle to cackle through them. Michelle stick with gospel because your voice better compliments it and people write according to what you can sing and not what Beyonce can. P.s. sorry about your fall and your unconcerned group members, but you are an hourly worker so the show must go on.The fakeness has to stop because there is no real love there.Letoya's single is great and we finally got the chance to see why beyonce was so intimidated, toya has a nice voice and it make B sound as if she is screaming more.If this is the end for them cool. I still paid for the cd though so i have to listen to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing fulfilled here but disappointment!","review":"I have enjoyed all of DC's other albums and each one has always had tracks on it that the group could have done without (as with most albums) but Destiny Fulfilled is a sad representation of what these ladies can do with their talents. I think anyone who purchases the CD will soon be wondering why they ever took the time to get it. There are a few good tracks such as the radio mega-play \\"Lose My Breath\\" and the slow and very sexy ballad \\"T-shirt\\" but overall Destiny Fulfilled is not going to be listed as anything great for 2004 or 2005. If this album was put together in a rush...it certainly shows! It doesn't come close to the other albums put out by DC over the years and the group may receive some negative feedback from their fans, this is truly NOT even a percentage of their best. I wish I had saved my money and waited for the \\"bootleggers\\" to hop on the net with it....it is not at all worth paying for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fulfilled.........maybe","review":"I've listened to every DC3 cd. This one just seems like they threw it together.I KINDA THOUGHT THEY PUT OUT THIS CD JUST TO SAY THAT THEY WHERE STILL TOGETHER. THAT THE FAME THAT ONE OF THE GROUP MEMBERS WHERE EXPERIENCING,DID NOT CHANGE ANYTHING, BUT IT DID. Almost like they put out the songs that sounded the best on to this cd. There was really no variety.Six of the last songs where all about the pain of relationships, all in a row. I think that thats kinda strange I never seen them do that on any other cd. I thought they could have made some more uplifting songs, or some more club bangers could have made the cd better.The 4 best songs on the cd where: Solider, Lose my Breath, Threw with Love, and Love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks like their destiny has been fulfilled...","review":"...as crap.What happened to their energy and their unique sound?? All the songs on here are all extremely generic R&B; songs. Granted I can see that they wanted to mature their sound a bit or something, but come ON. This is slow...and useless. I could pick up ANY girl R&B; group, and get the same effect as this album.I like Lose My Breath and Through With Love. That's about it. All the other songs are just kind of their, and I just don't get my groove on with any of it.I have to say I'm disappointed. It leaves me wondering if Beyonce killed the group's sound with her solo CD, because THAT sounded just like Destiny's Child. Makes sense though, since Beyonce's father is their manager. Go figure.I wouldn't buy this. I don't like it. It unfulfilling, and generic smokescreen.Ah well, what can you do. *shrugs*"},{"rating":"1","title":"whats the point?","review":"Destiny's Child isn't singing because they have passion for it, it seems like they just have the passion for money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed at the least!!!","review":"This is my first time buying a Destiny's child album without the original members and I have to say that I am so glad that I did not buy the other one. This has got to be one of the blandest R&B albums of the year. All though for the most part the songs were okay, however the girls voices were frilly, shreiky, and completely out of tune. The only members who sang on note were Beyonce and Kelly. I think I would have liked all the songs had Michelle not had part. Her voice was scratchy and out of tune and when I started to get into the groove of the song her voice would totally ruin it. All in all if your a die hard Destiny's child fan then you will be surely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"destiny fulfilled","review":"I love destinys childs. I have bought all of their albums and been to two of their concerts. I thought this album was very disapointing. The two best songs on the album are the ones they released, \\"soilder\\" and \\"loose my breath\\". This is not the normal destiny childs music. I'm very upset I wasted my money on this album. All they talk about is love and their man. What happened to the independant women who didn't need anybody for anything. Thats why I loved destinys child, because they didn't need anybody but themselves. Now it's a diiferent story. I hope they get their act together because I lost some respect for them from this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD was really bad!","review":"I'm not an avid DC fan, but I liked \\"Soilder\\" so I bought the CD from Target (it was on sale for 9.99). There is one song that I like and that is the last track called \\"Love\\"...the rest of this CD is hot garbage! I'm on Beyonce' overload and I'm tired of hearing constantly taking over the entire song (leading, background vocals, you name it she's there!). Michelle's voice doesn't match the groups, she has this blusey sound to her and it's just not a good fit. The couple songs where Kelly did sing, she sounded really bad to me. I hope this is the last CD by DC, I don't know that I can stand another one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyonce contradicts herself and Destiny's Child is lame","review":"Ok... Beyonce sings about being a very independent woman and being a Survivor but she's singing about have a ghetto thug in Soldier to make her complete and that she will slave over a man in Cater 2 You? She lacks substance in her music and she's contradicts herself. There's a better word for this a Hypocrite. First of all, the Destiny's Child girls are from a upper middle class neighborhood in Texas but they're dressing up as ghetto girls in the Soldier video? And they're singing about that they want a ghetto thug as a boyfriend. No girl wants a ghetto dude as a boyfriend. They mays sell more albums than most girls groups but TLC, the Supremes, and En Vogue and even latin freestyle girl groups from the 1980's like the Cover Girls, Sweet Sensation, Seduction, Expose have more substance in their music and lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"OOOOOMMMMMGGGG!?!?!?!?!","review":"yo dogg i been dey fan b4.....but man dis thang is so dissapointing......and i'm just 14 and i noe dat dis CD is horrible......only song worth hearing is \\"THROUGH WITH LOVE\\".....all da other songs are bad,bad,bad......anotha thing is dat dis CD still sounds like one of Beyonce's CD's 4real.....she always all up on all da tracks .....I'm jus dissapointed and i feel like kelly is veryu conceited now and michelle is bout to be out......and beyonce is such a diva in disquise.....das wat i'm thinkin.....and also i wonder why b is talkin bout through with love den sayin she dangerously in love {HahHum}"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"After Lose My Breath, it's all downhill.

Well...all the others, definitely are pure crap. Beyonce needs to go back to her solo career and Kelly needs to go back to her solo career as well.

That is not the Destiny's Child I fell in love with years ago. What are they doing! Can you say ghetto! And then Cater 2 U, jesus christ what happened to independent women! This cd was pure garbage. I bought the cd and literally skipped every song after soldier. I was like this cannot be good...there's only 11 songs! The ONLY song that redeemed this album was \\"Through With Love\\".

It focused more on all three girls even though Michelle only sings most of the hooks. But I feel that is where she needs to be because her unique and sometimes ackward sounding voice will probably make you change the sound immediately. But all in all I give the cd a 4. I think the first two singles really helped with albim sells. Lose My Breath and Soldier had great videos to go along with them which had a lot of influence on my purchasing of the album. T.I and Lil Wayne did they thang on Soldier.My favorite song on the album though would have to be Through With Love. For the simple message that a women had been through a lot and she finally finds love and acceptace from the one person who will never let her down and that's the man upstairs, GOD.I would recommend you to purchase this cd for the simple fact that Destiny's Child is back and Doing Da Damn Thang."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money. Buy yourself a new copy of Survivor!","review":"Ughhh... yeah I was thrilled when I heard Destiny's Child would be coming out with a new CD... excited when I heard \\"Lose My Breath\\"... enthused when I heard \\"Through With Love\\"... and disappointed as all when I heard the rest. I'm admittedly not an R&B fan, but I loved 2001's Survivor, every track was awesome. Now listening to this is such a let down. These ladies have the best voices in the business and what I thought were good heads on their shoulders. To allow a record to come out looking like a teen pop album with the liner notes denoting who sings what (like you couldn't tell), and songs that sound like they were done on the fly.. I can't find a reason to buy this album! You would be better off buying the tracks you like from Itunes. If this is the last CD of Destiny's Child, and how they'll be remembered (except for Beyonce' of course), they should have just left it after 8 Days of Christmas.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Destiny's Suicide","review":"Destiny's Child was the group we guys loved to hate. With their sassy {men are no good} and {we can take care of our selves} lyrics. But it seems they sold out. Allava sudden the same girls saying they want real men, want thugs instead. Where'd that come from. Beyonce YOU CAN't CATER to me. ...... Not that I mind catering, but that don't even sound right comin from her. Seems like they lost they're fire. Beyonce's album was {2 me} your typical Destiny's Child album. Alotta folk hate Beyonce, but ..... she really does {at least seem to} carry the group. Kelly's album Floped. Now that their image has changed Michelle has lost some of her Christian fanbase too. Beyonce should've never released a solo album.

When I listen to their latest effort, I am deeply saddened. I am saddened by the fact that some artists are so market driven and this LP showcases that mind-set. While \\"Loose My Breathe\\" and \\"Soldier\\" are two outstanding numbers, the rest of the album reminds me of album filler and it's just that. There's nothing here that stands out and makes me loose my breathe. In today's music world there are very few artists that focus on what is felt in their soul. Most of today's artists focus on what is popular at the time. While that is important it is also important to appeal to the souls of the buyer and this Destiny's Child effort falls very short of that. The Destiny has truly not been fullfilled and with this latest effort, I don't think it ever will be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"So, I'm a huge fan of Destiny's Child.

When you first listen to the CD you might not think too highly of it, but once I listened to it again the songs got better and better and I like mostly all of them. In other reviews I have read about it not having many upbeat tracks like Lose My Breath or Solider. There is a reason why they are an R&B group. These slow songs are fantastic and show off a lot of good vocals. I also like the way that the CD shows off the singing talents of all three of these fine women.

In my opinion, I think they are at their best when they sing slow jams. It really showcases their vocal talent. I'm not a big fan of uptempo songs, so this album was very satisfying for me.

I cant listen to it all the way through without getting drowsy. I only like about 3 songs, cater 2 u, If, and looose my breath. If Destiny's child is gonna put out more crap like that they just need to dismember.

I think \\"If\\" has beautiful harmonies, vocals, everthing (except Michelle's part). I'm sorry but Michelle is not bringing anything to the table.

Short Album; I really expected at least a 15 track album.2. Great vocals. They sound magnificent. The songs that really are the best are 'Cater 2 U' and 'Through With Love' but I feel that they made a good decision to release 'Lose My Breath' and 'Soldier' as simultaneous singles because they appeal most to their audience.3. More Variety; the album was very one-sided. I would of like to heard different styles of music other than the slow jams.4. Luring and Unique. Even though the CD is not what everyone expected, I think that the songs are still great. They'll never let us down. Also, the concept of the CD was a brilliant idea.Expectations for next album - I think that the next album should be longer and have more #1 hits.

When I listened to reviews it seemed okay, but when I got home and got to see the words my mouth fell to the floor! I love the beat, and the sound that they have together is wonderful, but all they sing about is how bad they want to get a guy into bed and about how bad a relationship is. I read their \\"thank yous\\" and all of them started with praising God and saying that their talent came from Him. The words to their songs don't match up with what they say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Did They Make This Album?","review":"Destinys Child has a strong point... as a group they can sing the mess out of some booty shaking songs. Unfortunately, they have a weak point... as a group they falter when it comes to the ballads. Unfortunately, \\"Destiny Fullfilled\\" is mostly ballads. And even with its fast numbers, a sparse three that I heard, \\"Loose My Breath\\" is the only one I could come close to stomaching. Maybe this is a sign of maturity, but to me it is also a sign of lack of creativity. R&B ballads are at a point where they are a dime a dozen. Destinys Child does nothing different to make their songs standout or even worthy of purchasing an entire album. In a word, this album was bland. I'm glad a friend let me sample it first before I made the grave mistake of buying it and getting angry with myself for wasting the money. Why did they go this route and why did they even bother making this album? What a major disapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"One the the year's major disapointments. It's all downhill after Lose My Breath; I have barely listened to this CD. This group's best effort was \\"Writing on the Wall\\" (one of the best R&B albums of the past 10 years) and they have yet to match the quality of that effort, which, incidentally, was made by a virtually different group. And related to that point, will somebody please tell me who's idea it was for this Michelle woman to be in the group? How did this happen? Did anyone actually attend her vocal audition? Hopefully this will indeed allow them to fulfill their destiny by being their last album. Can't wait for Beyonce's next solo project."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"This album was definitely different but still a great album. It is very personable and real. If you listen to the lyrics, you can feel what the ladies are coming from and the problems they have gone through (mostly Beyonce) in their relationships.

These ladies have matured and it shows!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Produced","review":"I rather enjoyed this album. The Survivor album was so Pop-laiden that we forgot about the real Destiny's Child. This album is one that shows adulthood and no more lame songs. I like this album because it's realistic. The beats are more relaxed and not so dance clubbish. Good work girls!Urr umm Michelle should only sing with more of an ambience on her voice or maybe not at all. Although, on some songs she sounds very nice but others like \\"Is She the Reason\\"...oh God no, she sounds like she just came back from a wild night of partying and screaming with all the scratchiness in her voice. Beyonce blows me away everytime! She makes the songs what they are literally, seeing as though she did most of the vocal production and arranging also and most of the harmonies and ad-libs! LOL!I say when u have the X-factor, you just have it. Kelly's great but without Bee...there would be no real star power in DC3. Let's just face it!

As I bought and listened to the album, I was surprised that there are 12 tracks in the CD, though it only states 11 tracks at the back side of the CD. Track 12 is entitled \\"Game Over.\\" It's a nice song. My most favorite track here are track# 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, and track #12. Destiny Child had made it again. You'll surely dance almost all of their songs. Also, when you put the CD in your P.C., there are special features (Unlocks the the CD secret), which are: you could see Destiny Child's new video \\"Lose My Breath\\", Footage, and wallpapers for your P.C.

Their has only been one who has made a semi billboard hit. Kelly... The others haven't done much to nothing. Instead of hatin', they should thank Beyonce for carrying them and making them millionaires in the process. Beyonce could and would have blown up with any other 2 or three girls. Believe me, Kelly, and the \\"other one\\", were the smartest ones. They shut up and were thankful for their high paying jobs. After Beyonce went solo, you know they went \\"darn it, there goes the money.\\" They were right. The Kelly and \\"other one\\" want and need Beyonce back, not the other way around.

At first I was like, \\"Only 11 songs!!\\" But then I figured that they put the best 11 they recorded or maybe the only 11 they recorded. Whatever the case may be, this CD is wonderful. I can listen to it from beginning to end. And actually, I'm bored with the singles, \\"Lose My Breath\\" and \\"Soldier\\" Either way, I enjoy all 11 songs. The rest of the album is mostly ballads; however, that's what a real soulful R&B group is about. Not only \\"pop songs\\" but real old-school R&B.

This album is just a bunch of rejects that did not make it onto Beyonce's album(which was trash by the way).

I can understand and respect other people's opinion about this album, but I have my own and I love it!!! I can really relate to this album. It didn't even really show a totally different side to D.C. because if you think about it they had a lot of slow songs on previous albums too...To me this is the best album that the sistah's have made. It has it's couple of fast songs but for the most part there are beautiful, well sung, deep, lovely love songs. If you are inlove or have ever been inlove you need to cop this cd because it's really that good. I play this everyday on my way to work and on my way home, it never leaves my cd player unless my husband is in the car. Overall, great cd, wish they weren't splittin' up but they are right they have fullfilled everything they wanted to so now it's time to go seperate ways, but they went out with a bang.

Those are the words of Jesus himself! Jesus set the conditions! We ALL broke the law, and JESUS paid the fine. Not budda, not muhammad, not the Pope! I am believing in a risen Savior who paid the sins of the whole world! Pastor Hagee, please do not be the cause of sending a false message to people who trust you, and will believe your false doctrine. I would not want to be in your shoes on judgement day! Esther"},{"rating":"1","title":"countdown to complete cognitive malfunction","review":"This is indeed a frightening book. It is frightening that educated people believe the future can be foretold by ancient texts! It is especially frightening that leaders might believe they are simply carrying out God's will by launching wars, and thus fulfilling prophecy. If you read the Bible carefully, choosing every 123rd letter in the odd-numbered books, it spells out:THINK FOR YOURSELF!LOVE ONE ANOTHER!(THAT INCLUDES DO NOT KILL OR SLAUGHTER ONE ANOTHER IN WARS!)CARE FOR CREATION!LEAVE A HEALTHY, BEAUTIFUL PLANET FOR THE SEVENTH GENERATION THAT COMES AFTER YOU!Peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hagee is a heretic","review":"How do you make a career preaching about the end of the world? We've been in the \\"end times\\" since the death of Christ. Hagee has been using fear and emotion to take advantage and brainwash people for such a long time it's crazy, any Christian with an average knowledge of the bible can see that Hagee has indeed made up his own gospel. To all my fellow Christians, stop reading and buying into this end of the world hype, concentrate on your own spiritual growth, and witness to others. Don't be so quick to hate Muslims either."},{"rating":"1","title":"hyperbolic drivel...","review":"facts? not in this book. insight? nope. this book seems like a collection of sermons and passages from other books..not much in the way of foresight or insight. Do we stand at the crossroads of trouble in the Middle East? well yeah..sure can find that out in a hundred different books which are more meaningful and fact filled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very important information1","review":"This is a very good book, with chilling information in it. It has definitely changed the way I look at the nation of Isreal. If you are a Christian, you need to read this book. If you are not, and want a glimpse into the future, then you also will want to read this. My only caveat is, I feel like either it was written in a hurry, or the Author did not use proof-readers. In today's world everyone uses computer spellcheckers, and they don't recognize incorrect words, only misspellings. Case in point, very early in the book there is the word interrupt, when the Author obviously meant interpret. Also a College English 101 teacher would edit the Author when he repeats himself several times, sometimes within sentences of himself. Case in point; the date May 14th, 1948 at 4:32 P.M. is forever etched in my brain, as it is mentioned about 20 times in the text. But these are small complaints, still this book needs to be read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hysterical","review":"I wrote a positive review on this book before finishing the book. I've deleted it and this is an update to say that the book is hysterical and unscriptural. While there is indeed a danger from Iran and while some day, according to our Bible the world as we know it will end, probably by \\"fire\\" of some kind (nuclear or Godly) this book is merely more End Times speculation, which people have been doing since the Bible was written and probably before. No one knows when the world will end. Charts, maps, timelines and premillenium guesses abound. Save your money; this book has no more answers than any other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jerusalem Countdown","review":"The author has written a very compeling book on an appropriate subject about a which all should be concerned. The author has thread his reader through the line from Abraham to the present day and pointed to the significant areas. The subject matter is very appropriate and are developing just as Dr. Hagee and the bible has indicated they would. This book has only one thing that should have been elaborated. That being Ishmael and how he ties into the Muslim religion.

For instance if you were one of those who thought JFK was the anti-Christ because of the JFK assassination and head wound than by all means buy this book! Or if you later translated the anit-Christ headwound as the Gorbachev birth mark than please buy this book! Consider last years \\"end-time\\" hurricanes and the fact that hurricane season officially ended November 30 without a single hurricane in the United States and only five on this little blue planet called earth. During the true return of Christ, Hagee's work will be elimanted with the rest of the foolish propoganda he displays.If you'd like to read an excellent commentary on Revelation, I suggest Craig Koester's \\"Revelation and the End of All Things.\\"Don't waste your time on work that by no means contains scholarship such as Jerusalem Countdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yea, I don't know bout this one","review":"I typically don't write reviews, due to the fact of, books are meant to be read without personal bias going into it, but rather letting the author make his/her case. Regardless if you agree with Hagee or not, the question MUST be asked...who in the HELL uses wikipedia as its primary source for information...Oh, that's right, John Hagee. If you turn to page 245 and read through 256 you will find most of his resources are secondary in nature and not primary. He cites wikipedia some 7 times on page 246. If I could give a no star I would. I have the 2007, \\"Revised and Updated\\" version. As a reader I was greatly offended and disgusted that I spent money on something that is most likely fabricated in nature. FIRST rule of research is FIND the PRIMARY source JOHN!!!!If you still want to read it just go to wikipedia. I'm sure you will eventually stumble across some of what Hagee did too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angry. Cranky. Shallow.","review":"John Hagee has a well-deserved reputation as a man of faith and a servant of God. His reputation and good work certainly shine much brighter than this particular book which seems small, cranky, and a little bit mean.I am certain that the good pastor knows that God is on the throne and well in charge, even of Jerusalem. The middle east is God's timepiece for the world. What is about to occur there has already been foretold and is unfolding before our eyes in these last days. Matthew 5 would admonish us to pray for, bless, and even love the very militant muslims who would unleash destruction on Israel.I read \\"Countdown to Jerusalem\\" for God's word about the end-times, not celebrity quotes from Rush Limbaugh and Cal Thomas. There are many good books about the future of Israel. This is not one of them.I recommend Paul Yongi Cho's \\"Apocolyptic Prophecy\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't understand such Ignorance...","review":"How is it Hagee in the 80's was saying this exact same stuff about the USSR? They were the Beast, Gorbachov was the anti-christ, they would attack israel with nukes, etc.... Pretty amazing. Oh Well, it makes him rich, and his readers have short memories.Glad I didn't buy the Book, borrowed my Moms copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Late(r) Great Planet Earth","review":"These types of writings seem to actually follow in the tradition of prophetic writings. Moreover, they proliferate in times of trouble. People are trying to use some guide to make sense of their situations and their lives. How to understand all of this. Might one recommend instead the excellent book, Misquoting Jesus, authored by a reputed biblical scholar, Bart Ehrman.That the Middle East is a troubled region is nothing new. Much of the material covered in Pastor Hagee's book was covered in Hal Lindsey's work from the 1970s, during the Arab oil embargo. While true believers have been beating the apocalyptic drum for well over 2 thousand years, it can be a distraction from the very real problems we face. Might we not do better to focus on the here and now, in learning how to live together in kindness toward each other?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Da Vinci Code","review":"I have not read this book and probably never will. It is clear enough from the well-reported historical and factual inaccuracies and unsupported conclusions that the book is fiction.Since it is fiction, but is clearly not intended to be entertaining or edifying, it fails as a book. A similar book, clearly labeled as fiction and written for the express purpose of entertainment, is The Da Vinci Code. That book presents a more rewarding experience -- simply because Dan Brown never requires the reader to suspend both disbelief AND the faculty of reason. Nor does he claim for himself or his book some sort of divine guidance to justify the suspension of both disbelief and reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Disappointing","review":"I must admit, I am a little disappointed with this book. I watch John Hagee weekly and his sermons are so dynamic about the ends times that I thought this book would transcend that same information.But this book mainly goes on about the Jewish people and how we should support them. I do not disagree with him, but wished the book had covered more than just this point. He does speak of Iran and the nuclear arsenal they are building, but that is at the first of the book and it gets repetitive.I'll still watch him on TV and hope that he releases a DVD pack of these sermons on the Jerusalem Countdown to Crisis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I purchased this to replace a similar Ace comb that broke in 1/2 after many years of faithful service.

I have a black ACE comb I recently purchased from a grocery store that is of the quality I would expect; so I know good ACE combs still exist. I only ordered this one because I liked the color. I am very disappointed in the quality of this comb. In addition, the cost of shipping was more than the cost of the comb...if I had realized that before placing my order, I would have cancelled this item (this was one item in a two hundred dollar order).On a positive note, the seller was very quick in sending the comb.

I am not in any way a Deco authority, but it would be nice to read (and see) something new about LA. Most photos are a rehash of already printed material and many need additional shots to explain the architecture. For example: the Wiltern Theatre. The interior is 1000% more fantastic than the one exterior photo used. The Wiltern is one of the best examples of theatre deco ever designed.But, for those that have never set foot in LA, this book may suffice their deco urge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peggy Bracken Never Disappoints","review":"I really love anything and everything written by this authoress.

The characters are accurate representations of the various factions that dominated the era. For someone who was just old enough to (16-17) to witness the period, without having as much at stake as those slightly older, this book reveals how much was sacrificed by the Vietnam generation. I keep hoping that someday Tauber will write a sequel which will let us know what happened to Willie, Joanna and the rest after 1970."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great review of growing up in the 60's and 70's.","review":"First of all I must point out that I read this book more than 15 years ago. It was a book that was passed around to so many people that the last time I saw my copy it had rubber bands holding it together. More important was the fact that people of all ages and backgrounds read it and took their own special meaning from the lives portrayed. This is probably the single best fictional historic account of a person coming of age in the 60's and 70's ever found. The characters were all reasoned and presented the joys and frustrations of an era that saw some of the best and worst times of the modern era. If anyone wants to understand where baby-boomers came from, and how they lost their souls, this is the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discontinued","review":"After I purchased this item, about four weeks later, the seller came back and said this item has been discontinued without telling me until after four weeks of waiting, not very good PR as far as I'm concerned.. Dan Hughes"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the 5-star reviews?","review":"I really don't understand the wildly positive reviews for this product unless they are company plants. The audio quality is poor and there are no pauses to be able to repeat. The manual is also poor quality and full of stuff that seems to have no relation to what is happening on the tapes. Finding the matching section in the manual involves paging through numerous pages until you happen to stumble on the part you are looking for. No logical layout to any of it. If you have lots of patience and extra time to waste you could probably get some benefit from these, but there are much better products out there. I was thinking of trying the regular Learning Spanish Like Crazy Courses but now I'm reconsidering after seeing this mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Update of Program","review":"This is a good program but nowhere near as good as FSI Spanish 2. When you buy this, you can download FSI Spanish 3 and 4 for free. That is why I basically purchased this product. This program does provide a good explanation of the subjunctive tense better than FSI Spanish 2 though. But getting FSI Spanish 3 and 4 for free is the real draw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I sent this product back because it arrived very damaged. The CD encasements were broken and most of the CDs were scratched. The CDs looked like burned copies of the program with an FSI Programmatic Spanish label stuck on top. The PDF \\"textbook\\" was hard to follow along with the CDS and overall is an inconvenient replacement for a hard copy of the actual textbook. I also felt that it was overpriced, as I believe level 1 & 2 of the same program is actually available online because it's quite old. I cannot say that the program isn't effective being as I returned it, however I would recommend checking it out online at this website- http://fsi-language-courses.com/Spanish.aspx first to see if it's what you're looking for and to try to get a copy of the actual textbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voodooing it","review":"Voodooism at it's best!

Our beloved Jade 4 U (Nikkie van Lierop) was still the back-up vocals for this album but I have to say Ruth has a set of pipes!!! It's too bad they didn't bring her back for some more albums.

You won't be disappointed!!!! PRAISE THE LORDS!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This album virtually defines the Lords. While their other offerings are very satisfactory, this one takes the fey star. The perfect blend of good technical attributes, hard music, and satire.

When I first heard the LOA, there was no denying that Ruth was spewing out some of the nastiest ideas I'd ever heard, but at the same time, I couldn't lie and say it wasn't good! This CD embodies everything that Tipper Gore tried to silence with the PMRC. That should be reason enough to buy it!The motto of this album is live fast, and if that's too slow, live faster. \\"Blowin' Up Your Mind\\" however, seems to have a bit of a message that spending all your time loaded and high can be unattractive after a while. \\"The Crablouse\\" is gross, but let's face it, the music is great; if you find it too disgusting to listen to the words, then just hear the music. It's awesome club music with some of the most addictive rhythms. Buy it, be shocked for a minute, and then admit you like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not my favorite LOA cd","review":"I really do not like this album. I realize they updated their sound from the Lust album with its early big beat, acid house grooves: but the vocal on this album are way too screechy for my taste.

Maybe they were trying to expand their horizons. There isn't a single track worth dancing to (Lust had many,and Our Little Secret had a few). Half of the album sounds inappropriately ecclectic. Jade adopts and accent somewhere between Counseler Troy from Star Trek and Bjork. The obscenity the band is known for seems forced and gratutious, and not the least bit rebellious. If you want to hear the group at its best, go with Lust, Our Little Secret, or Heaven is an Orgasm."},{"rating":"2","title":"More, please.","review":"This is for people who are going to hell and loving the trip.

With it's total distortion of \\"Pop goes the weasal\\". \\"Crablouse\\", the single that I (very) occasionaly heard on the radio, is a very playful look at sex (and STD's) in the 90's.

Every single copy of this TPB I've ever looked at has a few pages that are out of sequence. There's also a missing moment that was likely removed because the backstory involved was not included in this collection.Fortunately, all the issues reprinted in \\"Child's Play\\" have also been reprinted in the new \\"Daredevil Visionaries: Frank Miller\\" trade paperbacks. The color's better, the pages are in order, the missing panels are restored, and the backstory that caused the omission of these panels- AKA the \\"Death of Elektra\\" issue- is also included.

Yes, Peter Pan is the kid that didn't want to grow, the lost boys and Wendy are there, but there is a constant sense of tragedy in the novel due to Peter need of love and denial of it.The book is masterfully written, borderline with surrealism, and very vivid imagery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plodding, patronizing and ultimately empty work","review":"Robert Oxnam is a member of the Asia Society \\"think tank\\", the Council on Foreign Relations, and high level advisor to government and business elites who shape \\"multilateralist\\" China policy. Not surprisingly, this work of fiction papers over a pivotal period of Chinese history that remains a flashpoint for Chinese people (who know that the history was otherwise), with a globalist revision in which (for example) brutal Manchu conquerors were instantly benevolent and wise(they were not), turncoats are heroes (\\"peace and stability\\" are preferred to liberty and revolution), Jesuit missionaries are ethical (they were not), and Confucianism (his version of it) conquers all.

With other chess books, you get the impression of I went to the tournament, played and here are my notes to the games I won.What struck me about Tal's games is how so many of them were intuitive, i.e., Tal did not analyze to the end but was able to determine that his sac would maintain the initiative and to stop the attack required an immense amount of d calculation, impossible under practical limits.My only complaint with this book is that the binding started coming apart when I got to page 70 and that's inexcusable for a book costing in excess of $23."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic game collection","review":"This is one of my favorite chess books, one of the few I can't do without. The chess is spectacular, of course, but what makes this book a classic is the way Tal's wit and wisdom shine through. He's a funny, engaging writer.Unlike others reviewers, I haven't had any trouble with the binding (knock on wood). I can recommend this book without reservation--just don't expect to undertsand all of Tal's moves on the first--or second, or third--go around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Book","review":"Mikhail Tal's game collection is one of the best books ever written by a world champion, but I cannot recommend this edition and here's why: Cadogan Books always fall apart! Regardless of the size of the book, I cannot get through a Cadogan book without half the pages falling out. The pages started falling out before page 80 of this 496-page book. Tal is probably the best writer of all the world champions, but do you really want to pay twenty-five bucks or so for a book that falls apart while you're reading it and has little or no resale value? Despite all that, if you don't mind reading your books in pieces, by all means buy this book. For you, I give this book 5 stars. Cadogan has several other great chess books and will surely publish more great ones in the future; but I won't be qualified to review them, because I will NEVER buy another Cadogan book again."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT INSTINC BOOK,.... the best book writen for a former champion","review":"Well, the games are owesome, great games selections, you can the see the instic of Mikhail Tal, the brilliant of the tactic combination.Buying this book, you gain a tactic manual and chess culture about one of the most natural skills in chess history.The author, knows the critical position, and show in diagram, you can taste how Tal manoeuvres, crash some position.When i open the book, i was trully disapointed, this book doesn't have pic's, Everychess, is the second time they did this to me.They never insert pic's, in the book, when is about the life of a chess player, is because of that i took one start.

It is the fifth book in the series. In the books between Green Gables and House of Dreams, Anne grows up, quarrels with Gilbert, goes to school, teaches, makes up with Gilbert, and gets engaged. In House of Dreams, Anne and Gilbert finally get married and settle down with a small medical practice in a cove on Prince Edward Island. They meet an interesting old lighthouse keeper with many stories to tell, Anne makes friends with Gilbert's patients and the townspeople, and gets pregnant. This is a marvelous love story, and one of the best of the series. I have been reading and re-reading these books since I was a child. I own the whole set, some in first editions, some in reading copies for friends. If you have read Anne of Green Gables, you will definitely love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book to Treasure","review":"This book is about finally finding your true love and creating a home for him. Anne's House of Dreams is fairly anticlimatic, and does not have quite the same romantic suspense as Anne of the Island. But the reader cannot help but be taken in by the turn of the century seaside setting and the dreamy quality of the narrative. Anne finds happiness with longtime friend and beau Gilbert Blythe. We see the mature Anne as a young married woman who still has adventures. She meets a host of other characters, neighbors who enrich the story. There are stories within stories, spooky nights, misty harbours, and safe shores. I was rooting for Anne as she danced along the seashore, singing to herself, taking up her skirts by the waves. And she makes friends and acquaintances along the way. A pleasant book altogether. It takes you to a place you want to go back."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOO!","review":"I was super excited to read this book, knowing that Anne and Gilbert would finally be married in it.Little did I know that Anne would become totally boring once she got married, that L.M. would completely lose the magic that is anything about Anne, and that the folks in Avonlea would get maybe five brief mentions each in the book. (I exaggerate, but only slightly.)This entire book was about the other characters in their new location. Anne and Gilbert may as well have been minor incidental characters. It'd be like if Jane Austen had done a follow-up to Pride and Prejudice and then took Elizabeth and Darcy almost completely out of it, when THOSE TWO are the ones you want to read about.Extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite ANNE book!!!!!!!","review":"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS BOOK! This is my favorite Anne book, hands and hooves down. I liked hearing about Anne's full transition into womanhood and the fact that she never really let her full spirit be crushed. Gilbert was a little too soppy in this story, but it is okay. And I really, really enjoyed the wedding scene. And the whole Leslie Moore story is so exciting, but sad...until she meets the sexy (by 1900's terms :-p )Owen Ford! And Captain Jim is something else...he is such an enjoyable, lovable character and the story of lost Margaret is slightly cliched (perfect love swept away, man vows never to love anyone else), but WONDERFUL."},{"rating":"2","title":"The very best series in the WORLD","review":"This is the 4th Anne book by L.M Montgomery (5th if you count Before Green Gables by Budge Wilson(which you also really must read)) and Anne is as quirky as ever.

I took it back to get half my money on trade within a week. Ubisoft should be ashamed. The porting to X-BOX is terrible. Honestly, this game is worse than the original GR games (Island Thunder etc.). Slow, clunky, not fun. The online mission mode is limited to two players--and buggy on top of that--music not playing, lagging out, etc. This is from a guy who is a five-star and in the top 100 on both GR2 and GR2-Summit Strike. Both of those games are ten times better the this. Notice that nearly everyone who has played the other games are dissappointed with this one. It might seem okay if you don't know better, but believe me this game is terrible compared with the other GR tiles (and the Rainbow Sixes, at that). Ubisoft should pay me back the $25 I lost on it.

The last time I had this problem was on FarCry Instincts.I do admit that it does get a tad repetative, all I need is an Auto Rifle, Sniper Rifle and I'm good but the story, features, and environments are great. The story really got me involved with \\"why\\" I was there, the partner AI seemed quite competent especially when given orders and lasty the sites and sounds during game play, \\"I can go up there and shoot?!?!?...*chunk*...BOOM!\\", though a little restrictive to where one can go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not as good as the older ones","review":"I was a little too excited when I bought this one for my Xbox.

Not a big deal, but I still would have liked it to be in 3rd person. Unfortunately, there is no prone.....I don't know why that is. Multiplayer is pretty fun, but it can get choopy at points. I think Ubisoft should have fixed this. I would rather have a game held back a month than have a bad laggy game. Overall, I like this game. Weapon selection is great!

There simply is no redeeming factors for this game it's just simply awful and UBISOFT should be ashamed of themselves for screwing over current gen owners with this craptacular game and what's even worse they had the nerve to sell it for 50$, that's just low.

I have truly enjoyed every Ghost Recon up until this one. With hopes of good online gameplay, my friends and I purchased this game only to find out the online gameplay is tedious to initiate and full of bugs to play. Limited number of players is definitely a huge negative for this game for the online play!!Even in the single player campaign mode, the Xbox tends to bog down when the action starts to get intense.Expectations were high for this game, especially with all the advertising that was done.

It is the richest, most musically complex CD. Each song tends to grab you and stay with you. This is opposed to the other CD's where most of the songs are good but forgettable.

I found the film to contain way too much swearing and it really took away from the story line which was not too bad.

That \\"don't give up\\" moral is still just as true today, and somehow even MORE true today than it was when I was so much younger.

Robby Benson played the roll to his best and as an actor never received the recognition he deserved. Tom Skeritt (Top Gun) also stars in this movie and also played his part well.

This constitutes statutory rape, and I don't think that aspect of the movie is a positive influence on an impressionable young girl at all.I mean, this is the kind of movie today that draws all kinds of criticism for it's politically charged content. Imagine that movie coming out today!!Back when I watched it 25 years ago, the statutory rape thing was not an issue like it is today, but it is a very real problem. Because of this, I don't know if I would let my teen daughter watch it.

It's very hard to describe the track, but I'll do my best without spoiling it. She starts out quietly praying and then all of a sudden loud guitars start blaring, the chorus of \\"Like A Prayer\\" is played in reverse, and Madonna's prayer is exposed for what it really is. All I can say is that I was laughing out load for a good 10 minutes after I heard it. It's not dirty, just funny. This track absolutely makes me love Like A Prayer.

Other highlights are \\"Pray For Spanish Eyes\\", \\"Dear Jessie\\", \\"Express Yourself\\" and of course, the awesome title track.I really cannot explain in a mere review how good this album is. If you are a fan of strong, melodic pop, but also need a bit more substance than other artists can deliver, then this is the one for you.

Well, it just plain sucks. It's really bad 80's pop and it sounds outdated. And I love 80's music! I mean her other 80's stuff is a lot better then this crap. I was expecting her duet with Prince to be off the chain(boy was i wrong). It would be great to see them do an uptempo song together. Other then that Express yourself(well the album version is really crappy compared to the version i heard on the radio as a kid). Like a Prayer is ok, the video and concept are great. But the song overall pretty much gets overplayed way too much, even today. (its like mj with thriller,it gets old quick!)It's really not that great of a song.

The Title track is a wonderful song. The video is great too. But there are songs on the album that wern't realesed but are just as magical. Promise To Try is a wonderful ballad talking about how her mother died. It really captures the esscence of how she must have felt growing up without a mother.Oh father is another great song talking about how cruel her father could be while she was growing up. Other songs like Express Yourself, Cherish, Spanish Eyes, and Love Song are really good songs. Whoever thinks that Madonna has no talent is beyond wrong!

Like a Prayer suffered the worst from this because the cover looks blurry and lifeless. I was most excited to get this one since \\"Like A Prayer\\" was the first album I purchased (back in 1989). This reissue also clearly didn't have any patchouli splashed on it.In second place, Like A Virgin doesn't have the same tint as the original cover and is much darker. The image on the back is also no longer flipped upside down but is now right side up which didn't keep with the original album lay-out.With that said, the best looking re-issues happen to be \\"True Blue\\" and \\"Erotica\\" and finally the \\"Madonna\\" album seems to have an improved cover with the brightening of the image."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna's best","review":"This is the best album Madonna ever produced. She basically came out and said, \\"I'm a pervert and you better accept me for it.\\" I'm not sure it was for the best reasons. She made a football field worth of money off of it.

I think that the ability that sets Madonna apart the most is not simply being someone who manipulates media well but in truth two things: One, she's not a big fan of TV or indulging in the media, beign a puppet to it in watching it. Two, Marianne Williamson talks about that people who become legends do so because they tap into the concept of what the human consciousness is available to, needing to develop and that rings within all of us. It is that work that interests the rest of us."},{"rating":"2","title":".......Just another 5 star album by a great talent","review":"I could go on all day about how great Madonna's music is but it would get boring. All of her albums are five stars except for a few (Erotica & Bedtime Stories). Once she got out of her \\"SEX\\" era of the early and mid 90's, Madonna is back to full speed ahead. But an album from already 11 years ago, \\"Like A Prayer\\", stands out high on the list. Every song is great (with the exception of the Prince duet which should have been omitted). \\"Dear Jessie\\", \\"Cherish\\", \\"Spanish Eyes\\" are all classic Madonna. Although she isn't making music like this anymore, her newest stuff, \\"Ray Of Light\\" is also very good and original. But if you want one of best albums of the 80's, get this and you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe Madonna's Best","review":"A lot of people consider this to be Madonna's best album. Not without reason. Like a Prayer and Express Yourself are two of Madonna's best singles. They are also two of the best pop singles and videos of the 1980s. Still, I think Like a Prayer has to share the top spot with her first effort Madonna and the more recent Ray of Light. There are some weak songs on this album. There are also some immature and poorly crafted lyrics. Plus, with songs like Til Death Do Us Part, it's the start of the annoyingly self-concious Madonna."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock on Madonna!!!!!","review":"Madonna has talent!

Her Evita dress, who was Evita again? The good thing is, some people will actually remember her for having crafted a pretty decent album, Like a Prayer.Too bad she decided to change Patrick Leonard for that techno-synth guy Orbit. Or maybe Leonard got tired of working with her. In any case, Like a Prayer is her only real good album -well, True Blue is not too bad either."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD","review":"I am fascinated by our culture's fascination with Madonna, who, after all is said and done, is an okay songwriter and a lousy singer. Still, her explosion and maintenance of her bumpy but always interesting career remains her best talent. This album remains, to this listener's ear, the most consistently listenable; it features wonderful bubblegum pop (Cherish); a Beatles-ish flight of fantasy (Dear Jessie); and some confessional songs that work as commercial songs (Oh Father; Til Death...) Like A Prayer seems one of the more bloated, if cleverly conceived, singles, and most of the album is unexceptional vocally, as usual with Madonna. Still, the record works, mostly, and has endured: if you haven't given it a listen in a long while, as I had not, it remains fresh and inviting today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I ordered","review":"I ordered the wizard of OZ costume thinking it would look like the picture.

Robbie expands your mind, somehow managing to contain his magic on the little round disc without exploding your inner thoughts. The album, composed of 9 improvisational solo piano pieces to melt your mind, hits you with a rush of ebony and ivory intertwined with 10 fingers and a heart of pure soul. The pieces range from light-hearted, lounge riffs, to jazz-blues-classical style licks all interwoven into one. From beginning to end, this album becomes the soundtrack of your life, hitting every aspect of your existence in one tune or another.

I have never had more than 90 minutes of music on the rechargeable battery even after 10 hours of charging. With an alkaline battery it plays fine for up to 6 hours.

In addition, his characters here are immediately endearing, espescially Maud, Magdalena, and Daniel Quinn himself.I'm less coherent than normal having spent the night awake reading this great story in lieu of sleep, but for anyone interested in, well, good storytelling set with a historically accurate backdrop of Albany and canal-town New York as a whole,Quinn's Book recommends itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Notch","review":"Finally, someone got it right.

Herein lies the major problem with the book: the \\"Novell Administrator for Windows NT\\" is no longer available. It seems that after speaking with a Novell salesperson that the replacement is \\"NDS Corporate Edition\\", which is certainly NOT free.

The ribbed aluminum shell is too wide and the flimsy grill over the radiator is held by tiny watch screws that come off and strip in the process.It is made most likely to fit one particular case and not others at all.The ignorance is evident when comes to SATA connectors. The ledge around the terminal is in conflict with the SATA DATA connector next to it on the peripheral device such as CDROM or Hard drive. It has to be ground or shaved off.

The vocal quartet consists of English stalwarts doing a bored job on a Sunday in St. Paul's Cathedral. At times the choral singing gets a bit pugnacious, although it mostly coasts along. I would avoid this one, even at bargain price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speaking with the Angel","review":"I wanted to be one of the first in America to get this cd. I got my copy today and wanted to be the first to write a review. I've waited six months for this cd. I made a special 600 mile roundtrip to Portland to see Mary Black and hear her new songs. This may be her best yet. Specifically, Turning Away is one of the best songs from one of the best female voices in the world. Besides that, it actually has lyrics which mean something; a rare commodity in today's music. But, for those of us who know Mary Black's music, good lyrics are nothing new or unusual. And the title cut has a special meaning for those who have heard her sing it in concert after she tells the story of the inspiration for the song. Be one of the first in America to buy this fabulous female's latest cd. Although the price is obvously a little higher now than it will be later, it's worth every penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland!","review":"I picked this cd up while visiting Ireland with the expectation that it would be the type of album that I'd want to hear repeatedly. Instead it contains mostly very bland songs with very average instrumental arrangements. A disappointment coming from such a talented singer with such a marvelous voice. I believe that Ms. Black needs better material that is better suited to her capabilites. I will certainly think twice before I purchase another Mary Black cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"More like Mary's work on No Frontiers, et. al.","review":"Although Declan Sinnott isn't on this CD, Mary's songs on this one are more like her previous work on \\"by the time it gets dark\\" and \\"No Frontiers\\". The beauty and strength of her voice comes through without getting overpowered by the instruments backing her up. Not worth 5 stars, but certainly a worthy effort for the die-hard Mary Black fan (me included)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Virtually Unlistenable","review":"The U.S. release of this CD has been delayed numerous times over the past six months, obviously not for re-mixing because the result is virtually unlistenable. One of the best aspects of Mary Black's past efforts has been the seamless cohesion of her outstanding voice with her band. \\"Adam at the Window,\\" \\"Past the Point of Rescue\\" and \\"Might as Well Be a Slave\\" are great examples. This CD, however, sounds like it was recorded off a kareoke machine. I would have thought that a Mary Black recording of the truly beautiful \\"Fall at Your Feet\\" would be something to look forward to, but this CD sent me diving back to the original Crowded House version to wash that sound out of my ears. Likewise for the title track. \\"Message of Love\\" is truly grating, and \\"Big Trip To Portland\\" sounds like a Kathy Mattea discard. Mary, I love you, but you can do better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Connection","review":"As a big fan of Mary Black's earlier traditional work, and this CD being hyped as such, I bought this CD with much anticipation. Unfortunately, after giving it several \\"chances\\" I donated it to my local libary. If ever a beautiful voice was wasted on mediocrity, this is it. The best song on here is remake of \\"Fields of Gold\\" which takes absolutely nothing away from Sting's original version. \\"Big Train to Portland\\" is embarassingly bad as is the irritatingly sappy \\"Don't Say Okay.\\"It is pretty unusual for me not to like even one song on a CD by one of my favorite singers and I actually can't remember that ever having happened to me before.

So, when I saw that she was releasing a new CD, I was thrilled. I couldn't wait to rip it open and pop it in. What a disappointment! I thought that Mary's voice sounded as if she were recovering from throat surgery or trauma. I am used to her voice being strong and vibrant, but this collection sees a definite movement away from that. If her records continue in this trend, I will be a fan of her earlier work only.Also, I was very disappointed that her band had also abandoned their traditional sounds. I feel I am being generous by rating this record 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must be getting younger...","review":"Mary Black has had my heart in my throat many times before - she's a beautiful passionate singer and some of her earlier CD's are high on my Desert island discs list but this....this is elevator music. Mary, the songs and the band just don't gell and occasionally (the wince-inducing Cut by Wire is a good example - Lord Franklin must be rotating violently in his tomb) miss by a mile. Before I heard this I would have said that Mary was 100% conviction if you needed a handy definition; now that I've heard this suburban sampler for the Keltique (tm) crowd I'm not so sure. Sorry Mary, I've loved your work for years but I can't get along with this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgetable","review":"Her worst album. Much of the material has been done better by others (Eva Cassidy singing Fields of Gold; Dougie Maclean doing Turning Away and Broken Wings; Cry, Cry, Cry doing Speaking with the Angel) or isn't worth doing once (Message of Love is irritating).

I own all of her recordings and have played holes through them all, but I can't even remember the names of the songs on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"MARY, MARY, MARY","review":"This one is better than Shine, but only slightly. There are some good songs... \\"speaking with the angels\\", \\"I live not where I love\\", \\"Bless the road\\". Some are terrible... \\"Message of love\\", \\"Fields of gold\\". All in all a mediocre cd. If you loved Babes in the woods, Circus, No frontiers, Holy ground, By the time it gets dark, even...

In other words, standard late 60's British pop with a tiny bit of psychedelia thrown in for good measure. Don't expect much (if any) singing or memorable guitar work from Frampton here. If his name wasn't on the cd cover, I might never know he was on the album just by listening to it. So my advice? If you're a huge Frampton fan, you have to buy this to complete your collection. If you enjoy late 60's and early 70's British pop-rock, check out the Kinks, or Small Faces first before you purchase this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only one decent song","review":"Purchased CD for one song - From the Underworld - hoping there might be some other decent songs on it (it is after all a \\"best of\\").

She moves from stand-up monologues to the 40s big-band \\"Boogie-Woogie Bugle Boy\\" to the moving \\"We Shall Be Released\\" that ends the show, all without missing a beat. She does \\"Stay With Me\\" and you think she must have completely shredded her vocal chords, then gets up and says \\"Okay, change your head\\" and moves into a comedy number. What a performance, and what a performer!And what a disappointment that \\"Shiver Me Timbers\\" and \\"Rainbow Sleeve\\" are not included. \\"Shiver\\", especially, is a wonderfully whimsical and poignant number.

Homelessness is crude, factual, nonromantic and filled with mundane issues of surviving a life of where to sleep, getting food & money and socializing with like situated compadres. On the whole the movie and acting portrayed Wendy's journey and encounters fairly accurately although most homeless youth would have dumpster dived before risking such an obvious shop lifting. Where I have issue with this movie is this cutesy-fashionable \\"leave-it-up-to-the-audience\\" to finish the story. That, supposedly suspenseful yet incomplete, writing style works only rarely in literature and has no resemblance to reality - everything has a naturally occurring beginning and an end. The audience shouldn't be creating endings for someone else's beginnings.

The dual optical sensors make it really precise, with a smooth movement! Logitech has the best acceleration function that I have found in a mouse. Also, the mouse glides on the mouse pad, whereas the Kensington mouse seemed to stick, then slip, repeatedly. Summary: buy the Logitech dual optical mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY uncomfortable.","review":"I like this mouse because it has a cord (So no battery charging or changing required). However, I find it kind of pathetic when you have to install a driver just for a mouse. It takes up a small amount on my hard drive, but I still find it unnecessary. I replaced this mouse with a Logitech wireless mouse that required NO installation of anything!

Of the two, Dance Night is, by far, the better. Powell has created two characters - Morry and Jen - whom you come to care about, while also accurately depicting small town life in the early 1900s and how it is to be young. Her female characters such as Morry's mother, Elsinore, and, particularly, Jen, are complex and well rounded, which is refreshing, given that the novel was written in 1930. Though it is not as humorous as The Golden Spur, Powell still utilizes her wit with occasional one-liners that are capable of making you laugh out loud. Definitely worth reading, and further proof that more of her novels should be reprinted."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Classic","review":"This novel of early 20th century Ohio deserves a place with the novels of Willa Cather and Theodore Dreiser. Unlike Dawn Powell's satirical New York novels, this is a straightforward and touching story of a young man growing up and growing out of a stifling small town. The story paints a wonderful picture of a simpler time in our country. This portrait, along with Powell's knack for characterization and interesting plot turns, make the book a treasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep Away !!!","review":"I'm warning all 50's lovers !

Now, I knew from the past books I have read by the same author that this one was going be on the theme of \\"man is so mighty that he can survive all the worst of Nature with a capital N\\", but I must say, it started out good enough. But when they got to freak lightning comas and stuff, it just sort of, well, flopped. I'm sorry, but the part with the 'waterfall', it...uh well I suppose you could say it sank.No, I wouldn't recommend it.

I think that the reason for this is because Brian had to save some guy Derek, who had been knocked out by lightning. Most of this book talked about Brian taking care of Derek. Even the ending was bad, the docters said that Derek would have been fine for another week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good survival story","review":"Not quite as good as Hatchet, as the struggle to survive is contrived to begin with. Military experts want him to go thru a similar experience while being observed so they can figure out how he was able to survive. They need to know what about him helped him the first time. What he teaches them could help others who might be in similar situations. When things go wrong Brian has new problems to solve. He is responsible for another person who has been struck by lightening and is in a coma. There is less focus on how painful and consuming hunger can be. More focus on making critical decisions. How to get the injured man back to civilization, building a raft, learning how to navigate on the river. There are periods where Brian is exhausted because he is trying to get to the trading post as fast as possible. He falls asleep, dreams and hallucinates for portions of this excursion. Still a good story. We will look for the next one in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"intertaining elementry reading","review":"I want to read all of his books. Great adventure, short, simple!

I am on my way through it a second time...where I think each section is harder than the first time through, but your weapons also get better too, as well as a new one that you cannot get the first time thru! The game is similar in many ways to the PS2 versions of Ratchet & Clank, but some diehard fans may not agree. There are great weapons and worlds and creatures to conquer, and a fun story line. You also get to be a giant flying clank! The extra games are fun, as you toss mini clanks and fight robots and figure out puzzles etc. The game is shorter, but it IS a portable game after all.

I give this game a 4.5, nothing is ever perfect. But the developers did a good job of taking a legendary series & creating something everyone can enjoy as oppose to Spyro & Crash who unfortunately did nothing but failed since their oweners left. I brought this game along with Daxter & there both great original titles. But to be honest i enjoyed Ratchet more then i did Daxter. This game has alot of things 2 do for such a little machine.

This album has a distinctly mainstream 80's sound, and while it's apparent that Anderson takes a tongue-in-cheek approach to this musical form, the parody is a little too good for my taste.

This kelty has a great waist belt and a nice bumper for the kid to fall asleep while hiking. It is heavier (8 lbs) and is bulky in the car, but it's well balanced, easily adjustable for different height parents and babies, and I macgyvered a canopy to make it fit this carrier. The backpack and back ventilation is nice too. Mine is older and I didn't like how the tummy pad cut into my baby's belly, so I had to go into that piece and take out some of the foam that was making it too rigid. Something to look for when you try it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great backpack","review":"The backpack is wonderful! It is fairly light and my baby enjoys riding in it. He has basically outgrown the bjorn, and I wanted something that I could use to carry him as I walked around the neighborhood (with an active dog on a leash), shopped in a large store, or went on a short hike. The backpack works well for all of these activities. We took the pack overseas with us, too. Sometimes we collapsed it and put it into a duffel bag and other times we checked it (as we did a stroller)--we had no trouble with it with the airlines. Another plus is that we can easily move the straps so that both my husband and I can wear it. Finally, it is sturdy--I feel quite comfortable having my baby ride in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you liked this...","review":"This was a lovely book! I enjoyed every minute of reading.

Good work Ms. Strempek-Shea!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, unique Irish music album","review":"I consider this album worthwhile just for the very sensitive rendition of the song Kilkelly; but the centerpiece of the album is the \`\`operetta'' \\"The Green Fields of America\\", combining songs and tunes into a tapestry that details the whole story of Irish imigration to America. Also notable is the song \\"Peter Pan and Me\\", about the loss of innocence during the troubles. The two tune sets are fun and are played with spirit, but they're not the focus of the album. This isn't a cd I listen to often, but it's one that always affects me when I do pull it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has Iyer Ever Really Left His Desk?","review":"This guy either makes up things as he goes along or doesn't actually go along! For instance, he said garden fences and TV antenna are banned in Canberra Australia, which is nonsense. In fact, fences are erected at the time houses are built, so everyone has them, and most roofs also sport TV antennas. Plus, he describes Australian houses as \\"semi-detached,\\" when they are almost all just like your average suburban American house. Not major points, but he certainly lost all credibility with me. In fact, I seriously doubt that he's actually been here. Read Bill Bryson's book if you want to learn about Australia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty and Insightful ...","review":"Pico's short book is full of sharp and witty humor conjugated with intelligent insightful observations.

With every passing chapter, I could observe a progressive improvement in Pico's writing style. Essays from Argentina, Paraguay and Bhutan are very interesting. He comes into his own with the concluding essay on Australia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Founder Father of America","review":"This book paints a fascinating picture of William Penn's place in history as a founding father of America. The authors provide poignant narratives that show Penn's enormous contributions to the founding of a new government of freedom based on covenant, implying that Penn should be studied as enthusiastically as Washington, Jefferson, Adams and other early American leaders. The Seed of a Nation also explains why democracy will only work well when practiced by a public that understand the primacy of covenant relationships based on personal integrity, genuine faith, and generous trust. What I especially liked when I read this book is that the authors cut through the boring dogma of religion and academic soliloquy to get to the heart of matters, focusing on how Penn actually treated others, especially native Americans, and how he formed bonds of friendship that still illuminate how political leaders ought to be leading in the 21st century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Naive enthusiasm and quoting huge chunks from other authors is no reason to write a book. The author has almost no grasp of Quaker spirituality, or 17th century history in Britain or North America.

My friend's exaltations only making me madder, i listened with stuborness to this electronic record with a cool cover.But Peter Hook's bass warmed the ice in my veins. How could I not like the hook of \\"All the Way\\" even if it sounded like a \\"Just Like Heaven\\" rip off? \\"Fine Time\\" remains one of the finest disco tracks they ever made. Complete with the humorous sheep bleats. And \\"Run\\" is a fine tuning of any number of past New Order tales of love and loss. This time they just put a cosmopolitan bent to it.

The opener, \\"Fine Time\\" sounds a little out of place and is by no means an indicator of things to come, but it's still an oddly catchy piece in its own right. And some of the lyrics are just hilarious (You know I've met a lot of cool chicks, but I've never met one with all her own teeth). What follows, however, is a string of beautiful, well-crafted masterpieces. Some of them have a more accoustic sound (All The Way, Love Less, Dream Attack) while others are more dance-based (Round and Round, Vanishing Point, Mr. Disco), but they're all excellent songs. The former three would have to be my favorites, though. All in all it's a very short album, about 40 minutes, but it contains no filler. I recommend it to any New Order fan who hasn't already purchased it yet (can't imagine there are many of those) or to people who love good music in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another DISASTER from TONE-DEAF Rhino","review":"What the previous reviewers wrote with regards to this mess Rhino issued is 100% correct. Wow! Mastered from vinyl! Are they kidding?! In fact, this seems to be an on-going problem with this once great, now completely tone-deaf label. (They also recently released The Stooges first self-titled album, and it too is an utter disaster. Rhino was utterly asleep as the speed is oh so very s-l-o-w. It's as if no one bothered to listen to what they were releasing or were too stupid to know just how painfully slow it was... point-blank unlistenable).The currently reviewed title (and I am afraid anything that comes from Rhino these days) are must avoids... if nothing else, to let Rhino know they need to actually bother to listen before releasing material as high-priced collector editions."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Verdict on New Order's \\"Technique.\\"","review":"1989's \\"Technique\\" may not be New Order's best album, but it's easily their most accessible release. Alternating between hook-infested guitar pop and perky disco, \\"Technique\\" finds New Order experimenting with acid house on the bouncy first single \\"Fine Time.\\" In that song, singer Bernard Summer tries to shake off a persistent lover who's \\"much too young to mess around\\" with him. Elsewhere, there's the energetic rush of \\"Round and Round,\\" the guitar-flavored \\"Run\\" and \\"Dream Attack\\" and the disco stomp of \\"Vanishing Point.\\" All the ingredietns of a New Order album are here: Peter Hook's rubbery bass, Bernard Summer's spoken child vocals, and synths that occaisonally sound 1980s. While \\"Brotherhood\\" and \\"Low-Life\\" are at present my two favorite New Order releases, \\"Technique\\" is a solid CD that deserved its gold status in the US."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Order's Best Album - The mastering is awful","review":"Just a warning to those who are thinking about buying this. The mastering of the original disc is \\"ok\\" at best, but the bonus CD is terrible. Half the songs are mastered from Vinyl and you can very easily hear pops and skips and dropouts, etc.. Even Peter Hook has responded to all the complaints that he will do his best to get these fixed. Warner's doesn't seem to care since they had a couple of months to fix this issue since the UK release. If all you want is Technique remastered, then buy it used. The package is terrible, the liner notes are terrible (there are misspellings, wrong dates, and the insert is completely white with only black text.)BTW this doesnt just apply to Technique. ALL the remasters have the same issues...."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a New Order Classic.","review":"The Dance songs on this collection are among the finest New Order produced during their heyday.

His Archie Rice is an intense and utterly moving foray into the manipulative mind and overall cheesiness of a third-rate entertainer desperately trying to redeem a career on the skids.Olivier was the first of his generation of actors to be willing to play a modern, entirely compromised character and his bravery in this regard gives us what may well be his greatest performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Semi nudity","review":"There is semi nudity in this film.

No other dance I've tried kept giving me a lump in my throat so consistently. Argentine Tango (the dance and the music) can really, really touch something deep inside of us. Piazzola's music can grip your soul and shake you around. I guess that's why they called this album \\"The Rough Dancer.\\" It's absolutely beautiful and moving. This CD has to be one of his best. Classical Tango music has always been passionate, but Piazzola has taken it to a new level. If you are new to Tango music, I suggest you listen to a few tracks as it might be too strange for you. However, if you like Tango music, you'd love this CD.

While I liked the sound of period instruments, this recording just sounds terrible. I recently bought the complete Gardiner Beethoven. Wow! Lively, clear and intelligent. Gardiner convinces the listerner that he knows what he is doing (i.e. knows how to make this music) in a way that Norrington can't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Szell's version instead!","review":"First of all, let me get one thing straight, I don't believe in authenticity when it comes to how a work of music should be played. I don't mind if they're just trying to recreate how it would've been played during Beethoven's time, but must Roger Norrington say that it HAS to be played this way to be appreciated? I just don't understand. This recording is too ugly to be joyful. Where the tempo should be slow, it's fast, and vice versa. Beethoven would probably turn in his grave if he heard this vulgar performance.IMHO, the one I would go with is by George Szell, Robert Shaw, and the Cleveland Orchestra and Chorus. It may not be on period instruments, but it blows away this recording. Norrington is no match for Szell's mastery of the orchestra and Shaw's great choral direction. Just listen, and you'll see why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and Stilted","review":"Based on the great reviews, I purchased this book for my Kindle. Normally, I finish books in a day or so, but this one was so boring, it took nearly a week. I had to force myself to finish it so I could move on to something good. I found the characters, including heroine Claire Gulliver, incredibly dull. The dialogue was painfully stiff and unnatural. With so many characters on the tour to England, I was amazed at the lack of variation in speaking style. The mystery here is pretty dull too and I found the resolution unsatisfying. I'm a huge Agatha Christie fan and enjoy cozies, period mysteries and contemporary mysteries, but wouldn't recommend this book to anyone unless they're suffering from insomnia."},{"rating":"1","title":"T is for terrible!","review":"I am still slogging along in this dreadful story(84%). I would really like to like it because the settings,the sf bay area and GB are my top favorites, but boy oh boy is the writing flat and the plotting predictable. One reviewer mentioned some incorrectly used words, I have only found two so far and in fact that search is kinda what keeps me going. The funniest misuse was the word \\"thong\\" when the author was obviously referring to a \\"throng\\" at the airport. Anyway aim really glad I only paid the relatively low kindle price for this poor piece of writing. It does not even work for my insomnia because it is irritating, not just boringP.s.

How did this get published? How did it get on Amazon? Two words for the author: Editing. Transitions. Neither exists in this book. Doesn't deserve even one star. The author writes in her introduction about fulfilling dreams and I do admire people who jump into the fray to try something new and scary. I'm not a mean person, but I do believe when others purchase a product they should get their money's worth. Not here. There may be potential with this series but the author really, really needs to sharpen her pencil, edit, create proper transitions between paragraphs and topic changes and learn to use a dictionary! I bought the kindle edition for $3.99. Thank goodness I didn't spend nearly $20 for the softcover edition. I would be raving mad.

Take the scratching on \\"Roda,\\" for instance; it adds an exciting edge. Or the African influences that pervade \\"Rainha\\" -- a cultural acknowledgment that gives the track some oomph. Sure, there's plenty of tradition on the album as well, but Céu serves it up with a side dish of dub or electronica. The gurgling in the background of \\"Mais Um Lamento\\" or the beatbox that starts off the cover of Bob Marley's \\"Concrete Jungle.\\" There's easygoing jazz on \\"Veu Da Noite\\" and more minimal sounds on \\"Bobagem\\" which leans on a subdued drum, Céu's vocals, and a guitar.

But they are VERY thin, two-ply very thin terry. My 10 month old drools constantly and he will soak through these bibs in less than an hour. The shape of the velcro rough and soft sides do not match, so you have to be careful how you fasten it to make sure the rough side doesn't touch baby's neck. And be sure to fasten it before the wash so they don't eat your other clothes. They are bright pretty colors and they don't fade or shrink in the wash.Bottom line: I wouldn't buy these again as they are too thin for my drooler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too thin","review":"Although these bibs are large in size, they are way too thin. When my 3-1/2 month old drools or spits up the moisture goes straight through to his clothes and they end up wet anyway. Also the neck size is large and is too big for him. I ordered the green sprouts waterproof pack of 10 bibs and they are well worth the extra $. They are waterproof, fit his neck perfectly and are also large enough to catch his drool and spit ups."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect for drool and spit up - not so good for feeding \\"solids\\"","review":"These bibs are perfect for drool and spit up, though if the quantity is really big the clothes underneath can get wet. Even so, I prefer these to plastic bibs because my baby likes to play with and chew on them, and the cotton is nice and soft.For feeding rice cereal or other messy solids I would recommend something a bit more substantial / waterproof.The color selection is such that there is always a good color for baby's outfit, and they are big enough that they should easily fit up until my (big) baby is 6 months old. I do agree with other reviewers about the velcro in the washer/dryer - and will also add that you should be sure that the entire velcro is covered - if there's even a tiny bit that is left outside, something will latch on to it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total garbage!","review":"These bibs started falling apart after ONE wash! Pathetic. The velcro on all of them unraveled and now the tabs are falling off. Plus the velcro tab is really small so they don't adjust much, making a gap between my baby's neck and the bib so her clothing gets dirty anyway.

This album, produced by Rodgers, is just hard to like, period. I've tried listening several times, but its overly trite mix of R&B and hip-hop just won't grow on me (and I usually tend to like that kind of music). Depthless and immature lyrics abound, the beats are probably the most stale and uninspiring that you'll ever hear on a Nile Rodgers-produced album, and that suit she's wearing is scary. Even Sheena Easton's NR-produced album, which is much more pop than R&B/hip-hop, is much better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melt in Your Mouth Delicious!","review":"\\"Bounty\\" bars consist of a soft, almost molten center of sweet coconut coated in an outer layer of milk chocolate.

Vicki writes about her struggles to complete college while being on a hit show and being torn over wanting to quit overher parent's objections. Miss Lawrence also writes about her strained relationship with hermother, who often faked suicide to meet her demands. Vicki also takes us through her successes as a Number One pop artist and gives us behind-the-scene tales of portraying \\"Mama\\" on thelong-running \\"Mama's Family\\" television series.

All of these works are performed with immense vitality - no blandness on this CD!I originally listened to this recording through my library. It was my first introduction to Elgar's marches, leading me to purchase a different recording of P&C.; This recording was slower than Menuhin's and, though fine, did not quite inspire the same sense of excitement I had originally enjoyed.I hope you enjoy this CD as greatly as I have.

The Handbook Of Water Use And Conservation is enthusiastically recommended for anyone with environmental concerns for water quality and usage, from lay homeowners, to agriculturalists, to municipal authorities, to corporate C.E.O.'s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lives up to title","review":"The Wine Tasting Party Kit was a real hit and included six reusable cloth bags to hide the wine bottles, rating sheets, and wine glass stem labels. The enclosed book is very basic but can provide a jumping off point to select a theme for your party. A good investment if you want to have a series of parties with your friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Fun","review":"This kit is perfect for beginners. I didn't have a clue of how to get started in planning a party and this kit took the guess work out of EVERYTHING. However, it is very interactive and I reccomend keeping your guest list small (4-5 people/4-5 bottles)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun in a box - just add wine!","review":"I've used other wine tasting kits and I like this one best. The bags are a nice quality of fabric, the pads where you write your tasting notes have good categories and overall it's a good price for what you get. There is a lot of extra paper in the note pads so this will last for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, you can put together your own \\"kit\\" but...","review":"it will take time, effort and certainly more than $10 for you to do so. This kit really is the perfect novice set. It all comes packaged in a very compact game-box like container. The book is handy but not so long-winded or pretentious that your guests couldn't flip through it quickly (if they so choose). What I really found handy was the stand-up card that gives you a quick \\"how-to\\" on tasting wines.As others have stated, the pads to rate the wines are plentiful. As are the wine glass markers.All in all, this set would make a great gift and a wonderful starter set for novice or casual wine tasters.Cheers!Added 5/27: Finally put the kit to use and it was very handy. I really liked the wine bags -- easy to use to cover up the bottles. I'd much prefer that than \\"foil\\" or \\"paperbag\\" as some wine tasting sites suggest. Guests were interested in where I got it, how much it was etc... so seems like it would be a no-brainer gift for wine drinkers."},{"rating":"1","title":"condescending claptrap","review":"This guy is outrageously paternalistic and condescending.

Based on the true life story of Isak Dinesen the movie takes us back to a colonial period when Africa was still wild and fresh. I especially liked the scenes of flying in the Tiger Moth biplane. Pollack, a pilot, gives a perfect view of the African rift from above. Simply stunning and memorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING--This is the exact same flipper disc as earlier release","review":"This new blu-ray release is exactly like the last one: a flipper disc with scratches on the dvd side.

My favorite part is the music and cinematography. My mom and I have watched this movie every few years and we never get bored of it. The soundtrack is wonderful on it's own.There must have been VERY tough competition on Oscar night because Streep's performance definitely is one of the best that I've seen for a drama. This release includes interviews with Streep and Pollack. I was surprised to see a short interview (1999?) with the man who in real life was the young boy who goes to Karen with his injured leg. The video includes some photographs from the time period in Kenya."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of Africa","review":"Bad Audio. Could not hear the dialog.

I love the movie, so I bought it anyway. My thinking was, it's bluray, it's got to be better than standard DVD. It is not. WAAAY NOT! Rent it before you buy it. See for yourself. It has to rank as the worst Bluray video transfer I have seeen to date. My display device is a Samsung LN55A950; my DVD player is a Sony PS3. My connection is HDMI. My Hidef video library is approximately 100 titles, with standard DVD at about 300 titles. I am a discriminating videophile. If image quality is important to you, do not buy this title. To all Universal movie execs, you fooled me on this one, shame on me. I won't be fooled again. Next time, my $ will stay in my pocket untill I see what the reviewers say."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Redford movie","review":"I'm 25 and have loved Robert Redford since I saw The Way We Were in high school. Out of Africa is my favorite of his films. It is both beautifully shot and wonderfully acted. His costar, Meryl Streep, is an excellent counterpart. The story is centered around Streep's character, who can best be described as an abandoned housewife who is in charge of getting her and her husband's coffee plantation off the ground in Africa. While her husband basically screws around on her she manage the farm and gets it running to a success. She meets Redford's Denys Finch-Hatton and they eventually engage in a love affair. It is a moving and uplifting, albeit a little lengthy, romantic drama. The ending never fails to bring me to tears. I love this film and I think you will too. Give it a chance! It's a generally fun film that also has a deep message about respect for the earth and respect for each other and the fragility of life. I think I'm going to go watch it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I will go ahead of you and light a fire...","review":"The music, the passion, the landscape, the heartbreak - it's all here and it's one outstanding movie. Meryl Streep plays a plantation owner in Africa around the time of WWl. Recently married to a scoundrel, she falls in love with a big game hunter, played by Robert Redford. Yes, his English accent is lame, so what? He's Robert Redford! Her accent is charming and she isn't afraid to look like she never wears make-up.The music is simply perfect. When Meryl and Redford fly over the African plain and she reaches for his hand, I swoon. Guys, watch it with your wife or girlfriend; she'll think you're really sensitive. Ladies, watch it with a girfriend and sigh in all the right places. I love this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted a video to use at home and unknowingly got a REGION 2","review":"I am very very disappointed because this video is from REGION 2.... which means I can't use it!!!I certainly wish \\"REGION 2\\" would have been made clear to me when I was choosing it.I wish I could send it back and get a copy that is US player friendly!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic functions are broke","review":"When viewing the Blu-Ray side don't STOP or PAUSE the video.When stopped it will impolitely start at the beginning when PLAY is pressed.When paused you better get back fast as it will at some unknown point start from the beginning on it's own.How the industry can put out product who's basic functions are so faulty is beyond me.

The DVD side skips every time at a certain spot in the movie to the end. The blue ray side will not play at all. I must have gotten a dud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not strictly by the book","review":"Having read several of Dineson's writings, I can tell you that the movie \\"Out of Africa\\" does not follow closely the book by the same name; I have read that it draws from several resources, including Dineson's letters and essays written by others who knew her. In her book she makes no mention of any romance between herself and Denys Finch-Hatton; there is, however, much information available online to support the love affair shown in the film. This is one of Streep's better performances; she drops the girlish voice and gestures I dislike in so many of her roles. Streep's \\"Tania\\" is the strong, self-reliant and independant Baroness Blixen of the book, and I found her very likeable. Redford is, as always, Redford, and Africa is the star. A very pleasurable viewing experience. The costumes and sets are wonderful, as are the supporting characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"This is one of the best films of the modern era.

This is a well known epic (unlike the Scent of a Woman) with power, big stars, beautiful scenery, and a great musical score. Meryl Streep is superb portraying this great woman (based on a true story) and Robert Redford is suave and seducing in his portrayal of the lover. This movie has everything: infidelity, war, disease, racism, imperialism, political statements, discrimination, intelligence, beauty, well I can go on, and on. One of the best movie ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dud...","review":"Sorry, I know I am in the minority for this film but it just didn't make me think romantic and I didn't like the story.

The photography is the first thing you notice. Then, Meryl Streep's performance. Redford is just ok as the commitment-phobic safari-mad Brit whom Karen Blixen falls for. He hasn't changed much since then, at least on screen. This was big, old-fashioned movie-making by the late Sydney Pollack, and it's still well worth watching. It's a bit less than PC by today's standards in its treatment of the \\"natives,\\" however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Amazon selling pirated DVDs?","review":"On February 22 I ordered this Blu-Ray (and a couple of others).

What it does not have is an interesting script, interesting direction, or really anything of interest or value. Only Klaus Maria Brandauer emerges from this ponderous disaster unscathed.

Unfortunately it turned out to be warped and my mother commited a travesty by returning and exchanging it for an ABBA album. I guess Blondie was a bit too racy for a seven year old kid. Anyway, this is the album I remember most from them and has some of what came to be their biggest hits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pop-Rock","review":"It's a peak for the band probably. They wrote some great songs, and augmented those with a few great songs written by other people, to produce their most solid record to that point.Clem Burke is a brilliant drummer. Chris Stein is, in his sloppy way, a brilliant guitarist. Debby Harry is and was the bomb.

The remastered sound is amazing compared to the previous domestic release. However, they should've kept the original version of \\"Heart Of Glass\\" as heard on the LP, and add the longer Disco Version as a bonus track.

Radiate","review":"\\" The beams become my dream.....My dream is all on the screen\\"this song embraces the silver screen era, cool I guess, but the thing is.. she sings SO beautifully. And shes not trying to be Mariah Carey or (god forbid) Celine Dion. This album is #140 on the RS 500 list, and it deserves to be there, dont write Blondie off as new wave rock novelty....no way.. Parallel Lines is a classic! It sure beats all this teeny, rappy, \\"Im cool\\" sort of trash tunes that bombards our hearing once in a while. I got an idea ....lets tie up all these pukes and MAKE THEM listen to Parallel Lines over and again until they realize how awesome this album is. ... OK Im ok...I just hate kids, thats all. Ok thanx for listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blondie's best","review":"Blondie's best album, full of melodic post-punk pop confections.

This one had the bad matches... and that's it. The lucha match was ok but not as good as the three way at starcade of 98. And the Goldberg x Hall ladder match. There were only two cool bumps in that match, one was an elbow drop almost from the top by Scott, and the other was when Goldberg hit his head on the rope as he fell with the ladder, it looked liked he couldv'e seriously hurt his neck but got lucky. COME ON! The best slam of the night was a flub, an accident... boring tape don't get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An overall good compilation of Roxy Music's career...","review":"Though this compilation may lack a few songs (Thrill of it all being missing really makes this album lose a few points), it gives an overall good or general overview of the band's career. Though I can't say all the tracks were strong, I definitely liked Avalon and More than This. Street Life is rather interesting and I'd give a little more credit as it did include Pyjamarama which I think would be needed in any overview of this band. Not a bad compilation. I would recommend it to a few casual fans, someone who just wants a taste of Roxy Music (and Bryan Ferry), or perhaps a newbie to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Influence on music of the 80's is all over Street Life","review":"While uneven, this compliation CD is a great representation of one of the most influential bands/singers of the last 20 years. Ferry's \\"Oh Yeah\\" is steller as is \\"Same Old Scene\\" but the inclusion of \\"Avalon\\" and \\"Love is the Drug\\" make it a must have. Brian Ferry is one of the coolest singers to emerge from the 70s and Roxy Music is a taste everyone should acquire."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Greatest Hits Compilations of all time","review":"I could not agree with Burlington, New Jersey more. The first few tracks on this record aren't that great, but the last few (from 10 on) are the best. I have this one on tape and I am buying the CD today. The tape is a \\"permanent resident\\" on my stereo at home.Now, if only the Avalon CD would come back into stock (that's a truly GREAT album)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less is More","review":"This is a crummy compilation of a great band. The 1977 'Greatest Hits' is better. Unfortunately, it is out of print. The most glaring omission is 'The Thrill of it All.' In all, five songs are missing in action.

It's a fun way to have some new ideas about the monsters in your adventures and really adds color to the creatures. Everything from witchunter's journals to the ravings of peasants are included.I use this book currently for a Dungeon World campaign, as the first part of the book is useful on its own and I can ignore the stat blocks in the back.

Yeah. Easy.What makes this book different is that John Clausen does NOT assume that the editor of Family Circle or Sports Illustrated are old work buddies you can just call up for a favor.Yet he still makes freelancing look accessible and manageable instead of daunting. and his writing style is far more user-friendly than most.

I thought I was getting a book that tought Transcendental Meditation - what I got was a book telling me how effective TM is in a variety of different ways, but never actually teaching me how to meditate. In fact, the whole point of the book is to lure you into singing up for one of their \\"seminars.\\" In other words, after reading this book, I have no idea how to meditate - it was never described in the book. I am still intrigued by TM, and will still attempt to learn it via another book (hopefully) - in that respect I am a believer.

I read the book and actually paid for lessons to learn TM. A typical lesson costs anywhere from $200 to the $1000+ range. Here's the lesson in a nutshell. You're merely taught to repeatedly recite out loud, your so-called secret mantra (mine was \\"shreem\\"). You'll then be guided to gradually bring down the volume of the recited mantra to a whisper, then finally reciting it in your head in silence. Hey, now you're meditating! I did get headaches for the first two weeks, and practiced TM for a long time. Yes, it does calm and quiet the mind but also try joining a normal meditation class, which I did before trying TM.

It says nothing about TM. In fact,one could memorize every word verbatim and still have no idea as to the definition of the \\"transcendental meditation.\\" As an advertising campaign, it might appeal to those desparate souls who are willing suspend any reason and/or judgment in pursuit of peace of mind. The entire thing is a written infomercial. Plodding through the endless praise of TM by random practicioners, I finally reached the chapter \\"How to Start\\" only to find it required calling somewhere for a further sales pitch.

The title is very misleanding - A new introduction to Maharishi's Easy, Effective and Scientifically Provern technique, etc.It is is filled with endorsements from people who have studied TM.

The standout song on the album is Santa Monica. (Not a cover of the old Everclear song) Hopefully they will release this song as a single. I hope more people warm up to this kind of music so that this band has a chance of making it beyond 3 albums, which seems to be a barrier for most rock bands playing today.

I listened to every song, and I was not disappointed. Great album if you like country and rock. It is odd that a Canadian band would make a song called \\"Santa Monica\\" since that's in the Southwestern U.S, but I know that when they made this album, they put some deep thought into it.Just as an indirect gesture to show how much I think their album is worth hard-earned money, I deleted my TOAD mp3's from my computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD!","review":"I have to say that is a very good cd and that theory of a deadman should keep up the great work.

I think this song would make them sell even more albums then they have done to this point. Hopefully this will be their next single.

The song no surprise isnt much different than the rest of the cd so i don't know exactly what you were expecting. Anyways i think the cd is pretty damn good. This is good listening and so what if they sound a little like nickelback. Now we've got TWO bands that sound the same (like this is the first time). I would recommend this cd for nickelback fans but dont think its a \\"clone\\" because they definitely are much different and a little harder than nickelback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD at a great price!","review":"This is a awesome CD, better than there last. The only problem that I have is that somehow i seem to have gotten an edited version of the CD but there is only one version to buy in the store and it did not say edited on it. Has this happened to anyone else?

I ditched my messenger bag because I was getting a sore shoulder and wanted a real backpack. It's got a lot of nice corduroy-lined internal pockets to keep everything organized and great padding on the straps and back. I like the one-sided zips that are easy to access with one strap off, but the center zip pocket (obstensibly for sunglasses) is almost impossible to get to without taking the bag off completely.

I'm the kind of person who, when he has a backpack, loads it down with all sorts of things -- be prepared for anything, right? When that happens, though, backpacks become unwieldy and cumbersome because of their design (ie- the big opening, the middle opening and the smallest opening jut out way too far when they're full, thus they alter one's center of gravity too much).In contrast to that typical design, this pack takes all of that space, all of that room for my random additions, and keeps them inside the spacious main opening. Even when this pack was very full, everything was kept so close to my back that it remained a much more comfortable fit than I'd ever had before.Without a doubt this pack has surpassed all my expectations, and you're missing out not having one yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to love it..... disappointing construction.","review":"I really wanted to love this backpack and have continued to use it. The form and size were perfect for my needs.However, within 6 months of purchasing it, BOTH of the zipper pulls on the main compartment broke off.

Let's hope she does a lot more than just one as her music is unique and wonderful. This, her first CD/album was great and still is. The second wasn't as powerful, but \\"Surge\\" (1993) is as good or better than the first CD/album. She is the only musician I've ever heard who truly uses her voice as the primary \\"instrument\\" of her music, and she has a great voice that she runs through various synthesizing techniques to create great, innovative effects. For this first CD, by the way, she played everything; she couldn't afford to pay for studio musicians. She didn't need them and still doesn't!Give us back our Child! We want more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Great traditional playing from two great Irish musicians. Sounds a bit like the pub music I heard when in Ireland, and it takes me back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly delightful","review":"This is a wonderful CD, made before either of the participants hit it big in contemporary Celtic music. The tunes are traditional or traditional-style (the lovely \\"Trip to Skye\\" is Whelan's own composition), and he and Ivers, both accomplished solo performers, meld their styles well. The album has an improvisational liveliness, but never veers into being sloppy. The instrumentation is simple, keeping the focus on the two soloists and their straight-ahead renditions of the tunes. I copied this CD onto tape about 6 months ago to listen to in my car, and I've nearly worn the tape out by now. It's a terrific album."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as their first one","review":"This Album from Blondie was released in 1977, it wasn't my favorite album by them, but it does have it's moments, I like the songs \\"Detroit 442\\" and \\"I'm Alway In Touch By Your Presence dear\\" Very Nice, even though it's just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to their next Fallowing albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still my favorite Blondie album. An underrated classic.","review":"If you have never heard Blondie's Plastic Letters before then you are in for a treat. This is still and always will be my favorite Blondie album. I can still remember listening to it for the first time in 1977 and I loved it. I used to play it over and over again. Hearing it today is just as fresh as it was then. This album is their pre polished sound that was the real Blondie. It is a true example of their pop punk style. I saw them in concert in 1978 when they did Parallel Lines with the hit disco song Heart of Glass and Debbie Harry announced that they were not a disco band but a punk band. I guess that song made them popular but to me the real rawness of Blondie is in the songs on Plastic Letters. Every song is a classic. Give it a listen for the first time or rediscover it if you have'nt heard it in awhile. This is without a doubt one of my top ten albums of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bituminous Coal Queens of Pennsylvania","review":"This is a gem of a movie that is both lovely and surprising in its content and tone. I was so enthralled to watch a film about a slice of Americana life and to find myself so engaged by the story, characters, location, photography and music. The narrator, Sarah Rush who is quite engaging and amusing, goes back for her reunion in a small town in Pennsylvania. There we encounter not only the new crop of girls competing but also meet the past winners. It is great to watch these people who seem like characters but yet are real and wonderfully interesting. This is a film where the director, David Hunt, details what is the best part of Americana life but yet it also showcases the pitfalls about real life in the coal mines and competing for something that is important. This is a must see for all!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Christian products should carry a warning","review":"Had I known this DVD was wholesome Christian product rather than an unbiased documentary I would never have purchased it."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL","review":"Rex Lawson is a traditional highlife singer who's became famous in Nigeria during the 1960's His clear, powerful voice is reminiscence of Chief Stephen Osita Osadebe , who was heavily influenced by his sound.

Some of the recipes seem to leave out important information - like how to prepare the vegetables before cooking - which might be obvious to a more experienced Greek cook.

Pretty basic without all the Hollywood CGI, but very good and believable. The acting was fine and I think the characters were presented and developed well.The story is partly about the woman and her partner struggling to survive and partly about their love for each other. Even after he is infected and starts to mutate, she stays with him and tries to cope, hoping to find a way to help him.

Some of the songs were later used onTwin Peaks, where Julee Cruise ocassionally appeared as the Roadhouse Singer. Julee has a very ethereal voice, which is entirely appropriate for this album. The songs all have lyrics by David Lynch, with music by Angelo Badalamenti. The first thing you are likely to notice about the songs is that the words don't rhyme. That's pretty unusual, but somehow it works anyway. All the songs are love songs, by the way. The song \\"Falling\\" usually get the most attention, because it was later the theme song for \\"Twin Peaks\\", but the best song here is easily \\"Rockin' Back Inside My Heart\\". Not coincidentally, it also the closest thing here to a traditional song, in that it actually has a repeated chorus. This is actually a beautiful album, in it's own way.

After about a year, the heating element that seals the bags developed a hot spot in the middle of the bar, creating holes in the bags. If the purpose of the product is to vacuum out all the air for proper freezer storage, a hole created by the product doesn't quite fulfill it's job. Can't buy a replacement heating bar, so for $150 (what I paid) it's really junk. Don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money..","review":"I have had three of these and my kids have each had a couple, and we all agreed - they work for a while and then stop sealing. I've taken mine apart, tried to see why it stopped working and no luck - another one in the trash. They're OK for a while, and I wish there was a solution that would work more than a year, but plan on buying a new one every year. If you want to waste your money, that is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't suck out all the air","review":"Like the others have said, you can't just seal something, you have to let the unit suck out the air.

Going to buy the other brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst product I have ever owned","review":"I am now on my third Seal-A-Meal and although Rival has replaced two defective products prior to this one, it is by far the worst product I have ever owned. I use it a moderate amount to seal bulk purchases and during late summer to freeze corn we have grown in the garden.

My SECOND replacement unit has just stopped working, despite the fact that I gave it more than the requisite 20 second rest time between bags AND at least a 20 minute break in between batches. Got 16 bags done and had to do the rest in ziplocks. This product is a total waste of time and money. Don't buy one.

The seal is not tight enough to form a completly vacuum It.

It doesn't have a lock on the lid, like the Foodsaver, when you place the bag to seal, so my hands were sore by the time I got all my sealing done. It doesn't have an instant sealer, like the FoodSaver, so you waste a lot of time trying to just seal a bag without sucking out the air.One time on the Seal A Meal was enough for me. I packed it up and sent it back and spent more money to get the FoodSaver instead. The extra money is worth it for a more superior machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"what vacuum seal?","review":"Opted to spend less money to replace a Food Saver, and have regretted it ever since.

Having had my introduction to DM in 1984, my friends and I were in a pretty full lather by the time this concert arrived. It was, in a word, amazing. Southern California has always been a signifigant part of DM's fanbase and the feeling in the Rose Bowl that night proved it. I have attended college football games (and a couple of Rose Bowls) in the same venue and this was louder. A definitive classic in the annals of rock history (especially the last 20 years) and a must have, even for the casual DM fan. Even seeing Violator a couple of years later (at a slightly smaller venue, Dodger Stadium) was intense, but nothing like the night that Dave and Martin swept 90,000 people off their feet........"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I would say it is an amazing CD. Could be a bit shorter and a bit cheaper though :-). Anyway, worthwhile.

The fact that it's on Curb Records should be a hint to anyone wondering if they should buy this (Ray's recordings are scattered through Universal [Mercury and MCA recordings], Barnaby, Monument, Warners and RCA). Curb would never pay all the licensing fees needed to put together a set of this magnitude.The original recordings are available, but you'd have to buy at least three discs to get them all. But the additional cost is worth it to have the original recordings. The ones on this box set are limp recreations of Ray's former glory; while we're at it, shame on you Ray for re-recording your stuff and passing it off as your classic repertoire.Proceed at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"so, sooo not good!","review":"I love Ray Stevens but this collection is not the original recording.

If you are a true fan of his works, then this box set will DISAPPOINT you. If you are merely interested in something that sounds \\"digital karaoke\\", then this is for you.. cause that's exactly what it is. Ray simply grabs the lyric sheets and sings-um..

The cloning is a joke from a bad B movie.In one of the starting scenes Keaton's make up is bad and hekooks like he has a bad skin disease? Keaton's acting is good on the four distinct personalities, but the dialog doesn't make use of the comedy situations. MacDowell mainly does sexy and reads her lines.These two deserve a better written comedy that has more believable action and dialog. My conclusion is that it was a production line movie with bad oversight and quality control: a Hollywood screw up."},{"rating":"1","title":"$5+ and still no DVD seen","review":"I purchaced this item that required a small shipping fee.

Therefore, I am not satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Sleeper","review":"I found this flick at a second-hand DVD store for $3.00. My expectation level was low and it far exceeded them. This movie is a piece with other comic fantasies from director Harold Ramis, \\"Groundhog Day\\" and to a lesser degree the remake of \\"Bedazzled\\". Ramis mines most of the comic possibilities out of the possibilities of cloning oneself, plus or minus. The film is anchored by a superb performance by Michael Keaton that recalls his best work in \\"Beetlejuice\\" and the \\"Batman\\" films. Not classic but well worth your while. On a trivial note Keaton's character is named Doug Kinney probably out of homage to one of Ramis' collaborators on the \\"Animal House\\" script who prematurely passed some years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"One Can Be the Loneliest Number\\"","review":"Michael Keaton's performance in the hilarious film \\"Multiplicity\\" is outstanding. Keaton is a \\"too busy to do anything else but work\\" contractor who becomes a test subject for a scientist's human cloning project. The clones turn out to be a big help and a big headache. The clones emphasize different parts of Keaton's psyche and the resulting interplay of their/his personalities makes this film enjoyable and funny. Keaton is able to play four different roles in the same film with ease.Guaranteed to be a good laugh and sure to be a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"witty funny","review":"This movie should've done well mainstream. There's enough humor that it's not too difficult for most people to get, but yet there's enough substance for the critical thinkers, but enough humor to be silly to the so called average person. To those critics that gave this movie a bad slice was undeservedly so. How many movies can you watch where an actor can say something to the degree of \\"I'm sorry that I was having sex with your wife, but that it was actually you having sex with your wife because you are me?\\" Since cloning is not rampant yet, maybe this movie is too ahead of its time.MacDowell is great as a wife, and Keaton is just gosh darned funny as all hell as he plays himself and all the clones in it! Must've been hard to film, especially the parts with more than one Doug at the same time. Eugene Levy is in this one too, but he doesn't play a big enough part to show his witty humorous side."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest Michael Keaton Movie","review":"This is the funniest Michael Keaton movie I have ever seen. It's a very clever, entertaining comedy. My teen age grandson laughed until tears came to his eyes. He said, \\"I've never heard of this movie.\\" I found that many people haven't. I don't know why it wasn't promoted more. It involves cloning - big time. Each clone is a personality split from the original plus a copy of a copy doesn't turn out too well. Michael Keaton plays all the parts, (mostly anyway). The whole family can watch this one although little ones probably won't understand it too much. I'd recommend it for age 12 and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant :)","review":"All in all this is a great movie. Michael Keaton gives a great performance in a movie with a ridiculous premise.

After the psychedelic side-trip of \\"Satanic Majesties\\", the single \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\", followed by this LP, came as a great relief. It represented both a return to the band's R&B roots and their first extension into country-based rock. It also showcased a new depth in Jagger's lyrics.While \\"Sympathy...\\" and \\"Street...\\" have traditionally gotten all the airplay from this set, there are numerous other gems. \\"Dear Doctor\\", \\"Prodigal Son\\" and \\"Factory Girl\\" display the country influence in both music and homey, working-man lyrics. \\"Salt of the Earth\\" is a rock hymn to everyman. \\"Parachute Woman\\" is an R&B-based rocker.This is one of my ten favorite album/CDs of all-time. Nobody who likes rock music should be without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Stones' best!","review":"Beggars Banquet is one of the top 5 Stones albums. This was when they became one of the best bands in rock history, this album contains 'Sympathy For The Devil' and the hard rock songs played with acoustic guitars 'Street Fighting Man' but thats not it this album is more it has 'Parachute Woman' 'Jig-Saw Puzzle' and 'Strey Cat Blues' all of which are amazing songs. Then their are the softer folkyer songs which are great as well. This album was a start of a new Rolling Stones with this they wereo longer a Sycadelic band but a real rock band, and boy were they ever good, after this was released the Stones came across a long carrer of succes with his album after hit album and hit song after hit song. You must own this as it truly is a masterpeace!"},{"rating":"2","title":"my banquet","review":"Together with Let it bleed one of the most varied RS albums. Buy it today and enjoy.

Great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beggars Banquet. The Rolling Stones","review":"This has got to be one of the best offerings from the Stones. The fantastic 'Sympathy for the devil' is by far the best track ever written by Jagger/Richards. No expectations is another as are 'Stray Cat Blues' and 'Street Fighting Man'. I think that this album has the best guitar in it before the introduction of Mick Taylor. The solos on 'Sympathy'and Stray Cat Blues must be some of the best by Richards, even though I think that he matured further next to Mick Taylor later on. Another very good track is 'Parachute woman'. This Album together with 'Sticky Fingers' and 'Let it Bleed' represent the Stones at their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bad Band","review":"This is classic rock, sure, but that don't mean its good.

It is now held up as one of the greatest albums ever made, any genre, any time - sactified by critics everywhere. Forget that stuff. If you you want to know how the blues informed 50's rock and roll, crossed the pond and started the British Invasion and then came back and became something beyond anything anyone could ahve expected, it is all here. Listen to \\"Street Fighting Man\\" - a pissed off proto punk anthem, and then \\"Prodigal Son\\" - as real a blues mutation as can be imagined. I know they wasted much of the last 30 years being stars. But they once walked 10 feet off the ground.

All of the songs including the singles (Street Fighting Man and Sympathy for The Devil) all come together as one on this phenomenal album. The vocal work that Mick Jagger did on No Expectations is so underrated in my opinions. Just the lyrics he laid down on the track with the way he delivered it is beyond description. And Street Fighting Man is about as punk rock as it gets. Another thing I love about this album is the amazing cover art work. It's one of those albums where the packaging is really something special to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute brilliant album in every aspect.","review":"With the start off track \\"sympathy for the devil\\",you know that the stones were trying something new.Unlike the predecesor \\"satanic majesties request\\",this one is full of fresh ideas and doesnt get cloyed in psychedelia.A must have for any fan of music in general.Brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Royal Flush","review":"One of their most complete albums.

It rocks! \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" has been played so many times on rock radio stations over the past few decades, it's no longer worth listening to.\\"Stray Cat Blues\\" isn't too bad but after you hear the live version of this song on \\"Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out,\\" you won't like the studio version nearly as much.

They never again procuced the kind of multi dimensional, introspective, soulful rock such as Salt of the Earth or edgy Stray Cat Blues you see on this album. Gravitating to the world's greatest pub band, anchored by the spare virtuouso guitar riffs of Richards and the formal drum beat of Watts, the band was less innovative, their ballads much less successful and their output became the distinct, raw edged but predictable Stones sound.

But I can live without EVER hearing \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" again.This is a VERY laid back record, LOTS of acoustic guitars and a country-blues feel to the whole thing.

Nothing can dull a song more than album rock airplay. \\"No Expectation\\" is a gritty blues track that contains more soul than anything I have heard in 15 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"begging for the stones","review":"What can you say about the classic period of the Stone's? This is a seminal, must-have album for anyone who loves rock and the blues."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not a Stones Fan! But I LOVE THIS RECORD!","review":"This is one of the greatesr albums of any genre I've ever heard. It has some of everything and if you can't appreciate it, then you aren't much or a music fan. The entire thing is just very, very good. I bought it because I've always liked \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\"...but the rest of the songs hold up so well play afer play. Since getting this album about 4 months ago...I've bought 4 other Rolling Stones albums. I've liked them all...but this one is by far the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of rock's perfect albums","review":"This is Paul Westerberg's favorite album. Nothing more needs to be said. But, if I can throw my own two cents in, this is truly The Stones at their most soulful and brilliant. My favorite Stones songs are spread across various albums but I don't think they ever made a better album than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just rediscovered this","review":"I bought this when it came out in 68, but I RETURNED it to the store because my 15 year old ears couldn't stand most of the country tracks. There were only two outright rockers: Sympathy and Street, at least to me back then. Country music seemed like the lamest possible thing to me then and to hear Mick's ridiculous attempts to sound country only added to my disdain. Flash forward to today. I finally listened to this again and, of course, was blown away. Not only did the country rock sound fine, but I was totally taken by some of Charlie's hard drumming on Parachute Woman and maybe Jigsaw Puzzle, which I didn't appreciate back in the day either. Oh well. Live and learn. I've jumped on the bandwagon for one of the best Stones' records ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want your computer to work don't buy this battery","review":"I saw the price on this battery and thought to myself that I really had a great deal! My old battery lasts for about 5 minutes so I have to keep my Powerbook G4 plugged up to use it so I definitely need a new one. When I put it in I noticed that the actual fit was poor (it stuck out another 1/8 of an inch) but that was the least of my problems. A few days later my DVD/CD drive quit on me and also the headphone jack started to act up. I took my laptop to the Genius bar and they said that it sounded like an issue with the logic board and that it may be caused by the battery (uneven power output perhaps?). Anyway I swapped my old battery back in and the problems went away! What a relief!! I am sticking with the genuine Mac batteries from now on. Spend a little more money, save a lot of headache and buy Mac batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lithium Ion Laptop Battery for Apple Powerbook G4","review":"I just knew I would be without my computer for at least 10 days, due to the Christmas rush.

I went to a reputable computer repair center and was told that apple computers only use \\"original\\" apple batteries, not the replacement batteries. I had to return that battery and only could use my laptop with the charger. When I saw this add and read all the reviews I was convinced that it was the right one. NOT!!! It was the exact same type of replacement battery and I had to return this one also. I recommend to anyone who have an apple computer, spend the money and get original apple parts and save yourselves time and money!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Good Costa Book","review":"I enjoyed this book a great deal.

Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"God if you're up there...","review":"When I first heard the soundtrack to CLTG I had mixed feelings.One of the problems I had with it was that every single child on the cd over sings every song. It reminded me of Rent only with kids (Not that I didn't like Rent cause I did, but thats another review) and it was just too much. Also the song lyrics are no more complex that a saturday morning cartoon. After the first listen I put it away for about two monthes.Then last month I got it back out and relistened, While the problems still existed I listend to the recording with a diffrent state of mind and found that I thoroughly enjoyed it.The songs and stories took me back to when I was younger Granted i'm only 19 but...) and i had a nice trip down memory lane.Standouts include:ArnoldLike Everybody ElseA Simple Holiday SongKicker BrownHow Come?The best advice I can give you is that if you decide to buy it then give it more than one chance because it will probably grow on you and if not, sorry you wasted you money."},{"rating":"1","title":"well-intentioned, but...","review":"Children's letters manages to be both earnest and artificial, like the soundtrack to an extended Barney episode. Children are singing, but it's too often painfully obvious that a well-meaning grown-up is putting the words in their mouths. One or two songs manage to capture the spirit of the singer, especially a teenaged boy's song about the baseball cap he associates with his estranged father... but one trip through this disc will be enough for most listeners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Houses of the holy moly","review":"This is all metal... c'mon say it with me now...

Other highlights are \\"Getcha\\", the ambient and noisy \\"I'll Be Waiting\\", and the melancholy instrumental \\"Easy\\".There is 100% metal content and 0% suckage.

This match was alright but it could of been better. And it had DDP vs. The Giant which was a good match. The Ric Flair vs. Eric Bischoff match was kind of stupid. The Konnan vs. Chris Jericho match was alright. The best match on it was the Triangle match with Kidman vs. Juventud Guerrera vs. Rey Misterio Jr, That was the best match on it. But the rest Sucked! Take my advice, I ordered it on PPV and I rented it. This tape is a total rip off! Its definetly not worth 50 dollars. This Starrcade really puts the Starrcade legacy to shame. WCW had all this hype for the main event for nothing and the undercade was horrible!

What a suprise Nash takes the belt from Goldberg, officially starting the downward spiral in Goldberg's career. Worse yet is Nash's effort \\"his\\" big match, its like he's on no-dose. Common Nash show some pride in your work.

I do think this CD sounds better than the original release -- I played it on an HDCD compatible player (this is an HDCD, while the original was not), and the sound is more natural than the original. But it's not a huge improvement, and I'm sure some may not think it worth the extra expense. The disc was in perfect shape (unlike that of the previous reviewer), and the cover artwork/liner notes are faithful to the original LP. But there's nothing really special here -- no bonus tracks, no remixing from the original elements, just the best audio quality version of the original album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was really looking forward to this one","review":"The original CD sounds better to me than this one.

I will never forget or let go of this compilation of the silly and hopeful anthems of my youth. Bear in mind, you might not like this group if you're conservative! They're gay, environmentalist, human-rights oriented, i. e., ve-e-e-e-ry liberal :) Songs like Roam, Love Shack, and Junebug are happy-go-lucky songs to bounce up and do silly dances to, Deadbeat Club is deeply nostalgic, Topaz is chillingly futuristic and full of hope while hinting at environmentalism. Channel Z is a political rap in Fred's nasally twang over some of that unmistakable Keith guitar, outlining the extremely leftist ideals of the band sometimes with sarcasm, sometimes directly, but always silly. The album ends with a lazy instrumental that is as cozy as a lullaby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Growing Up FastI was somewhat disappointed with this book-it started to feel tedious after about a third of the way through and I easily could have put it down. For good. \\"Random Family\\", on the other hand, was awesome-a book I truly couldn't put down. This book was just too much of the same story after story and I did not truly care about anyone that was being written about. Just too much of the same thing in each chapter. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but Extreme","review":"This book has a lot of hadith but gives to much credit to some extreme hadith and ideas. I have a different opinion now of the writer, who I believe supports terroism. \\"A call to Jihad\\" is stepping across the line for some one who is translating Hadith. He should have kept his opinions out of the book.I cannot say Hadith should be given any credit because it was written by a bunch of \\"Persians\\" and Quaraish nobles who wanted to hyjack Islam for their own wicked purposes. This book is not about true Islam."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the one with \\"The Cutter\\" on it","review":"I mainly bought this because I really like the song \\"The Cutter\\" but haven't heard much else from this group besides the song they contributed to the Pretty in Pink soundtrack. While I wouldn't say this is a \\"great\\" album, it is a pretty good representative of its genre: ecclectic 1980s pop music. A few songs stand out (Cutter, Clay, Heads will roll) and there's a nice Arabic sounding theme that runs through many of the compositions which gives the album a nice exotic edge. Worth listening if you get the chance, but based on other reviews here, this isn't their best album so maybe it's not a good place to start if you're just starting to explore this band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adventurous and Great","review":"They were really \\"being all that they could be\\" at this point. They already had a formula for making great music. They added numerous new things into the stew here (Eastern instruments particularly) and upped the ante. Some of the material runs out of steam (on Side 2), but the recordings themselves are as lush and as brilliant as any I can remember in the history of what we call \\"rock music\\".The best tracks here (the first two tracks especially) are passionate, massively catchy, dense but affecting, and just out-and-out brilliant recordings. The emerging tendancy towards meloncholy downbeat songs is present, but held at bay by the brilliant pop/rock on Side 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"their best...nothing transitional here! TRANSCENDENTAL, yes","review":"this album conjures and invokes senses and forces of the himalayas...Shankar's touch adds weird urgency to the swirling sometimes despondent (and quite existential) mix.this is essential echo...and very much like the Banshees after they did JUJU, they realized they opened up something...i think they went one more step (a bit artier) with Ocean Rain.but this is simply by far their best.a challenging album for all emotions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holmes vs Ali !","review":"Need I say more two legends friends the two best heavyweights in history as far as slick boxers People learn all you can about these two champs !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sneak preview","review":"When it comes to user friendly video editing software these folks have done it well.

And it is FABULOUS!","review":"Josquin was one of the great composers of all time. This beautiful disk can get you a nice taste of the music. The voices blend so well and the horizontal layers are all cared for so the vertical structures are revealed, but not dominant. That is the way polyphonic music should work for music in the sacred style. In other places like tracks 4 & 6 there is a nice emphasis on the vertical structures without losing the linear voice leading.One really can't call the vertical structures CHORDS at this time, because such a concept did not exist.Track 13 on the death of Ockeghem is simply exquisite!This disk is a wonderful addition to your Josquin collection and if it is your first disk - Don't STOP here! Get his masses and other works. Josquin is absolutely stunning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Beauty","review":"This Cd was one I found at a Thrift shop and it is wonderful. the tonality and tuning of the singers is amazing, it's so easy to listen to because there are no little waves you usually get from less professional singers.

I would highly recommend this to any vocal major or even instrumentalists, these piece can easily be played in chamber settings.Very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to be missed!","review":"This is great music performed with love, understanding, and (when called for) humor (check out El Grillo!). The Hilliard Ensemble comes as close to perfection as we have any right to expect from mere mortals: the singing is unfailingly beautiful and musicianly, and this well-varied collection of short works by Josquin will inspire you to investigate the large-scale works (i.e., the Masses).

This documentary starts well and gives the viewer a taste of what it must have felt like to average 45+ miles/day for weeks on end. It has all the elements of a well-made documentary: ample footage of the run, interviews with friends and families, and of course, the agony of \\"da-feet.\\" I felt compelled as I watched it and slightly unsatisfied at the end, as if I'd just had a sugar-free diet drink instead of the real thing. The end comes too easily. It seemed as if the film-maker... director... er whomever, lost intensity for the project and suddenly, we're at Manning Park. My own aspirations for the PCT may cloud my judgment here. Ultra-runners may love this film, but I'm guessing thru-hikers will feel less affection. We love the trail; David loves the physical challenge."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing DVD about an amazing runner","review":"I'm not an ultramarathoner (yet), but really enjoyed watching this movie.

It was filmed by a professional documentary film maker and you get a fairly good sense of what running the Badwater is all about. \\"Bear\\" and \\"The Runner\\" seem pretty amateurish by comparison. Of the three, \\"The Runner\\" is the worst. The director seems like someone more used to making commercials than movies. He periodically throws out nerve-wracking montages of images (20 images in 20 seconds) accompanied by very annoying hyperactive drums. I also didn't care much for \\"the runner\\", David Horton. Maybe it was too many Clint Eastwood and Charles Bronson movies as a kid, but overly emotional, touchy-feely men who will cry at the drop of a hat tend to creep me out a bit. No doubt, considering the type of running he does, Horton is one tough dude, but I prefer guys to be a bit more reserved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat boring and tangential","review":"The description of this video from websites and the DVD jacket is misleading. Very little scenery from the PCT is shown, with most footage stemming from just a few parts of the trail and experience. This was all about one man and how special he and the crew seem to think he is. The most interesting part of the film was when Flying Brian helped David Horton through the High Sierra. That was the only part that really did justice to this magnificent trail. Interviews with Horton's family were mildly interesting, but much of this--as well as interviews with David at stops--seemed tangential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"This item is perfect for school lunches.

I ordered 6 of these cases and just ordered 4 more for future growth. The case is canvas but seemingly sturdy. The sleeves are lightweight.

But it's message is downright repugnant. It endorses a vigiliante law system that basicially disregards basic civil liberties, and justifies police brutality, an especially ugly message in light of recent police shootings. It's quite startling seeing this soon after Eastwood's \\"Unforgiven\\" which essentially has a reversed version of this message. A superb thriller, with Eastwood creating one of the more memerable screen personas in American cinema, but like \\"Birth of a Nation\\" or a Wagner opera, this is evil art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Clints Best by far!!!","review":"I watched this movie for the first time this past winter.

Director Don Siegel's gritty realism works to reincarnate the classic John Wayne hero image-a tough, independent, two-fisted good guy- to a funkier, more turbulent period. Eastwood's taciturn, squinty-eyed protagonist is the new rugged individualist, who, in a bureaucratic world, cuts through everything to get the job done.

McQueen should have won an Oscar for that performance. \\"Dirty Harry\\" is inferior in every way: script, direction, sound, and acting. I had trouble staying with \\"Dirty Harry\\" what with all the 70s clichés that kept popping up to spoil it. But \\"Bullit\\" was fascinating from start to finish. Like James Dean, you have a hard time keeping your eyes off Steve McQueen, whether he is speaking or reacting. \\"Dirty Harry\\" is a very mediocre film that looks more like something made for TV, and it has not aged well. \\"Bullit\\" is the real deal and deserves the moniker of \\"iconic\\".

But you can only nit pick at certain things when the rest of the things are great. And most of this film is first-rate. The last adventure film this good was \\"The Fugitive.\\" But I'd still rather watch \\"Dirty Harry\\" for the 1,000,0001st time, than \\"The Fugitive\\" a third time.

In reality, mass panic would ensue, like it did in the DC area a few years ago,With that said, the story here was awesome. One man, standing for what's right, going after the evil criminal despite being blocked every step of the way by bureaucracy and bleeding-heart lawyers.A movie like this would never be made today, because our society has become too feminized and liberal.

But I'm glad I took that gamble with the cinnabar set. It's not as deep of a red as cran berry juice per say... but probably closer to the skin of a red pomegranate or granada fruit. As for the quality of the pieces, it's exceptional for the price. It's been through our dishwasher about 10 times now and I can't see and damage or fading in color.They're so easy on the eyes that now we want to put in glass windows in our cupboards so we can see them.

After the first year, however, the batting inside began to slide to the edges and corners. The corners are particularly bad with very large clumps of batting in each of them.

This is unfortunate because in all other regards it is a nice comforter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Compelling Read...","review":"Unorthodox and fascinating. A kaleidoscope of ideas, intriguing musings, and arresting prose. A book that comes to us seemingly from another dimension, with delicious perspective and convicting principles.

Escher were an author...","review":"...I'd imagine his novel would read like Amnesia. This is not a light read. It is not the sort of book you would take to the beach on a sunny August afternoon, but the sort you read at 3:00am under the covers. Amnesia may be an intelligent and highly quotable book, but it is also confusing. I will say that everything one really needs to know is within its pages, but the question lies in whether the reader knows for what he or she is looking. Diligent or not, every reader will undeniably learn something from this novel. It is unique, compelling, and most likely unlike anything you've read until now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing and compelling","review":"Like a rotted tooth or a troubling sore I return to this book.

First ever.This printer is a complete waste of money. I NEVER print in color, and yet the various color always seem to exhaust themselves as if by magic. So, now, with a one page printing job on my hand, I can't use my printer because it ran out of the light blue. This printer will NOT let you print in b/w if your color levels are down, but, again, I NEVER USE the colors. They are simply drained slowly with every black and white printing job I send to the machine.Besides, it's extraordinarily slow - it takes forever to come online, it asks a whole bunch of unnecessary questions before proceeding with the printing job, and, get this, it SHAKES on my desk in a way I've never seen an appliance do.Seriously, this is an incredibly ridiculous printer. No one should buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the hassle!","review":"We bought this printer for our business so we would have the ability to print off labels and also do photo quality brochures,catalogs, flyers, etc. So far, I think I've spent more time unjamming paper from the back of the printer than I have actually using it! It just isn't capable of grabbing label sheets without creating a paper jam on at least every third print out. I can't even say how many sheets of label paper this machine has ruined for me already. I also discovered that it won't do two sided printing without an error message for the second side of the sheet. I ruined over fifty sheets of paper and a whole lot of ink figuring out this problem and ended up hand feeding each page just to complete one catalog. The print quality is okay when it does work but I think it won't be long before I'll have to find a better quality machine for the business.

You have to buy only HP paper to print and that's expensive and the photos stick together. You can't print more than 5 or 10 pictures in one print job or the printer for some bizarre reason gets confused and restarts the job from the beginning every time you have to change paper.I still can't figure out how to make the stated dimensions of the printed picture conform to what's actually printed meaning many cutoff heads.This is trash.Go with a less expensive photo printer.

I've tried to find info in the online manual to no avail. I'm ready to take a sledgehammer to it. Look around before buying this printer...they can't all be this frustrating, can they? Can they?

If a color cartridge is EMPTY it says either replace it or continue printing in B&W;, that's fair. Keep spare color cartridges on hand. Photo quality is very good indeed.

Even with the assurances from the brochures and manuals that you can bypass this auto-sensing, you cannot. Setting the paper source to \\"transparency\\" does no good. If you have preprinted checks or invoices or any other paper with printing on both sides, this printer will flat out refuse to print on the form. For some this will be no big deal.

I always have to print over, or trim the large paper. I'm not sure where the bug is, in Apple's software or HP's.When I finally get the paper right, the color and sharpness of the print is great.

Of exceptional note is the photo print quality. When using the HP Photo paper, the results are simply superior. You cannot tell that it was printed on an ink-jet and not from a professional photo print service. With that said, the HP software installation was a nightmare. I have a year old Dell XPS 400 running Windows XP and had to install the HP software three times before it would work properly. It was a frustrating, and to me, unnecessary experience. If HP can build such an outstanding printer, they should be able get the installation drivers right, especially since XP has been out for so long. If not for the software, I would have definitely given it a higher rating. So, 5 stars for printing (especially photos), 4 stars overall. Note to HP: Get the installation drivers right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Album!","review":"This album is great! Since purchasing it, I have listened to it countless times on repeat.

The whole thing just sounds slopping and sounds like a little Bach, and a little Beethoven pushed together. Like he took the first half of a piece from Bach then took the last part of one of Beethoven's piece and put them together to make is own song. I am a classical, rock, and flamenco guitarist and even from a guitarist stand point yeah he plays some fast licks but the whole album just doesn't have a leg to stand on. The only song that is even a worth while listen is Toccata. Don't waste your money or time. There is nothing special about this album at all. What makes it even worse is that it is Yngwie doing this album.

Some weird elements in some spots. Overall enjoyable. But not easy on the ears. The orchestra drowns the guitar. The EQs are all weird. There is not very good definition on the sound. Could have been way better. Maybe a remaster version will be different sounding. Listening on various equipment and speakers, I still feel the recording and especially mixing could have been done much better. Orchestra at times appears too distant, very low definition to orchestra or guitar sounds. Playing louder on a hifi sound a bit better but still the orchestra drowns the guitar many times.

Yngwie spends most the time out of sync with the orchestra . The fact that his work was recorded on a different continent shows . This is not Yo Yo Ma here . It isn't even Rick Wakeman ( am I showing my age ? ). If you like modern musicians working WITH an orchestra try Nightwish, The Moody Blues or Renaissance . I actually like Yngwie's work and have been buying his material since his 1st. Rising Force album . He is one of the most talented guitar players in the world . His Baroque style stands in stark contrast to the Blues or Jazz based chord structures that most other guitar greats use . It is just disappointing that when Yngwie gets his chance to take his material and talent to this level , it fails to impress ."},{"rating":"2","title":"SPEECHLESS","review":"I was completely speechless when I first heard Yngwie Malmsteen. He is arguebly one of the best guitarists in the world. I mean what he can do with a guitar is the likes of which has never been heard before. Combining neo classical elements with old fashion thrash metal. Not just metal. Blues, pop, classical, latin, this guy can play them all. This is definitly one of the albums I'm going to remeber most. Wow, there is no one that can compare to Yngwie and theres some pretty amazing guitar players in metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"TREMENDOUS WORK!!","review":"This album is Yngwie's best so far. I used to be a Malm fan, but changed my mind after listening to his \`Alchemy\` album. However this one is really worth appreciation. After a long satisfying prelude (which is also derived from Yngwie's earlier works) the Cavalino Rampante shows how electric guitar fits the classical sound best. Inspired from Bach, Vivaldi, Pagannini and Tschiakovsky's compositional forms, Yngwie introduces electric guitar, without bass or drums, to classical arena. Although his Fugal composition is wrong, Yngwie does it and produces best and the most original album in his career since \`Rising Force\`."},{"rating":"1","title":"Composer? How about just Poser...","review":"On the cover you can see Yngwie posing as a classical musician. I guess posing as Ritchie Blackmore is reserved for his Rock albums. First, There is no depth in any of these songs, only melodic in the sense of copying entire phrases from Bach, Vivaldi etc, nothing that is original and no real melodies to be found. To sum up this cd, It's a compilation of copied phrases from real composers with improvised fillers. For what it is, it's a neat gimmick, but not real classical music. Yngwie is a excellent rock electric guitar improviser, but for himself to pose as a classical composer is a insult to classical music. As for the playing itself. Yngwie does a decent job, but if we are to compare him to the best classical musicians, this sounds sloppy with no dynamics. Electric guitarist Tony MacAlpine or Michael Angelo have much more controlled technique. Yngwie shines best in his early Rising Force albums with Jens Johansson."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is a joke","review":"I think the compositions of Yngwie are really bad. Always playing in minor keys and copying the cadenzas from Bach and Paganini Compositions. Is 0% original. The chords and rhythm sounds always in the same way and solo part too. There's nothing to listen but scales, arpeggios and more scales and more arpegios, nothing else. The guy is fast, but he plays silly passages using always the same patterns. He's not impressing, is boring, a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metallica bad Malmsteen good","review":"I have been a guitarist for the past 20 years.

This one would follow an amazing string of 3 previous albums; all considered classics by both fans and critics. \\"Volume 4\\" would see the quality dip oh so slightly and find the band experimenting with new sounds, but this was still Sabbath in their prime and another great addition to their catalogue. The best songs on this one are probably their love song to Cocaine \\"Snowblind\\" and the rocking \\"Supernaut\\". The album contains the band's first ballad in \\"Changes\\". Whether this song works or not has been the subject of great debate among Sabbath fans for years. I like it ok, but it was probably a shock to their fan base back in 1972.

Vol. 4 contains all the elements that made their first three albums great, plus a lot more, creating one of Sabbath's best and most diverse studio performances. Plus, with the song \\"Snowblind,\\" the band becomes one of the first to seriously deal with the REAL effects of cocaine. Vol.4 is a great album from beginning to end.

It has great metal songs on it and still stands as a great example of what metal should be melodic and well written and sung. Although this one is the most thudding of all sabbaths discs to be sure.

This album also marked the newer more experimental Sabbath, it has more substance to it than the first 3 albums do. This one also features more distorted guitar playing by Tony Iommi, which is some of the best sounding ever.

This album mixes heavy metal, hard rock, and psychedelia, and is one of the greatest albums EVAR!1. Wheels of Confusion/The Straightener - 10/10 One of Sabbath's greatest songs. An almost psychedelic song.2. Tomorrow's Dream - 10/10 Almost seems like Wheels of Confusion/The Straightener Part II. Another great song.3. Changes - 10/10 Sabbath fans seem to be split on this one. I presonally think it's a great song.4. FX - 9.5/10 A short little psychedelic instrumental.5. Supernaut - 10/10 The best on the album, and possibly Sabbath's best.6. Snowblind - 9.5/107. Cornucopia - 9.5/108. Laguna Sunrise - 10/10 A great acoustic instrumental.9. St. Vitus Dance - 8.4/1010.

It is hard to direct the spray. 3. The power goes off (supposed to be a safety feature) and then you have to actually unplug it to reset it. Just using the dial does not reset the power. Ugh!! 4. It tips over easy on the board. Last beef = 5. It is hard to store because you can't wrap the cord around the handle to store it. (The handle design won't grab the cord, so you have to wait for the iron to cool completely and wrap it around the iron head.)And it tips easily on the shelf.Pro: The only pro is that the cord is nice and long and flexible.

I never got the excel program to work. The battery constantly went dead and lost all the programs. The system was slow retieving information. I dropped it at work and sent it to HP. They wanted over 250 dollars to fix it. Actually that was the good news.Another pharmacist told me to buy an 89 dollar visor. Now I can find free programs that are better than the ones I was going to buy. It also has a soft case to protect it which the Jornado didn't have unless you wanted to buy it. The OS system is much faster than the Windows system.HP customer service wasn't very good either.

And the number for the US servce is on the west coast - and i'm not!

I'm keeping it and some of the features are a real benefit. But in general it hasn't exceeded my expectations and in a lot of ways it's been a disappointment.The problems with earlier Windows CE handhelds haven't been addressed. It's poorly laid out, too many menus. Too many buttons for too little space. And despite its name, the Jordanas don't fit well in a pocket.I think Microsoft's problem with handhelds is they see the world in terms of Windows and keep trying to make the CEs more like the desktop OS. Rather than making the layout more simple and intuitive, Microsoft has added more applications.I'd advise others considering this model to get something cheaper for now, like a Palm model. Perhaps in 5 or 10 years Microsoft will get it right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bulky - HP made a mistake with the screen","review":"One thing about the Palm. You may complain about the fact that it does not handle attachments via email and that the PocketPCs do it effortlessly, yet when it comes to design they beat the PocketPCs hands down.Take a look at this HP Jornada. First HP confessed (as it is a company with integrity) that due to a manufacturing error that screen was not going to handle thousands of colours as originally advertised. The second thing is that the design is bloody awful. It is big and clumsy looking. Almost like something designed in the old Soviet Union.I must admit it's not as horrible looking as the Casio. But close.My advice to you is stay well away from this one. And any of the PocketPCs except perhaps the Compaq IPaq which is extremely groovy looking.Wait for HP to redesign their unit.HP has been doing small devices for nearly 3 decades.

I have my Jornada synchronzied to my computer at work and home, making it easy to keep my contact and calendar on both machines up-to-date. I previously owned the 200LX whose motherboard failed. I, of course, did not have a backup plan, so I literally lost two years of my life. That will not be the problem with this machine.3. The reader is the greatest.

I have had to reset this thing more times then I can count. And just last week it seems to have totally locked up for good. I lost all my data on the PPC and it will not resync with my desktop. I place it in the cradle and nothing happens. That's not new but before if I turned it off and on a few times, perhaps slide it in and out of the cradle a few times and perhaps rebooted my PC eventually my PC and PPC would again notice each other. This time nothing works.This thing should last longer and be more reliable. All the features in the world are of no use at all if the thing is not reliable.

There isn't much software available for ti now though I kept hearing promises of things becoming available in the future. From my experience with Microsoft, we are going to see more things available that requires the new OS and this has a good chance of being left behind.

Neat. It's my working companion (loaded with medicine texts).BEWARE: 1- CSTN screen means direct sunlight won't let you see anything. 2- You'll fill up your 32MB or RAM very soon (so many uses...) so be prepared to wish a 64MB compactflash card (don't worry about buying an extra jacket or adapter: it's there).NICE looking: Executive class looking. iPAQ looks like a toy, and seems very plastic to me.

I've been listnening to it, trying to like it, but there just isn't much there to like. I'm actually kind of pissed that I wasted $20 buck on it. I suggest you keep your money, or buy one of the other WASP recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Rate!","review":"H. S. Bear seems to be one of the best kept secrets around. His writing in general is superb. This book is a well organized first course in analysis broken into digestible chunks and surprisingly thorough. It covers the basic topics and then introduces the reader to complex analysis and later to Lebesque integration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Disappointing Ending","review":"I don't know what happened to Mr Card but after enjoying the entire series which I found was excellent, this story was a very obvious disappointment. There were plot holes after plot holes. Things he's lead up to for 5 books were ignored and glossed over. It didn't even seem like the same author wrote it.Overall I loved the series and despised the conclusion. So the question is, do I still recommend it to others? I have no idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"DULL AT BEST","review":"Another chapter in the saga of Alvin Maker that seems to have no objective, form or substance. As I read this book I continually wondered when I would finally get to a part with some interest or relevance, I never found it. Follow Alvin as he whups up on the nasty white man and saves the blacks, injuns and French. Oh yeah, he starts to build his crystal city but not in any way you might have expected.Is it bad? No. What it is is boring. Too bad, I have been following this story from the very beginning and really enjoyed most of it. There must be some extremely virulent disease going through the fantasy/SF community that has wiped out the ability of many writers to actually finish stories. Hopefully they will come up with a cure soon.Unfortunately it will be too late for this one. It is DOA, terminally boring. I can't in all good conscience recommend this one, even to Mr. Cards most fevered fans. Hopefully he will put this puppy to sleep in his next volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"give it a chance!!!!","review":"i loved this book, it was really great i could hardely put it down. it's funny how it has history in it and how they play it into the book so that it actually makes some sense. i really liked arthurs character, he was so funny and reminded me a lot of my brother. it had so much suspence in it. it's a great book that people should just read to give it a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Orson Scott Car Fan","review":"I have never read an OSC book I didn't like. This one is one of the better ones, though. The characters (as always with Card) are well developed and easy to care about, the situations are bizarre and engrossing (Alvin meets Abe Lincoln in this one), and the book leaves you wanting more. I read this in three days. Why didn't I give it five stars? Well, because I've read Ender's Game and The Lord of the Rings and a few other classics, which this book does not measure up to. It didn't leave a strong impression on me, but it was about as entertaining as books get anyway. Not something that will stick with you forever, but it's thoroughly entertaining. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.","review":"I love, love, love Orson Scott Card's Alvin Maker series, but he is just pushing it now. It's time to let it go man! This book isn't a complete waste of time, but it's not something I would read instead of say, doing laundry. It's just not that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Orson Scott Card series peters out...","review":"Like the Ender seriers did with Children of the Mind and the Homecoming series did with Earthborn, the Alvin Maker series sputters to a conclusion (hopefully) in The Crystal City.Not that this book was terrible, but it just didn't seem to have any purpose other than gettin Alvin and his followers to the Crystal City, and there just wasn't anything interesting enough that happened along the way. I think they were all too good, and too powerful, that you knew they would always do the right thing, and you also knew that they always could, so there wasn't any doubt about the conclusion.If you've read the rest of the series, you'll probably want to read this book just for closure, just don't expect much."},{"rating":"1","title":"complete dissapointment","review":"I have been a huge fan of card for over 20 years, but this book is horrible. I cannot believe card wrote this. The characters seem like flat parodies of the people I loved from the first three books. Quit reading the series after Prentice alvin if you want to keep feeling good about it. How a brilliant premise and three treasured books could be turned to such tripe I will never understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great follow up to the last book in the series!","review":"I was looking forward this book after having read the first five, an i'm looking forward to another one soon!!!

I fell in love with his writing with the Ender sci-fi series, but I also enjoy reading his fantasy works, as well. He is able to pull me into his stories immediately. I don't want to put his books down, having to know what is going to happen to my favorite characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"I started reading this series a few years ago and got all the way to heartfire before it just completely lost me.That said.. i was in half price books the other day bored and saw this. I Thought eh.. sure... I started the series, lets finish it.It's worse than heartfire in my opinion, and I didn't even particularly enjoy heartfire. So Preachy. Maybe I didn't catch the preacher like talk in the first books because I was getting caught up in the story. There are certainly elements about it I enjoyed... but mostly, the hell is this? lolI read it, I finished what I started. Now I'm done with Mr. card for good.Thanks for Enders game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps the best resource of its kind!","review":"My colleagues have created a truly useful book. It convers all the basic topics in clinical medical ethics in a way that is practical and useful for clinicians. Its vest pocket size also means it can be carried on teaching rounds. This book is also ideal as a supplementary text in undergraduate and graduate courses in biomedical ethics. Along with a basic summary of major points on each topic, it provides current bibliographic references for further reading. I imagine many philosophy professors can use this information to aid in syllabus construction. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slightly predictable, but loveable..","review":"I bought this book as an impulse purchase at a cool independant book store, and I'm truly glad that I did. At first, it was a slow read, but towards the middle it gains momentum and just keeps rolling till the end. The young aviators charater development is truly depictive of the \\"Old School\\" Naval Aviator mentallity (do anything for women attitude, and rather die than look stupid). All in all, the book is slightly predictable, incredibly humerous, and a great relaxing read for any aviation buff.

I loved it! I learned so many things on Harriet. I don't want to spoil the book so that is all I will say. If you don't like the begining, KEEP READING! I hated how slow this book started! That's how slow it started. KEEP READING ALL THE TIME!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good mid-level reader book","review":"I got this book for my 3rd grade daughter who is reading slightly above grade level. The stories of Tubman's life were a bit dry (not really a dramatic telling), and the historical fact segments inserted into each chapter lacked context. But the general sense of the scope of her work on the railroad, her personal commitment, and the additional things she did in her life were generally well communicated. Readers certainly come away with a greater appreciation for Tubman's contribution despite numerous personal challenges."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harriet and the URR","review":"I read this book many years ago and Petry's works of fiction never fail to excite my imagination. Twenty years ago I took students from the high school in Ithaca, New York, to visit Harriet Tubman's home and grave in Auburn, New York. Petry gives life to Tubman's adventures, which stay with the reader long after the book is finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a very interesting book.","review":"I read the book Harriet Tubman. This book was about a young girl who is raised on a plantation. She passes a very difficult life on the plantation.The master always contracts her out and the people who get her treat her very bad.Then when she grows up, she hears a story of a slave who was running away and he suddenly takes the underground railroad and gets to freedom.So she decides to go to the North to freedom by the under ground railroad.When she gets to the North she decides to help out the rest of the slaves by the underground railroad.Then she helps more than 300 slaves get to freedom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great subject, tough read.","review":"My fourth grade daughter is doing a book report on Harriet Tubman.

This book details how members of Congress are nothing more than pawns of big corporations and industry leaders. Not only does it expose how Congress is bought and sold, it also sheds light on how much time Congressional members spend begging for donations versus the time they should be spending dealing with the issues that they are put in place to solve.This book is disturbing, but it also illustrates how to solve the problem, and what some states have begun to do to solve this problem. Hopefully more people will realize that corporate money should not be running the country the way it is, and this book is a good place to begin with that lesson."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT SELLER","review":"The product is excellent, the smell great, if I liked it and would recommend it to a friend, THANK YOU, FOR SALE"},{"rating":"2","title":"Recomendado","review":"Perfume con aroma agradable, para mi es una fragancia para utilizarla a diario.

There is no sensationalizing, the author is well-informed and presents the information straighforwardly. That alone is quite enough to make one realize that we are in a very risky health situation. The second aspect of the book is an absolutely damning description of the FDA and the EPA and their failure in the role of protecting the food supply and the environment.

I have a bunch of Sandisk memory devices and I found three out of the 8 were counterfeit, including one very expensive CF card.Sandisk might be a fine manufacturer and getting a bad rap because of the counterfeit items.But as a buyer you've got to ask yourself two questions:1. If some of these have even come through Amazon, which is a very reputable company in my opinion, what's my risk in buying a Sandisk device? This is particularly true when you can buy an equivalent Kingston device for less.2. What is Sandisk doing to go after the counterfeit market? When this problem happened to Microsoft they clearly went after the perpetrators, let everyone know what was happening so they could better avoid the problems, and creatively came up with solutions to help fix the problem. I've got the strong feeling that Sandisk would rather hide the problem after talking with their support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excessive Shipping Charges","review":"I was charged $19.96 for shipping 3- SanDisks weighing 8oz. or less!This was shipped via USPS Ground.

I purchased this cd because of the song, Two Occasions, which I grew up listening to. I liked the keyboard work on that song and it did not disappoint in that area. The rest of the tracks though did not interest me. I have to say that I did not hear the other tracks before so I need to let it grow on me. So far, though, I don't care to listen to the whole album.

Nevertheless, the 43 koans (translated to english for the first time by Thay) are a true piece of art, which make this book a good addition to any Zen practitioner's library.I feel the book \\"Meet the Real Dragon\\" by Gudo Wafu Nishijima goes deeper into the essence of Zen practice, and therefore into the essence of life itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peace","review":"This beautiful man is all peace.

It installed easily and held more than enough for our 1,400 mile trip. However, on the second day of the trip the car top carrier began to shred. It had to be held together with duct tape in order to make the last leg of our 1,400 mile trip. We returned it and got a full refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wind tore the cover","review":"We packed the soft carrier pretty full but the contents shifted back a little once underway. We could see it through the moonroof andthe carrier seemed to be slipping backwards. We have an SUV with top rails but not cross rails. When we arrived we discovered that the top tore in several places on the backside of the load. Not near any straps so it must have been the wind force. It was worrysome on the road to wonder about it. May not use it again. Would not recommend unless you have crossrails on your car and use bungee cords too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Packright was the right pick for us.","review":"Just got back from our family vacation which was a 5 hour drive - one way. The PackRight Sport 1 worked exceptionally well for us. Put a layer of shelving liner between the top of the Rogue and the carrier, then attached only two straps to the luggage rack to secure the carrier. Worked perfectly. No slipping, no noise, no problems. I've read other reviews stating the zipper was difficult. I will admit the zipper is a bit sluggish around the corners but if you just take your time there should be no problems. We were lucky enough not to have any rain on our trip, but I did run the car through a car wash where I manually spray everything down. No sign of any moisture inside. Overall I am very pleased with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for family vacations","review":"The bag fit cloths and beach toys for a family vacation. It has a water-resistant zipper feature that folds over and velcros shut. I probably over-stuffed it, as the velcro came undone in the drive. That said, we did drive through some rain and everything inside was completely dry. I used it with the accessory mat that kept it from sliding around on roof and protected my roof from getting scratched."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"We were excited about this item, but sorely disappointed! Right after receiving it we put it on our car, got ready to head to Yellowstone, lightly tugged on the strap to slide it so that it was centered on the roof (and I do need to mention that it was not fully packed or even strapped down yet), when the stitching came undone and the plastic ring, meant to hold all the weight and force of holding it on the roof, fell off. There was no way to attach it after that. If the strap couldn't handle such a small tug, there was no way it would have be able to handle a stronger tug to make sure it was tight enough to stay on the roof!"},{"rating":"2","title":"land before time","review":"These are great movies for children.WE own all of the land before time.

This movie, however, is just not the way to go about it. There was not much depth to any of the characters. The plot was weak and alot of the scenes felt like they were just filler and served no purpose really, especially the scene where they were playing pool and the scenes with Rain's mother which could have been utilized to give the characters depth but remained underused. I did not believe Rain at all, the acting wasn't very good in my opinion. The two stars are for the subject of the film and for two actors, Wes Studi, whose character was the most interesting.

Like the others said he hit big with his first hit \\"Nite and Day;\\" and then with the release of his debut album 1988's \\"In Effect Mode\\" fyi sold two million copies. Anyway, this album is a transition; but it's a very good album. I slept on this album for many years; due to the fact that I was only nine years old in 1990. Moreover, now that i'm grown I just found this album and am falling in love with it! I do remember \\"In Effect Mode,\\" because my sister use to play the hell out of that album; but this album is just as good as that album.With slow jams like \\"So Special,\\" \\"Touch You\\" and fast cuts like \\"Missunderstanding,\\" this album will be sure to take you back when music was actually music. Not like today, where Justin Timberlake can't even play a keyboard.In conclusion, the album is off the hook."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Realistic Look..","review":"First off, I want to say that I almost didn't read this. I believed this to be the first volume in the series, and I was immediately turned off by the artwork. Then, just to be fair, I gave the book a chance. I learned that this was the second volume and that I needed to find out what had happened before. Thankfully, Wikipedia exists, so I was quickly able to catch up. I have to say, this series is a realistic look at how society would most likely deal with superheroes. They would, of course, be viewed with some stigmatism by the non-powered members of society. This was pretty inventive, and made me think of Alan Moore's Watchmen. Having read many of the other books in the series now, this book really just brings the audience in slowly to get them used to what the heck is going on. I am glad I gave this one a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"This album is gorgeous, mainly because of Te Kanawa's moving interpretations, and of course, her voice. Te Kanawa's ability for 'floaty' French music is striking...for a big, rich voice to achieve light, legato sound is unusual in opera today, and is very pleasant to the ear. If you want French arias, this is the CD for you!

This series was supposed to be the tv networks answer to \\"I Love Lucy\\". It failed by far, to meet that type show.

Mine is already slightly loose after a couple of hours of play. No support for Win7, and it shows up in the games. The feeling is king of imprecise, like playing with a keyboard. Even a gamepad is more fun to play!!The pedals are the worst. They are too hard, and the base too light. The pedals are too near. So it either moves by itself or you touch two pedals at times, and you always have to push hard on them to react in the game.

Very easy to use, install, and configure the Genius F1 Racing Wheel is really the ultimate device for PC racing games. Why use the board or a smaller game controller when you can add more realism and ease to your racing experience? The only downside to this wheel is the size. It takes a while to get used to the small size for driving comfort and can even get in the way a little when not in use (but I have a compact computer desk with minimal storage space). Otherwise, it is a A rated device that'll really enhance your gameplay and after some getting use to, your racing performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this.","review":"It's amazing to think I spent nearly 40 dollars on this. This wheel is probably worth 5 dollars at a used parts store. With the PS2, there's about a 40 degree play... in other words, nothing happens until you turn the wheel almost completely, at which point the direction is maxed and any game you're playing you wipe out. The pedals are too close together and almost impossible to use. It's impossible to mount and use effectively. On the PC, your system will lag so badly, it will make any game unplayable. This is completely useless and i threw it away after one use, with no regrets. I watch every penny I spend, I feel like a huge fool for wasting my hard earned money on this horrible piece of plastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Far, So Good...","review":"Honestly, I don't see why this has such low reviews, but then again, I've only been using it for the last 4 days.

IT ONLY TURNS 90 DEGREES!!!--THATS RIGHT... ONLY 90 DEGREES. If your new to the steering wheel world 90 degrees doesn't mean anything to you, but you need more than 90 degrees to race around an oval track or you will be banging into the wall every turn!

I have only used for aprox. 8 hours of recording. I powered on the camera, finished the tape that was currently in the recorder, and it suddenly powered off. I had noticed the battery was fully charged when I was recording so I knew it wasn't a battery issue. We then found there was no way to manually eject the tape since it is a motorized ejection process. We contact Sharp who suggested to remove the battery and reseat (which we had already tried) and if that did not help then it would have to be sent to a service center for $$$'s. The quality is very disappoining considering the camcorder was used so little and was always taken care of. We eventually took the camcorder apart ourselves destroying it just to salvage the video tape inside since it is more cost effective to purchase a new recorder than to send $$$'s to repair a junk camcorder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Barn Mailbox","review":"The customer service and shipping from this company were excellent!I guess I didn't believe the other reviews and thought I would get one of the \\"good\\" ones.

This book was of no help to me what so ever during my Exchange install. The book is poorly written. The chapter order makes no sense at all. The index is useless. The whole book seems to be written to tell about Exchange 2000, but not give any useful information. The authors should be ashamed, and I think they would be, but I don't think they read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obtuse reading;","review":"This book has some information that is useful, however most of what I needed to know was difficult to find and implement. The lack of useful guidance with clear cut reasoning for milestone steps was frustrating (i.e. organization naming and bringing in additional domains into your empty root that have existing Exchange organization). Buying this book was not the best use of our limited funds!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money","review":"Unfortunately, someone already used the appropriate title for this book. The alternate name should have indeed been Worst Tech Book Ever.This book is around 800 pages, and yet devoid of anything resembling useful information.The illustrations (other than the screen shots) are all either overly complicated, or are not detailed enough. The discussion of protocols, while taking up about a third of the book, is needlessly repetitive and never offers any detail of substance. Additionally, subjects such as backups are covered by a few pages that can best be summed up by \\"This would be a good Idea\\".Really, this is simply terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed it as a kid and my kids are enjoying it now.","review":"Kids love the dvd and their getting to know the stories of the bible at the same time..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Less of the loud accompanyment please!","review":"Ofra's Haza's singing on this album is stunning, where we can hear her above the loud accompanyment. I just hope that with modern recording technology they will reissue her work with the background toned down so that we can enjoy the beautiful soaring voice. There was none like her. Whenever I hear Ofra's voice on a sound track I recognize it instantly. for my taste, it is the \\"dance club\\" rhythmic beat that it too loud. I prefer Kaddish and Slave Dream where the background music stays in the background."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I can try to articulate the emotion that this singer brings out in her music but I will not bring her complete justice. Her voice is unreal, it sounds as if she is an angel, taking a listener to incredible hights before unreached. Each track is complete, in and of itself. Everyone should take a moment to appreciate such genuine genius talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of Ofra Haza.","review":"Having bought Shaday and Kirya by miss Haza, i bought Desert Wind with the notion that it would be as fantastic as the aforementioned. Boy was i wrong. Gone are the heavy Yemenite/Israeli beats and flavor, as is Haza singing in Hebrew. Instead, I found her beautiful voice swallowed up by abhorrent 80's synth-pop cheese and benal lyrical content, with Hebrew only in the chorus at most. There is not a single song, with the exception of \\"Slave Dream\\" that I could bear to listen to all the way through, and most of the songs are laughably bad. So, fans of Haza's other works, do yourself a favor and save your [money] and buy Shaday or Kirya. Unless you want a good laugh, then by all means, purchase away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good...","review":"As a dedicated bike commuter, I need and use a lot of lights. This one seemed like a great deal (and it's a Planet Bike, which are usually well thought out products), but it turned out not to be so. It doesn't seal at all, it has holes in the casing, and any moisture at all causes it to either A) stay on permanently, B) run down the batteries, C) completely disable the switch. I got about one year out of it before the rains destroyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sturdy","review":"I had problems with this light not staying in the mount. Finally it came apart while riding at 25mph scattering parts and batteries to unknown locations. I didn't hit a bump or anything, the case just opened up and sent parts in various directions. It won't work well for lighting your route, but as a flashing light pointed at oncoming traffic it gets attention. It is cheap for a reason!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Let others see you","review":"Don't count on this one as your primary light source. Not enough power. But in flashing mode it draws attention. Makes others see you (thats what I wanted).Its very small & lightweight. Easy to install. Nice looking MICROlight!"},{"rating":"1","title":"24 Hours","review":"I received this light last Wednesday, rode home from work that night, and while riding back to work the next morning (after about 10 miles and less than a day of life) the light joined the ranks of the other suicide jumpers people have apparently encountered with this model, popping off the bracket while riding probably 12mph down a smooth road. Slightly frustrating.The design overall is also far inferior to that of the 3LED Beamer, which I'd had previously but was stolen. The Beamer is most definitely worth the bit of extra money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light committed suicide","review":"I got myself a pretty new bike, so I wanted a pretty new headlight. This fit my fancy. However, after a short time of riding the light popped off its mount. I thought I might have put it on incorrectly, so I carefully returned the light to its mount. However, on my usual commute the light came flying off and fell to the ground in many pieces. I haven't gotten more than about 50 miles on this bike with the light in place. Since a light that won't stay on the handlebars is worthless, I'm giving this product the lowest rating. Now I need to shop for a new light, or maybe just put back the old 2-C battery light from my old bike that stayed in place for thousands of miles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Owned 3 - they all died","review":"Sadly, this neat little light is very sensitive to moisture. Like other reviewers have said, any moisture at all causes the light to either turn on and stay on or it kills the switch entirely so it won't turn on. I bought two initially, one failed quickly and the manufacturer replaced it. But, the replacement died too. And then 3rd one died."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great-but batteries $$$","review":"Great little light, but next light will use AA ,so I don't need to shop andpay $$$ for n batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daylight","review":"Bought this for my son who goes to the gym at night on his bike. No problem seeing where he is going with this one. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good as a visibility light, but not an accommodating bracket","review":"This has a great quick release mechanism that is very secure. However, the mounting bracket does not easily accommodate my handle bars. It comes with a rubber insert but the insert is actually too thick. I used electric tape to build up the mounting spot and it is fine on that. It is the lack of flexibility in the mounting hardware that knocked a star off.I'm only using this light for riding after dark to meet bike laws and to be seen by others. It is not powerful enought to light your path well if you are riding at a quick pace on a dark street or if you are doing any sort of mountain biking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome light","review":"Nice bike light for the right price. Very happy with decision to buy it. Looks cool on the bicycle also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great simple light","review":"If you just need a simple, lightweight safety light, this one is perfect. Not recommended for night riding when more \\"wattage\\" would be needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"better ones out there for the money","review":"I agree with previous reviewers that this light doesn't mount securely. I was riding my bike around 15mph when I hit a bump and it fell off and got smashed. The light actually fell off several times before that even during slow city riding.Also, the light itself is too dim even for commuter riding. The light cast by this has a very narrow range. Any time of night riding outside of well lit city streets is not possible, and even in city streets the light source is relatively dim so you'll be overshadowed by all the surrounding light. There are some much better lights for just a tad extra $."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i expected","review":"i bought this light mainly for a friend, and i'm not sure if it's my fault for lack of reading...but i expected something different.

It has room for the camera and one additional small battery, but with the strap on the camera it becomes difficult to fit everything inside the case. There is no additional pockets, so you'll be unable to use it to carry other stuff, like lenses, charger or cables.The battery is the same you get with the camera. It charges quickly but it only gives you an hour or less of recording time. I recommend a larger model as your second battery.Summary: spend your money on some good case with lot of space and a BN-VF714 (2hrs.) or BN-VF733 (5hrs.) battery pack."},{"rating":"2","title":"At over 90% off, it is a sweet deal !","review":"I bought this bundle for $4.97.Actually I bought four of them, since S&H; was the same whether I bought 1 or 4.My JVC camcorder uses the same exact battery.

But the CD sucked, I mean, it's not the worst but it's not worth [the money]. I LOVE Everlast and I had to buy this CD just to hear how he was. Personally I think it's not worth buying.

Pathetic garbage....","review":"This is garbage. Everlast is filthy, vile, anti-everything good, and of no worth to the human mind other than to dilute, discourage, cloud, and otherwise weed out any remaing positive feelings and thoughts one may have.

I love what he did with Ives' songs, his Transmigration, violin concerto etc. I was wondering why I hadn't heard this piece before. I was so excited by the beginning orchestration that I actually said to my wife that history will prove Adams to be the voice of our generation. Unfortunately, I quickly changed my mind. The problems began with the triteness of the \\"chorus\\" part of the first track. The piece continued sinking; not being buoyed by the insipid libretto. Adams is a rhythmic genius. I don't consider him a great tonal-melodist. I bet there is only a small audience for this piece. People versed in his concert pieces will find this uninteresting and those that like modern Broadway will not enjoy the angular melodies......but what do I know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music","review":"The piece is clever, funny and moving. Audra McDonald and the cast are fantastic. But the sound of the recording is quite dull and the booklet doesn't add much. 4 stars - a reflection of the CD and materials, not John Adams' music. Still definitely worth the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but he's done better","review":"Not the best work from this fine artist. It seems slight indeed in comparison with the Violin Concerto or Grand Pianola Music.

File this with Hoodoo Zephyr, as being an entertaining piece, expertly performed, but with little substance.

The essay is by Ivan Vartanian, who I've never heard of and is not really an academic author or scholar. I found it to be a somewhat shallow and somewhat stereotypical discussion of the artists included. The entries for each artist were also very brief. The images, however speak for themselves, and there are quite a few in this slender book. They included several full-color full-page comics by Aya Takano for example. The images are not really \\"definitive\\" and they should be supplemental to other reproductions of the artists' works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shows a lack of due dilligence","review":"As a graduate student in HCI, I found this book to be a travesty. The author did not do her homework when preparing this text, many of her statements were either dated or just incorrect. Professor Preece also has a tendancy for making broad sweeping statements that are for the most part unsupported and questionable.This does not mean the text is completely without use. As a framework for a text on online communities the design of the book is good. Several of the further readings are also worthy of examination.The text is recommended for graduate use.

There were typos on every single paragraph and I couldn't distinguish where each hymn and story started or stopped. All the words were squeezed together so you couldn't decipher anything!This seems like a scam to me... knowing that I paid $30 for something that was thrown together by a horrible editing/publishing company.

It arrived today and I am so disappointed! First of all, the box does not have the castle top like the pictures show. Second, the clothes are really tiny and flimsy...very bad quality. I just opened the box and some of the tops are already coming apart at their seams and around the edges. Third, the description should tell you that you don't get all the different skirts really; each skirt is half one color on the front, and half one color on the back...rip off! Lastly, for this cardboard trunk of junk, it was way too overpriced! Now I'm going to have to spend even more money buying her something better to make up for this tacky gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"The main reason this item recieved any stars from me is that my girls love to dress up, so I cannot deny that it has a fun factor and that there is educational value since it gives a huge boost to the imagination. However, I have two girls both of whom are average height--my oldest at 9 has outgrown this since she was 3, but still LOVES to dress up. My youngest at 6 has grown out of this as well at age 3. It is just not worth the money for the little time that they can use it. The quality is also horrible. The outfits do not stay together, the shoes break and the jewelry does as well. My recommendation is to go to a local consignment shop or clearance sales and buy some \\"fancy\\" dresses, buy some cheap jewels at the dollar stores and create your own princess box.

Most of them are nice quality but they are not of the Disney dress up quality. This factor does not at all seem to bother my daughters ages 4 and 6 or any of their friends a bit.

I bought them instead of the Playtex drop-in kind for money reasons. I have had these bottles for 5 months and they keep getting MOLD in the tiny holes in the bottom disk. I have boiled them and put them in the dishwasher. I ALWAYS let them completly dry before I reassemble them. I called Playtex and they said they were sorry and would only send more disk after I sent them all of mine?? What was I to do for a bottle?? This was their defect, not mine! I just wanted them to at least give me some sort of credit toward the Playtex drop-in kind as that was the only nipple my son would take and they said \\"SORRY\\". Now I have to buy more bottles for 5 more months!Don't make the same mistake I did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAKY DISKS TIMELY to replace","review":"The disks, required by this system to vent air through the bottom, wear out rather quickly. These disks are NOT sold in stores, or online. The consumer must contact Playtex by the 800 number, wait for them to e-mail, mail, or fax a request form to you. You must then complete the form, requesting replacement parts, send the form plus a certified check to Playtex and wait 4-6 WEEKS for the replacements. Out of the 12 bottles I purchased, after 4 months of NOT constant use (I breast fed for 6 weeks), I'm down to 6 functional disks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good bottle","review":"We bought these bottles for our newborn....what a nightmare! The first time we tried to feed her with them, she tried to eat for 10 minutes and was getting very frustrated, so I check the nipple and nothing was coming out! After cracking the hole on the nipple open, we tried again. After a while, the bottle created such a vacuum, that the nipple started to colapse, so I constantly had to unscrew the bottom, since that side was up, to allow more are to get inside. After all of that, I tried rolling the bottom 'vent' portions to hopfully crack those seals open a little...it helped a little, but she still was getting so frustrated and exhausted! I tried the stage 2 nipples and the flow was so fast that she kept choking. After all of that, I returned them and bought the Playtex Premium disposable Nursers and the Avent disposables. The avent nipples were too long...but she LOVES the Playtex Premium Nursers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"By the time you buy the bottles and the separate nipples, these are not any less expensive than the Dr. Brown's. My son is 7 weeks old, and we have had to replace several of the vents already because they leaked and ripped when stretching them. I called Playtex, and they were kind enough to send me a few vents to replace the ones that I had to throw away. Since they readily offer this service, I know that I am not the only one that has encountered this problem. I was told that if I needed more replacement parts that I could place an order, pay shipping, and wait for them to be shipped to me. No thank you! In addition, the flow on the stage 1 nipples was too slow and the flow on the stage 2 nipples was too fast for my son. I finally gave up this week and purchased the Dr. Brown's."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Money!!!!!","review":"We used these bottles for the first 5 months with our son and they were terrible! First, the nipples are hard and it made it hard for my son to latch on since they were as realistic compared to the breast. Second, there are to many parts to wash and put together and since you have to stretch the rubber vent part after every cleaning that is a pain and also when he was able to hold his own bottle, he had a really hard time because of the curve in the middle and how wide the bottles are for babies little hands and becuase of all of that he just got alot of air in his stomach and spit up which defeated the purpose of \\"vent air\\" bottles.I would tell other moms not to waste their money and just to buy the Playtex Nurser System that uses the bags...now those are GREAT bottles!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkward and leaky","review":"We are loyal to the Soothie line of bottles and so forth, they have always worked well for us. I tried these hoping that it would help my baby sleep better with less gas but there were several problems right away. She didn't seem to like the shape, and it was kind of awkward for her. It was really hard to get the top just so, so it wouldn't leak. And the bottle will not fit in most warmers. I wouldn't choose this one again."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"I had my daughter on the playtex premium nursers but buyinging liners and burping them is real pain when you have 2 kids both under 4 years old..so I bought these off ebay and she likes them just as much as the nursers..I would tell anyone to buy them..great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Bottles!","review":"Out of all the bottles that we have tried, these are the ones that we are going to stick to! We previously used the regular ventaire bottles, and they worked just as good, but we switched to these because my baby is still breastfeeding and the shape of these nipples were perfect! The bottles are small but chunky enough to hold and cleaning them is easier than cleaning the Dr Brown bottles (which didn't work for us). The colors are pleasant to the eye, but best of all--they really work!! My baby doesn't have cramps and doesn't spit up at all anymore! I love these bottles so much, they are worth the money you pay for them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this bottle","review":"My daughter is 8 weeks,and breastfed. At 6 weeks I had to go back to work and initially tried the Avent bottles. She choked on the long nipples and they were too hard. These bottles and nipples are great, they are softer and smaller, like real nipples, and the cool VentAire deisgn makes her less gassy. If your child is breasfed and you have to bottle feed, I highly recomend the VentAire Natural Shape bottles."},{"rating":"1","title":"nipple doesn't fit snug around ring","review":"I recently bought these bottles after using the disposable Playtex bottles.

The avent bottles don't and my baby can't latch on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I am a breastfeeding mommy, and I bought this system to supplement pumped milk. I love it! It really does the trick. The nipples are the perfect shape. I bought the 9oz. so my baby could use them as his appetite increases. I accidentally bought the wrong nipples, so make sure you buy slow nipples for a newborn, but it is wonderful. It really cuts down on his gas. I just wish I had bought more."},{"rating":"1","title":"They leak","review":"I had problems with these bottles leaking on both ends. My baby hated the larger nipple, and half the milk always came out all over him. They also leaked from the bottom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Don't waste your money on these. I had been using the playtex premium nursers with the \\"NaturaLatch\\" nipples, but buying the liners proofed to be a pain. These bottles use the same nipples and are not supposed to let air in the milk, but that proved not to be tru. First, the nipples are harder than the ones for the disposable system and tired my daughter out sooner. Second, the only way to relieve the vacuum in the bottle is to partially pull the nipple out of her mouth and let the air in through the nipple. This \\"Vent\\" system is definitely not working; at least not for us. We are back to disposables until we find a suitable bottle for her. On the up side, the removable bottom does allow for very easy clean-up and the wide bottleneck is great for preparing the bottle without spills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gas and Leaks","review":"Dr. Brown's bottles didn't solve the gas issue, but neither did Playtex Vent Aire. Aside from the fancy name, Playtex did not reduce baby's painful gas (from breast milk). Also, the bottom can leak if not forcefully tightened - I lost 2 ounces of precious breast milk with these lousy Playtex bottles which were recommended by the women's clinic. For people who produce little breast milk, losing 2 ounces is like losing large 24 karat gold nuggets in the sink. The number of parts to clean is comparable to Dr. Brown's bottles, but Dr. Brown's bottles at least provides you with a cleaning brush to clean the interior nipple; with Playtex, you're out of luck. I think that I heard the venting taking place ONCE when Playtex Vent Aire was dry. Since then, even when dry, I rarely hear the venting of air. All Playtex does is make you vent your frustrations in the product reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended by Lactation Consultants","review":"After quite a few issues breastfeeding I went to multiple support group sessions in my county, all the lactation consultants recommended this bottle especially if you have to supplement or have other issues.My daughter at 4 months goes back and forth beautifully (great for a working mom!)A bit frustrating that my pump is not compatible (Avent) so I have storage bottles and feeding bottles and somehow I managed to get two systems with lots of little parts but my girl is happy and healthy so it's all worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick w/the Original Ventaire!","review":"My baby hated these bottles. We have the original Ventaire bottles and she loves those, so we thought we would give these at try. My daughter could not latch on to the nipple, and wound up with half the formula on her bib. The bottles also have a tendency to leak unless they are put together absolutely perfectly. They were not as reliable as the original in keeping air out of the bottle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Design, Son hated nipple","review":"I love the Vent-air bottles - tthat has been all we have been using for months now. I bought 1 of these becasue my son used to use Avents. he hated the nipple on the bottle. The bottle itself is fine. I love how it comes apart becasue it makes it so easy to clean. It is kind of hard to hold becasue it is so wide though. I can't take off too many stars for my son's personal preference but just because a baby likes one natural nipple doesn't mean he will like another."},{"rating":"2","title":"They work fine for us","review":"We have been using these bottles off and on since our son was about 6 weeks old.

There are two main things I do not like about the playtex bottles:1) If you don't screw in the bottom properly, they will obviously leak. At 3am and half awake having to deal with screwing in the bottom part and the top part is a real pain. I would prefer something simpler.2) The parts are small and I found would always fall through the racks in my dishwasher. This was really annoying. I didn't have any problem with the breastflow bottles."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 2nd favorite bottles","review":"My favorite is the Playtex Drop-ins bottles, just because you don't have to wash bottles and can just throw in a new liner, but these are my second favorite. I bought the wide ones so I can easily switch the nipples to my drop-ins bottles. The only thing with these is one of them leaks a tiny bit. When I shake up the bottle to mix the formula, sometimes drips go flying. Other times they can be filled with water and in my diaper bag all day without a drop missing. I'd still recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"bulky, leaky, not for me","review":"We switched from Avent to these bottles, and I'm not impressed.

I started giving supplemental formula for my one-month-old who is a BIG eater and it is the worst product! If you can't put the back vent thing on absolutely correctly then the bottle will not allow liquid out -- no matter how much baby sucks.<br /><br />Imagine a straw with liquid in it on which you have put your finger to block the end and then you try to get the liquid out.

I wound not recommend anyone buying them. I am going back to buy some other bottle.<br />1) There are too many components, total 7 pieces for each bottle. It needs to be assembled really carefully else it WILL LEAK. It takes time to assemble the bottle and if one piece is missing then it become useless.<br />2) It LEAKS when warming milk in warm water even after you take the nipple off. I highly suspect outside water will get into the bottle that way. A big risk factor for bacterial.<br />3) Bad basic design! They easily LEAK in general. <br />4) My baby swallow more gas with this bottle then a cheap Evenflow bottle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"Waste of money.

I ended up trying the ADVENT bottles which happen to have 4 nipple flow rates - all with more than 1 hole. My son finishes a bottle within 5 minutes compared to 20 minutes and is much happier! PLEASE RETHINK INVESTING IN THESE BOTTLES. THE good reviews I understand ~ they are nice to clean because they come apart but also while using them I ended up losing some of the vent discs and riping one ~ YOUR GOING TO BE BETTER OFF AND HAVE A HAPPIER BABY IF THEY CAN DRINK THEIR BOTTLE AND SATISY THEIR HUNGER BEFORE FALLING TO SLEEP ~ TRUST ME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I do NOT like these bottles!","review":"I had bought these bottles becuase of the look and they seemed to be a good bottle.

There has been numerous times wich myself or my husband thought we got the covers on good and have put them in his diaper bag, and to our not happy surprise we notice later on that they leaked out water or formula everywhere! And this goes for when you are pouring formula into the bottle on the counter! I wish I had used a diffrent bottle! They make a MESS!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They use to be good, Not any more","review":"I used these type of bottles several years ago and had no problems except they would leak out of the bottom if the disk was not put in correctly. However, since they have redesigned them, they are not very good. The bottle itself works good, but the nipples are horrible. The stage 1 nipple, the hole is so small that my newborn was having to suck so hard that it would put him to sleep with out eating very much. I changed the nipples to the stage 2 and now the milk comes out to fast for the baby, so he would start to gag while sucking on these bottles. I have changed bottle systems for his regular bottles and use these bottles when I add cereal in his formula. Since it makes the formula thicker, my baby doesn't gag when he uses these bottles. I would suggest using these bottles only if the baby is older, approx. 3 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It!","review":"The only word that comes to mind to describe this bottle is garbage!

I am glad I didn't spend the money on them because the instructions warn not to use them in an electric bottle warmer. We all know you aren't supposed to microwave bottles either, so you are left with the only other option, placing the bottle in boiling water to warm. That works fine except when you tip the bottle up to feed the baby, the boiling hot water that has been trapped in the vent holes drips down your hand/arm, and potentially onto the baby! Now I have to remember every time to make sure I get a towel and shake the bottle a little to make sure all the vent holes are emptied out before feeding our baby. USE CAUTION"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Bottles!","review":"This bottle is a waste of money, we bought them and the nipples did not have holes in them.

They weren't my choice, but my mother in law bought them and we were stuck. Should have switched. So much work was involved in cleaning them. Then the plastic discs would get clogged and we had to soak them in bleach every so often which made me worried. It was such a bummer when I would pour formula into the bottle thinking everything was put together correctly, only to have the formula (liquid gold to us) leak out all over the counter. After all of that, our son still spit up. UGH! We are expecting our second child soon and I refuse to go through that hassle again. I am going to try something else even though we have so many of the other bottles from last time."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE READ -DISAPPOINTING BOTTLES!","review":"I like the angled shape idea of the bottle and the colors, that's it! If your child is drinking just 4 oz, the stage 1 nipple is appropriate. However, when your baby is drinking more than 4 oz you need to throw these bottles away. When you switch nipples to a stage 2, the milk flow is extremly fast because the opening is so---- large they choke and get gass! They don't sell medium flow nipples, it's either slow or fast. So, you end up like me and spend more money and time buying different bottles, ones that your child can grow with. Plus, when you use a warmer with these the humidity/condensation build up from it's vent system on the bottom is EXTREMLY HOT! I already had some drip on my daughter's leg that almost burned her, which other bottles don't do.

The size is fine, and I like that it's wider and not as tall, but the whole deal with unscrewing the bottom to make the formula come out was just too much hassle. What's worse is that I didn't realize I had to do that at first, and my poor baby was sucking on the bottle forever and not getting anything out! Once I realized that I had to unscrew the bottom to make the vaccuum work, I had to tighten the bottom to set it down and then try and loosen it again with one hand while feeding. Once I turned the bottle too loose, and formula came out way too fast and my son almost choked. Not the worst bottles, but not my personal favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Engineered Rubbish","review":"Instructions followed perfectly....yep people feeding their baby don't pay attention to one of the most important things....Clearly an over-engineered product which touts perfection but falls short. Holes in nipples are, not holes but virtual holes, which lead your baby into thinking it might get something in a couple of days of sucking. Ventaire doesn't work, and what ever machine they tested it on must have had the PSI setting to about 20 babies...all the little bubbles coming back in the nipple \\"hole\\".All the other negative reports here are exactly what this product does....but maybe they have production issues that.Playtex can design a great product for holding boobs, but fall short of making a product that can feed like one.Went out and bought Avent bottles...and guess what..it works perfectly, and doesn't have a removeable bottom...wow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky and slow","review":"Don't remember how we got these bottles, but I'm pretty sure we got them free with some promotion.

The best feature is the fact that it is a wide version, so there is no need for a bottle brush. I like to get my hand in the bottle and clean it. It has a nice natural nipple and the ventaire technology. Definitely my favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nipples","review":"I like the bottles but the nipples are not good for a newborn. It would take my daughter over an hour to eat with the stage 1 nipples and the stage 2 nipples were so fast that she couldn't keep up. I am sure the stage 2 nipples will be fine in a couple of months but there needs to be something between the Stage 1 and Stage 2 nipples."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better out there!","review":"I bought these bottles for my newborn son because they are supposed to reduce air which in turn would reduce gas in his poor little tummy! Well these bottles made the gas even worse! He also has acid reflux and these bottles did nothing to help that!Also the stage 1 nipples that came with the bottle-- half of them did not even have a hole in them. Yes I did boil them and all pieces before the first use as well! The stage 2 nipples were just way to fast for a newborn!We junked these expensive bottles and went with Plytex disposables with the NaturaLatch nipple! Absolutely no problems and no gas! Very happy with the transition!As we all know a happy baby makes a happy parent!! :)Buying disposables can be a pain, but I would definitely go that route over these bottles anyday!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Bottles!","review":"When my son was born, he was admitted into the NICU because he had low blood sugar, so they stuck him on a bottle. While he was there, they told be that he had a lot of gas nad will need to be burped a lot, and that's just the way it was to be. When I got home I used the little evenflo bottles, and he did have a lot of gas. I thought it was just him. Until i used these bottles. Ever since I started using these bottles, he has been the most happy baby. Air is off of his little belly, there aren't anymore screaming fits from the pain of gas, and overall is just a happier baby.I owe so much to these bottles! I have both the regular skinny ones in 6 oz and 9oz, and these in both sizes. I won't even try to use the other bottles anymore. They are a little pricey, but it is so worth it to have a happy baby!!! Trust me-I KNOW!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PICTURE IS MISLEADING!!!

I found that if you put clear tape over the markings it will help protect them."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS BOTTLE SYSTEM","review":"I purchased the vent air system for my 2 month old and they are absolutly WONDERFUL.

My son is 4 months old and they all LEAK. Constantly. I fill one up to put it in the diaper bag and within a half hour it's empty. They aren't very durable, the plastic on the rings is actually breaking off and now I'm going through the struggle of trying to find a new bottle system that my son will take (I hate the liners)...And they never did reduce the amount of air in the bottle at all. Do not buy these bottles unless you want to buy a completely new system in 4 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem with bottle flow","review":"I bought these for my daughter thinking that maybe they wouldn't leak like the last ones I had used. They don't leak, but the stage 1 is TOO slow and frustrates her. She's 5 months and the stage 2 is TOO fast. They made a HUGE mistake in not making more stages. Had I realized this before I had used them, I would have taken them all back."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess!","review":"A friend recommended these bottles, but since I started using them, other moms keep saying, \\"Oooh, Vent Aire. Aren't those awful? We've had so many problems with those!\\" They really do leak - when you transport them in a diaper bag, when you shake them to mix the water and formula, and when you try to feed your baby. What a mess!I got rid of these and bought the Playtex Nurser (bottle is hollow and you drop in a new liner for each feeding). You do have to consider the cost of constantly buying the refill liners, but at least the liners can be recycled. And the generic liners save you money and work great. I am really happy with the Playtex Nurser. Clean-up is so easy and feedings are no longer a mess!"},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAKS and DOESN\\"T HELP w/ SPIT-UP, SAVE YOUR MONEY","review":"I bought these bottles for my baby who is a big spitter.

I will be calling Playtex to request a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"The last thing any new parent needs is a hassle. These bottles are the hardest thing to not only put together EVERY time but worse to clean(forget sanitizing)!!We would have to unscrew the bottom to keep the nipple from collapsing and pray our lil guy did not hit the bottle and spill it.The only thing positive about this bottle is the story I get to tell about the time the bottom plastic piece was sucked in by my lil guy creating a pop so loud that I flew up in the air pouring formula all over us. If we only had the camera out.I can laugh now.Aventi bottles work pretty well."},{"rating":"1","title":"These crack and leak EASILY!!!","review":"Please don't waste your time and money on these bottles.

Too many little parts!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Contains BPA/ Bishpenol A - I returned Mine!!!!!!!!!","review":"Just wanted to inform all parents out there that this product contains BPA/ Bisphenol A. I returned mine. Pacifiers,bottles,breast pumps can have BPA in them as well such as the AVENT products that I returned. I then decided to go with Born Free bottles and sterilizer,Soothie pacifier and the Gerber Nuk pacifiers,and Medela pump. All their products are BPA Free. You do the research and decide if you will buy or continue to use their products. I've already written the President, my senators, and Oprah. Hopefully together we can keep our children safe."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY SATISFIED","review":"I love them! Being a first time mom and tring new things out, We had gone through several bottles and no luck. It was always the case of my daughter sucking in too much air. Then by chance we tried them and have been using them since. We started out when she was about 6wks old and she had no problem going from from breastfeeding to bottle. She was less gassy and did not spit up as soon as she was done from all the air that was sucked in while feeding. Then recently we had started using the Natural Shape bottles and she is able to hold those a lot better as well as drink from the nipple. The only down fall about the bottles are tring to locate replacment vent dics. Since my daughter had started eating cereal in her bottle the cereal settles along the the bottom of the vent disc and in the small vent holes. Even after daily cleaning and rinsing after use they still have a hard time coming clean. But overall they are the best bottles my daughter has used an reasonable priced as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need medium flow nipples","review":"We like the style of the bottle and the ventair system. Unfortunately the stage 1 nipple is way too slow and the stage 2 is too fast. With the stage 1 my son (who is only 3 weeks old) gets frustrated and with the stage 2 he spills a lot of the milk over his mouth. We have found other Gerber nipples that fit in the bottles that work much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bottles","review":"We tried a few different \\"anti-colic\\" bottles. We found these work best. The slow flow really is slow (unlike what we found with Dr. Brown's, so it works great for infants. We haven't had any issues with spit up with these and we aren't having to bang out burps every few minutes. I am breastfeeding and haven't had any issues with nipple confusion with these either. It is worth keeping up with the extra part for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bottles","review":"Baby is not nearly as gassy since we switched to these bottles. Also very easy to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Great!!!","review":"I purchased these bottles because my baby has problems with gas. I thought this would reduce the intake of air. Not so much. In order for the formula to keep flowing you must screw the bottom off the bottle several times. This can lead to a big mess if your baby moves or turns and the bottle tips. Also it leaks out the top and bottom. The nipples that come with the bottle are not soft and too firm. You can purchase softer ones to fit this bottle, but it's a waist on the original ones. I do like the wider mouth idea. It made it easier for my baby to latch on (with the soft nipples extra $) and it is a larger area to get the formula in. I would recommend the new Gerber bottles. They have the wide mouth, less leaks, and less air."},{"rating":"1","title":"thumbs down","review":"they were fine at first, slightly annoying with several parts to clean without having a dishwasher. but after about a month the numbers began to rub off and they started leaking everywhere. i literally had to use a measuring cup to pour the correct amount of water in to make formula. very annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice bottle set for supplmenting breast feeding","review":"I got these because I babysit my nephew who is breast fed. His mother started classes and is away for 9 hours a day. He has been very fussy about \\"bottle\\" substitutions for mom, but he adjusted quite quickly to these nipples. While they aren't mom, he is consolable and accepting of this system! Certainly makes feeding time while mom's away a whole lot less stressful!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"stay away....","review":"I bought five sets of both 6oz and 9oz bottle, because I thought the ventaire is good for my baby per the product description. The 6oz bottle has slow flow nipple and the 9oz bottle has fast flow nipple. I use these bottles from the time my baby around half a month to two months and since then these bottles are in a shelve. The slow flow bottle takes up to 1 and half hour to feed 3oz. My baby suck on it the whole time, but since it is too slow it can takes a long time. The fast flow is too fast, which can choke up the baby since she couldn't swallow fast enough. My baby spits out half of her feed with the fast flow bottle. Stay away from this kind of bottle if you can or just buy one set to test it out first. I have been back to the standard yellow nipple which is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Working for us","review":"These are the ones that are working good for us. Just ordered the 3 pk of 9 oz. Although the manufacturers description written there is misleading about what bottles and nipples comes with - this one has 3 fast flow nipples. Our neighbor is also using them. We have not run across any of the leaking issues or anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two major problems -- numbers rub off & seals leak","review":"These bottles have two key defects...1.) The numbers wore off of these bottles within the first two weeks! Each day I had to rewrite the oz. markers back on the bottles with a Sharpie...a total pain! The only reason I continued to put up with this is because my son took to these bottles so well.2.) The bottom seals/vents leak. I found if you put them in the microsteam bags, they warp easily and then the bottle will leak. I had to buy all new vents. I simply washed these in hot soapy water and no longer microsteamed them. That did the trick.These two performance issues drop my overall rating. All that said, my son took to these bottles extremely well. If you really want to go with this brand, get the Crystal Clear version. I had no trouble with the numbers on the Crystal Clear ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where are the nipples?","review":"We love these bottles! They do create bubbles when baby is drinking, but the bubbles dissipate almost immediately. The bottles have reduced his gas and they seem to be the only nipples he can suck on without bending or compressing them. That said, we've had difficulty finding replacement nipples for them! The stores in our area sell only the stage 2 Vent Aire Natural Shape nipples. The regular stage 1 Vent Aire nipples are too small for these bottles. Still, I'd recommend these bottles highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Advanced bottles for the advanced child.","review":"These are the only bottles our baby would take. They are wonderful especially if you switch between the breast and bottle often. Wouldn't use anything other than the Playtex Advanced for my child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessary","review":"I was trying to get a Playtex bottle/nurser that didn't require liners, since the liners seemed like another unnecessary expense, but my baby liked the Playtex natural rubber nipple. However, I found these bottles confusing and the added features completely useless. They require a silicon nipple, and my baby couldn't get a good suck on it. It might be good for other babies, but not mine. I'm going to keep them around and try it out on her again, but I don't have high hopes for this bottle."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Bottle Ever!","review":"I LOVE these bottles! Before my son was born I bought a ton of Avent bottles. We tried those and the hole in the nipple allows too much milk so he gets choked. After the feeding he spits most of it up. We tried several bottles before the Ventaire Natural Shape. Now, using the Ventaire he does not get choked, he does not spit-up any and most of the time he doesn't even need to burp! I have not had any trouble with assembly, even my 14 yr. old daughter and my husband got it right the first try! With the bottom of the bottle coming off makes it wonderful for washing. These bottles have made our life great! I also breastfeed for the first several weeks and he did not mind drinking from the bottle instead of the breast either. I would recommend these bottles to anyone.God Bless!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not working as it promises","review":"My baby boy spits up a lot and since day one we got Dr.Brown's for him. However, the problem w Dr.Brown's bottles are they are supper hard and time consuming to wash ( at least they work fine and I am going back to them ). When I saw Playtex does not have much compartment like other bottles, I got one. To my disappointment Playtex Ventair does not work at all!1. It does not reduce the bubbles as you can clearly see bubbles through.2. It does not help with gas, colic or spit up at all, it is like normal bottle with way more expensive price tag3. Worst of all it LEAKS sooooooo bad4. It does not fit in my Dr.Brown's warmer, in which it accepts most bottles.In conclusion, it did not work for my son and it was such a waste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not loving these bottles","review":"My babies found these bottes to be extremely difficult to get anything from.

The fault is not with Isbin, who seems comfortable in any musical genre. Mentzer, on the other hand, runs into trouble immediately; her delivery lacks the necessary understatement, and her vibrato goes whanging all over the place. It's pretty painful, though it improves when the performers get to the lieder tracks and Mentzer seems more at ease. Still, getting to the later tracks isn't easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Skies","review":"This is one of James Keelaghan's earlier CD's and is no longer available.

The heavy emphasis on the treble (soprano) voices (at normal volume on my sound system) resulted in ear piercing sounds that took the joy out of listening. Not all of the songs are treated so badly that they are not reasonably pleasant to hear, but I was unable to play the CD through: after I had had enough of jumping up and down in attempts to attenuate the accented (and somewhat non-melodic) treble voices, I simply put the CD away, never to be played again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lackluster atempt at the majors","review":"Ok..

There is a large amount of factual error in this investigation.There are some downright malicious allegations made against many of those whose have been positively inspirational - in particular Father Jozo Zofko.The dignity and integrity of the visionaries themselves acts as a counterbalance to some of the appalling claims in this sad and at times pathetic attempt to demolish Medjugorje.James Mulligan"},{"rating":"1","title":"not factual","review":"The book seems bent on giving information that is not factual and twists the messages around to make them seem inconsistent with church teaching.

It's a bit pricey ($40? plus shipping one-way) but it comes back looking like new. They also replace several of the parts as part of this preventive maintenance.As far as the folks giving this product 1-Star, they should learn how to read as the product description is quite clear. And you cannot blindly trust any of Amazon's add'l purchase recommendations. So I give those posters 1-star for their intelligence.

It looks promising at the outset because of the large number of scholars who have contributed to the book. It incorporates scholars from different cultures and institutions to attempt to bring together an ecumenical view of Church History. Unfortunately that goal is never achieved. The book wanders aimlessly through church history, never clearly identifying what time period they're trying to cover and making much of what they're trying to present incoherent. This is mostly likely the result of so many different voices trying to get a say. There are better church history overviews, such as Justo Gonzalez's two volume \\"Story of Christianity.\\" There are some good sections here and there, such as the section on Islam, but this is a book better left on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Time for Tea","review":"This book was also published in paperback in the United States under the title A Time for Tea: Travels Through China and India in Search of Tea (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1991). Informed and entertaining, the book is a combination travelogue-history; the author visits China, India, and a few other tea-related places (Boston, as in Tea Party), all the while telling us how tea is grown, processed, and drunk; how it was first discovered; and how it came to be exported to the West. I found it totally engrossing. Had it been written by an American, I would class it in the category of New-Yorker-style writing: intelligent, witty, light - yet informative. I suppose the book may now be out of print in the American version, but it's certainly worth tracking down.

I have emailed and called Customer Support and no response to my issue. I was told by them that my problem may be RAM related as I did add a 1 Gig stick of RAM to my CPU recently but have removed it and still got the same annoying issue of blinking lines and a high pitch whining sound. I gave this item one star b/c it did work but only for one year.

There were a big cross section of children at the party (6 months - 12 years) and EVERYONE .... adults included, could enjoy the bells and LOVED them! They are very well made and felt safe for all of the babies to play. They make a beautiful sleigh sound. One 6 year old told me that she had requested from Santa some bells from his sleigh and her mother was tickled pink that we had found these and were giving them out (.... mark that off of the list for \\"Santa\\"). My father asked during the party why I was giving away such expensive bells and he was shocked to find out how inexpensive they were.

Indeed, Thomas describes how as a child he summons an archetype he calls the \\"Jolly Marauder\\"--the spirit of the adventurer. As an adult the call to adventure comes by way of a teaching job in Korea. The ensuing experience in a Confucian prison is refracted thus through the literate, 1st hand account of the Western individual.Where it succeeds is that true to its romantic impulse, the narrative doesn't simply rely on the stock plot of white boy in foreign jail. The narrator instead brings us to the place where the human spirit is pitted against the hard walls of the institution--it's socio-politically complicated, physically harrowing but ultimately a spiritual journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloated","review":"Another successful attempt at crowding five pounds of material into a ten pound bag.

Bouton writes the introduction for the stories and provides one story himself. It's a great look on managers and is faithful in tone to his other books. If you read \\"Ball Four\\" you'll appreciate the stories on Ralph Houk. Although the book is often funny, it is a genuine look at these managers at a time before baseball became big business. Like \\"Ball Four\\" it may be somewhat dated, but it's a must for baseball lovers who appreciate the history of the game and it's uniqueness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Built like a tank but....optics poor.","review":"I bought theses binoculars as work equipment.

The image quality is good (though not great). The sport focus system does not really work from 20 yards out (as advertised). It's fairly sharp from 70 yards or so out, but I've found I have to re-focus for the 20-70 yard range. The focus mechanism is fairly stiff, so it does stay put once focused. Despite the minor shortcomings, this binocular was exactly what I was looking for - lightweight, rugged, decent image, reasonable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stiener Binoculars 8 X 30 Marine","review":"I was very disapppointed by the poor quality optics of these binoculars. Steiner has a supberb reputation but eidently they are producing a low quality product at this level to get to a low price point.

And you can do other thing besides doing the story, this game is like \\"Grand Theft Auto\\", but it's an RPG, so sooner or later you will get BORED and you want to do the story. \\"Fable\\" is way better than \\"Knights Of The Old Republic\\", you caqn do what ever you want. On the negative side, \\"Fable\\" is really short, most gamers will beat it in a day, or in 9 hours.

If you rate and write reviews of games based off screen-shots and trailers, you are doing a disservice to those looking to see if they want to buy. Visually \\"Fable\\" looks like it is shaping up to be great with in-depth gameplay, but wait until it is released to put your two cents in so others may see if it is truly a great game on the basis of true playability, not marketing ploys.

There's a perfect balance of slower songs (Whistles the Wind, Don't Let Me Die Still Wondering) and faster songs (Seven Deadly Sins, Tobacco Island - one of the best on the album). In my opinion, Within a Mile of Home is better than Drunken Lullabies, but both are worth getting (if you liked Drunken Lullabies, you'll like this album).

I'd waited for so long...and it wasn't Swagger and it wasn't Drunken lullabies, and I was perhaps a wee bit crestfallen.And then I listened to it again. And again.

Amazon was very good about getting me a second camera in short order. Unfortunantly, it had a loud tape drive motor that the mic would pick up while recording so you always had a buzzing whine in the background. I liked the camera and wished it had worked well. Still pictures were very weak but it was cool to have that ability at all. Don't give up your dedicated digital still camera. Light sensitivity is a couple of years behind.

I had it for barely a year and it worked great no complaints at all till it just quit working all together. Now it makes a great paperweight. The unit will not power up at all. Bear in mind that my unit has never been mishandled or mistreated. I have also done research on the web and have found similar reviews elsewhere. I am still trying to get Sharp to help me replace or repair it. I'd love to be able to write a retraction in the coming days that Sharp has stepped up and done the right thing.

Very upseting that it happened the moment one year warranty expired!Part II - March 2007I have had the worse experience with this camera! Do not buy it, it does not last! First it broke down as soon as the warranty expried and I sent it for service because I really liked this camera. I paid $300 to fix it and one year later it broke down again!!!

This camera seemed great from the reviews, and boy did I do my homework on this one. Problem was that intermittently there would be a problem during playback of tapes, ie: extreme digitalization or blocks across the video. It drove me crazy so i sent it back to amazon, who then sent me out another unit. Same issue with this one!!! Called sharp and was told they thought maybe i was using the wrong tapes???? How is that possible, I was using Sony Mini DV's, no mystery there. They told me not to use TDK tapes as they are having issues with this camera, thankfully i did not use TDK. Anyway, after 13 months of this issue, i had enough. Called Sharp corporate and demanded to speak with the CEO. Ended up speaking with one of his people who couldnt have been nicer in fixing the issue. They are sending me a totally different model camera......hope that solves it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Get It","review":"Well I have to say that Amazon.com was very good about replacing the camcorder.

It takes good video but it just doesn't want to play it back to the computer. The video comes back all digitized and full of bars. I figured maybe it was because it is going into the computer, so i unplugged the firewire, same thing, just chunked video. I would recommend buying this camera if you JUST want to RECORD. Don't think about playing it back. ROFL a one way camcorder."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Sharp support for firewire","review":"The firewire connection does not work when connecting to a pc. I have tried on 3 different pc's w/ different cables.

I however like animes like Ruroni Kenshin, Magic Knight Rayearth, Tenchi Muyo!, and Vision of Escaflowne. I quickly got bored with this series. I quickly got bored with the characters and the animation was cool at first but now I think it is kind of lame. What gets me the most mad is the bad guys. They don't die! They just become stronger in one LONG battle. Freeza's battle was so boring. The action is so mindless and nothing happens in action but annoying grunts. The plot is okay. Save all the Dragonballs... Not too great but not bad I guess. There is more to the plot at times but pretty much all the bad guys want all the Dragonballs. If you need a anime filled with action you can get this I guess...

Terrific storylines, unique characters, awesome powers. After each tape ended I just popped in the next one. This is something you'll watch over and over again. It's kind of like pro wrestling, although you watch it and know what happens, you go back later and watch it again, and again, and again.I've read other reviews of this and other DBZ videos, and people whine and complain that they're edited. Now, if that's all you care about, then that's sad. If all you care about is violence and profanity, and you don't buy this set (or any other DBZ video) because it's \\"edited\\", then that's REAL sad.It's about the storyline.

They just didn't have enough changing the opening song but they had to include some weird music to the series and cut most of the more dramatic scenes. Translation is bad , even the voices that they gave to the characters dont fit with their personalities.

I think if you want to watch REAL DBZ then you should get the Japanese Versions. If you don't understand Japanese then you can get the subtitled ones. Trust me that the Japanese version is so much better! English cuts out everything violent which is the true DBZ. DBZ is supposed to be an action cartoon, not a sissy fight.

It has some great stories that are totally original and awesome! I especially like Goku traveling on Snake Way! Even though the voices are terrible and they edit all of the good stuff, this saga gets ragged on a lot more than it should. This set includes the 3 or 4 episode turned special of Radits, Goku traveling to Snake Way, Goku training with King Kai, and the Fights that break out between the Saiyans and the Z Gang.

All children are different, but ours reacted very adversely and we could not finish.

Just don't expect easy hooked-filled pop music- this CD is more of an urban symphony with occasional vocals thrown in for emphasis.

My grandson (21 months) loves slicing the vegetables, husking the corn and peeling the cabbage. It would also be fun for kids to put all of the veggies into a pile after they've been cut and put them back together again like a puzzle.

No more tangled cords! The *idea* of just 1 retractable cord to use for all devices is good -but the execution just didn't work. USB chargers, in general, are not the most efficient.

I'd return it if the cost of shipping wasn't more than its worth.I bought this thing for my kodak camera, the smallest adaptor was not small enough, despite specs seemed comparable.I thought I can at least use the other adaptor to charge my blackberry. It fits but as soon as I plug it into computer or the wall unit, it causes blackberry to reboot.Of the remaining two of the four, one is the common large one which comes all the time with accessories (I had four extra ones lying around). The last one is a just a coupler for joining two standard USB cables. Who in the damn world would even need that?The only useable piece in it maybe the retractable standard USB. Maybe even it doesn't work, since I did not really try it. I have tons of USB cables lying around, so I don't need yet another one. I needed the adaptors. Apparently this is not the product if you need adaptors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another bad monster movie.","review":"The creatures in this film do get to do what monsters do best, and that's about all it has going for it. I was impressed with the amount of screen time dedicated to watching giant monsters trash villages, suburbs, cities, temples and factories. It makes me wish better monster movies spent more time with the monster, without losing the plot of course. Instead we get things like Cloverfield which barely shows any of the monster at all! They're called \\"Monster\\" Movies not \\"Annoying Screaming People With Bad Camera Angles\\" Movies. Although the problem with this movie is the 'special effects' aren't very special, and while the story follows the classic \\"take baby monster away from parents, parents come to get their baby back and tear stuff up.\\" theme, you've really got to be in the mood to watch this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a BOOTLEG DVD The WORST possible quality","review":"This is a joke.

Well get those not this! A greedy buisnessman sends half-brained twits to clear out and explore an island that he wants to use for an amiusment park. They then meet natives that befrend them. As they head into a cave behind emense statues, an annoying brat tells them not to go in there. The reason is that their gods Gappa would hate that. As stupid as they are, they GO IN! The explorers head into the cave and capture a chicken monster. As they left the island, the brat goes too. And no duh the creature gets from 4 tho 40 ft. tall. The parents come in and retrieve the baby. It's a rip-off to King Kong, Mothra, Godzilla vs. Mothra, Godzilla, Gorgo, and the X from Outer Space. This is simply a tragety and should of never been made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out","review":"This movie is also called \\"Monster from a Prehistoric Planet\\". How do I know?

It ranks right up there with the greatest suitmation monster stink bombs in history, including most of the Godzilla series between Godzilla vs King Kong and the Heisei series in the 1990s, and virtually all of the rest of the Toho and Toho-clone stable. There is just something so delightfully awful about the attack of those giant chicken-slash-parrots that makes you want either to fall to the floor laughing or run screaming away from the television (maybe not such as bad thing...) never to watch again. Anyone one familiar with the Red Dwarf TV series might recognize Gappa from one of the episodes as well. I have an idea... Instead of the Golden Turkey, let's introduce the Golden Gappa!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Monster from a Prehistoric Planet","review":"Don't buy this DVD. It is an awful copy by Alpha Video. When I ordered this I thought is was the Tokyo Shock version which the revilews of the DVD stated it was. My bad- I should have read the product specification and would have seen that it was an Alpha video copy. It is dark, grainy, awful audio and barely watchable. The good news is that Amazon sells the Tokyo Shock version called Gappa, the Triphibian Monster which is available through their dealers and not on Amazon prime. It costs a few dollars more but the copy should be so much better than this Alpha version. I swallowed the $8 and ordered the Tokyo Shock version. So let my bad choice be a cautionary tale for you.

The story follows a shy young lad (Johnny Crawford) who accidentally injures his father's prize horse, Black Beauty. A miraculous recovery is in the cards, as songs with names like \\"The Donkey Game Song\\" are sung.

One of the most talented and beautiful voices in rock, McCulloch projects a powerful magic when put into a live setting. From Echo and the Bunnymen to Ian M. to Electrafixion to the EATB of 2002, Ian has proved again and again that he's a major talent and one of the top live performers of the last 2 decades.

They have been around for ten years and have had a lot of impact. They definitely were heard by DFA 1979, Wolf Eyes, and The Locust. And plenty of other bands. They definitely have had an impact on some crazy Japanese bands like DMBQ. This is two-man heavy rock. This is a good place to start for people like me who are often late to the game. Three or four songs into this and it's totally relentless. This music needs to be heard in all its loudness. I hate those old people who have earplugs. What the hell are you listening to? I am listening to this record right now (track six) and my hearing is damaged. But I am hearing this in all its glory. I don't think this is a record for mellow people or people with a heart condition. This is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"These guys are a bit of a letdown...","review":"While you can tell this band is technically proficient I find the songs go nowhere. I think their music suffers for using only two instruments while trying to be as loud as possible. As a consequence the sound, while heavy, is dull and repetitive. A better experimental heavy album from 2005 would be the newest Fantomas album, \\"Suspended Animation\\", which also employs a more inventive vocalist in Mike Patton."},{"rating":"1","title":"A leap of faith","review":"This was one weird movie.

His essays The Cultural Role of Rhetoric and Gnostics of Education both eloquently expound an orginal insight that complements his work very well.

Jackson is outstanding as a tragic art dealer who specializes in comic art, his character is named Elijah Price and will remind you of the mysterious people Vincent Price portrayed.

Night Shyamalan films should be AVOIDED","review":"This movie had promise but QUICKLY went down hill. Not even the likeable Bruce Willis could do much to save this ridiculous mess. I'm so glad I borrowed it off a friend, rather than rent it.M. Night Shyamalan films are not clever, artistic or even original. He tries to make his films unique but they fail even before the middle of the film. Just look at his other film called \\"Signs\\". Mel Gibson couldn't save that either. Not even big names can help his movies.Overall, far fetched nonsense films which don't deserve any of our attention. I'll avoid his films from here on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I see the same movie the rest of you saw???","review":"I though this movie was absolutely horrible! It is the kind of movie that gets me mad that someone had the nerve to make something so bad! This is in the same category as something like Showgirls! Story was terrible. Directing was terrible.

As we all left the theater (the five of us who hadn't walked out) we felt like it was bad. I even got paid to watch the movie, and I still felt as though I had wasted a precious few hours of my time. Not only watching it, but putting the film together.And what was with the whole comic book thing???? That was just not good!!!

So, in my next movie, I will also weigh down a fairly cool idea with even more heavy handed emotional belly-button gazing. People will LOVE it.\\"Ah, well, no. People didn't love it.

If you grew up thinking that there might be a small possibility that superheros may be living with us mortals, this is your film. M. Night Shyamalan lays out this wonderful tale of a self-denying superhero that lives a very unassuming life.Mr. Shyamalan is one of the best director/writers of the past decades.

This is a slow, awkwardly paced film with poor dialogue, and leaden acting (think Bruce Willis in 13 Monkeys but without the enthusiasm ;-).

Night's \\"The Sixth Sense\\" was very highly anticipated by me and many others who found his first movie breathtaking. To say the least, I was extremely dissapointed. I found the plot twists silly and badly timed. The scene involving Bruce Willis' son pointing a gun at him made me laugh out loud. (His son was so convinced that his father was a superhero, he was going to shoot him to prove it.) Writing like that just makes my stomach turn. I think M. Night made a movie that had a deep personal interest to him, but a gut wrenching car wreck ensued on the screen. Pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Un-Watch-able","review":"Usually, I enjoy any movie with Bruce Willis or Samuel L. Jackson. This one is an exception.

It was entertaining from the very first scene and it only got better, and the twist at the end, well that made it a classic.

It was truly a waste of ($), unless you have problems sleeping at night (then it would be a great sleeping pill). It took about 45mins for anything remotely interesting to happen, then after a VERY short period of interest, it became a sleeper again.

Just a fair warning for those who read all of those good reviews. . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looooooooong wait for a cool ending","review":"This movie is kind of like watching a baseball game: 3 minutes of action packed in to three hours.

Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"Pacing was uneven and I couldn't sympathize with any of the characters or their motivations, like Robin Wright Penn's refusal to live with \\"football in her life\\" or some nonsense and the kid becoming unhinged when his father refuses to believe he's invulnerable and goes so far as to point a gun at him. Look, kid, if you want to test someone's invulnerability there are better ways than scaring the s**t out of them. I just couldn't buy the premise and the film just overwhelmingly struck me as pretentious. I did appreciate the irony of casting Bruce Willis an ordinary-seeming person and reluctant hero who really is invulnernable as opposed to all the intrepid action heroes he's played in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"I figured it all out","review":"This movie said it had surprises in it, but I was able to see right through everything pretty much from the first frame.

I recommend the film, and I especially recommend the DVD! The extras on this DVD are exceptional. Be sure to watch them if you are watching \\"Unbreakable\\" with friends and want to jump start a discussion. Extras include an interview with Night Shyamalan, who is as articulate in front of the camera as behind it, and a series of shots you can see (and switch back and forth between) as storyboard and as the finished product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Above all, just a good movie","review":"Take it for what it is: a good movie. Don't compare it to Sixth Sense or whatever.

By the wasy, I like comic books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"One of M. Night's best movies. If you have not seen it, I highly suggest you watch it. If you like M. Night's movies then you will love this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Slant on the Superhero","review":"This film puts a very unique spin on the comic superhero genre. I just watched it for the second time and felt the director was still finding his way when you compare this to Signs and The Sixth Sense, yet this earlier movie still delivers. Willis and Jackson are great in this - Jackson seemingly born for the role and the creepy edge he brings to the part. A worthy addition to your library and one that must be watched with your son (providing you follow with some discussion on the differences in good and evil)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre thriller from talented director","review":"It was fairly suspenseful, the ending was typically surprising, though not amazingly so, but it was unoriginal. I especially found the young boy to be bland, a cross between Haley Joel Osment in The sixth sense and the boy in The Shining. One doesn't know whether to be afriad and disturbed or sympathetic. The premise is rather preposterous, although it might have been engrossing without the superhero sub-plot. When Willis dons a cape-like poncho and heads into the night to go save someone, anyone, the film becomes as transparent as glass, which is interesting because glass seems an overused symbol throughout the film. Overall, its not an awful movie, but it could have been much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke","review":"I was waiting for this film.M. Night proved his storytelling ability in his last film, but just rushed everything about this movie.There are two nice scenes, but it's not enough to support the film.

I wish the two weight scenes had been melded into one so both could have been depicted.The DVD has all the cut scenes, storyboards, score, etc...The impact of the film is awsome. The Climax and power with wich the film ends on is nothing short of POWERFUL. The score is fantastic.This screen play has become one of my favorites in the same realm of the Matrix.

I heard that \\"Unbreakable\\" was not as good, so I waited for the DVD to come out. Now, I'm so glad I didn't waste my precious time in the theater for this stupid movie. The story is ridiculous and the editing is really bad. You get irritated watching 2 shadows talking to each other at a distance or from the reflection of something, and it goes on until the next scene. You can't use the same technique from \\"the 6th sense\\" on this movie. I bet \\"Unbreakable\\" would have turned out more exciting if it was done by someone else..."},{"rating":"1","title":"...incomplete...","review":"It is because of the success achieved by Sixth Sense that this movie was given any credit at all. The plot is decidedly incomplete, and although the following two sequels may fix this problem, this installment simply cannot stand on its own.

It's an uninteresting twist on comic book super heroes, and what comic superhero can be so great if all it takes is a squirt gun to eliminate you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better as a coaster.","review":"The movie's build up was great. The back stories of each character led you to believe something great was gonna happen. Each person discovering their purpose and roles was the foundation for a epic ending battle. Alas the movies ending was the most anti climatic ever. -spoiler- He calls the cops. No battle between the superhero and his arch nemesis, no super intelligent trap that the hero has to narrowly escape, nothing. All he did was walk away and call the cops. At that moment the movie became a Frisbee. And Shyamalan became the most overrated director of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointment","review":"If you are expecting another 6th Sense like I was you'll be very disapointed.

Take \\"The Sixth Sense\\", add \\"X-Men\\", throw in a little Jules Winnfield and this is what you get.

Do yourself a favour - ask someone whose seen the film to tell you the ending, and spend the cash on something more worthy. Sorry, Night, must try harder."},{"rating":"1","title":"C'mon already","review":"Pacing. In a word that was this films biggest problem. Not to mention lack of plot. I saw this movie in the theaters and was not at all surprised when a man sitting a few rows behind me stood up and yelled \\"C'mon already.\\" However the real shock came when no one in the theater even responded to this out burst. Bascially this would of been a great short film. However it dragged on for nearly 2 hours. I am generally a great fan of both Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson and I greatly enjoyed The Sixth Sense. But even the \\"surprise\\" ending was a tremendous let down. Despite a few amusing scenes, this film rates very high on my don't waste your time list."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice enough Special Edition","review":"For a movie like this, picture and sound are paramount to enjoying this, and the transfer on this DVD is exceptional. I also enjoyed seeing the deleted scenes, and the little documentaries on the subject matter that makes up \\"Unbreakable\\". I have to confess I didn't see this film when it was in theatres, and for the most part, people I talked to who did see it were pretty divided. One of the things that impressed me about \\"Unbreakable\\" was that it didn't stay in a conventional genre. It's not really a drama, a thriller, or even a comic-book type film. The performances are solid and the ending (while being somewhat abrupt, and being a major punching bag in the negative reviews of this film) works just fine. It's a flawed, but impressive film nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie Misconceptions","review":"This movie is great if you go into it realizing before hand that it is a comic book movie and nothing else. Don't watch it expecting Sixth Sense cause you're not gonna get it. Superhero lovers will enjoy this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"If you don't harbor any affection for comic books, you may not care for this film because it takes them rather seriously. I used to read a lot of comics and still feel nostalgic toward them, but even I had to roll my eyes a little bit over some of Samuel Jackson's impassioned speeches on their true meaning. The pace of the movie was also slower than I expected. However, the more I think about this film, the more I appreciate it. In this age in which too many movies are edited for audiences with the attention span of an infant, its nice to see a filmmaker take his time to develop the kind of mood and atmosphere that this film has. If you want to see a special-effects laden slugfest, rent \\"X-Men,\\" \\"Superman\\" or \\"Batman.\\" M. Night Shyamalan is giving us a different kind of story: what if such a hero could actually exist in the same world that we do?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078","review":"Unbreakable is the legend of a real life superhero, brought to you by M. Night Shyamalan. The idea is profoundly unique and the cast is great, but I really didn't like how it turned out. The first half of the movie was awesome, but as Shyamalan movies tend to do, it got weird, in this case too weird for me. While I love Samuel L. Jackson, his character was just annoying and I didn't really consider him a threatening villain. Bruce Willis on the other hand was terrific, but his character was just naturally dull. Shyamalan wanted to keep the story as real and believable as possible, but a superhero who just can't get hurt and has no other real powers is just kind of stupid. I love the uniqueness of the story, but the film just didn't do much for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"great potential, poor realization","review":"This movie is a great disappointment. With interesting plot and deep philosophical message, it could have been a great movie. Unfortunately for the viewer, this promising set up has been turned into a boring crimi with unclear purpose. On top of everything, both main actors' performance (B. Willis and S.L. Jackson) fell behind their usual qualities. Avoid this one unless you are a diehard fan of one of the two main actors!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed but great (If you're a comic book fan)","review":"I can see why a lot of people didn't like this. It's very unique and NOT for everyone. Most people didn't even know what the movie was about when they first went to go see it. They just knew it was from \\"that guy who made Sixth Sense\\". That alone would account for much of the disappointment with it.But, for those of us that are taken with the mythology of the comic book hero, there is a lot in here. This movie deals with the questions of how a hero is made. And if evil deeds produce that hero, does that mean that the tragedies that reveal him were actually worth the suffering? I'd never seen a movie deal with this before and I was enthralled through the whole thing.It DOES suffer from a pacing issue and the ending is a little...rushed, but it's still a highly original and entertaining film. Kudos to all those involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"POSING THE QUESTION: WHAT IF SUPERHEROES DID EXIST...","review":"I loved THE SIXTH SENSE, and Shamalayan's take on the possibilities of actual superheroes in our midst ( and our present society's fixation on such an improbability ) in UNBREAKABLE was presented in such a low-key ( some might scoff, and say 'simplistic' ) fashion that one almost wishes that the premise were true. Willis and Jackson as the main protagonists in the film deliver some quite nuanced performances, and the atmospheric camerawork, and subtle ratcheting of tension throughout the film built to a very decent ( and not overtly contrived ) conclusion. If not taken too seriously, UNBREAKABLE is quite engrossing, even thought-provoking, and well worth a second, or even a third viewing. Good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest movies ever made!!!!!","review":"Im serious when I say this, Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jacksons performances were far past great. M. Night Shayamalan made another great hit. This movie has a really good story and a shocking ending that some people don't get until the movie actually finishes but it is easy to get. Im not going to ruin it for those who haven't watched but its a nice DVD set with the 2 DVD's and a little book that contains info on the movie superheroes and the director. Although hate cardboard alot. It doesn't l;ook nice and get's damaged fast. This movie also has one of the most, if not the most emotional soundtrack ever made. You have to watch it a couple times to really like it. The soundtrack is hard to get so if you see it I suggest you get it right away. So go watch it, it's not a boring film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very smart","review":"Unbreakable is passable entertainment as long as you're renting and not actually buying a DVD or paying full theater prices. It's just not very well thought out. Willis has to question his wife and son to figure out if he's ever been sick. Well, it turns out he's never ever been sick a day in his life. If you'd never ever been sick a day in your life, wouldn't you know that? Never missed a day of work -- wouldn't you know that? This is probably a laugh-out-loud comedy to Cal Ripken. There were numerous instances such as this when my friends and I turned to each other and wondered what had happened to the sharp, logical screenwriter of The Sixth Sense. The pacing is the same as The Sixth Sense, but it had a purpose there -- here, it's just lethargic filmmaking. And the ending, well -- I didn't see it coming, but I didn't much care, either. \\"Unbreakable\\" is not the word I would give to M. Night Shyamalan's winning streak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunh?!?!?","review":"After seeing 6th Sense, I was eagerly awaiting Shaymelan's follow up. Ohhhhhhhhhhhh...kaaayyyyyy.I would say that this is a love it or hate it movie. I hated it, but I know several people who loved it. Willis, again, manages his role with the skill you'd expect. Jackson...all I can say is 'Is there ANYTHING this man can't do. The acting is fine. But the story is a head scratcher. I've heard that, if you are familliar with Comic Books, this is a great film. I'm not, so it explains it for me, at least.I put this in the category of Chinese Dinner films.

I didn't think something that was seemingly minor would have such a effect on the film. They would be wise to remove it in the DVD version. Otherwise \\"Unbreakable\\" is dark, brooding, and amazing.

Like the well in an outhouse!","review":"Everything about this movie was fantastic, except for the plot, script, characterization, and acting. I was so touched when Bruce Willis showed that he really is a superhero by untying a couple of knots, beating up a fat, drunken janitor and falling into a pool. It showed me that there's a superhero inside everybody--by lowering my standards for superheros so far that nobody could possibly fail to meet them. Had Yoda seen this movie, he would certainly have kicked Shaft off the Jedi Council!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT as good as Sixth Sense","review":"Interesting at first, then just drags on until its dumb ending.

Jackson and Robin Wright Penn.The director is also pretty good .A very good concept movie,but very frankly,the results could have been better.I didn't even see all the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I still don't get it","review":"This movie totally sucked!

Premise is silly, naive, and I'll say silly once more. It lost me big time when Jackson's character told Willis' he became a security guard because he \\"wanted to help people\\". I've been a security guard; they're the vast semi-employable with no skills: technical, people, or otherwise. And in comparison to 'Sixth Sense': amount I believe it's possible to see dead people-8%; amount I believe there are super-heroes walking the Earth-0%.

My biggest complaint, I have a daughter with O.I. and as much as I love Samuel L Jackson's work, he was way to big and healthy for the role. The only way a man as big, strong and healthy looking could convince me he had O.I. is if he was one of those rare actors who could inhabit the role and become the fragile person the character was meant to be. I have not known many actors who could convincingly become that which they most certainly are not. It is a rare talent. I once had an acting instructor, 20 something at the time, with no make up, costume or props, he transformed himself into a little old man, before the entire class. That is a rare talent. This said, if you can ignore or get past this incongruity the movie is a fine piece of imagination and execution in all other ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shorter sometimes is better","review":"The story is good, but not good enough for a movie length film. The story would have been better as an Outer Limits type show. Also, I think the director who narrated the deleted scenes seems to be a little too full of himself. And there were deleted scenes that could have helped this miserably slow movie. If you are an insomniac, then you will love this movie. Otherwise, don't expect too much - although the last 15 minutes are the best of the whole movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I'm a big fan of Shyamalan and The 6th Sensebut this film was so full of nothing with a ridiculous\\"shock\\" ending that it was all we could do torestrain ourselves from laughing out loud in painwhile we were watching it.Worst unintentionally bad film since \\"The Comfort of Strangers\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the impatient","review":"OK, the plot's been laid out in hundreds of other reviews so I'll skip the rehash. What I'd like to point out are the aspects of the film that I found especially, well, special. First off, David's son was moved by pride in his dad and frustration that he'll never be like him. Poor kid. Second, I was left wondering how they'll keep the secret from Mom if Dad will be diasppearing every night to go beat up bad guys, when she's so apalled by violence of any kind. Third, IS David bulletproof? Probably, given his resistance to impact and lacerations, even from razor-sharp metal and broken glass. But we never know, and how could be possibly take the chance of finding out? I hear this was supposed to have been expanded into a trilogy. One may hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"best shyamalan movie","review":"This is by far my favorite M. Night Shyamalan movie ever. It doesn't get the credit it deserves.

There are also other areas where less noticable distortion occurs. None of these errors are present in the disc's lossy Dolby Digital soundtrack nor in the DVD's lossy DTS soundtrack, so it is clear that Disney dropped the ball in encoding the lossless PCM soundtrack. For the price they are charging for this release, I hope they set up a replacement program with a new pressing to remedy the defective PCM 5.1 soundtrack. I recommend avoiding this disc until Disney addresses the issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shatters under scrutiny","review":"One of my friends loved this movie, another completely hated it. I remember being somewhere in the middle after seeing it in the theater. The silliness of the movie's main conceit didn't bother me-after all, the movie is about comic books. What bothered me the second time around is that it really isn't a very good movie. Is Bruce Willis supposed to be the same ghost that he played in The Sixth Sense? Is every movie that Shamalan makes going to be about bland people in a bland world? The brightest thing in the entire movie is a Tropicana orange juice carton. I think rather than watching another Shamalan movie (I'm sure Mel Gibson's character in Signs will be every bit as lifeless as the protaganists in Shamalan's other two movies) I'll check out some Hitchcock, who at least knew how to meld humor and energy with tension and suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was bored...","review":"I personally did not like this movie. It was my husband's idea to purchase this particluar DVD. He enjoyed it. Maybe it is a \\"guy flick.\\" I just felt bored with it. The movie is slow going and difficult to follow. At the end I felt it was unfinished and bizarre. This is not one of Bruce Willis's best movies. I just could not get into it. This is just me..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting Thriller Should Have Been Longer and Explored More","review":"Filmed Just down the Block from me in Manayunk, Philadelphia! This is a solid movie which is nothing short of solid entertainment. Although the movie fell short of its true potential, and probably could have been a little longer with a few more sub-plots, Unbreakable keeps you wanting more! My only regret is that the film was not longer and had a little more 'meat' in terms of additional sub-plots. Nontheless, Unbreakable is thoroughly entertaining even though I felt I should have gotten even more out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome, nerve shattering, thriller with a twist........","review":"i loved it! but it took me 2 viewings to really apreciate the plot and especially that jaw dropping twist at the films climax. the acting by all is splendidas is the great, eerie musical score! the thx dts sound and picture quality rank way up there! i really enjoed this film even more than the sixth sense! rent it or buy this one-you wil be on the edge of your seat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very underrated","review":"This is a thinking person's movie, which is why so many people hated it. It's slow, but the pace makes it all the more realistic and engaging. Great story and acting, it's just good... but short-attention spanners won't have the patience for it... oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underated","review":"This is the one of the most underated films ever. It is right below the most underated film on my list, Road to Perdition. While these two movies are totally different, they are the same in one aspect. Amazingly directed, acted, and just plain awesome. The ending of this film is classic. It did not blow me away but it did give me chills on how it was presented and what was said. The best comic book movie ever, that was not even based on a comic. I wonder what it would have been like if it came out now during all the comic book movies?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Liked it Much More the 2nd Time Around!","review":"The first time I saw this movie I would have given it three stars. Now that I have seen it numerous times, I would consider it my favorite M. Night film (followed by The Sixth Sense, The Village, and finally Signs) even though I liked all four of his films a great deal. It's a little slow at times, but it is a great superhero film with a little more realism than say Spiderman. Worth buying, especially if you like M. Night's films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbeatable","review":"M. Night Shyamalan's rapid-fire follow up to \`The Sixth Sense' is, for my money, the better film. With his wonderfully original and perfectly structured screenplay, this young master once again has us entirely in his thrall. But it's the beautifully understated performances from Willis, Wright and Jackson which really make this work. With the wrong actors, or the wrong direction, this unusual story with its \`family values' subtext could easily have descended into absurdity or melodrama, but the tone of chilling plausibility is maintained till the end. Slick production design, thoughtful camera work and editing, and a surprisingly effective score from James Newtown Howard, add the final touches to what is a very, very impressive piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comics come to life","review":"It's a wonderful \\"origin\\" story. Comic book fans will appreciate the depths that the director has gone through to show us the birth of a superhero. I would really love to see his continuing adventures, but I know that's not going to happen. Perhaps it's best that we just have this first piece of the proposed trilogy. Some may think it a little slow, but I think the detail is what makes the movie special.If you are really a fan of comic book superheroes, or just like a well told story then this will work for you. It's not action packed but then this is not about a superhero. It's about discovery and that takes time. It's a good journey to go along for.Good replay value. You pick new things up with each veiwing. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rename it to Unwatchable (to the tune of negative stars)","review":"This movie was very disappointing. The storyline was very weak along with the weak characters. The worst thing about this movie was the ending which I saw coming a mile away. I wasn't the least bit surprised. How do they get big actors like Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson to do films like this? Also I think that this director reached the peak of his career with the Sixth Sense. Maybe he should try children's films. I wish that I wouldn't have wasted 2 hours of my life on this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable","review":"Unbreakable was a truly awful movie that combined a sophmoric plot and Bruce Willis at his worst.

Nice photography though. If you can manage to stay awake. Not worth a rental. I found myself admiring the aesthetic qualities of the bookself next to the TV. Stupid, stupid plot. Not worth watching to see how stupid the plot is. An attempt to have a surprise ending. Don't bother.Is this a worse movie than Gladiator? Of course not, but it's not a whole lot better. Just bad in a completely different way. Hence the two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF TIME","review":"Best thing about this movie was the trailer...Terrible movie.. had some potential... half way through i was still eager to watch.. but the end is LAUGHABLE....Terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING","review":"Many friends warned me before watching this movie! But I didn't listen... now I regret it!This movie is very weak and boring. I cannot imagine the same director and writer of Sexth Sense directed and wrote this movie!The movie failed because:1. The dialoge was EXTREMELY terrible.2. The acting job was no special.3. Lack of suspense and surprises.4. The wife and kid characters were terribly shallow and weak.5. The events were very slow and boring.6. The overall story is silly.7. The director is to blame for so many weak points all through the movie.8. The settings and interaction between the main characters was weak.The ending was a bit surprising but after being bored all through the movie you won't care or be impressed with it.Don't say you haven't been WARNED! This movie has nothing to do with the PERFECTION of Sixth Sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbreakable?!! More like Unbearable!","review":"A painfully boring and slow pitiful excuse for a movie. What do you want to bet the guy that wrote the Sixth Sense wrote this long before Sixth Sense? You know how it is, when you are hot the studios ask, \\"What else have you got?\\" Pull that old script out of the closet and rush it into production. Put a couple of stars in it, some nice previews and bingo. The most laughable scene in this movie is where Bruce Willis (who has these supernatural powers and is almost invincable) has to be saved from a pool by children!....by CHILDREN! The Twilight Zone used to do this kind of thing but much better and in less than 30 minutes. Avoid this one at all costs unless you want to catch up on sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"We're looking up at the bottom of the barrel.","review":"Terrible, terrible terrible. What else can one say - Willis is wooden, Jackson is so preposterous it's cringeworthy. The film has no redeeming features, it trundles along at a speed that a slug would be scornful of. The plot I found to be ridiculous - no matter how much I suspended my disbelief. My advice would be to keep your money and start a stamp collection - it would definately be more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the 5 stars rating","review":"Genre: drama (for the poor audience) Unbreakable in this movie must be only the b...s of the poor audience. Never in my life I saw something as boring and ugly as this intollerable and stupid movie. Nothing here is good. Locations are ugly, so the costumes. Story is a real nonsense. Bruce shows just one of his only two expressions. The direction is always very very slow (indian timing). Cinematography is dark and bleak. The music seems like in an epic movie of 50s. I rate this movie 1 like BATTLEFIELD EARTH where at least there where some nice and strange piercing on the nose (and that's it) If you are curious for watching this movie wait for it on TV or go to the theater at your own risk"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, somebody stop him!","review":"Stupid, boring and irksome. Proves that Shyamalan wasn't just a one hit BLUNDER after the just slightly less stupid Sixth Sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absalutely Terrible!","review":"I went to see this movie in theaters and was horrified at how terrible it was. I thought the script had too many holes in it, and the movie was completely over dramatic. I can't say enough about how bad Bruce Willis was in this movie! He thought keeping an expressionless face the whole movie was called acting, and he tried too hard to capture the Sixth Sense all over again. The one positive thing I can say about this movie was it's directing. I really think M. Night Shyamalan has a great future, but this movie should be locked up and never shown anywhere ever again. Save yourself the agony and don't see this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"unbearable slow","review":"This story had a lot of potential. But I had the feeling that the director was trying to be too clever. From the very first camera shots in the train between the seats to the very slow and soft dialogue.The movie moved along very slowly and the ending, although far fetched was resonably good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I'm Smarter","review":"I read a review of Unbreakable in the Cincinnati Enquirer and the writer said the movie was great. He also said that the ending was some surprising twist. Either I'm smart or this man was extremely dumb.Unbreakable is not good. The ending has no twist. I guessed it in the first five minutes. That is incredibly disappointing.The best part of the movie, without giving away too much, is the action scene. that's right. there is basically one action scene. If there had more action, I might have liked this movie more.My 16-year-old-brother was bored for the first hour of this movie and my mom fell asleep for a half-hour of the movie.IGNORE the hype for this movie. Save you money. Sixth Sense was good. Unbreakable is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"If there were negative stars, this movie would get one","review":"This is a total mess. The kind of movie you are glad not to have spent money about. I wonder how many people got out of a movie theater literally swearing about this ridiculously slow, inconclusive, mass of nonsense. How did this script find a producer to finance it, I will never understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another M. Night Shyamalan disaster","review":"Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson do their best, but are undone by the ultimate auteur of our age, M. Night Shyamalan. Shyamalan's films are characterized by being plodding and moody, always with a \\"surprise\\" ending. Well, sorry, what he conceives of as being profound and clever, I see as lumbering and predictable.There are people whose films I like, those whose films I admire, those whose work I admire more than I like, and those whose work I like more than I admire. At the ends of the spectrum are those whose work I both admire and like and those whose work I neither admire nor like. Shyamalan is in this latter group.If you like any other of his films, you're probable slow enough to like this one. Otherwise, avoid at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit silly","review":"I rented this movie because M. Night Shyamalan made it. After watching it I'm glad I didn't buy it. It's a bit too stupid for me. It's a comic book movie but it doesn't look like one. Bruce Willis does not look like a super hero and this doesn't seem like a movie about a super hero. This movie is geared towards adults but is dumb enough for little kids. I doubt this would even make it as a comic book. If you're a comic fan go watch Spider-Man or Daredevil. If you're a M. Night fan go watch Sixth Sense or Signs. Leave this one on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected, intelligent superhero film.","review":"Don't let the previews fool you- \\"Unbreakable\\" is a superhero comic book film through and through. However, whereas most films like \\"Superman\\" have dopey action scenes and corny dialogue, \\"Unbreakable\\" creates carefully paced, thoughtful storyline about a man coming to grips about powers he may or may not have. Think of this as an 'origin tale' of an up and coming super hero. Other reviews may say that the ending ruins the film- it does anything but this...the ending is_dead on_and perfect_for the genre. If you're a comic book fan you'll love \\"Unbreakable.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Twisty? or predictable?","review":"When Unbreakable first came out, everyone was talking about the twist ending. I think it was Entertainment Weekly that said the mere mention of a twist ending ruined the ending altogether. I would have to agree. From the moment I started watching the movie I began to speculate about the end. When one thinks about it for a while it was easy to figure out. Maybe it wasn't as good as the Sixth Sense (which the ending was ruined for me) but I didn't really like the Sixth Sense as much as the rest of the world did anyway. So it was really a let down but we'll see what happens with this summer's Signs, maybe, hopefully, it will be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliantly subtle","review":"Critically, yes, Bruce Willis is in it, there's a mystery, the pace is subdued, there's a kid as his costar... but the formula isn't identical... I thought this movie was superbly crafted. There's a tangible tension in plot and characterization, a mood delicately evoked that transcends the screen. I don't want to give away too much of the plot, because the beauty of this movie is watching it all unravel.I thought the presentstion of good and evil presented in the film were excellent. Using comic books and the intrigue that surrounds them... mutating that into real life super hereos (and not real life as in live action like the x-men) was an inventive and well-adapted idea.If you're a fan of comics or graphic novels, you must, must, must see this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbreakable Didn't Break New Ground","review":"Unbreakable could have been written as an episode for the Twilight Zone. Meaning, the story could have been told in 30 minutes. All that was built up ends in a Twilight Zone type twist ending, yet it is a disappointing one. The film making is stylish and moody, but the pacing is too slow. Also, the Samuel Jackson character as well as Spencer Treat Clark as Bruce Willis' son are hard to sympathize with. I'm a comic book collector, and this movie did not put \\"fanboys\\" in a good light. I think a lot of people were not impressed with this movie. Just look in the Amazon.com \\"Used MarketPlace\\" and you'll see why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbreakable","review":"I was struck watching this film by the old fable about the emporer's new clothes. As a big fan of \\"The Sixth Sense\\", it was shocking to sit through this overly long rehash of someone's juvenile fantasies filmed in too dark, out-of-focus cinema techniques. Someone, somewhere along the way, should have told the young boy genius director that this was bad, bad, bad.

Darker than the Dark Knight (batman), this movie takes the genre and applies it to our life today.What is unfortunate is the many that do not get this film. I have a friend who works as a foley artist (sound effects) and he said that when working on this film they called it \\"un-watchable' - but sit down...take the couple of hours...and let yourself be taken away.I wish, that in some way, shape or form...M.N.S. contiues this saga to the two additional installments that were meant to shape this sage. Even without Unbreakable stands alone as a great film."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Twist Ending That You Didn't See Coming","review":"Once you've seen Unbreakable and you understand the ending, it all comes to you in a single solitary flash: so simple, yet so satisfying. M Night Shalayman follows up his blockbuster \\"The Sixth Sense\\" with a fantasy about comic book heroes and their destiny in life. Bruce Willis turns in some good underacting as the hero David Dunn who has been at conflict with his true identity his entire life. Samuel L. Jackson plays a disabled comic art dealer with a more than unusual world outlook. The one scene that you won't forget is Willis bench pressing almost the whole house in front of his awestruck son. Unbreakable is definitely worth buying, the second disc has some good behind the scenes commentary, deleted scenes, and a documentary about comics and superheroes. The ending is quite a surprise and well worth the build up...recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Directing, what else can I say","review":"What do you get when you have great actors and a promising story. Nothing when you combine it with an awful director. This movie is so horrible that it is more enjoyable to make fun of it then watch it.Main plot ideas are seeminly put in in random order. One of the main mysteries of the whole movie turns out to only come into play for about 2 minutes, and getting to the scene seemed impossible so they have the character waiting around for something to happen. The only one action scene in the movie takes about 5 minutes in all, and all is done with no sound at all except some grunting and the occasional thump. The movie works on character development throughout the movie, only to have nothing to do with it later on.Maybe this was a hurried film, or low budget, but even so, its bad for that. The story looks as if everything was just thrown in. Dumb and Dumber had a better story. Save yourself the money and buy a movie worth seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie is the worst movie ever ever EVER!!!","review":"....This movie was completley sick and twisted and was probably written by someone in a mental institution.

The plot manipulated the audiences' emotions to such a degree, then let you down so hard you can almost feel it. I walked out on the ending, although I'm surprised I didn't walk out sooner.

You keep noticing things as you mull it over and over in your mind. Unbreakable is about a lot of things, but not comic books. Comic books are just a cover for what this movie was truly about. It is about the never-ending battle between good and evil, the dependance of good and evil upon each other in order to exist, weaknesses, and about fulfilling one's true destiny. If you are looking for an shoot-em-up car chase movie, this isn't for you. This movie has a deliberately slow pace, with surreal climaxes, and an ending that will leave you with questions. It is a movie for those who like to think. I could watch this movie over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as \\"The Sixth Sense\\" but still compelling","review":"This premise doesn't seem to be as \\"fresh\\" as Shyamalan's previous success. A man suddenly becomes invulnerable like a comic-book character. But like most modern comic books, unlike the black-hat white-hat ones of yore, this comic book hero has shades of gray and vulnerabilities, though his body has undergone terrifying changes.The homage to comic books is much better done than in Kevin Smith films. At least it captures more of the artistry rather than adolescent obsession. Still, isn't it an adolescent's dream to be invulnerable? Not when it comes at a terrible price..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbreakable (2000)","review":"This movie is the best sci-fi drama I've ever seen. M. Night Shamalan does it again with such great direction and an original story line. The story is basically about a guy who soon finds out that he may possess human powers and his ordeals coping with it. Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson deliver very powerful performances, so it's impossible to take your eyes off the screen. Like Shamalan's other films this one leaves you in suspense throughout the entire film, and has a surprise ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"gripping","review":"on one side theres a man stricking by the ability to withstand anything, he cant get hurt, but his downfall is water. on the other side there is a man who is fragile and his bones can break easily, and his weekness is stairs and the fragile man reveals the invincable man his secret and things happen. both Willis and Jackson are powerful as always and this one really grabs you from the shocking beginning to the horrible truth at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dull, slow movie","review":"This movie moves like it was shot in slow motion. Bruce Willis seems to sleepwalk through the entire thing, and even the action scene fails to excite. Comic books play a significant part in the film and Shyamalan shot everything to look like it was framed in a comic panel. Sometimes this works, but once you notice the technique, it becomes annoying. Scenes that should be intimate, like a conversation between Willis and Jackson, are shot from far away to frame them between fence posts, instead of close up. Overall, very artificial. The ending is not a surprise, but it is hardly satisfying. The best part about this movie is Samuel Jackson, who, as always, provides a fine performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unmemorable.","review":"So Shyamalan and Willis got together, made \\"The Sixth Sense,\\" one of the most moving films ever, and as this movie might say, \\"we gave them our credit card number,\\" showing up in droves for \\"Unbreakable\\" on opening weekend. We remained glued to the screen for the first hour, despite the overuse of slow-motion and the minimal dialogue, because these guys did \\"The Sixth Sense,\\" and waiting that one out paid off, right? And \\"Unbreakable\\" also foreshadows a big surprise. But it's not that big and not that surprising. You don't need to bring any hankies to this movie. Bring several enemies instead, thereby wasting their time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not great","review":"I just saw this movie yesterday. I went into it in a really excited mood, but as I sat there I felt somewhat bored throughout most of the movie. There were a number of good scenes, but many of them felt somewhat awkward; for example, during a certain scene with a gun the theatre was laughing. I felt that it was supposed to be dramatic, but it came off as comedic. I also felt that the kid in the movie was trying far too much to be the kid from the Sixth Sense. But, there was some gold amid the lead. The ending was extremely powerful, it seems that the director has a knack for those suprise endings. Unfortunately, this isn't enough to make up for the slow pace and unbelievablility of the rest of it. I still don't understand why the drugs weren't in that guy's pockets?This movie might be good to rent, but I'd skip the $5-8 and long (though probably not for long) lines that it would cost to see it in the theatres."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHYAMALAN LOST A FEW SENSES MAKING UNBREAKABLE","review":"\\"Unbreakable\\" is fair. You see Bruce Willis' paycheck is huge, so cut out train accident sequence and just show a news junket of a crashed train.Furthermore the sets are so dark you wonder why people are living in such depressed surroundings. The plot itself is interesting and kept me watching, but as the movie progressed it got dumber and dumber.Shyamalan shows up in the movie for a cameo (Does he think he is the next Hitchcock?)....Not on my life.The characters never evolve, you never understand the relationship between Willis' character and his son, or his wife.Other dead ends are with Samuel L. Jackson character who is nuts, but you wonder how he found Willis' and how he knew he had this special gift.The movie is just digestible fare not worth a movie ticket admission, but okay for rental.With \\"The Sixth Sense\\" the kid could see dead people, with \\"Unbreakable\\" Willis could see crazy people....stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbreakable","review":"The film starts slowly but you soon realize that it is the film's mode of development. It's a great story with a surprise ending. You really feel what the characters are feeling. I cringed and turned my head when Samuel L. Jackson's character fell down those stairs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bruce Willis","review":"Before I watch the Unbreakable,Without any doupt I buy The all the Dvd's when the Bruce Willis in any role.But after this one I will read the all the rewiews then decide to buy or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"About that Poncho!!!","review":"Was this a comedy ? While watching someone, face unseen, skulking about in a poncho on some heroic(?) mission, we wondered if Bruce had abandoned the film entirely due to embarassment and boredom! And about that dialogue...\\"Stop, you're not supposed to shoot your father!\\" How idiotic and where was the much needed psychiatric care for the boy? This movie was a joke and complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, slow and a waste of time","review":"SLOW SLOW SLOW, that is how i would describe this movie. Confusing. This has to be the worse movie i have ever seen. I can not find a person in my life that has liked it. dont waste your time or money on it. Just my opinion"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible...","review":"Yes, like many others I am a huge fan of the Sixth Sense. And no, I did not go into this movie expecting or even wanting another Sixth Sense. I was actually hoping for something better. What I got was a movie that was literally painful to watch. Yes, the weird camera angles were cute, but the drab dialog and abusively slow pacing were unbearable. Halfway through the movie, my friend and I were shifting restlessly and giving each other bored looks. By the end of the movie, we were ready to run out of the theater screaming. Watching the ushers at the theater empty ashtrays would have been more exciting than watching Unbreakable...I would NOT buy this DVD unless I felt like torturing myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"As enticing as a bus-ride!","review":"Despite my usual verbosity, this time I'll be short: what a boring and disappointing movie! The plot is turtle-paced and I've caught myself on acute desire to give the characters a good push in the back so that they act and speak faster. B Willis is somnambular and S Jackson should get a better haircut and change his shining violet raincoat for something less awkward looking. The viewer feels fooled in the end by rather an ordinary movie-trick.It's worth to watch it only to compare it with the over-hyped \\"6th Sense\\". Maybe I'm too harsh, but I consider it lost money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie sucks","review":"I watched this in the movie theater and boy was it boring. If this was a thriller, I wasn't thrilled. This is the type of movie you'd show your kids if you wanted them to sleep because it starts of slow and the ending isn't worth waiting for. This is almost like Blairwitch project where they build up the hype and the product ain't tight. I recommend you skip this and buy yourself a homestyle melt in Burger king, its much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Disappointment","review":"I love \\"Sixth Sense\\" and fully anticipated loving this film as well. What an unbelievably disappointing experience. I kept waiting for something even remotely interesting or believable, interesting or meaningful to happen, and got to the end with my mouth hanging open in disbelief in the waste of time and money spent. What a piece of nothing. Not even remotely interesting. Bruce Willis and company should, however, be given an award--the Razzy perhaps--for their ability to maintain not only straight faces, but utterly grim and emotionless faces. Don't waste your time. If I could give it less than 1 star, which Amazon doesn't allow, I'd give it a .001 for Willis' lack of emotional depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbareably Boring","review":"First thing first, I saw the Sixth Sense and found that it was ruined by good reviews and over hyped and the much talked about twist end which was predictable, after that I desided not to read a thing on Unbreakable. That didn't help one bit. While The Sixth Sense wasn't much great I liked the idea it had and it had some good moments, at least it managed to keep me interested for awhile, Unbreakable lost my intrest around 5 minutes into the movie, thirty minutes later I was almost asleep, I wish I could of fallen asleep for this movie went no where FAST. The plot was the same thing re hashed over and over again, Jackson keeps trying the prswade Willis that he is a super hero but Wissis doesn't listen, that is basily what the whole movie is like, there is actully no point in seeing this film at for it is just far to boring, I highly recommend that you skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak, dissapointing","review":"This is probably my least favorite M Night film (I have not seen Lady in the Water). Sure, it has an interesting premise, but it just doesn't go anywhere. It barely has any kind of suspense or intrigue after the first 20 minutes. The characters are barely interesting, though I do have to give props to Sam Jackson for giving an effectivly creepy and on pitch performance. Bruce Willis sleep walks through the film, as usual. All in all, rather dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Premise But","review":"It's just too slow and lugubrious. All the scenes are dark and depressing. I felt like asking someone to turn on the lights! Fine acting, cinematography and all that, but I'm really not a big fan of comic books, and especially not of movies made about comic books. If I had known that this movie was a comic book story I would have never rented it. If you like comic books, you'll probably love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbearable more like it","review":"The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars is because of the great Samuel L Jackson. I'm probably the only person that found myself asking why was this made? Mr. Glass was the only thing keeping me in the theatre, and I work there!!! I have no intention on buying this DVD. I'm mainly writing this review to see if anyone shares my opinion about this movie. Leave the comic book scene to Kevin Smith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good movie","review":"IMHO, this movie will be great if it is 45 mins shorter. They run out of idea half way through and start repeating the same idea over and over.The ending is not very good or \\"deep\\" either.Skip it"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"Since this movie stars Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson I thought it would be good. It was so boring I couldn't wait for it to end. Everybody in the movie speaks in a hushed monotone and it's hard to hear what they're saying. It's probably just as well because the plot is ridiculous and far fetched. Bruce Willis' character cannot be injured in accidents where everyone else is killed. Samuel Jackson is his opposite who breaks bones just by sneezing. Samuel Jackson has a theory that characters in comic books are real and are on earth and represent good and evil. This is actually the theme of the movie the best I could tell. None of the characters in the movie are likeable and I really wasn't interested in what happened to them. I hope they don't make a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"M. Night is a Modern Film Guru","review":"I really enjoyed this movie. It had an eery pace to it that picked up as the the story progressed. I loved the acting and directing and the story of a normal man who finds out that he is not so normal after all. I love stories based on real fantasy. That is a story that is based in our time and place, but will have a supernatural twist to it. this movie shows great emotion and human reaction to the fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfying","review":"This film lingered with me the next few days--which, to me, is a pretty good recommendation.Rent before you purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Samuel L. Jackson makes this film!","review":"Samuel L Jackson was incredible in this film, Bruce Willis is good too but Samuel steals the show. After all the negative reviews I wasn't expecting much when I finally watched the movie. After the first half hour I was very impressed but still I was waiting for the movie to fall apart. An hour goes by and I'm loving the movie so I think this must be one of those movies that disappoints in the last half. An hour and a half passes and I'm glued to my chair. When is this movie supposed to turn sour? Two hours go by and we're running out of time, it's only gotten better. The only thing left that can go wrong now would have to be at the tail end of the movie. Yet the ending was fantastic! So my question still is, what is wrong with this movie??? In my opinion, absolutely nothing! I found it to be very creative & unique, just the kind of movie I appreciate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable","review":"Sadly, this film did not live up to those high expectations. I found THE SIXTH SENSE to be one of the best films for ages, but this is a lame follow up. I like Samuel L. Jackson films normally, and he is good in this, but it isn't one of his better films. I almost fell asleep watching this as the pacing is so slow and character development is scarce. It becomes un-interesting and far fetched, as for the twist, well, its not too bad, but nothing surprising. I was hoping this was going to be a brilliant movie experiance, my advice is not to keep your hopes up, because, unlike the film, they will be breakable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Story","review":"This is an incredible book and is an inspiration to all women of the world.

From the other review I have read, I can safely say that this is a book that you must buy after you finish this review. I always thought that Jesus was black, but I never knew that one man (Etiese T. Mkpa Abasika) could have the knowledge to publish a novel of this caliber. I can't wait to read it so that I can write another review and praise it with even more validity! I hope that my synopsis has proven valuable. I can say with a true heart that I LOVE the cover. It is a cover that should be looked at again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under appreciated thriller","review":"Released in 1982, this film features effective performances and does a good job with creating creepy imagery. The story centers around a young man (Zeljko Ivanek) who becomes commited to a state run mental institution in order to cure his amnesia. Kathryn Harrold is the doctor who attempts to aid him. The catch is he can project his dreams to the concious world. Reality and dream reality run amok for Harrold in her quest to cure the young man. If you like intelligent thrillers, this is a movie to be viewed. Horror fans take note: this film does feature some gore, a prerequisite beheading, and enough chills to deliver the goods."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highschool Rolling Music","review":"First off, I will say it does take alot to impress me when it comes to trance. I hate anything having to do with Ibiza, jokenfold, and most mainstream trance. With that caveat out of the way, I will say this album does start off strong, but then quickly degenerates into fluffy \\"first time doing E in highschool\\" trance, almost right up there with the cheese to be found in Ministry of Sound. (might as well mix in some rainbow bright and carebears) The only actual psy elements I heard didn't really kick in until towards the end of the album, when it starts to pick up a little. This album would be great for mixing, but really can't stand very well on its own. If you are at the point where you've found Juno Reactor, Shpongle, Infected Mushroom, Hallucinogen, you probably won't be impressed with this. Its just too standard, not nearly tripped out enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Worthless","review":"As other posts have noted, this is not the Ace hard rubber unbreakable comb of old.

Fortunately they capitulated. This book is an exercise in gross self-indulgence and unprofessionalism. It's not only that it's illegible, but it's loaded with postage stamp sized pictures (literally) that are tinted red, blue, green, yellow....etc. It's as if a child pasted a disparate bunch of pictures in a notebook and made an attempt at writing prose.

The house rented out for a party is only a small part of the plot. It's mostly about journalists struggling against the restricitons set on them by the Islamic Republic of Iran. It's dark - but very good. Though really a minor part of the film, the party scene gives one a glimpse into the life of real young Iranians. The images of veiled women and gun-toting bearded men so prominent in Western media are here completely contradicted by scenes of young women in revealing party clothes and young men break-dancing to western music."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"Again if you like bluesy music, then you'll probably like Little Feat.

Musically, this pop product from California is stylistically consistent. Yet the instrumentation is diverse and each member is resourceful. But it's Lowell George's vocals and slide guitar that are primarily at the center. He's not flashy and that's a positive. You get treated to 12-bar blues, a song of prescription meds for tripping and a blues with an accordian.But the three highlights are \\"Easy To Slip\\", a jaunty acoustic/electric number about lighting up and the sheer joy that memory drifting can project, \\"Teenage Nervous Breakdown\\" in which they switch to the domain of energy-driven rock and roll and the title track, a leisurely-paced country blues in which a generous helping of background vocals provides just the right amount of tension."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS ONE IS A BANGER","review":"This one will surprise a lot of people, Bobby Valentino's debut released in 2005, under the Ludacris imprint \\"Disturbing The Peace\\", is a complete BANGER!

This album is about as basic as RnB can get. The only song on this album worth getting happy about is slow down, and that is only due to its unique sound. However on listening to the rest of this album i found that the 'unique' sound of slow down was dragged into every song.Every time i skipped to the next track i found that the distinctive base from slow down was present, in the end i began to think that maybe JLO worked with Bobby on this album as she also has the tendancy to use dodgy sounds in her music (mainly high pitched squeeky sounds... as heard in Jenny from the block and Get Right)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised","review":"Bobby Valentino's self titled album was extremely surprising. Didn't think it would be good at all. I like many of the tracks.The only big problem is they sound pretty much the same. The flow of the cd is consistent.

But I should have known that, that's how these Artist glab our attentions. They put out their tightest joint on their album as their single to get you hooked.

Tell me has a great beat but what he did on it is less then good, stilling Ginuwine's lyrics and concept (in these jeans) and flowing with boring melodies again. I really only like track 2 and 6.

The best songs are the one just mentioned, \\"tell me\\", which sounds so good and catchy with the nice, exotic beats, \\"my angel\\", \\"give me a chance\\", and \\"never lonely\\". I will admit that the whole beats and vibe of the cd is much a bit of the same and it is repentive, which is why all it deserves is a four rating.

Despite a small hit with \\"Blackberry Molasses\\" the group did'nt do so hot in the long run. But after attending Clark Atlanta University Bobby realized his love for music was unshakable. He joined forces with Ludacris and DTP and released his solo album \\"Disturbing Tha Peace Presents, Bobby Valentino\\" After huge success with \\"Slow Down\\" he released a club banger \\"Tell Me\\" and his thoughtful ballad \\"My Angel\\" which is about his parents love for one another should be making waves on the airways soon. The album is full of songs equally apt for the club or the bedroom. My personal favorite, \\"Tell Me\\" is one of the hottest joints of the year. Bobby has a great voice and really put his all into this CD. If you don't take my word for it, take his, while promoting his album on BET's 106&Park;, he offered an eight song guarantee. There you go!Victoria"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's pretty good.","review":"as usual, like any r and b singer, we have dirty filthy disgusting sexual lyrics, so that really takes away from the thing as a whole, but the beats just sound good to me so I like it. His voice sounds just the same as the singer from Pretty Ricky so it's hard to tell the difference. And by the way his name's Bobby Wilson, not Bobby Valentino. He just wants to sound like he's real romantic, I guess. All he talks about is (darn) sex and it gets so irritating. Makes me wonder if he thinks about anything important or meaningful. This is the kinda stuff a woman would sing abou,t all they think about is sex anyway. It's the same with guys too, but it's just so frustrating 'cause it a;ll they talk bout., i get annoyed bi it.

Seeking to inherit the family fortune, his conniving cousin - teamed with a pair of London strippers - plot to drive him over the edge for good. If you can suffer through the often tedious first hour and a half, the outrageous ending is good for a laugh or two, but otherwise there's little to recommend here.Someone needs to talk to Sinema Diable about the quality of its products. This DVD - like its other releases - is subpar. The print that was used for the transfer shows a lot of wear and the sound is marginal at best, which is a little galling considering that the back cover promises \\"an \`All New' Gorgeous Digital Transfer.\\" It may be \\"all new,\\" but it's far from \\"gorgeous.\\" There are no extras on this disc, either.

It's probably ok with salsa, merengue or other caribean rythm as long as I don't know most of them, but it is not samba for sure! It's indeed a disrespect with all composers who try to create samba music seriously, wich is very far away of Byrne's songs. The impression \\"Rei Momo\\" caused me is that Byrne put together all latin american rythms he heard about, without studying them deeply. And the title of the CD is completely out of point. Rei Momo is one of the most traditional characters of Brazilian carnival and specific of samba music. It just don't have anything to do with the type of music Byrne has done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Profound respect","review":"Speaking as a Latino, I have nothing but respect for Mr. Byrne.

For me, this is the pinnacle of his solo work. Talk about genre bending, he has written songs ranging from the Columbian cumbia to Brazilian samba, and seemingly everything Latin in between. Lyrically scary and musically enchanting. What can you say about this? It just shows the pure genius of David Byrne."},{"rating":"2","title":"ELEGANT AND ENJOYABLE","review":"From the quirky and experimental music of Talking Heads to the joyful rhythms of Latin America, in a graceful leap. This is quite an accessible and versatile album (unlike some of Talking Heads' stuff) with elegant melodies and witty lyrics, easy to digest and enjoy. My favourites include Make Believe Mambo, Independence Day and The Rose Tattoo. If an album is judged by the quality of the songs, this one is way up there. I'm not sure, though, whether it will appeal to all Talking Heads fans. Better listen first, before you buy. But I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"Rei Momo is one of the greatest albums I have ever listened to. So many songs that never grow old, like Independence Day, The Call of the Wild, Dirty Old Town and Crazy for Love have kept this CD in my player forever.Lewis Kahn's violin solo on Independence Day is one of my favorites of all time.Co-producer Lillywhite (Peter Gabriel, Talking Heads, U2, The Pogues, etc.) does an impecable job throughout. Even though the album can strike some as lacking \\"flavor\\" or sounding artificial, the production of the album, the musicians involved and Byrne's witty and brilliant lyrics more than make up for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"I love Enya's music.

I've played the 360 version and it was fun. however, the only thing the ps2 version has in common with the 360 version is the name. nothing else. The missions are different, the graphics have been toned down massively, the AI is choppy, and one of the worst things about this game is that the cover system is terrible! when I take cover behind a wall and try to peak around, it doesn't even let me look past the wall. It's hard to explain, but once you take cover and try to peak around corners, you'll understand what I mean. You can't change from 1st to 3rd person. There are a limited number of orders you can give your teammates. There are much more bad qualities this game has that I won't mention you'll have to see for yourself. bottom line, if you own a 360 buy that version. if you don't, ignore this game and stick to the previous ghost recon games"},{"rating":"1","title":"I took a big risk renting this game","review":"All i wanted to know was if it was as bad as the one for x-box. Well i was very wrong in fact the ps2 versian is ten times worse than the x-box versian. Which makes it in comparison to the 360 versian....ugh don't go there. I really don't want to go into detail let's just say the graphics caused me a mild cause of nausea. And as for the gameplay well let's just say playing with a turd you just let loose in the toilet is more fun than this game, staring into sun is more beneficial to you than playing this game. I could go on but then i would have to keep reliving the short hour I played this turd. And what is the worst part, you guessed it the price. For the mere price of 50$ you can enjoy a game so half assed that you'll have trouble believing Ubisoft made it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No split-screen co-op mode, sluggish single player... semi-auto?","review":"My daughter and I were really jazzed about this and then there was no split-screen co-op mode. The original, Jungle Storm and Rainbow Six 3 all have a two player, local-only mode so we were expecting one. No joy.We say, \\"Ok, so single-player and take turns! No problem.\\". Maybe we have been playing super-sneaky Rainbow Six too much, but not being able to crouch, corner peek is rotten. In fact all the input feel sluggish, slow, lagging and loose. Not a fun game.This last gripe is probably my fault and I haven't investigated it any. The rifle is semi-auto. This should be a military issue assault rifle w/ full auto and maybe optionally burst. Even if there is a select fire toggle, why default to semi-auto? I think i saw it flash on screen, but could not make it happen.Maybe the game will grow on me like Rainbow Six, but I am doubtful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter PS2","review":"When you think of Ghost Recon or even Tom Clancy video games you think of \\"STEALTH\\" missions, well this game doesn't have much stealth at all. With the \\"ABILITY TO SWITCH\\" between stealth and just full on \\"ATTACK\\" it isn't really stealth at all, your partner in most missions just stands around waiting for your orders, but if you choose \\"ATTACK\\" mode than your partner just does most the work and that isn't fun unless you are a \\"lazy bum\\" and like doing just about nothing. Plus this game doesn't even have \\"TWO PLAYER\\" game play although it has online play it still is a bunch of \\"BULL\\"!!!!!!!!! Overall I rate the fun of this game a 3 and the game overall a 4.5.

What Bach-lover wouldn't want another worthy Passion to add to his collection, even the reconstruction of a long-lost score? Well, maybe one day, but this recording is certainly not it!This St. Mark reconstruction doesn't really even sound like Bach to me, even in the recitatives whose authenticity Mr. Koopman claims were the result of years of playing the real thing. And very unfortunately, the bulk of the recording consists of recitatives, though I've not timed them; perhaps it just seems that way. The arias and choruses, though based on other Bach works, do not inspire me. Granted, the gauge by which I judge poor Mr. Koopman is perhaps the greatest composer who has yet lived. Still, it was Vater Bach who provided the basis and framework for Mr. Koopman's success or failure; with such a leg up, I expected more!... and so I vote with a mere two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good song but...","review":"Great song and there is enough supporting english so you can slightly understand it if you don't speak Japanese... it's a fast song though... fast meaning that it's high tempoed and fast meaning that it's only 2 minutes 46 seconds long.

However, if you are looking for good Halloween decorating and party ideas that are a lot more elegant and adult-oriented, then I strongly recommend the Kasey Rogers (Louise Tate, from Bewitched) book: \\"Halloween Crafts: Eerily Elegant Decor.\\" It is well worth the money, or else try Martha Stewart's Halloween book. It is basically a compilation of several years' worth of her Halloween recipes, decorating, and costume ideas from the October issues of her magazine: \\"Martha Stewart Living.\\" Both of these books have decorating and party ideas that are a lot more oriented for those of us adults who still enjoy having fun on Halloween, while not being \\"cutesy\\" nor overly gorey, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still waiting for the fun","review":"If the book wasn't *way* too cute for my taste, I'd still dislike it.

Problem is, one of the great strengths of the I Ching is that is stays on the mythic realm of archetype and imagistic poetry from which one interprets one's answer. Once you try to ground that into the specifics of the mundane, you get into trouble. I tried using their technique and wound up getting very frightening predictions of impending, fatal events that (now years later) I can say with confidence didn't happen. The beauty of the I Ching is that it offers us a poetic archetype of where we are, that we then interpret. The more you remove the poetry, and the interpretation, the more you remove the spirit of the original.

It makes piecing quilts so easy. I can adjust the needle to correct my 1/4\\" seams, so I seldom use the seam ripper anymore. That is always a plus.It also sews through very thick layers with ease. Hemming jeans is a breeze with this machine. It didn't even strain a bit over the denim hump. That's what really convinced me that I had gotten a great machine.The person that gave this machine a bad review over 1 or 2 decorative stitches not looking the way they wanted them to look really didn't give it a fair deal.

I tried it out and it was a huge disapointment. The fonts could not be made smaller or larger and the scripted font didn't connect together - the letters had funky thread stitches between each letter - now for block letters I understand - they are not connected so it would have to have some way to keeps stitching but for the script it would be the right thing to have the letters just begin and end with the loopy lines that connect script letters in a word - but it didn't it was HORRIBLE looking. I am returning the machine ASAP because I can't use.It's probably really good for the novice who isn't really interested in sellin quality items. but I wouldn't recomend it to anyone who plans to use the decorative stitches or anything for a professial product. Not good quality for that.Good luck with your search."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Stewart Sings Songs Of A Plowman's Son","review":"There are really two issues here: first, there's the earthy and resonant voice of Andy Stewart, complete with a grand Scottish burr and perfectly accompanied by a varied group of well-chosen instruments from flutes to electronic synthesizer with melodies both old and refreshing; then there's the deep thought and strong whimsy of the rightly esteemed poet-laureate of Scotland. Andy's voice gives rightful airing to some of the finest of Burn's songs. To hear the two together leaves no doubt that the singer is at his peak, and that \\"Rabbie Burrns wa'farr mare th' a lad wh' wrrote tha' New Year's song.\\" I dare you to listen to \\"Is There For Honest Poverty\\" without getting a patriotic lump in your throat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply put...An Excellent Album","review":"Wow is all that needs to be said.

I bought their first cd (self-titled) and honestly wasn't too impressed with it. But the music was good. Then Holy Dogs came out, and since I have a friend who is friends with the band, I was able to get a copy of this before it came out. It starts strong, finishes nicely, and is really good all the way through.Stand out tracks are \\"New Beginning\\" \\"Velvet Elvis\\" \\"Only a Dream\\" and \\"Climbing the Walls.\\" The songs are not \\"deep\\" but they tell a great story from adultery to going on an intergalactic journey on \\"Superstation.\\" It's modern rock n roll with a nice edge. It's not \\"hard\\" rock. It's how rock n roll was meant to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another gem","review":"This is one of those albums I can just listen to, without doing anything else like reading a book or typing on my computer. I can just lay there and listen. For me, that's rare, and the mark of a good CD. This was yet another find at my local store-with-a-listening-station, and it hooked me fast. I find myself humming \\"Climbing The Walls\\" while working, that's how infectuous this is. Try it, and if you don't like it, I'll buy a New Kids CD. ;^)"},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll be begging for another ride!","review":"From the opening jam of Superstation, this cd snagged me. Honestly, it didn't even need that. Years ago, I recieved a cd in the mail from Coke when they launched their Surge soda.The cd was better than the soda by far. One of the tracks it included was from Stir. I picked up their cd, and subsequently, got Holy Dogs when it came out. One track, New Beginning, got some actual airplay here in Oregon. I don't know about the rest of the country. This is one of those bands that i just don't understand how they did not catch on.The cd holds on solidly from start to end.

This album is one of the best I own. I had a friend recommend the cd after he had read a review, bought the cd, and liked it. I went out and bought it for 8 bucks, and it just might be the best 8 bucks I ever spent. Just listen straight through, and enjoy great catchy guitar driven alternative rock that doesn't make you depressed like so much of today's modern rock. I just hope that this band hits it big so many more can enjoy their sound. Stir Rules!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to snuff","review":"This album is produced in a slick manner with hooks and it's obvious that the band has talent, it's just not shown in the songs. I believe that the band probably dumbed down the content to fit what they believe is more accessible stuff. It doesn't work. They are able to collaborate with the producer and create an interesting atmosphere on 'Spaceman' but other than that it's not that memorable because the songs aren't that deep, or resounding. 'Superstation' is the only song that could possibly make it onto the radio, but that's unlikely. \\"Holy Dogs\\" really disappointed me because I knew that this band had built up a grass roots following in their hometown on a cheap recording and this was their followup, unfortunately, it doesn't excell. Stir might have more honest and provoking music in their future, but based on this failure I don't know if they'll get a second chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish they would quit playing there single.","review":"This music is produced so well that you might not notice the lack of music creativity and awful lyrics that are behind it.

I have an apprehension toward any band they are peddling as a next big thing. Make no mistake, this is another bland American band somewhere in the realm of Matchbox 20, Dave Matthews, Counting Crows and Tonic. I am no fan of hair metal, but I think if forced into a choice between listening to Warrant and this, I'd probably choose the latter. What happened to modern rock? Just because no one heard of this band yet doesn't make them good. But given most people's taste, it will probably sell about 10 million copies. Listen to real modern rock like Gay Dad, Belle and Sebastian, Promise Ring, VNV Nation or Suede. Terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Bleeding Gums Murphy!!!","review":"So, I'm not a huge fan of The Simpsons but I do like jazz and toy figures.

The reading was challenging (be prepared for a vocabulary lesson), but beautifully lyrical and I stuck with it. It captivated me. Carlyle's words bypass that little word processor in the brain and go directly to a deeper consciousness. The book is history come-to-life rather than literature or art - the most powerful account of human activity I've ever read. I felt a citizen of 18th century Paris and was greatly affected. The journey was wonderful and terrible. I wish I had read it prior to 2 previous vacations to Paris; it would have changed everything. I would have engaged every willing Frenchman in a conversation of this period - I wonder if they're over it yet......More unsettling is how this book changes one's perspective on 21st century America. By all means, read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT READ THIS THIS IF YOU ARE UNFAMILAR WITH THE SUBJECT","review":"This book is written assuming that you already know what went on, and fails to explain the details.

It loses focus in the complexity of the revolution and gets bogged down in way to much detail. Even if you know a lot about the revolution the analysis is too much and distracts from whatever his overall point is which was lost by about page 20. I had a hard time getting through it and if I had not needed to read it for class I would have stopped after the first 50 pages.

Don't read too much into those who praise this book as this is nothing more than proof of their erudition; a validation of such a high IQ.

As reading this book realize the great store of words and meanings that suited his direction rather than the true nature of the French Revolution of the peoples. What an awful book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique Insight","review":"\\"The French Revolution: A History\\" is an important book to learn about the French Revolution. Thomas Carlyle describes the interesting characters, turbulent events and the chaotic period of the Revolution.The book was first published in 1837, thus benefitting from first hand account of events in the Revolution. This has its pros and cons to the value of the book since such first hand influence could dilute the objectivity of the author. However, Thomas Carlyle managed to produce a vivid and thoughtful account of events and leading characters involved in the Revolution.The author uses a unique prose style which some readers may find interesting and poetic whilst others may find hard to comprehend. However, if looked at from its historical context, the writing style should make sense, particularly to those already familiar with the subject.This is an informative and insightful book that is well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"JAMES JOYCE STYLE WORD SALAD.","review":"I know where James Joyce stole his schizophrenic word-salad style of writing.

It reads like a descriptive list of events with precious little interpretation or commentary. There are pages upon pages that read like \\"... and the next day, some troops moved three feet to the left.....\\" and so on. It also doesn't distinguish between key influential events of the battle and those that were ultimately inconsequential. Also, for a book whose primary focus is miltary logistics, it is woefully lacking in good quality maps.It does a sobering portrayal of the brutality of invading Soviets towards the German popluace, and I think it is this that will remain the book's enduring contribution. But I think given the richness of history that this book has to work with as its core material, the prose could've been so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"The piece hanging off of the necklace had already fallen off when I received, clasp broke and I never even got to wear it.

Yes it's occasionally funny and occasionally well written but most of the time it consists of little more than the birder equivalent of name dropping. I came away with a strong feeling that birding is a clique of people who feel that they are the only people who know what real birding is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Birding at its worst","review":"I'm an avid birder, but this book was very disappointing. Filled with, at most, mildly amusing anecdotes about obsessive people \\"twitching\\" (as the Brits call it) to add to their country lists, I had trouble finishing it. This is birding at its most fatuous. The author concedes that chasing rare birds has no intrinsic value, bringing into question whether reading about the chasers has any value, either.Kenn Kaufman's \\"Kingbird Highway\\" and George Levine's \\"Lifebirds\\" are much better books that capture the joy of birding and transcend the pointlessness of mere listing."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very exciting","review":"I laughed out loud twice - far too little for a book!

I don't think it was any British-ness about the characters that turned me off, unless we are to believe that a strong streak of pomposity and self-involvement are central to the British birder's character. The \\"those were the days\\" tone was not wistful, poignant, or nostalgic, but strangely superior and even curmudgeonly at times. To me, the book lacked the kind of approaches that make for good reading on the subject - objectivity, humor and/or vividly personal revelations. I just couldn't maintain any enthusiasm to continue reading about this particular tribe of more-significant-than-thou birders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"I loved this book and look forward to rereading it.

There are crescendos where there shouldn't be crescendos and violent and sharply biting outbursts in passages where Debussy is asking of the pianist the most gentle and delicate touch possible. I'm not saying Gieseking isn't a phenomenal pianist from a technical standpoint, but he displays so little regard for the composer's intentions. By all means, buy this record if you want to hear Gieseking, but not if you want to hear Debussy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll say it all in just one word...","review":"GREAT!!!!The only bad thing is it's only 6 eps...

And that's always been either watch it online with terrible quality, borrow the bootleg DVDs my friend had, or catch it on [adult swim] with commercials. Funimation finally has done something right (well, with Amazon's help... that 40$ MSRP is ridiculous) in releasing this incredible OVA series on ONE disc (that's right, Synch-Point. ONE disc. 6 episodes don't need more than one.) Everything about this series is amazing, from the hilarious art, to the great voice acting on both sides, to the even better soundtrack by the pillows.

Furi Kiri was one of those kind of shows i only had briefly caught on cartoon network late at night. But from there i had to really look for it. I Kinda which there was more. I guess if you like any sort of anime, this is definitely for you. There are some mature themes in this series so if your into the cutesy anime you probably should shy away from this.

He did a marvellous production job, altough sometimes a little bit too polished and mainstream oriented, but the eight original tunes are very good.

I thought this band pretty much had gone away after the stretch of classic albums from way back when. I was so blown away by this album that I find myself thinking that it stands up to Phenomenon, Lights Out, Force It, and Obsession. The songs rock hjard, are catchy, ( I can't stop singing Stopped By A Bullet) and convey a real raw energy. The album contains remakes of the tremendous Doctor Doctor, and Lights Out. Both are done so well that they can only please hardcore fans.

At least, that's how it sounds to me, a die-hard fan who used to think UFO really could walk on water. Where's the fire? Long extinguished, I suppose. And was there supposed to be a bass player on this album?? If so, he's nowhere to be heard on the mix. I've heard basement tapes that sound as good...And is that Michael Schenker or Joe Satriani playing lead guitar? What happened to Michael's fiercely original and articulate solos? If I wanted to hear Satriani/Steve Vai-style wankage (which I don't), I'd buy THEIR albums.Like a fool, I read everyone else's comments online, and bought the CD actually thinking that the boys had put out something worthy of their former glory. Boy, was I disappointed!! The remakes of 'Doctor, Doctor' and 'Lights Out' drove a stake through my heart. I almost cried. Oh well, at least I still have my copy of 'Strangers In The Night' to remind me of what UFO sounded like at their peak..."},{"rating":"2","title":"only two poor reviews says it all.","review":"There are only two negative reviews for this one! that says it all , you can't please everyone but clearly this one pleased most of us ufo fans out here ALOT. And that's true with this one, the tour that year was fantastic too with the original band laying down two shows in Denver that I saw. (months apart!) They were incredible and this cd does it right with top notch melodic metal that is well written , sung, and played. The songs fit them too. Pushed to the limit\\" says it so well for anyone who is getting older and they can are fighting against it. And songs like \\"venus' should be top ten hits. This band really did 'walk of water' with this one it returned them to greatness all the way. There are several versions of this one bonus tracks wise but that's no big deal , whatever one you get you will love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to have them back!","review":"After many years, this classic band has finally returned with the lineup that made them legends. If you were a fan in the 70's and 80's, you will love this CD. Michael Schenker stands alone in a sea of imitators with his distinctive guitar style. Older and showing it in the photos, UFO nevertheless packs the punch missing from so much of the music today. \\"Knock Knock\\" is an instant classic. But along with the punch is the melodic aspect that endeared them to many. In fact, about the only thing that has changed is the waistband measurements of the band, and most of us could be guilty of that over the years. Schenker fans should consider adding this to their collections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reunion album!","review":"I ordered this CD directly from Schenker in Scotsdale AZ which was kind of cool...this was when it FIRST came out and didn't have the bonus track. No I find that I will have to buy another version to get Lights Out. )c: UFO is one of my favorite bands, and this reunion album definately captures the magic the band had when they were all together before. These guys can still rock, I only wish they could stay together and release some more stuff. Schenker was mediocre on his own, and UFO was mediocre without Schenker. If you are a fan of the old UFO, this album rocks just as hard as Obssession!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the boys are back and better than ever!!!!!!","review":"when this album came out i was scared to death to play it. i've been a ufo fan forever and did'nt want this to be bad. i was very very happy when i finally got the courage to play it. it is the best rock&roll album of the 90's. if you're young or just don't know about ufo buy this, turn it up and have a blast. p.s. michael schenker never played with the scorpions ( that was his brother )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Walk on Water is GREAT!","review":"This disc is right up there with \\"Obsession\\" and \\"Lights Out\\". Was truly shocked the first time I put it in my player, it rocked! An excellent blend of hard rock with melody; this is what UFO did successfully in the 70's and this disc sounds as if it was done right after \\"Strangers in the Night\\", without sounding dated. Phil Mogg's vocals and Schenker's playing are such a perfect match, too bad that mix isn't heard more often.Had this disc been promoted properly, there could have been at least 3 singles released- \\"Venus\\", \\"A Self Made Man\\" and \\"Darker Days\\". There are really no filler tracks which once again takes me back to the 1975-79 \\"classic era\\" of UFO!BUY THIS DISC!!! and while you are shopping get Phil Mogg's side project $ighn of Four- different than UFO, but still has that cool Mogg sound and is more blues-based (guitarist Jeff Kollman is really good)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great \\"comeback\\"","review":"This is Ufo's \\"comeback album\\" -95 (their best/famous members, M.Schenker etc.).Good purchase.(this release contains 3 bonus track)Tracks are very good, bears comparison with their best works.Booklet is as poor as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a good cd after a few years","review":"I have had this cd for a few years now and it is still a very good cd. It starts with really hard rocker self made man then goes on to two more pretty good songs and then we come stop by a bullet of love..always refreshing to hear and the next two songs darker days and running on empty make of the heart of the cd..the last two songs are better than venus and pushed to the limit...knock, konck and the other song. Doctor, Doctor is really improved here, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"About Time","review":"I've been a long long time fan of UFO and Schenker.

I am into Motocross Madness 2 alot for pc's. I decided to give this new title a try on PS2 because it seemed to get good reviews. I was very disapointed with this game. So unhappy, that I wanted to return the game within 5 minutes of playing it. The handling is very unrealistic. The tracks and decent in my opinion but the bike is hard to control. I really hated to give this game a bad review, but it is nothing I expected. If you really want a high quality game for PS2, buy ATV Offroad Fury. The creator of Motocross Madness 2 made this game and the handling of the bike is 100% better. I am hoping other titles for PS2 such as MX Rider and MX 2002 Featuring Ricky Carmichael will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"This game is bad. it is boring, you just drive in a straight line most of the time, and the courses had bad graphics. at least it has a cool soundtrack, though. plus, the tricks are nearly impossible, and the trick courses are poorly made. i bought this at a used game store and returned it the next day. it is dissapointing, get atv offroad fury instead"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is McGrath trying to steal the crown?","review":"I am a fan of both Carmicheal and McGrath.

I dont care if MX 2002 is unrealistic its fun and that is all that matters. We will see who will win."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supercross fans","review":"In my opinion this should be one of the best Dirt bike racing games to come out. Having played previous Supercross games on the PS1 and given the technology of the PS2 I'm really looking forward to seeing this game in action. Previous games have been getting better and better for the game including small features such as winning the hole shot, grooves in the track, and actual supercross tracks. Also another great feature is being able to set up your bike for track conditions and terrain. So look forward to this being the best supercross game yet!! I'm sure all other games will derive themselves off of this one now. Look for all the features and more I'm sure!! 5 star is my opinion on what this game will bring in."},{"rating":"1","title":"KING","review":"JEREMY WILL BE THE KING AGAIN ONCE HE REGROUPS AND FOCUSES ON RIDING.EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT RICKY BECAUSE HE ONE A FEW RACES.JUST WATCH THIS YEAR WHEN THE KING SPANKS HIM AND GETS.

I could watch every episode dozens of times without growing bored. Thank God that they had a second season in which to tell some of the best stories centered around King Hiss, Hordak and the ancestral history of King Grayskull.

And, since BCI went out of business (no doubt due at least in part to their inability to actually include complete episodes on their dvd releases) I am stuck with a defective product. Don't buy this set or volumes one or two. Wait for the upcoming complete series release on 9/29/09 and get all the episodes at once.

The story does not have much to it, and the only truly good actor...the only actor...was Bela Lugosi. I got the movie thinking it had to be great if Lugosi was in it, but even a great actor can't compensate for a poor story ...which drags at times. The movie was so slow, I literally fell asleep watching it 3 times. I had to start it again and again.And not sure why they colorized this movie either. The \\"monster\\" is just an octopus in a aquarium. When they colorized it they used a bright blue background. The monster is supposed to be attacking some men at night!

This entry centres around mad scientist Lugosi's attempt to create a master race of atomic superbeings to carry out his goal of (What else?) world domination.Amusing,but not as good/bad as PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE. The movie is still worth a look if only for the \\"seriousness\\" with which Wood made it. BRIDE OF THE MONSTER's most \\"elaborate\\" set piece is a giant rubber octopus which makes the squid in 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA look like footage from a Jacques Costeau documentary. A fun time-killer for lovers of bad movies, especially at its compact 69 minute running time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"BRIDE OF THE MONSTER is perhaps Ed Wood's best film, it's outragously fun, fast-moving and very, very funny (even funnier than Wood's infamous PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE).

Drunk this is by far the best movie you will ever see. I know he's acheived a cult status at this point, but Ed Wood was an intense man with an extreme passion for this medium, and this film should be watched by everyone.

Mr. Sullivan present different viewpoints on the subject of homosexuality (Prohibitionist, Liberationist, Conservative and Liberal) To present any argument you must understand the position of your opponent and I welcome the chance here ( in this book) to do that.Not everyone in the gay studies filed has embraced the book and some have spoken very publicly against it, which is funny to me since everyone wants freedom of speech and equal rights, but how quickly we are to condemn those whose viewpoints do not reflect our own. In closing Mr. Sullivan makes some valid arguments for the legalization of same-sex marriage, which he claims would not undermine heterosexual marriage, but may actually strengthen it. Finally someone who commands that we think about ouselves and our culture, who does not give the reader a sugary sweet view of what the world could, should be like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Although I approached this book with an open mind, I was extremely disappointed with it. Sullivan seems to be saying that only a monogamous homosexual, or one who has achieve virtuous ex-gay status can achieve the correct morality as assigned by the his own Roman Catholocism. Yet his own experience with HIV, unsafe sex, and promiscuity seems to contradict this. At a time when so many Roman Catholic Priests are being prosecuted as pedophiles and many teens are stepping forward with tales of abuse, is it logical for Sullivan to be touting his own 'ethics'? What I found most disturbing was his insistence that morality is only a theory or abstract idea and one's own conduct (ie his own websites) must be ignored and excused as 'private' sins which may result in one's death, but are nevertheless innocent 'mistakes'.

Also, the somewhat fuzzy, thick font style wasn't pleasant either. Basically, each chapter---as far as I got---consists of naming a philosopher, a paragraph or so explanation of what he thought about that area of philosophy, followed by the same type of exposition for each successive philosopher, one after another, until the end of that chapter. It wasn't very interesting or enjoyable, and I enjoy reading this type of stuff. Much of the explanation (perhaps in part due to the subject matter) was vague, unmemorable, dry, and uninteresting. I felt that, if I were to finish the entire book, a month later I would be unable to answer almost any questioin one might ask about what I read. Maybe it's just me, but I was disappointed with this particular purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"grandma's supplemental education for grandkids","review":"an important comparison for young readers to begin to really understand philosophy.

Frost is either highly misinformed on Christian matters, or a liar. He states that we have never been able to answer the problem of evil and sin, which we have. He declares that we do not know who created the devil, and we do. He does have a couple of gems in the book, but if you are a Christian, or atleast open to truths, even the ones you don't like. I believe they would be better found elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Comprehensive But Dry Reference","review":"If you are in search of a handy reference work that gives fundamental summaries of the main theories of western philosophy, this book functions adequately. Most of the major philosophers, or at least the major philosophical movements in history, are consulted for their theories on fundamental questions. These include the basic college course stuff like the nature of the universe, good vs. evil, free will, and the like. The thinkers covered stretch from Plato, Aristotle and the other Greek immortals, to the lesser ancient schools, on through the middle ages to relatively recent philosophers such as Kant and Spinoza. A useful bonus is a biographical paragraph in the appendix on every thinker whose work is used in the book. The only flaw with this book is that it was written by a professor back in 1942, and is presented in the dry, humorless, and didactically professional writing style that prevailed in that day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for survivor of suicide","review":"The book is dated and not sensible at all if you lost a child to suicide.

First I have to say, this book is not for someone who has just lost there child. In the first chapeter she explains how you have to do what is right for you, then on another page she is telling you what you should do, because people who have studied greaving say it is the right thing to do.First on my part, I did not agree with anything that was said by her. I could not even read the whole book in full, I started skipping pages. At the end when she says she is sorry that her son is dead, but she still has joys, and so should I we. Some people can go forward better than others, but most parents don't.This was my only son, I will feel this pain for the rest of my life.

It continues to be a book that offers concrete help to those of us who have endured this devastating experience.I just ordered another copy. I will hand it to a young woman who is exactly the same age I was when I first read it years ago.

The letters tell as much about human beings as they do about the wiles of the devil, and have been justly famous and loved by Christians since their first publication in 1943.

I have since I first heard Dirk Wears White Sox back in college. So I decided to try this out as my first Ant CD (I'd previously just dumped the vinyl to digital). It's a good remaster - nothing to jump up and down about, but clearer than my friend's official US copy. And the demos - as curiousity pieces, they're a lot of fun. And boy, the guy has a rotten voice without all of the processing. I thought that when I saw him live in the '80's - now it's confirmed.

Those of us who do seem only to remember \\"Goody Two Shoes.\\" He was/is more than that. In fact, all of Adams' cds have something memorable about them. I chose Friend or Foe to review because I think it's arguably his best cd. It has the hit \\"Goody Two Shoes\\" on it but it also contains non-hits such as \\"Friend or Foe\\", \\"Desperate But Not Serious\\", \\"Crack Pot History and the Right to Lie\\", \\"Cajun Twisters\\" and \\"Place in the Country.\\" 12 solid tracks all together. Prince Charming is also very good, and so is most of his early work. 1995's Wonderful is a fine example of what Adam Ant can do. But, start with Friend or Foe. It's relentlessly frenetic. Definitely upbeat, with an emphasis on BEAT. The music on this disc isn't like anything you'll hear on the radio these days. A must have for any rock collector."},{"rating":"2","title":"He can never disappoint me!!!","review":"It is my opinion that this is his best album.

The characters look like they were pulled directly off the football field from Blitz- big, bulky and cartoonish. The controls are awkward, utilizing the right analog stick to strife renders it difficult to view along side or behind you or turn to attack a pursuing enemy. The combination moves aren't nearly as impressive (I really wouldn't even classify them as a \\"combo\\" move at all...) as in DMC, and the weapons had much more promise than what was actually used.

The seller shipped the package quickly, except that the cap on one of the bottles was loose, so the hot sauce leaked a little bit; otherwise, I would have given them 5 stars.

It was hot and dark in that little room, packed full of a hushed crowd. All those people were in on a secret: Dick Gaughan. I've never forgotten the spare beauty of that night. Worker's songs, like colliary bands, are an acquired taste for Americans. I can't think of a better introduction not only to traditional agit-prop music, but to the astonishing beauty of the celtic music sensibility than Dick Gaughan, and this album in particular. He can do things with a guitar that stretch the instrument immensely. In his hands, it's a fiddle, sometimes a pipe, but always sparklingly clear. His voice is stern and honest. This is beautiful work, his Now Westlin Winds and Workers Song in particular. A good introduction to the often difficult celtic ear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Musicianship","review":"A sparse and endearing album, full of both understated love songs and fiery anthems, this is a must buy for anyone who loves true Celtic music (no new age dream songs, thank goodness). If you buy it for nothing else, buy it for the song \\"Now Westlin Winds\\" which features Gaughan's fantastic guitar playing and deep, crackly voice.

Tuscany at its most enchanting moment, a wonder and a joy for my eye. But Mary scarcely opened her eyes to all this beauty. Yet she will write about it, and be evocative and give readers the longing to come and experience for themselves, as I never, never could. Such is the power of the gift for words, and the technique for using them. The accomplished writer need not feel, not muse, nor think as much as I do, but he will make his readers do so, as I cannot. I am led to wonder whether successful writing and dreaming and thinking ever go todether.

(\\"Sunset and Twilight\\", p. 365.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"SHAMELESSLY UGLY!!","review":"Forget about this edition of the book--which I would love to find another original 1963 edition of to replace the one I gave away. The cheeseballs at Harvest who choose to reprint this title by shooting pocket edition-sized pages of toothy paper and then enlarging it to trade paperback size should be horsewhipped. Fat broken type throughout. Nearly unreadable. Coyote, buck ugly printing. I understand the margins in publishing, but a good selling backlist title like this should elicit some respect from the publisher, even if they have none for their readers. Somebody should be canned for this want of taste and judgement. We're talking about Florence here. The point of the book is aesthetics. Get the book from the library and wait for a new edition from another publisher. Are all Harvest books this poor? Venice Observed is also a travesty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stones of Florence","review":"I just finished this book prior to a trip to Florence. This is a book of commentary and Mary McCarthy's observations and knowledge about Florence. I found it very useful, and in parts very fascinating. I'd recommend it before taking a trip to Florence.The beginning is a bit slow. But when it picks up, afer the first chapter or so, it goes much faster. I would have gotten more out of it, and it would have gone faster, if I had already read one of my other books about Florence, say \\"Florence: Biography of a City\\" or \\"Florence A Portrait.\\" This is because, especially at the beginning, she comments on artists and places I'm not familiar with.Her commentary about art and artists is really must read information. Especially about Uccello and, later, the Mannerists. There's some great history here, too. I'd STRONGLY recommend reading this book before a trip to Florence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Useful Resource","review":"I bought this thesaurus for my kids but everyone is using it. It is a very good reference for those who want to expand on their use of the English language."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will find some entries and definitions exclusively in this book","review":"Its coverage contains a wide range of words and terms. You will find some entries and definitions exclusively in this book. Thumb index is also included. Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Regretable Purchase!","review":"Not what I expected from a so called thesaurus, and I use that term loosely. It is more a dictionary. It gives you one lengthy definition after the other of the same word, instead of the lengthy list of useful synonyms that should be standard in a \\"true\\" thesaurus. This format is a major time waster if you are trying to find just the \\"right word\\", or the correct \\"flavor\\" of the word.Since our entire society has been dummied down for the last 50 years, this is just another tool used in the process to turn us into coddled semi-literates.Makes a nice paper weight though!!Check out Webster's New World Roget's A-Z Thesaurus for a workable \\"true\\" thesaurus format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the synonyms?","review":"What I look for in a good thesaurus is quick-to-find, accurate, fairly substantial lists of synonyms. Except in a few cases, this disappointing book doesn't offer such lists. I'm not sure how anyone could get much use out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unlikely But True","review":"What a great story!!! What a witty writer !!! Could have only happened in the fifties,sixties, and seventies from an American perspective. Must read to understand the old world order in a shrinking world."},{"rating":"2","title":"The test of time","review":"This recording has been measured praised and condemned (well, no one would be foolish enough for that) over time, but is the best reflection of the power and majesty of Mahler's most coherent symphony. The complaints about the sound not measuring up to the modern digital recordings reflects a need for thunder over substance and a bad stereo system. Walter Legge produced recordings that surpass the restrictions of his time and place and the sound on this is magnificent.And the conclusion, where Scwarzkopf's voice floats over the chorus in the Aufstehen is unequaled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"I have four recordings of this symphony: this one, Bernstein (NY Phil); Solti (LSO); and Slatkin (St. Louis). This performance conducted by Klemperer is by far the worst. Tempi and dynamics regularly ignore Mahler's instructions, ensemble is sloppy, ugly instrumental tone quality abounds, and intonation is horrendous, especially in the all-important final measures, with everyone apparently playing as loudly as they can without regard to balance or tone quality. The Slatkin recording with the St. Louis Symphony (who would have guessed!) is the best: superb in all of these categories. I also highly recommend the Bernstein, not for its accuracy, but for the special excitement he brings to the score. However, be aware that it is more Bernstein than Mahler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this recording","review":"The first movement is really spectacular, the middle movements are good, but unfortuanately, the final movement is incoherent and uninvolving. What should be the gem of the performance comes off as a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"m2klem","review":"Proclaiming a recording a \\"classic\\" or \\"great\\" springs from a mixed collection of who likes what and how the performance was originally received.This one is both to my tastes. I, and listeners way before my time, like the Angel sound, the Philharmonia, and the feeling that shows up when Klemperer conducts this tune....it is hard for me to find an m2 i don't like something about! I even have the old Klemperer/Vienna Sym/Vox from 1950. That is interesting, too.If one likes m2, this Angel recording will be enjoyable.dj"},{"rating":"2","title":"A clear first choice","review":"Mahler's second symphony has its greatest exponent in Otto Klemperer. He performed it frequently, and this celebrated incarnation of Klemperer's interpretation is an unsurpassed achievement. Klemperer's grasp of the details is impressive, as well as his overall view of the work as an organic whole. The Philharmonia plays beautifully - the orchestra was in its best shape when this recording was made early in the sixties. Choir and soloists are also impressive.Moreover, the recording quality is good enough for most ears, at least if your hifi equipment is of decent quality.This is the recording of the second symphony that I appreciate most, a frontrunner before Scherchen's with the Vienna Symphony and Walter's with New York Philharmonic. It has its place in every collector's shelf. A real desert island disc, warmly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldie but Goodie","review":"This is a majestic and stately recording. But I find it pretty exciting too. Did NOT find the tempos \\"too slow\\" as some contend. I own several versions of this symphony. But is is my favorite. Technical quality is pretty good and no faults stand out. This recording is a bargain. I have Solti, Bairenboims, Stokowski and some others. But his is my favorite. If I were new to this piece, I would start here to see if I want to go further. The old stereo is pretty good and a really good sound system makes this recording a joy. Many \\"newer\\" recordings lose the forest for the trees. This is a real gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this","review":"The paint does not stick at all. Waste of money and time and very disappointing for a 5 and 7 year old and their mom who should have donated this money to WWF. We did however use the opportunity as a consumer reporting teaching lesson writing this review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for take-along quiet play!","review":"I got this for my daughter to use in the car - always a fight because she gets bored - and it is a hit! Both girls (4 and 6) have had a lot of fun with it both in the car and at church (clean, quiet, easy to carry in). The magnets are bendable so you have to be a little careful, and I would suggest a carry bag or something, the magnets aren't strong enough to stay put if you hold it upside down, so if they are carrying it somewhere the pieces can fall out. I don't know for how long this will be a fun toy - maybe it will lose its newness - but since I plan on keeping it in the car I figure it will always be a little different than what they have in the house and keep their attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Toy","review":"This is a fun and inexpensive toy that can amuse someone in the preschool set for about half an hour. Our four-year-old niece enjoys her plastic Mr. Potato Head but seems to have more interest in this board Potato Head because with more pieces it has more possibilities for combinations.Storing the pieces and not losing them can be a challenge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"It arrived today. I opened the package all brand new still wrapped. Excellent for collectors...Pros- brand new, Price ( way better then amoeba)Cons- none"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok movie supported by an awesome filming location","review":"This is one of those movies I saw once, briefly, on HBO way back in the day. But its strange ambience and incredible location (I'm guessing it's a European estate of some historical royal family) made it memorable. The acting and plot are competent, and set against the grandeur of an old world estate, it all works. We can all hope that a copy will make it on to video on demand at some point!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredaibly Personal","review":"When i bought this album, i really thought that it would be merely a historical document. I didn't expect the moving, passionate music and lyrics that lay within. This is definately some of the best work done by either Reed or Cale.It made me miss warhol so deeply, even though he died before i was even born."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Lou's finest recordings.","review":"Great album. Supreme. This is an album that I keep coming back to listen to over the years - the mark of a great recording. Brilliant job - magical. Enjoy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"So so","review":"There a few nice pieces on here, \\"Open House,\\" Nobody But You,\\" \\"Hello It's Me,\\" But so much else on it sounds like some marginally talented teenagers jamming in one of their bedrooms. I know Reed and Cale are talented, but they decided to only have the two of them play on this record because they were both Warhol disciples, and didn't want any \\"outsiders\\" involved. But they needed more musicians, or should have overdubbed more instruments themselves. A whole album of fairly heavy stuff, but not one drum sound on the whole album, is a bit weak. Having NO DRUMS was a bad idea! It's a shame, because I'm a big Lou Reed fan, and a big Andy Warhol fan, and this should have been great, but it's just not."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece that takes some time to digest","review":"Though usually viewed as the second installment in Lou Reed's three-album cycle of loss and despair (_New York_, _Songs for Drella_, _Magic and Loss_), Cale's contributions lend this record the Warhol-like ethereal-ness that it badly needs. It took me a year or so to really get into this album, but now I think it simultaneouly chills and uplifts me more than _Magic and Loss_ (probably because the subject was such a prominent public figure). Especially recommended: \\"Open House\\", \\"Style it Takes\\", \\"A Dream\\", \\"Forever Changed\\", \\"Hello, It's Me\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and funky, smart and stunning.","review":"As the soundtrack to a snowy love affair, it was indeed beyond compare.These songs are both delicious and heartbreaking. Reed and Cale are at their best here in praise of Andy. I think he would have been impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Songs For Drella","review":"I have heard most if not all of the songs through online radio, so no surprises there. The condition of the cd and packaging was perfectly okay. [DR]acula + Cinder[ELLA] though considered a work of fiction in the liner notes seems to sum up Andy Warhol's life, including the time he got shot by that woman. Money well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Songs for Drella is as good as Berlin but lighter","review":"Songs for Drella is a wonderful tribute to Andy Warhol, who started Reed in the Velvets. This is a wonderful heartfelt melodic CD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"My opinion about Daniel O'Donnell is a mixed one. I love many of his songs, yet many other songs also sung by him bore me to death. He may sound sweet and gentle and soothing, but he may also sound bland and untalented, which is really strange. Now on DVDs he looks fine when he was filmed outdoors, but on stage he is absolutely horrible. The way he moves and his gestures are so effeminate and irritating I couldn't bear looking. Why couldn't the guy just walk instead of jumping in small steps like a little girl? What on earth did he dip his knees in the middle of a song for? No wonder there were few men in the audience, and none of them smiled. They must have been bullied by their wives into coming to the show. Now I know Daniel is better heard than seen. I will continue listen to his music, but seeing him on stage is a big no for me. Sorry, Daniel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to your CD collection","review":"This collection features several new songs that Daniel had never recorded. He does a wonderful rendition of \\"Try a Little Kindness\\" and other country standards. Mary Duff also contributes to this awesome collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDER DANIEL","review":"Daniel O'Donnell is a really good singer, the best Irish Singer I know. This DVD is just great, when you listen to Daniel sing you just want to hear more and more. Also, when he sings duets with Mary Duff it's magic. They blend so well together."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst racing game ever","review":"By far the worst racing game ever terrible graphics terrible damage effects and even with the cheats it seems lame and I will not recommend this to anyone BEWARE!!!!!!!!! don't buy this game"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it alot","review":"I bought this game mainly because I ride a dualsport motorcycle featured in the game and because I am a big fan of the race.I really enjoyed this game,it has cool grafics and great control,but the music sucks,if you can over look that,its pretty nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I bought this game because it was an off- road racing game, and ...its a waste of money. I would recommend test drive off road instead of this game, I have both. After playing this game once I probably won't ever play it again. The graphics and game playing are very poor, definately not playstation 2 standards. I gave it 2 stars only because I've played worse games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend your money elsewhere","review":"This game is full of glitches, and load times are roughly equivalent to waiting for paint to dry.The concept is good, but as others have said, once the extremely short campaign mode is completed (who's heard of a ten-stage Dakar?) there's not much else to do.On the glitches; it's impossible to lose in Campaign Mode, because once you get past stage 8, you're automatically put into first place with a 60 minute lead over the next closest racer.Don't buy this. Go buy a copy of V-Rally 2 for the PS1 and you'll have a much better time."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],M={key:0},H={key:1};function R(a,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(o(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(o(),b(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",H,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,N)):p("",!0)])}const W=d(C,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-45c01d4e"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/51.md","filePath":"glossary/51.md"}'),x={name:"glossary/51.md"},G=Object.assign(x,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{P as __pageData,G as default};
