I was delighted that it would be easy to find because of the changeable face plates and light-up antenna and faceplate.After charging it the recommended amount of time, and a few successful uses, it has gone on the blink. Within less then four minutes of conversation, my side of the reception begins to get static and then washes out totally. Selecting the channel scan button only makes it beep uncontrollably, and the only way to hang up is to re-cradle the phone in the base unit.I have investigated the website's very few options for troubleshooting and have not found this issue addressed. Calling support for help is out of the question as this is our only phone. We are returning it tonight.I really wish it worked, because I love everything else about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I'm not a teenager, but I bought this phone because of the different ring tone choices (I thought it would be fun). Well, I was right about the rings, that's pretty neat. Everything about this phone lives up to it's reputation EXCEPT reception. After a few seconds of having the phone \\"On\\" it's very noisy with lots of static. When I push the \\"Off\\" button to hang up, that won't work. I have to place the phone into the base to get it to hang up. It's a shame that the reception stinks on this phone because everything else about it works great.However, it's going back to the store today."},{"rating":"1","title":"INSECURE","review":"Note this is an ANALOG phone, despite being on the 2.5GHz spectrum, and its signal can be picked up by other wireless analog devices, like wireless headphone or speaker systems"},{"rating":"1","title":"Popped and crackled - Horrible reception!!!","review":"I have two toddlers begging for my attention, but I am so disappointed with this phone I want to take two seconds to warn others about this phone's poor quality. The phone looked like fun, but after charging the battery as recommended, then plugging it in, the reception was immediately staticy. I could hardly hear the other person and it was annoying to the point I wanted to throw the thing in the garbage. Changing the channels did nothing to improve it. The fun rings the phone advertises have a cheap electronic sound, too. I would not buy this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Another Pretty Face(plate)","review":"I LOVED this phone in concept. I loved being able to assign rings to individual callers. I know... how lazy have we gotten that we want an even simpler step than checking the Caller ID. Still... it seemed like a really great feature. However, the first few times I used the phone, I lost the signal every single time. I tried to be patient and search out new channels but each time, there would be TONS of static (through which I found out later, the caller could hear me shouting HELLO? HELLO?) and then eventually I would get disconnected altogether. I returned the phone and, because I still really liked it in theory, I exchanged the phone for a duplicate, thinking maybe I'd just been unlucky and gotten a \\"lemon\\". So back home, reprogram, call and pfft. Static galore. I just wouldn't trust it enough to ever recommend it to someone. I went from loving this phone to really hating this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks \\"cool,\\" but not worth it","review":"I went against the grain--knowing I shouldn't have--and bought this phone over better brands like Panasonic and Sony. Unfortunately, the novelty of the ringtones and changeable faceplates quickly faded away and I was left with a below average phone. The reception is poor and very quiet, and just holding to my ear felt abrasive, most noticeably after longer conversations.Eventually the phone completely went down the tube with the battery dying, but even if that hadn't happened, it still would get this same two-star rating. I've since replaced it with a mid-range Panasonic phone that is infinitely better than this one. Sure, maybe this phone didn't drive me to the point of homicidal rampage, but many better phones in its price range exist that you'd be better off purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This phone is awful!","review":"First, let me say that I have another v-tech phone - that works great! But this one couldn't be worse! I bought the phone for my daughter thinking it would look nice in her room. It's cute all right, but after about 6 months - during which time she used it maybe 3 or 4 times for no more than 5 minutes per call - it simply stopped working. I thought it was a bad battery and bought a new one. Guess what...the battery was not the problem, the charger in the base simply stopped charging! You can't use a cordless phone with no battery...and since a charge only lasts 5 days...that's the length of time this phone will work. I would never consider a phone like this again. Don't waste your money like I did. It may be cute, but it doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Fun Phone -- But Poor Reception","review":"This phone promised pure fun. It looks cool.

Too bad, really . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything is great except what matters.","review":"As stated in my title above, I have but one big problem with this phone. The reception is awful, and no channel changing is going to fix it. I feel this is true with almost all cordless phones today. I have an at least ten years old, or perhaps not, 900 mhz. Toshiba that still has the best reception I can find. Unfortunatly, in its old age, it does not seem to hold a charge as long, and I find my self replacing its battery far too often. But, I digress. I just want a phone with good reception, and this V Tech is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time/Money","review":"I decided to try this phone despite the handful of bad reviews. I figure, hey anybody can get a lemon, not to mention these cordless phones are all pretty finicky about where you place them and what you place them next to.So I figured I would give it a shot.To be fair, the phone has some good features, like its very cool design. The ring tones; the orange backlit display; the flashing keypad; and the interchangeable color plates make this phone seem like a great product. But what good is that if you can't use the phone to talk. If the handset finds the base (and I do mean IF) then all you get is static. I try to change the channel, the phone locks up and I have to put it back on the base. Awful. Here today, gone tomorrow. Back to the store it goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teen Phone Buyer","review":"I recently purchased this phone and it does not work worth a darn.

Easy to program rings, lots of features, color changes (if you care) also easy. Wanted to like it! But while sound coming in was ok, almost everyone I spoke to from the phone --- even when I was not far from the base -- told me sound was breaking up or I sounded like I was trapped in a tin can. If you just need a voice getting basic information across, might be ok, but if you need to sound closer to a standard corded or cell phone, either this model isn't it, or the particular one I received was faulty."},{"rating":"1","title":"The VTech NoConnect","review":"I bought one of these phones, and used it for a good 3 months or so with pretty good luck, there was some occasional 'crackle... pop!' on the line, but adjusting where I would stand seemed to fix this so I deemed it outside interference.About month number 3 it stopped working completely. It would answer ok and then you had about 60 seconds to talk clearly before it died and the other party thought you blew a fog horn in their ear. I replaced the battery, same thing.So I took it back to exchange it - ok nother one brand new in the box... never opened... charged for 14 hours like it says to, and NO CONNECT. NO CONNECT... NO CONNECT... NO CONNECT... thats right, just as many others on here have stated it doesn't work right out of the box. I sure wish it did because it was a great phone while it lasted. However I will not be trying another one and I suggest everyone take my advice and steer clear of this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks aren't everything. Don't waste your time or money!","review":"I purchased this phone because it looked really cool, and the features sounded great. It didn't take long to realize that was all the phone had going for it. I began to experience problems with interference, and the phone would refuse to turn off. Then it began making a horrible crackling noise after you were talking for over 20 minutes or so. After this occured, you couldn't get the phone to turn off or do anything. I was very disappointed in this phone. It was a good idea, but it is very poorly made. I returned this phone. Just don't waste your time or money on this phone. It is not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Third Time is NOT a charm!!!","review":"Bought this phone because of the features.....never even got to see any of them in action.....First one wouldn't even charge.

Third time must be the charm......nope, charged the phone for 12 hours......went to lift the handset off the base and got.....\\"no connection\\" My suggestion, buy a Uniden, Panasonic, or Motorola. Something is seriously wrong with the manufacturing of this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun but not fun enough","review":"I bought this phone for my new apartment, loving the color changeability. Overall this phone rings only when it wants to. If I pick it up and it is working then I can't hang it up, I have to take it back to the base.

My daughters phone lasted about a day then the static began, then my sons lasted about three days when the static began on his, I returned both of them and had them replaced at different stores, still within a few days same thing happened. I then returned them again and purchased two more at another two stores and have since had to return both again. Am not purchasing these phones again. These phones need to be recalled and fixed before anymore of them are sold, they are a total waste of money. Great idea - kids loved them, wish they had worked, DO NOT BUY ONE THIS CHRISTMAS - they will only be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Third one finally worked.","review":"Bought this for my daughters birthday. It was new defective, VTech sent another, same thing, new defective. Finally after a month and wasting my time packing and returning the 1st two I received one that works. I wrote VTech saying they have a quality problem with this phone and asked if they could provide me a free extended service contract, they assured me the phone would be OK and I could purchase a contract if I wanted.

We owned a V-Tech phone several years ago, and vowed NEVER to get another one after the bad experience. My daughter loves what this phone should be able to do.

I didn't like the fourth episode of Season 1, \\"Winds of Vengeance.\\" I never have liked any episode of any series when my favorite characters are in trouble and made to something against their will. I didn't like in Winds of Vengeance when Sue Ellen was made to sing in front of the family in a bathing suit while the bad man held a gun on her. I never did like that scene. Sue Ellen didn't deserve that. In Season 2, my favorite episode was when Sue Ellen took it upon herself and escaped from the prison JR put her in, the sanitarium. But it was sad when Sue Ellen was drinking, pregnant and crashed into the pole. All in all, I would recommend this DVD set to anyone who loves Dallas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are Some of the Episodes Edited?","review":"I just recently purchased the boxed set, and I have found that some of the episodes appear to be edited.

It didn't take the show long to find its audience; already in the first full season the producers knew they had something good on their hands. In these early days of the show, you got to see much more of Jock Ewing at the office (actor Jim Davis, of course, died later in the series' run) and how he influenced J.R. in his own conniving. We also loved seeing Tina Louise of \\"Gilligan's Island\\" return to television as Jock's ill-fated assistant, Julie Grey. (Ironically, her \\"Gilligan\\" costar Russell Johnson would appear later in a smaller role.) And if there was another prevailing theme of this early slice of the show, it had to be \\"poor, put-upon Sue Ellen.\\" Thankfully, that character would mature to kick butt in later seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dallas Junkie, the start of all night time drama to come!!!!","review":"I was so exctied when I received this.

I forgot how good the show was and the wrighting was way before it's time. It was funny to see how far technology has come. Like how no one on the show had a cell phone. I can't wait until season 3.

Let Linda Grays portrayal, of the drunken, pathetic, vulnerable character, Sue Ellen Ewing, be reason ALONE to get this boxed set. Watch her get into arguments with pretty Pamela over and over.

Why? Because Dallas is classic television. The writing, directing and acting was purely entertainment and the stories were consistently engrossing and sometimes silly. Who could forget Sue Ellen's affair with Dusty? Or Pamela's aerobics classes? Mandy and Sue Ellen fighting it out for J.R.'s hearts? Sue Ellen's affair with Chris Atkins? The Barrens Oil Ball where there was at least one fight (or catfight) per ball?Dalls approached camp but it never went over the top like Dynasty which means that its episodes still retain the power they had throughout the '80s. Perhaps it was not as witty or as well-written as the more sophisticated Knots Landing but it was able to retain strong dramatic structure throughout most of its run.I think the work of Larry Hagman and Linda Gray was definitely overlooked. They turned in consistently good performances, playing perhaps the most dysfunctional couple in television history pre-The Sopranos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Show!","review":"Unfortunately, I got seasons 3 & 4 in the mail before 1 & 2, so I started watching season 3 and now I'm completely hooked.

The main theme title starts out loud, but when it comes time for the actors to talk, I needed to turn up the volume on the TV in certain places more than once to hear what they're saying. I've watched 3 DVD's out the set so far and the sound quality is not the same as it once was on tv.

Although Solomon didn't want to follow in his father, Moses' footsteps he still did what he was told. Solomon was very curious about everything and sometimes it got him in trouble. Solomon was a great read for any age. I also loved the fact that this is a book of forida heritage. As many know Florida history books are few and far between. It ws truly an awesome book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book To Enjoy and To Share","review":"Solomon is an excellent read. As a resident of the area used as the setting, I really enjoyed the historical tibits, but more importantly, I came to really care about the characters, and want to find out more about their lives in post-civil war Florida. This novel really is a coming of age story, of a boy named Solomon who is developing his own strengths. Solomon's father is a farmer who doesn't understand his son's hunting spirit. Shaw's character-driven novel is tightly-woven, filled with great details and action. Middle school students will especially love this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"casio wave ceptor atomic watch","review":"The watch maintains exact time, is easy to read in any light, is reasonaby attractive and is priced right.Because of the atomic function, it is somewhat thicker than most wrist watches.Set up was not complicated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't make this mistake","review":"I knew I had a problem when I saw the manual's diagrams and instructions.

But I couldn't understand it. Why do post-modernists have to use such turbid prose. Do they only write for each other? Does each author seek to create his own personal language, unreadable, opaque and undecipherable to others?Still, I think there is something valuable imbedded in all this sediment, I just don't know what it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Complete Illustrated Guide to Tai Chi","review":"I searched long and hard for a good book on Tai Chi. This is it. This book has it all. If you are interested in the Cheng Man-Ch'ing style of Tai Chi, I recommend you start with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to Tai Chi","review":"This book is one of the best \\"guide\\" books, I've ever read, if this book does not make the reader absolutely go out and want to learn tai chi, than no other book will. It certainly was a pick-me-upper, and it inspires good health and well-being within each and every one of us. The author should definitely follow it up with a sequel, something similar to better living, cannot come close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great All-Around Guide","review":"As a very new student of this form of Tai Chi I am finding the book both fascinating and very helpful. Angus Clark provides substantive background pieces and then shows all of the moves -- both the warmup moves and the actual form. Each move is illustrated, diagrammed, and explained. Once one has learned the moves in class (I wouldn't recommend using the book without a course) this is an excellent home study aid!Very pleased to have it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please - spare me","review":"As a devotee of Pride and Prejudice,I have read many sequels, including Berdoll's first, which I enjoyed. This book was a tedious, cliched, poorly written disappointment. A flimsy, unimaginative plot, repetitious to the extreme, with no depth to the characters. Enough about Darcy and Elizabeth's sex lives, we get it already!! Just how many different ways do we need to read about their libidos? Darcy and Elizabeth are reduced to either having or thinking about sex, and very little else. If you remove the sex, the 480 pages would probably reduce by a third. Also, the pretentious overuse of the words compleat, connexion, frisson, etc., were annoying to the point of distraction. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very explicit sexually","review":"I just didn't feel this author's works were up to Austen standards. I don't feel it was true to the time or the characters. I'll keep the passion where it needs to be - private. Just not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"What garbage...","review":"This was the first P&P sequel I read and fortunately I didn't let it prevent me from reading other sequels and variations. Three main comments that other people have made: the book is smut (I enjoy sexual scenes but these were just too much and too gratuitous), the plot stinks, and the story is unbelievably repetitive. Read something else. This book is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and dumbing","review":"Blah blah blah sex. Blah blah blah sex. Thats pretty much all this book is. No good storyline. No humor whatsoever which was what I loved about Jane Austen's characters. This book makes them dumb mindless sex addicts. Had to force myself to read the whole darn thing hoping for at least one good paragraph but at the end all I could think was it was written by a horny teenager with a sad understanding of the characters and a really big thesaurus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Waste Your Time & Money","review":"While I enjoyed Mr. Darcy Takes A Wife, this book is awful. The author jumps around throughout every chapter. The Arthor never explains why Charlotte Collins has the look she does, or why Mrs. Bennett is Charlotte's son. Also why is it that afteer all this time Elizabeth still does not trust Mr. Darcy. There are so amny loose ends in this book. Don't buy it unless you have the true desire to throw away your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful romp","review":"If you enjoyed the first book in this series, you will be entertained by Darcy and Elizabeth's marital romp both in bed and through the adventures in England. Yes, there are spots of the plot that hop around the ancillary characters and you have to be patient in the middle to get to the reveal about Georgiana's future and what happened to the dastardly Wickham. However, I thoroughly enjoyed D&E and their marriage portrayal. I think this is a book for those days you want to lose yourself in Regency England. I think the last 100 pages were the most suspenseful. Overall a satisfying romantic adventure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crime against Jane's life work","review":"Horrible, hated it, couldn't finish it, it was so bad, sold it to used book store hoping no one else would ever read it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious at first, but overall Fun!","review":"If you can get past the first 13 chapters, you will be home free. I kept thinking I was reading the same page over again. The author re-established the facts so many times that it made the time line a little hard to follow.However, I love Linda Berdoll's ideas with the development of characters. The overall plot is fun and interesting, and when the pace picked up, it was hard to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly not Pride & predudice","review":"My favourite Classic book Pride & Predudice and the BBC addaption from the book a masterpiece. Linda Berdoll sequels totaly misses the characters and loses all the subtle passions of Jane Austen's masterpiece.Read Mr Darcy takes a wife and Darcy & Elizabeth, but only if you don't mind a sexual romp that debases these lovely characters. These books are OK in their own right and a good read but not lizzy & Darcy."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Such a disappointment!\\"","review":"The first sequel, Mr. Darcy Takes a Wife, wasn't all that bad but this one was not worth the read at all. The characters become very different than how Jane Austen created them--they do and say things that don't match them. I was rolling my eyes through half the book and only finished it to know what all happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"having read the Janet Aylmer \\"Darcy's Story\\" (slow starter, but enjoyable), and the Carrie Bebris Pemberley mysteries(not excellent, but good enough), i was looking forward to this book.

We want more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me!!!","review":"I am a Jane Austen lover and a classic reader overall and this book was awful. Don't waste your money or time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as intresting as the first.","review":"It took me a good long while to suffer through this book. It jumps around way to much. I only bought the book because it was recommened with her first, \\"Darcy Takes A Wife\\". I did not enjoy this as much as her fisrt. The plot thickens as you read but, it takes a while to get there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave Miss Jane Alone!","review":"I understand the author's crush on Colin Firth's portrayal of Mr. Darcy but this does not give her license to change the essential character of Miss Jane's people. Anyone who believes good sex solves everything should be writing in the Romantic Porn industry not mucking up classic literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Sequel","review":"Having thoroughly loved the first sequel by Mrs.Berdoll, I had to have this second book...and I LOVED it! I realize that some readers didn't enjoy the descriptions of Lizzy and Darcy with their children, but to me it showed them maturing and living the life we all wanted them to live...together and happy. The love scenes are equally as heated in this novel and the story line is to my liking, but the cast of other characters I could have done without. Wickham and Lady Catherine's stories were interesting, to be sure, but every other story just seemed to lag, as well as reviewing everything that happened in the previous novel in the first chapters. Even though it starts slow, the interaction that we get from Lizzy and Darcy more than makes up for the beginning and reminds me just why I began to love Pemberley's Prized Couple in the first place!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just read the first book... You'll get the gist","review":"So, I absolutely loved the first book. It was an interesting take on what could happen after Darcy and Elizabeth marry. But don't spend any time or money on this sequel, if you have the first. I get that Berdoll might want to summarize what happened in the first book. Ok, fine. But don't write a second book summarizing the first.It was dull. And repetitive. And don't waste any money on this pathetic attempt at writing a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am a huge fan of Pride and Prejudice and Austin in general and was really looking forward to reading this book. However, I did not find any of Austin's witty banter or excellent character development in this book. I typically read one book every two to three days but this one has had me trudging through for nearly two weeks. Luckily the chapters are short because getting through one before putting the book down is just about my limit. If you are interested in this book, I would suggest checking out the first few chapters in the library and then deciding whether or not it is worth the money. Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Kindle Edition","review":"The Kindle edition of this book does not match the print copy. The chapters are out of order, making it difficult to go back and forth between my book and my Kindle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Darcy & Elizabeth: Nights and Days at Pemberley","review":"Not nearly as electrifying as the first book. Too many points of view take away from the main characters, who act and speak so out of character, it is no longer a continuation of the novel we all now. It is a stand alone, steamy at times, romance novel. It was probably, though, meant as such, since there are clearly explanations of things that otherwise would have been known to readers. But still a fun read if you like to know what happens next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Bore","review":"A bad rehash of her excellent \\"Mr Darcy Takes a Wife.\\" Couldn't even get through it. No more Linda Berdoll for this reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeping Pride and Prejudice alive for me!","review":"I love the original Pride and Prejudice. So I took chance on the first, and this sequel. I have to say I loved them. I love the characters, and to see this book continue their story with little twists and turns was interesting and kept me wanting more! I love how Mr Darcy is portrayed, dark and mysterious to the world, and warm and sensual to Lizzie. Love, love this book, especially to see them finally have children!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Darcy & Elizabeth: Nights and Days at Pemberley","review":"I enjoyed this book nearly as much as the one before it. Although I do think that some it is a bit more vulgar than necessary, overall I enjoy reading more about Darcy and Elizabeth and their lives together. The first book seemed to tie up all the loose ends pretty well so this one needed to untie them, as it were, in order to tell the stories. Once you get past all the back-tracking it moves along fairly well. Perhaps not exceptional literature, but entertaining none the less. I want to be swept away by a book and lose time when I read; this one does that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorely disappointed","review":"I recently purchased this book, and, for the first time, actually returned a book to the bookstore. After struggling to read more that half of the book, I had to return it.Usually, I enjoy even the smuttiest of romances, yet this one only degrades two of the most beloved characters in the English language. The text jumped all over the place. Perhaps it ended well, but after 42 chapters, I had enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"What else could happen","review":"I rather enjoyed the first book more so than this edition but I have read it several times now. I am not a fan of the flipping around from character to character as is done in these two books I would much rather concentrate on the main characters, however it is a good book and worth a read. I am sure I will read it again possibly just skipping over the excess of character I do not care so much about. Wickham is truely evil, Lady Catherine is never satified and little Georgiana is just as passionate as her brother is I believe. I hurt for Richard in his injuries and altered life style. Darcy always proud and distant is fun to see as a father and still in love with his Elizabeth."},{"rating":"1","title":"more of the same","review":"I have to say, the first book in the series had me longing for something more than Boots & Lizzy in the sack, this book was more of the same. Though I'm glad that her sister finally achieves her first orgasm with Bingley, I'm not sure that's what I was hoping to read - yes, marriage can be a passionate thing and yes, the A&E/BBC Pride & Prejudice film was brilliantly done and yes, these books were largely based on this depiction BUT isn't there more to it? I suppose my biggest beef with these books is that there isn't more depicted in these books - more about Darcy and Lizzy and her transition from second daughter in the Bennett household to Mistress of Pemberly and everything that entails. I'm also not sure I needed 101 ways to say \\"they shagged\\" in Austen-speak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, people, this is complete rubbish","review":"I have never picked up a worse book in my life. My wife and i enjoyed the first book, \\"Mr. Darcy Takes A Wife,\\" so we bought this one. DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE WE DID!!! There is a very weak plot, after she spent half of the book repeating the first book. She couldn't even make up her mind if Darcy's mother's name was Elinor, as in the last book, or Ann, as in this one. Whatever fits into the story goes. I don't mind sex, but I do require some sort of plot or at least one interesting character. I read one of the reviewers saying it was one dimensional, but I think they were being nice, I can't find any dimension at all. I wouldn't buy this book, nor recommend it. I have no idea why anybody would write or publish this. Did literature become Hollywood, where nonsense sequel can get away just because of the succesful original?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"I love PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. I enjoyed Ms. Berdoll's book MR. DARCY TAKES A WIFE.It was for the most part interresting and I enjoyed the spicy romance between Darcy and Elizabeth. That said, this book was a huge disappointment. The first 3/4 of the book were only a rehash of her first book and the rest was just unsatisfying. The business with Wickham didn't even make much sense. I can recommend the earlier book but this was a big letdown. Spend your time watching Colin Firth on the DVD instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are we being a little too picky?","review":"I have just finished this book and love the storyline. Is'nt that what we are really after? The STORY. I really enjoyed the way that the lives of the characters take twists and turns. I can look over some of the errors that are made like: name changes, the confusing French or Latin, or grammar. All of that really doesn't keep from following the storyline. I think that if anyone chooses this book, they need to look past the picky little details to focus on the story of the characters. The end of the book is the best part, so keep it up and you will happy you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could not even get through the first 15 pages. Life is just too short to waste on this plodding text.","review":"Some reviewers has mentioned that \\"Darcy and Elizabeth\\" gets better after page eighty. I keep trying to make myself plow through the boring parts, but something is telling me life is just to short to waste my time on this plodding text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive rehash","review":"I loved Mr. Darcy Takes a Wife and didn't want to see it end. So I was delighted to see another sequel by the same author. Unfortunately this one just continually rehashes previous material in slightly different ways. The storyline jumps all over the place, contradicts itself, and does not feel cohesive. Perhaps better editing would have made this a worthwhile read. While Mr. Darcy Takes a Wife will find a permanent spot on my bookshelf, Days and Nights at Pemberley will not.I do hope to see more from Berdoll. Perhaps she should take on a sequel to the characters in Emma."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"I love Pride and Prejudice. I couldn't wait to find out what became of Elizabeth and Darcy. If you want to read about the 101 ways they had sex go ahead and read this book. BORING, DULL, REPETITIVE...."},{"rating":"1","title":"a nice cover","review":"the only thing good about this sequel and worse Miss Berdoll's next one is the lovely art on the covers. I enjoy a 'romance' every once in a while but when deciding to read these I expected, hoped to 'hear' Darcy and Elizabeth in Austens 'voice' or at least one of the many filmed versions. This book was a terrible disappointment, I stupidly read both because I have the inane compulsive need to finish and complete things. I could not write as beloved Austen, I would hope someone who had the gall to would do a better job. I'm not even sure I should give these books away they are that bad, I should have read the previous reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me!","review":"I think the art of Austen's irony is totally lost on Berdoll. One piece of advice, find your own characters! We all love Elizabeth and Darcy, but they are the product of another persons imagination.One last thing, what kind of line is, \\"he was in high dudgeon\\"? That was one of the dumbest lines I have ever read. I am pretty sure no one in England has read these books, because there have been no reports of head explosions."},{"rating":"1","title":"REFUND!","review":"If I could I would ask for a refund. What a waste of my time and money. If you did not read the first of Ms. Berdoll's novels then do not bother to. I can only assume to make this new book more than a few pages long; she has rewritten her first book all over again in this latest attempt. The lack of any new and creative ideas made this book more boring and complete nonsense than the first one.There are so many fabulous books out there to read, do not take your time or money to read this reincarnation of her desperate attempt to write.I will give her a one star for effort in trying to write a book, but that is as much as this book deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sequel to a Sequel","review":"Of all the sequels to Pride and Prejudice, I thought Bar Sinister (also released as \\"Mr. Darcy Takes a Wife\\") was the most original and well-written of the lot. Unfortunately, that originality is missing from Darcy & Elizabeth: Nights and Days at Pemberley. Linda Berdoll spends most of the book rehashing scenes from her first sequel and from the original Austen novel. Fully the first third of the novel is recapitulation of Bar Sinister. The entire novel feels old and tired and lacking imagination. I wouldn't bother with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good CD for New Age","review":"A friend told me about Ray Lynch, and I bought this on his recommendation. He was right; although the CD is inconsistent (some instrumentals are very good while others are not), the CD is well worth the money. I have a machine that transfers music from one CD to another, and for my purpose the music was great (an ipod would probably work as well). If you like New Age music (people like Enya, Jesse Cook, etc), you will probably like some of his cuts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"This is a great package for a beginer. The bass is a great bass with a cool color. The amp is o.k., great for the price. Not very loud though, and the sound cracks. It's not that bad but gets worse as the volume goes up. The strap is o.k., and the bag is just fine for keeping the dust off it, no padding though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice package!","review":"This is my first bass guitar and it is a terrific beginning package. First, the lb11 Silvertone bass itself plays very well. You got to firmly touch the frets for it not to buzz and it makes a sweet fat sound. It look very cool even though It's a darker blue than expected. The amplifier does it's job very nicely working as a practice amp and can reach high volumes. All the other things were inside the case. The case will not protect against hits but the bass is strong enough anyways. The cable, guitar strap, tuner, and picks are just average quality. The instructional dvd doesn't last long. The accesories are not something to complain about though. Overall, the package is very well put together and definitely reccomend it for the price. I expect to still be using it in a couple of years. Good job Silvertone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"I am very impressed. For what it costs it's a great guitar. the only problem I have is something in the guitar is not grounded properly so there is this annoying buzz if your not touching any of the metal parts. But other that that everything works great.I would highly recommend this for a beginner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try other beginner bass.","review":"Pretty hard to play for beginner bass. It's too expensive for the quality it provides. I suggest that you look up craigslist for used bass and amp sale. Yamaha and Fender squire make better beginner bass than Silvertone package. I have had this for 3 years and finally got an albanez bass and fenders amp to replace.After using it on daily basis, these are my opinions:Pros:The color is great for this bass, and the shipping was fast. Everything was included in the picture, easy transaction.Cons:The bass does not have many frets, and the neck doesn't stay straight. I had a professional friend to fix it for me and the first string still rattles like crazy after a few weeks. When it doesn't rattle is when we loosen the neck and it was so hard to press down the string.The tuner does not work period.The Amp produces very small sound, and after 1 year of usage it makes some weird noises on it's own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I wanted!","review":"I love this.

All in all, the bass itself is solid. It has some fret vibrations on the E string in the F/F# area but that came out when I replaced the strings. As for the accessories, the amp is perfect if you are looking for low-volume practice. Anything beyond that it just isn't designed for. The \\"gig bag\\" is garbage - it's a dust cover. It ripped apart when I was loading it into the car sending the bass crashing to the ground. The cord and tuner are okay but decidedly low-end. I purchased a new cord and Snark via Amazon.For what you pay, this is a great buy for beginners. I've gotten to the point where I am playing every other week with the praise team and it does fine. I definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bass for beginners","review":"The box the guitar and amp came in was questionable.

The packaging was in good shape but the guitar a huge 3\\" x .5\\" gouge in the body. There were no signs of transportation damage so it must of happened at the manufacturer (in China). Obviously the quality control from this manufacturer is poor. Amazon's return proces on the other hand is 1st rate. They had a new one sent out right away and should have it by 12/30. Hopefully the next one arrives in good condition. It's just dissapointing to see the look on your childs face when the present they've been looking forward too getting for so long is broken and has to return it. Thanks Silvertone, thanks allot.Update...The new arrived in different packaging this time.

I had to do a lot of adjustment with no directions. After an hour of messing around with the bridge I found the neck adjustment, then it went much better. I have a couple of six string guitars and I've never had a guitar with a neck adjustment, so it's a case of not knowing how to adjust the neck without directions.

The little amp that comes with it is fine for me, because I use it inside my house for practicing and don't intend on playing any gigs with it. My only \\"complaint\\", if you can call it that, is that the bass itself is pretty heavy. I know in general basses are heavy but this one really gets my shoulder hurting after a little while.

The guitar was new and looks expensive. But the amp was smaller than I expected but worked fine. First thing wrong was the manufacturer didn't ship me the cable to connect the Bass to the Amp(Thank God my brother had a spare). After that I noticed the guitar buzzing a lot. I played around for 3 hours to find out what was causing the buzzing when I played and It turns out the neck of the guitar was bent out of shape.

But the cord was a piece of junk ,after about 1-2 weeks of playing it just stopped working.... After a while I got a new amp which really added alot ,and a multiple effects pedal and it was like a whole new bass! email me for links on the effect pedal and amp because they really made my bass!

The speaker is internal, so you can't muffle it either.While we've only had it for a matter of hours, I worry about the stability of it as well. With a child, the pizza could easily break and cease to function, ruining the whole element of the song.So, it's cute... play with it in the store, or at a friend's house, but don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"But my son would give it five stars","review":"When I bought this for him, my son was 22 months and he just loves the thing. He opened it (Christmas morning)and by the end of the day he knew the words to the song and was singing along. I'm tolerant to noises, my husband not so much. He was getting kinda annoyed with it. LOL I wasn't gonna buy it for 25.00-30.00 at the store but when I found it on amazon for 7.50 I had to buy it. Now though I would probably pay full price. He liked it that much. Well maybe 20.00 anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Giggles","review":"I am not sure who had more fun with this toy at Christmas; the adults or the baby.

The plot, with one exception which I will mention later, was superb, and the descriptions and emotions of the characters and situations was excellent. However, I was a bit dissapointed that the book's main villan was only in the last fifty pages of the novel...I would have liked to seen King Ghidorah throughout the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Libertarian young-adult monster thriller? If you say so...","review":"This is an odd mix of libertarian government-bashing, monster thriller, and young adult concerns, and nothing quite fits together. Drawing on the \\"rogues' gallery\\" of monsters from the Godzilla films, Cerasini spins a tale of an ancient Antarctic civilization (with a hat-tip to H. P. Lovecraft) out to clear the world of humans. A publicity tour of genius teens (in their own blimp!) and soldiers is the world's only hope to stop the monsters, and, by the way, Godzilla follows them for no apparent reason. If you like Godzilla monsters or military hardware, you'll find something for you. Otherwise, skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Godawful","review":"I am a MAJOR Godzilla fan, so ofcourse when i saw this book ibought it. Ha! Marc Cerasini claims to be a big Godzilla fan, yet he is ruining the whole series with his horrible novels. First MAJOR mistake is his is mixing the Monster series with the Hensi series. Are we to believe that Megalon, the goofiest of the monster (not including Gabbera cause he was make believe in a childs dream) is in the same story as Biollante and Battra? I mean your mixing serious Godzilla with the goofy 70's Godzilla. If you were to take Biollante and Battra out mabey, MABEY this book might actully be worthy of having the title of Godzilla on the cover. Infact the cover is the only highlight of the book. I dont like how the new wave of Godzilla books are totaly destroying the Godzilla Series its self. I own ALOT of imported godzilla toys and posters, but ill never buy these American books agian. Shame on you Marc Cerasini. Dont buy this book if your a serious hardcore Godzilla Fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the Godzilla books!","review":"This book is simply amazing. Even though many people thought Godzilla 2000 was better, I think this is the best of the Godzilla series. Since my dad is from Peru, I loved it when Cerasini had Peru in the book and Megalon destroying Lima (I would have preferred Gigan instead). I also loved the battle sequences, such as when Anguirus fights Gigan and Godzilla fights Manda. I also liked the action parts when Godzilla fights Biollante in the Ancient Ones crystal city. The ending could have been a little better but over all this book was simply amazing. I also loved it that Cerasini shows that the U.S. is still struggling from the monsters attacks in Godzilla 2000. I belive that they should have made these Godzilla book's into movies instead of the TriStar Godzilla movie. They would have brought in more money than that each!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS BOOK IS GREAT!!!!","review":"This book was awesome!!!!I liked how almost all the monsters appeared and how it showed who was good and who was evil.Example Rodan killed Battra and saved the Destiny Explorer.

My only complaint is that it is billed as a gothic romance and isn't as spooky or suspenseful as the gothics I am used to. However, there is PLENTY of heart-stopping romance here though (which is often an afterthought in some gothics) so it sort of balances itself out.

My little girl is the sweetest thing in the world and so very well behaved. She would never bite and she is so patient and tolerant. Before I knew that she was having seisures at night, I discussed the problem with Uncle Mattie, (the creep) and he wanted me to fly my dog out to him so he could do some bruital training, (in his own words)with the dog. He stated that the dog was vicious and would get worse. What a creep. This dog would never hurt anyone or anything. What a putz! If I'd done what he asked I would have had to put the dog down. What a creep. OH yeah, and he said about 10 times, I should buy his book.

The information is good, but it is presented in such a way as to drive off any thinking person. The book is written as a set of dialogs between \\"Uncle Matty\\" Margolis and his irritatingly stupid students. If these are real people, it is scary to think that they might be allowed to vote and drive cars. I found myself focusing on this aspect more than listening to what Mr. Margolis had to say in each lesson, which when one takes out the dialog, are actually pretty helpful. I suppose the problem is that once you've written one dog training book, there's not much else you can say on the subject.

It has laughs but not gut busters. I found this movie to be very funny that has jokes at the right time. It's not that anything extremely funny ever happens, it's just the way Napoleon reacts to the environment around him. He's dressed like a nerd but talks like a spoiled/whiney kid. Making up stories to impress people who will never like him, eating in class, fending off bullies while trying to keep a cool status with the ladies, it's like being back in high school all over again!I think a lot of people relate to this movie, especially us not-so-popular ones. Like I said, this movie will appeal to some and to some it won't. I can very easily see where people could watch this movie and not understand what's so great about it. But it is great, and to those who think so will agree that this is a movie that will go down in cult history"},{"rating":"2","title":"Recognize the characters","review":"I too grew up in small town Idaho (although at an earlier time, '60s and '70s) and recognize the characters.

I'll admit, the first time I saw this movie, I didn't get it. Then I realized that there really wasn't much to get, which is what makes the movie so great. There's really isn't much of a plotline, but the hilarity of the characters makes up for it. From the set and costume design to the characters themselves, the movie is just plain funny. Another thing that makes this movie worthwhile is that it's capable of holding different meanings for different people. Some see it as purely comedic fun, others see it as a sort of coming of age story, and some people just don't see anything in it at all. However you feel about this film, you have to admit it's definitely one of a kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lockers' color are pretty","review":"This movie is interesting, but not as funny as I thought.The music is great.

I will say that months after its release, people such as Mel Brooks referred to it as genius.You need to see it for yourself.

I think people who were the jocks, cheerleaders, bullies and popular kids in high school are the ones who hate this movie because the movie almost seems to ignore them, and you know how much those types hate being ignored. As for anyone else, you ought to enjoy this movie. Even folks who were the nerdiest kids in high school ought to love this movie, especially since they couldn't possibly be as nerdy and dorky as this guy.

I do, and so I did. It's a little strange and slow, but it's a black comedy and won't appeal to everyone. Everyone is deadpan and secure in their nerdiness. It's such a bizzare movie, I can totally understand why it has a cult following. His friend Pedro stole each scene. He was hillarious. He wants to become class president and runs against Halie Duff's character, Summer. Napolean saves the day when after giving your election speech, it needs to be followed by a skit of some kind, so Napolean dances to Canned Heat and is so funny. Needless to say, he wins the crowd over and Pedro is now elected.I took off a star because there are definately parts where it is slow and stretched out to much, but overall, if you like obscure comedies, then check this out.

Because it has no other value, other than perhaps for the purpose of studying the effects of boredom on the human psyche. I kept expecting the main character to be a hero, instead he's just a loser. I can appreciate a movie without a hero (i.e. Being John Malkovich) but can't they at least make the loser character someone who does something...anything...interesting?Also, the other characters are really weak. The best potential characters, the grandma for example, are barely ever on screen.I thought this movie would be like Rushmore, and I couldn't have been more wrong.I will say one thing positive about it, though, there is a scene where Napolean goes to jump his bike on a ramp and instead just plows through it - a really funny gag, I have to admit...most of us have done something like that.In summary, might be worth it if you can rent it cheap and get a backup movie, but I wouldn't recommend buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pseudo-Intellectualism at it's height","review":"People like this movie for the same reason that they like Donnie Darko, because they feel like they should.

Napoleon is the \\"class geek\\" that all of us remember from high school. So far so good, but the film simply didn't do anything for me. In a word, I found it lame.I literally nearly fell asleep during this movie - it was that dull for me. By about 1/4 way through it I could not wait for it to end. I stuck it out as I kept expecting it to get better and become funny. It never did.The only part of the movie I liked was the WHEN IN ROME song they played during the closing credits.

Especially when compared to the world we live in, where every apathetic american could care less about starving children in africa.

Since then, I have watched it a few more times on cable, and I have found it has more than grown on me. Now it is one of those pictures that I have to sit and watch anytime I flipped by and see it on tv. A loveably goofy cast of misfits highlight this film about the biggest misfit of them all.

The acting is good (pariculary napoleans g'd out brother and push-over uncle) but its so dull.

Everyone was raving about it, saying how funny and great it was. I just had to watch it too.So I rented the dvd. I watched the first half hour or so, waiting for the funny, a plot, anything to sustain me through the movie. Nothing. It's just the beginning, I thought. It'll be great by the end, just like everyone else said.So I waited. And waited. And waited. I waited until, finally, it was the end of the movie.I sat in amazement, wondering how anyone could like this movie. The 'laugh lines' that everyone raved about weren't funny. NO plot was ever really developed, and the movie never really finished.All in all, I would definitely say that this is the WORST movie I have ever seen, and that includes Glitter and the Spice Girls movie.

People who like this film just enjoy laughing at nerds. It's actually that simple.There's no plot. The characters, pathetic as they begin, never develop. The so-called jokes are so dry that one feels the sensation of dying in the desert as the writers senselessly destroy the spirits of their own characters.

If that is the case then why is this movie being called by so many as one of the funniest movies in years. The whole time I watched it I maybe chuckled once, and even that was probably forced. This movie is dull, stupid, and ultimatly pointless.The story here is that Napoleon is a high school student who seemingly gets no respect. He makes friends with a hispanic student who transfers in and a girl who one day tried to sell him crap. After his guardian gets injured in a ATV accident his Uncle moves in to care for them, and all he can think about is a get rich quick scheme. The movie drags along at an unbearably slow pace and ultimatly is not funny.I am told it gets better with repeat viewings but the question is, if the movie sucks to begin with, why watch it again.

For starters, does everything have to make sense to be funny?? Heck no. I laughed the second Napoleon came on the screen and kept laughing til the end. The hilarious things in this movie are more about stupid humor, which is fine by me. The problem with many of today's movies is that they think they need to have sex jokes and cuss words to be funny. This movie shows that you can be funny just being stupid. I am 20 years old and I am immature. I laughed at this movie until I cried. This movie is the best movie I have ever seen.Aside from the side splitting laughter, this movie also has it's tender moments. You will probably cry when you see Trisha leave Napoleon at the dance...I did. And when Deb and Napoleon dance together, it just looks right.I could go on and on, but go see the movie.

Jon Feder in this movie reminds me a lot of one of my ex-colleagues (in a good way), which makes watching this quite strange. Napoleon's eccentricities are all so amazingly weird that by the time we get to the end we're really truly relived to see his transformation - and my jaw nearly dropped when I saw it achieved. Skits tied together don't always turn out well, but this little film sort of has what it takes to stretch out to full length. My own high school experience was more like Napoleon Dynamite than other films like American Pie (good grief). The internet romance between Kip and Lafawnduh is a bit unlikely, as is the weirdness of \\"Uncle Rico\\" being Napoleon's guardian (Jon Heder was 27 when Napoleon Dynamite was filmed) is a stretch, but it's all in good fun.

Kung Pow, another really dumb movie is hilarious in comparison. I beg you not to waste you time and money. If you want some good laughs for the same price I can recomend watching paint dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"A comedy with no humour.","review":"This is the worst film I have seen in a long time and has nothing to recommend it. Pretentious & filled with contempt for it's 'characters' it invites the viewer to mock those it deems beneath them.

Put me in the hate camp.For a better treatment of the same issues see 'Welcome to the Dollhouse\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"worst movie i have ever seen. i only laughed once.","review":"i cant believe that i wasted my time on such a pointless movie. i cant believe that people even take the time to watch this movie. this was horrible, i hate it, its sucks, what else can i say? its stupid. just dont waste your time watching this. watch something else. peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that dynamite","review":"this movie is far from funny and dvd special features aside and quality sound and video, this movie is dumb and I would not recomend even renting it save your money or buy a film with class.

While some people who like wasting their precious time may enjoy it, there's a name for those people, we call them idiots. Napoleon Dynamite is a complete waste of time and has defined the phrase, \\"Is it over yet?\\" It's a drag about nothing and I'm still waiting for it to start. I advise you to never even consider seeing this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOD!! THIS MOVIE STINKS!!!!","review":"Ok, i watched this movie for 45 minutes and i got so bored i tured on Dora the Explorer and watched benny the bull fall down a hill. (This is a show on a baby channal). My friends say i didn't understand the humor of this movie. They say it is so stupid it was funny. I think its so stupid...its stupid. I don't care if a guy wants a \\"quesidiilla\\" or if he rides on rollar skates on the back of a guys bike. I didn't feel the characters, and i couldn't connect with the character. How? Well, i have never tied a string to an action figure and thrown it out my bus window, or put tater tots in my pocket for later. This movie teaches nothing has no moral, makeds no sense, about as entertaining as a lightswitch, and seems as if the produces, script writers, and cienimatographers and the casting was all done by freakish German monkeys. DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE!!!! THE BOTTOM LINE:(drumroll) It stinks. (duh!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY [...]","review":"[...]This movie is NOT Hilarious, Funny or even Entertaining.

But hey this is a great movie! What a beautiful Idaho! the music is also pretty nice, I'm not American but I love every sences in this film. I think it's normal but cute. I can't see any lovely things in boring Hollywood movies and I can't see any special in all those teen movies, but this one is just really good. Kinda like a interesing documentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Bad","review":"Napoleon Dynamite is beyond merely bad. It is really bad. It is disjointed. It has no plot and no action.It was supposed to be about a week in the life of some high school 'nerds'. There was really nothing holding it together.There were a couple of funny spots in the show, but it is certainly not one that I would recommend. I really thought that it was a total waste of 90 minutes. Do yourself a favor and get something else instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like an unwanted guest who won't go away","review":"I really tried to like this movie. After turning it off the first time because it was unwatchable, i came back a few days later to try watching it again. But this movie is just a failure. It tries to be quirky and witty, but it fails miserably. The acting is not really acting, its just monotone reading of lines. That would be fine with me - and even acceptable as an eccentricity - but there are just no redeeming qualities to make you accept its shortcomings. It offers no insights into how that geeky crowd lives, nor does it resonate if you were that geek. It is an MTV picture, and it really shows - this movie tries too hard and comes up short. Instead of wasting your money on this dog, go watch Rushmore again, or Garden State."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst movie ever","review":"this movie was so bad, when the other reviewers are creating parameters just to watch the movie you know its bad. if i have to be a certain age or have a certain level of dorkiness about me to enjoy the movie, then its a dorky movie, a dorky terrible movie. not even worth renting"},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE OF THE WORST OF ALL TIMES","review":"How in the world can a supposedly \\"Top 500, or 100, etc\\" reviewer give this movie anything other than one lowly star? I wish I could have bought the trailer alone, it was good. It bore no resemblance to the final cut in full length movie form. What a total waste of time. Inane and not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"glad it wasn't my money","review":"Some friends of mine rented this movie and supersize me and brought it over to watch, choosing the lesser of two evils (we had just eaten dinner) we opted for this flick. While I will admit there were a couple parts where I was forced to laugh at the sheer stupidity of the characters, this ranks right up there with Blair Witch Project where I kept expecting it to get better. My problem with this movie is that I felt like I wasted my time watching it when I could have done something way more interesting. Maybe I just don't get it or can't empathize with the characters, I thought the little romance was cute and the grandma was cool, but overall I think I just found the main character to be really dumb. sorry to all you guys who really liked it, maybe you're better than me too."},{"rating":"2","title":"low budget classic","review":"This is a low budget comedy classic. My kids current favorite movie. Worthwhile rental or purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"...uneven","review":"Rented this one the other day. It does have a few laugh out loud funny moments....but they are kinda few and far inbetween. It's worth checking out anyway. One of the funniest things about this movie is one of the supporting charactors. There is a girl that Pedro takes to the dance, and later Napoleon starts to date...its one of the daughters from that icky Meg Ryan movie where Meg plays a drunk and her husband is a pilot and he is trying to hold the family together, etc. Forgot the name of it. Oh yeah, its called \\"When a man loves a women.\\" Anyway, one of the little girls in that movie, one that Meg kicks around when she is drunk, is in this movie, and of coarse has grown up a bit since then. See if you can recognize her.If you liked something like \\"Welcome to the dollhouse\\" then you might like this one. There is just a lot of really random crazy stuff happening in it. The dance sequence at the student council presentations is crazee...probably the highlight of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heck Yes!","review":"This movie is Freakin' Awsome. It has basically no plot but that is the cool part you dont notice it because the movie is freakin' hilarious.Gosh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful! Gosh!","review":"What a great movie. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD. Deffinatly one of those movies you have to see more than once. Check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet!","review":"This is a movie you will definately have to watch twice... If you have heard nothing about it and just randomly watch it you will think what the??? But try not to watch the movie to follow a particular storyline, just sit back and enjoy the daily adventures of Napoleon and friends. Awesomely funny movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wins points for its uniqueness","review":"Even if you don't like this movie, you gotta admit, it's at least different. This movie has developed a large cult following, and to be honest I am not sure why certain people continue to spew quotes and think this is the greatest movie ever. There are cute little nostalgic moments, such as the ridiculously long phone cord (some of you remember when phones had cords...) So in conclusion, it's a good movie, but not a GREAT movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly genuine comedy!","review":"Napoleon Dynamite is one of the funniest films I have ever seen in my life. Most of the humor is directed at and some might argue, against, the main character Napoleon, who is depicted as a nerd to end all nerds. But, the humor isn't cruel, because the audience loves and roots for Napoleon's success. The film is absolutely loaded with one-liners that you will catch yourself running back and forth with your friends long after you see the film. As far as longevity goes, after two viewings, the humor is not as grabbing as the initial. It probably won't hold up to a film like \\"The Big Lebowski\\". But, it will stand the test of time to sit proudly next to your copy of \\"Bottlerocket.\\" Napoleon is the comedy of the year, and a perfect movie to watch and laugh at with a big group of friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't understand the popularity of this movie","review":"I don't understand why this movie got such great reviews. It certainly wasn't an intelligent comedy, if comedy is what it was intended to be. It was simply painful to watch; almost as if a bunch of high school students made it themselves. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Ever Made By MTV Films","review":"Wow and I thought joe's apartment was bad !MTV has lower there standards from making this film.Never want to see any movies that has Jon Heder in it.Shame on everyone who wasted money on this !"},{"rating":"2","title":"not a comedy at all, but worth watching at least once","review":"well, this movie was entertaning for me, meanwhile it was slow but not boringif you are sick and tired of movies packed with special features, super heroes, and unrealisitic stories of wizards or aliens invading our planet, then this is the timne to give yourself a break and watch a movie of a nerd going to school in idahoat least you can think this could really happen somewhere in real world,If you haven't seen this movie yet, i would say give it a try, but don't expect anything extraordinaryhope it helped"},{"rating":"2","title":"You either \\"get it\\" or you don't","review":"What can I say? Reviewers who say this movie has no plot are right. This movie lives or dies depending upon whether or not you like the characters. What you see is what you get. If you think Napoleon is funny, then you'll like this movie. If you like dry, subtle comedy based on the actions and mannerisms of the key characters rather than some contrived situations they find themselves in, then you'll like this movie.And it takes a few minutes to get into the groove. But once you get it (if you do) then you're hooked.So if you need to be force-fed comedy (like TV sit coms) then you probably won't like this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Flippin Sweet Movie ever!!!!!!!!!","review":"In my opinion it was the best movie ever. I dont care what the others said, saying its stupid it rocked.It deals with a nerdy big haired looser thats trying to make it through High school.When he meets a new guy at the school named pedro they become friends and with a little help from Napoleon Pedro runs for school president. I know some others think it stinks by what Napoleon says, like \\"gosh!!, flippin, and sweet\\" i think its funny when he says it.I've wathced it many times and it never fails. Especially when he does thelow breathing thing at the begining of the movie.Me and my best friend thinks thats so funny.But then ending could have been better. I think the fans of this movie would have liked it if Napoleon and Deb kissed at the end. I hope they make a Napoleon Dynamite 2.This is the best flippin movie of all time!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Its ok..","review":"I bought it cause everyone said how good it was... but i was not happy with what I saw, I think its because I was expecting something so funny that when I saw it, it wasn't. I just didnt laugh like I thought I would.. I actually fell asleep during some of it"},{"rating":"1","title":"High School High","review":"Those who went through high school high on weed will relate to this movie. That's the impression you get of Napoleon (Jon Heder) in Napoleon Dynamite...that he's high all the time.Basically the movie follows this kid (Napoleon) through a monotony of high school and family situations. Napoleon responds to these situations as if in a drug induced stupor. In this film his loser character/attitude prevails when faced with conflict; hence, his state of stupor is glorified to heroism which is probably why a few teen's and young adults think that it's cool to mimic Napoleon's character.There are some amusing scenes. But mostly I found myself chuckling thinking \\"what an idiot\\".Napoleon Dynamite is an over-rated film for MTV junkies.Purchase it? No way, Dude."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sweet, strange and funny film - It's DYNO-MITE!","review":"Speaking with others who have seen this movie, it seems that there are two camps; the \\"I love this movie!!\\" camp or the \\"This is the worst movie I've ever seen\\" camp. If you are looking for a fast paced movie with quick and witty dialogue, this IS NOT for you.The film started slowly and there are some scenes that are just plain weird. But as the credits rolled my husband and I looked at each other and said the same thing, \\"that was really fun!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought I'd Hate It.","review":"I was rather \\"Out of the loop\\" for the duration of Napoleon-Mania . I was serving as a missionary for my church, at which time I didn't watch any TV or movies or even listen to much music. I heard a little bit about Napoleon Dynamite, and alot of people were quoting it(\\"IDIOTS\\"). All I saw was a formula for disaster. Everyone said there was no plot and that there were alot of inside jokes. All of the 10-15 yr old crowd seemed highly entertained while most of their parents did not. So when I got home (which was after the lunacy), I hesitated, even rejected invitations to watch it. Then one day, at Blockbuster, my dad convinced me to watch it. Honestly, I loved it. I laughed for days. That's all that was really important to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Free Spirited Yet Hilarious Movie","review":"I'll start out the review with being blunt: This movie doesn't really have much of a plot. At the beginning it feels like a bunch of scenes of hilarity strung together ( Including Rex Kwon Do ) but once Napoleon meets Pedro and Uncle Rico comes, things begin to progress.Small laughs and moments make this movie funny. You may not be falling out of you chair but you will have a smile on your face during this movie from Uncle Rico throwing a steak at Napoleon's head or Kip ( Napoleon's brother ) going \\"gangsta\\". This movie uses its free spirited design to bring the sometimes humilty and sometimes dullness of Napoleon's life to the viewer.Overall- I guess I can see how some people would be turned away by this movie. Try watching it at home with your family and see if you enjoy it better. You may find yourself laughing at the subtle hilarity of this movie and enjoying all the great qualities of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet!","review":"I must have been one of the last people to watch this quirky little charmer of a movie. It's got an off-beat sense of humour, while still capturing the essence of high school life's difficulties for the outsider geeks attending the school ND, the character, is just such a geek, and he lives in his small-town home, in a non-traditional family. During the course of the movie, he develops new friendships and a possible romantic interest, and grows enough to put himself out there, literally, for the sake of his new friend, when his friend is on the rocks. It's hard to beat loyalty like that. The off-beat humour comes from both ND's own personality quirks and sayings, and the events of the developing story. And sometimes things are just \\"out there\\".And there's always Tina the Llama to contemplate.So, check it out, you might be pleasantly surprised!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Napoleon rocks","review":"This film has given our family many hours of enertainment,mocking the characters lines and applying them to our own situations. The lines are classic. The deadpan,understated humor is so memorable and weird. If you have been to highschool, you will recognize yourself or others in this nondiscript circa of time. It's a family film which teens and parents can watch and enjoy together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun movie, but a little bit over-hyped...","review":"First for the actual review: for what it is, Napoleon Dynamite is a good movie. It's funny and offbeat, it's somewhat different, it has likeable characters, and it's a fun story about a bunch of high school losers that holds your interest and gives you some laughs.However... this movie is also overrated. I mean, you can't go anywhere without seeing a \\"Vote For Pedro\\" or \\"Gimme Your Tots\\" shirt, and almost everyone on facebook.com is in a Napoleon Dynamite group. I think people think a little TOO much of this movie. Like I said, it's a good movie, but wow... people, please...Despite this, I still give it a recommendation. Just don't expect Raging Bull."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new cult classic!","review":"Napoleon Dynamite at first watch, was one of the worst films I'd seen in awhile but after my teenager watched it over and over again and began using quotes in day to day life, I became a fan as well! It's soon to be a contemporary cult classic like Rocky Horror was in the 70's!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious at best, entertaining for sure","review":"This movie will make some laugh hysterically, others will find it mildly funny, but most who have the capacity to find the good in this far from perfect movie will at least be entertained.These characters, who are socially inept, attitudinally challenged, or mildly delusional, bring to light some of the less attractive qualities of our race. Yet there is much to like in these characters, even with all of their flaws.This movie speaks a lot of truth. I have known people in my life who resembled the people in the film. And the events that unfold are not all that strange. As far as the school election goes, I have seen a similar thing happen during my school days.Rent this movie. If you don't at least appreciate it, there might be a part of you that is under developed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid and no story","review":"if any buddie in the world likes this movie they must be insanethe dance in the movie is very weird and dum and uncle reco or how ever you spell his name is an idiot and it weird how he selles breast pots to get money and kip is an idiot and a girlie girl andhe talks weird.!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worsted Flippen' movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This movie is crap.

Well, we rented it, watched it and I was totally unimpressed. This has to be the lamest movie I have ever seen in my 41 years of living. It was as mind numbing as an episode of the Teletubbies.I laughed twice: when Napolean botches jumping the ramp with his bike and when Kip runs over the tupperware bowl. His dance at the very end was pretty good. Two songs used in the soundtrack: Cyndi Lauper's \\"Time After Time\\" and When In Rome's \\"The Promise\\" were the high points in the film for me.The rest of it left me wondering \\"what the...?\\". Very bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible movie","review":"This movie is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. It not comendy it stupidty.

Unfortuantly 1 star is the lowest rating I'm allowed to give this pile of crap. This movie doesn't even deserve one star, if there was a way i could post an animated gif of a steaming turd instead of the one star then I would.Like most people i saw this movie with a group of friends that kept telling me how great it was. I tried to enjoy the movie, I tried to watch with an open-mind, but all i got was 90 minutes of what can only be described as mental agony. I kept waiting for something to happen in the movie until I couldn't take it anymore, and I walked out of the theater.

Watch the best movie EVER White Chicks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vote for Pedro or else!","review":"This movie transcended all other movies in the history of modern film. It beat down \\"The Godfather\\" saga, slapped \\"Star Wars\\" in the face, and it stabbed \\"Titanic\\" in the eye.Pedro is the classic character of the outsider, and Napoleon, the tragic clown figure. As well as his love interest, who seeks to save Napoleon from the drab existence he is. Uncle Rico trapped in the past longing for another shot.In short, this movie touched the hearts of many, it certainly helped get over my days of heroin abuse"},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST movie of all time.....","review":"Giving this movie \\"1\\" star was difficult for me. Having never been moved enough to write an online review before, I was truly hoping you could give negative scores as ratings.

It doesn't take an academy award winning performace to make me enjoy a movie. But this movie was equal to me handing my 10 year old a camcorder and cutting him loose at home and school without edits!

Every character in this film reminded me of someone I knew in high school. This is what made it so funny to me, the fact that it was like seeing all these people I used to know again. Napoleon as a character was so complex and masterfully played, I really don't think they could have gotten a better actor for that part. With all the good things I have said about this film, I don't reccommend it to everyone.

I saw it and there were about 50 scenes that tried to make you laugh, and I only laughed at 3 (Napoleon get a steak thrown at his face; his uncle says \\"Get some pampers for you and your brother\\":the scene with Pedros cousins). Other than that, you might get a smirk at all the other scenes.If you truly love movies, don't watch this. If you truly like comedies, you might like this.

It is about a guys every day life but he has probloms like he still wears pampers or something likke that. I would have to say that the lizzie mcugire movie is like 10 times better and I hate that movie. At least that movie has a plot. They never get to the elections till about 75% of the movie is over. Then napolean does a stupid dance and the same with summer. the popular people are not like the girls in regular movies they never make fun of napolean. And the fact that it took 22 days to shoot was stupid. It should have taken much much shorte like 3 hours because it is about a geeky kids life so he shold be aloud to say whatever he wants. I wish I could rate it 0 stars but oh well. I probaly perfectky described the plot of the movie. If you like movies with no plot you should probaly get this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"over rated","review":"Everthing about this movie was bad.

That is until I saw this movie. Apparently, everyone giving this movie 4-5 stars are all wrong. To me, it seems people say this is a good movie b/c its the cool thing to say. I thought the mannerisms of Napoleon were annoying, and if he were in my school, I'd kick his @ss too. If you have poor taste in eclectic comedies, then this one is for you. However, if your looking for intelligent, offbeat comedy, I would highly suggest \\"Dead Man on Campus\\" and \\"Necessary Roughness\\" as two of the more popular films in the genre.P.S. The only vote for Pedro should be for Pedro Martinez, to the all star game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated to an extreme","review":"I thought that with everyone at school telling me how funny it is and quoting the dialogue non-stop that I was in for a real treat. Everyone said that this was the funniest movie ever and that you are crazy if you dont like it. Well, I am crazy I guess, because I absolutely HATE this movie with a deep passion. I saw this like seven months ago or so, and I am still trying to figure out what people see in this. There is absolutely no point, the characters are bland and boring, the so-called \\"jokes\\" sound like stuff a kindergardener would say, and it feels like some immature teen just filmed his day and then randomly edited his favorite scenes together. This is by far the most overrated piece of crap I have ever seen and I swear that if I hear one more person quote any line from this film, I will claim insanity and admit myself to a mental hospital just so I dont have to hear another quote ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Crap","review":"I hate this movie.

I hate this movie, I'm glad i didn't pay to see this crap. The only funny part of this entire movie was when they shot that thing right in front of the school bus.

I saw little semblance of a plot, very, very little comedy and bad acting all around. I didnt like this movie from the very beginning- the food on the plates being passed in and out. This makes no sense, i hate this movie and all those who \\"love\\" it who proabably want to cut out my eyeballs right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the worst I have seen...","review":"This movie came highly recommended to me. It was not the worst movie I have seen, and I did sit through the entire flick. However, Napoleon and his bunch were much too flat. If it was only Napoleon that was deadpan, then the quirkiness of the others may have worked. The uncle was the only interesting character. About the only nice thing I can say is that Napoleon put forth a fairly accurate portrayal of a student with Asperger syndrome that also has some serious emotional issues. He should have been picked on more at school for the film to be accurate. I may use a scene from this movie when presenting on Autistic Spectrum Disorder because Rain Man was so overrated. As one reviewer suggested to me, \\"This movie grows on you.\\" I doubt it, but only time will tell. If you want offbeat comedy, try Office Space instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"And this is supposed to be funny?","review":"So here we have it: one of the worst films of all time.

Come on, Bob Dylan's about 1,000,000 times funnier than whoever wrote the script for this album, and Dylan doesn't even write comedy for a living!Anyway, this is really really bad. There is no plot. And the jokes... \\"Bow to your sensei!\\" \\"Give me some of your tots!\\" \\"Vote for Pedro!\\" \\"Flippin' Sweet!\\" \\"Gosh!\\"...these are supposed to be funny? No. Definetly no. There is a reason why this got such bad review from the press, people! It's bad!And now kids are walking around with Napolean Dynamite t-shirts and quoting it at every possible opprotunity. What has the film industry become? Argh!If you want REAL funny stuff, go with the Simpsons, Monty Python & the Holy Grail, or classic Dylan albums. If you want mindless drivel, this is your outlet! Just don't say I didn't warn you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am baffled...","review":"People have told me that you have to see this movie twice to really like it and that you should see it with other people who like it. I've done both a few times and I still dislike this movie. It is dull, slow paced, and pointless. There are moments that are funny, but they aren't really funny, worth maybe a \\"ha\\", but no more than \\"haha\\", if that makes sense.

Also, everyone reccomended it. They said it was one of the funniest movies they've ever seen. Really??? Well my family rented it, and it started off weird. It's about this teen who is a geek. That's about it. There was no point to the movie. Everything was \\"Random.\\" Of course there were a few laughs, because the acting is funny.

There isn't much I could say that hasn't already been written by other reviewers, but coming from a guy who owns over 600 titles on DVD, I regret even watching someone else's copy. I am in an occupation that winds up seeing a substantial amount of movies, and am very disappointed to have painfully sat through this humorless, mindless epic. As for the podunk Idaho town that it represented, I'm sure the residents are now embarrased to have to admit that's where they're from - if not, maybe that would be a good place to start testing nuclear weapons.

I thought the plot was non-existant and very lacking in actual comedic substance. The characters were unique and pretty well made up, however they did nothing.

I detest this film and that's the only reason I'm taking the time to write a review; I feel that passionately about it. It's not clever and it's not funny.

The End (Plus, Napoleon always says \\"Freakin Idiot\\")This movie was a total waste of time. When I went to the movies to see it, the theater was about half full.

OK, he's a rebel geek, we get it. Bad hair, bad teeth, no dance moves. The other characters were also pretty much one-dimensional as well. The material might have been suited to a skit on SNL, not an entire movie. There were some funny parts in this movie like the steak to the head, the button throw, and the ill-fated ramp jump(hence the 2 star rating) but most of it was pretty boring.

The premise of Napoleon Dynamite is ancient, old, nothing new, and therefore I cannot recommend it in anyway whatsoever. EVERYTHING in the movie is a cliché that has been done before, and the lead is just annoying to watch. UNFUNNY!Here's a movie inn nutshell: Let's get some guy to dress up really funny and nerdy. Let him talk real dumb and slow \\"h e y m a n, w h a t ' s g o i n g o n m a n . \\" Then put him in ridiculous scenarios like some stupid dance routine and you think you have a funny movie.

Neither of these is a reason to waste your time watching the movie, much less be obsessed with this film. Watching a dog do it's business or watching paint dry is more fun.

It gets funnier the more you think about it. How can you not love lines like, 'You know I'm training to be a cage fighter' and 'Girls like guys with skills, nun chuck skills, computer hacking skills...'I disagree with others that say the only reason you'd laugh at this is because you feel superior to Napoleon.

There are many errors and mistakes that you can find if you go to moviemistakes.com. But, it is an independent film so you cannot expect a perfect movie. However, where the film lacks in plot it more than makes up for it with hilarious scenes one after another. I found myself laughing nearly every scene...i would recommend this movie especially if you are watching with friends, because everything is funnier while with your friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make yourself a dang quasadilla and WATCH THIS MOVIE!","review":"This is probably one of my favorite movies of all time!

Yes, I laughed a little bit, some scenes were very fun... but... the guy is so dumb that instead of laughing I was getting upset. I'm kind of dissapointed. Maybe I heard too many good comments about this film that I was expecting too much. My husband bought the DVD without watching it first based on the good reviews. We both watched it together and then we both regret the purchase, so if you are planing to buy this DVD without checking the movie first, I recommend you to rent it and then decide if you really want to buy it. I guess 'Napoleon Dynamite' is not a movie that everyone will enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW! That was really bad!","review":"I don't have a lot to add to what Joseph wrote below. He sums it up nicely. This movie is almost never funny, and it doesn't have anything else going for it.I honestly don't get what other people like about it. I've had movies recommended to me before that I didn't think were all that good, but at least I understood why they liked them. This one...a complete dud.The only thing I can figure is that lots of college students are watching this in groups while drinking heavily. Then maybe it would be funny. Maybe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like the most boring movie ever!","review":"Nothing happens in this movie. Nothing. All of the 'humor' involves characters stereotyped to the point of hyperbolic. It's marginally racist too. The Mexicans are thugs in a lowrider and the one black person is all 'ghetto booty' and is just there to teach the lame white boy how to be cool.\\"Duurrrrr your mom goes to college!\\"Thank God the constant quotation of this thing in the past.If you want 'loser' comedy then Beavis and Butthead is so much better. So is Daria."},{"rating":"2","title":"More fun than taking your Sledgehammer off a sweet jump!","review":"People either love or loath this movie. Personally, I loved it, but I can easily understand that it would not appeal to large numbers of people. If you enjoy quirky, offbeat movies like, A Mighty Wind, Best in Show, Crumb or Hairspray, I would think it likely that you'd appreciate this one. Of the fifteen people I have introduced to my new favorite movie, only one has not liked it; the other fourteen want to watch it again and again. Take a chance. If you don't like it, there is an excellent chance a friend would love to take it off your hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange","review":"Napoleon Dynamyite is just one of those movies that you see when you have nothing better to do. It has no plot and no suspense whatsoever. Basically a random assortment of bizarre scenes about a geek (Napoleon) and his life, it makes audiences laugh hysterically. But what is so funny about a movie with no purpose?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtly Intoxicating","review":"I read really bad reviews about this movie before watching it. Some said it was funny for the first ten minutes and then flat the rest of the time. This film was really hilarious. It was filled with little jewels. Lines that are very quotable and unforgettable. Uncle Rico is the classic loser uncle who thinks he is cool and his scamming with Kip is classic. Napoleon is someone that is indescribable. He is everybody from you high school and no body from your high school. I was worried the whole time that I might find out a little of myself in him. Buy this one right now it is going to be one of the classic films in you collection right next to Rad, North Shore, Big Lebowski, Better Off Dead, Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles, Etc. Nothing bad about this film even came into my mind. Remember Vote For Pedro!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet!","review":"Napoleon Dynamite. You'll either love it or hate it. Me? I loved it. To me it was just a sweet, funny movie about a nerd who really didn't care that he was nerd. After all, he had skills! I think many people will be able to relate to the nerds vs. the popular kids theme (I mean, didn't your school have a Summer Wheatley?) and Napoleon's sense of not really caring made this a real 'feel-good' movie. So many scenes reminded me of my school years--tetherball on the playground, slow dancing in the gym, tator tots in the cafeteria. Great lines too! I find myself saying \\"Yessssss\\" far too often now, but what a fun movie find! Make sure you listen to the commentary on the special features. Oh yeah, I let my eight year old son watch this and he loved it too. Definitely a safe movie for families to watch together...if you like that kind of humor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Pedro's cousin with all the \\"sweet\\" hook-ups","review":"Hillarious...We all knew a \\"Napoleon\\" during our high school years. Each character in this movie represents a character from my high school years. Napoleon, a \\"weird\\" kid that thinks his weak drawing skills are superb, is a blatant liar, and takes his belief in mythical characters seriously. Pedro, the overachieving underdog, regardless of the ethnic background, his not-so popular character always had enough \\"pelotas\\" to do things that he wasn't supposed to do (like asking the most popular girl to the school dance, and later running against her for school president). I can go on for hours describing each character and their resemblance to my own personal high school classmates. But if I will let this movie transport you to your high school years. See Uncle Rico? the time machine actually does work!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the coolest movies ever","review":"What's this? A comedy that is actually funny? Napoleon Dynamite is so well done and obviously on a shoestring budget... I can't get over it. It's chock full of genius joke vehicles and is immediately quotable. I especially like the timeless nature of it. It seems like it could be taking place anywhere from the 80's up until now. The time machine bits are absolutely priceless as well as almost every single thing that comes out of Napoleon's mouth."},{"rating":"2","title":"I secretly laughed at this moive.","review":"Shhhhhhhhh! Don't tell anyone but I found this moive so stupid I laughed so hard I cried. Gosh! I was a Friggin' IDIOT to resist seeing this film.

The main character, Napoleon Dynamite, becomes annoying 2/3's of the way into the film. Basing the movie around him becomes the film's major problem. John Heder does what he can with the character, but doesn't succeed much.However, the film does feature fascinating supporting characters. The best character is Pedro, who is one of the best low-key comedic characters I've ever seen. The actor does a commendable job. The rest of the cast is also fascinating, and makes the film bearable.The DVD also features extras that, like the film itself, only require one viewing. If you're interested in low-key comedies, then this film is for you. For the rest, \\"Spaceballs\\" and \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\" are funnier!Movie/DVD Grade: B-"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back in 82' I could throw a pigskin a quarter mile.","review":"O man I love this movie! I've watched it 14 times now and every time I can't stop laughing. There are two types of people in this world: those who love Napolean Dynamite and those who hate Napolean Dynamite.

It is not an everyday movie and that's what makes this comedy rock. The jokes are fresh and funny, the cast cannot be beaten, the only problem with this is the ending.

This is something for the whole family!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The plot is as retarded as the main character.","review":"I got caught in the hype of a movie that I saw no previews of. I see why. The movie is slow, and since people tell you it's a comedy you feel obligated to laugh at the dull humor. It's like I spent the whole time, sitting an anticipating a laugh I would never get. It was so rediculous I began laughing at things to stay awake. I rented it for $.99 and I regret it. I couldn't even finish the movie, which is something that rarely happens.

Napoleon is not so nerdy that he's funny. that is just another excuse for laughing at this lame movie because everyone else says it's funny. and for all you \\"intellectuals\\" who want to justify laughing at this show, don't give me that sh-- about all the subtle humor. there isn't any. don't try to argue, there just isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dynacrap","review":"I saw the 10 minute short film that this movie was based on and liked it a lot. I was ready to rush out and see it in the theater until the local paper said it was horrible. After that, EVERYONE who saw it told me it was HILARIOUS... damn those stuck-up newspaper movie reviewers. So rushed out and got the DVD, only to find out that this movie is just as stupid as the local paper made it out to be.This movie is basically a few funny halloween costumes stretched into a feature film. It is silly, but rarely if ever funny or clever. I like dumb comedies, but this one is down there with the likes of \\"Stuck on You\\".Go rent Beavis and Butthead, Sixteen Candles, Wayne's World, Rushmore... this movie is a pale shadow of those and others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I bought this movie without ever seeing it... BIG mistake. This movie sucks so very painfully. All the funny stuff you see in the previews are the only highlights you will see in the whole movie.

This movie wasted my $20 gift card and two hours of my life that I will never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star is being tame","review":"This was the dumbest hour and a half of my life.

When I watched the movie, I didn't even laugh. No, I don't have a bug up my ass, I just didn't find the movie that funny. I just don't get how some douchebag saying \\"You're such a flippin' idiot, gosh\\" in a low-strained voice is that hilarious. The disappointment of the movie not being so great was bad enough. Then everybody around school starting quoting the movie constantly, which got really annoying. Sorry folks, but it's not funny when other people quote movies, because it's not original. If you're trying to be outgoing or funny, make original jokes instead of quoting some movie.People have weird senses of humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"No pleasure in bully laughing","review":"I saw this movie becuase so many people said it was hysterical. Perhaps I just don't get their idea of funny. I do not think it is funny to laugh at someone so pathetic, it feels like bullying to me. I felt his pain, but mostly this move was like a train wreck, only one that I could look away from. I am forever grateful for my fast forward button. I got the jist of the movie without all the long tedious pathetic scenes.But the dancing at the end was funny. People could watch that.

It was a very boring movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Either you love it, or you hate it - there's no in between!","review":"I was totally impress when I saw Napoleon Dynamite, mostly because of the fact that it is a movie you can sit down and watch with your family and not be embarassed. No nudity, no foul language, nothing to have to explain to the kids - just good humor.When I brought Napoleon Dynamite home, my husband wasn't too sure about seeing it, and in fact, didn't want to watch, but we both laughed all the way through the film.Great story, great soundtrack, great actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"So funny --it'll hurt!","review":"I just had to get on here and write in my two cents on this hilarious movie. I am not exactly a teenager--but watching this made it all come back full-force--and I couldn't have laughed any harder. I love Napoleon because he is just so strange. Everything about him--he's weirder than most nerds--and the other characters are priceless--the puny older brother and the on-line babe he links up with; the llama in the backyard--the motorcycle grand ma-- I also loved the odd little extras (ie: \\"The Happy Hands Club\\"??) Jared Hess--you're a genius. Thank you for making me laugh--and yes--I will \\"vote for Pedro\\" ! I so recommend this hilarious movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE FUNNIEST MOVIE EVER IS HERE","review":"I love this movie. Doesn't everyone?

Jon Heder is perfect as Napoleon and his friends and family are priceless. Even the high school queen bees and jocks aren't all that mean.

So I caved in and watched with a few of my friends. I have to say that this movie didn't even come close to living up to my expectations. In my opinion there were maybe one or two funny bits in the movie, but that's it. And the part that I hated the most was that if you took the scenes that actually had something to do with the plot, this movie would have been about 15 minutes long. The main character was genuinely unlikable and painful to watch. If I had to see this movie again I would probably drop alot of acid first, then I might be able to enjoy it. MAYBE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hell No I Won't Recommend This Movie! Worst. Movie. Ever.","review":"Tries to be artsy and funny. Is neither.

Wait for the Team America movie to come out on DVD so you can spend your 20 bucks usefully and not blow it on a Beavis and Butthead rip-off that doesn't even compare to Beavis and Butthead's hilariousity. The Tigger Movie was more entertaining. If I could I would give this -10 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply one of the worst movies made","review":"My friends raved to me about a movie they had seen over the weekend, it was \\"hilarious\\", this movie was Napoleon Dynamite. I went to Amazon.com to check the sales rank and reviews to discover there were few bad reviews so I thought I would give it a shot. The next weekend I watched the movie with a friend we both sat quietly watching the plotless film. It looked as if it had potential in the beginning, so we waited and waited for the plot to develop, only to discover there wasn't one. There is a reason the character Napoleon Dynamite doesn't get recognized in every day life because they are compulsive liars to make their boring lives seem worthwhile. This movie is a complete waste of time and I have no idea why so many people have actually purchased it. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"the real napoleon was funnier","review":"yeah, all i really have to say about this movie is that it is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. i really wish i could give it 0 stars but that wasn't a possibility. i did not laugh the whole time. only people with sick senses of humor that think they are better than napoleon will even give a slight giggle at this piece of trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good movie","review":"Napoleon Dynamite is without doubt the dumbest movie I've seen this year. It has no plot, no climax, no story. After I saw it, I asked myself, \\"What was this movie about?\\" When you sit through an almost two hour movie and have no idea what it was about, then that might be your first clue that the movie sucks. I didn't laugh once during this movie. I don't think random jokes thrown into a movie are funny. Who cares about three losers in high school? Nothing happens to them! I don't understand the purpose of this movie, probably because it doesn't have one. If I haven't made myself clear yet, I'll summarize. This movie is stupid. Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite Possibly the Worst Movie Ever!","review":"I kept hearing great things about this movie from a coworker, so I decided to rent it and check it out. What a mistake this was. The movie has no plot, poor dialogue, made no sense at all, and had the worst soundtrack I have ever heard. Then again, what can you really expect from a movie from MTV. This was a huge waste of time and money, with which I could have purchased an empty box and been much more entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie was NOT set in the 1980's","review":"This is more of a nitpick than anything. I've seen a number of people saying that this movie was set in the 80s. It wasn't, so therefore I find nothing credible about the reviews written by these people (who obviously weren't paying attention). For one thing, the internet as we know it now did not exist in the 80s... for another Uncle Rico would have been in his early 20s rather than mid to late 30s...Ah well, I guess the people who have this misperception hated it so much that they failed to pay attention. The setting for the movie is in fact a contemporary one set in small town America... and folks from larger cities may indeed feel that they've stepped back into the 80s visiting some of these towns.Enough about that... I liked the movie. No, it's not the \\"best movie ever\\" or even my favorite comedy, but it wasn't as bad as some are saying either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been shorter","review":"This movie really should have just been one of those short movies you see at film fests which are twenty to thirty minutes long. There were a few funny lines here and there and I even chuckle when I think back on some of them (i.e. Kid on Bus-Napolean what are you gonna do today; Napolean- Whatever I feel like I wanna do. Gosh!). However, after forty-five minutes or so the movie just seemed to drag. Like others that have written reviews, I profess to liking offbeat, otherwise dull character driven movies. Nevertheless, I watched the last part of the movie while unloading the dryer. Note-If you too do this make sure not to miss the final dance scene. That is worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than My Mother The Car!","review":"The problem here is that the audience this movie is aimed at doesn't have the life experience--or the attention span--to get it. And anyone old enough to get it probably won't see it. You might as well show Two Lane Blacktop to people who came to see Two Fast, Two Furious.Still, with a bit of judicious editing, N.D. could have been tailored to the right audience. Napoleon comes home and, tired of being picked on, heads for dad's gun cabinet.Locked 'n loaded, its back to school for some serious detention. Before going down in a hail of bullets Napoleon whacks most of the football team, narrowly missing a cheerleader in a low cut, tight-fitting top and a teacher, in a low cut, tight-fitting top.Soundtrack by Fear Factory; direction by Oliver Stone (who lays down some nonsense about it being a serious commentary on the state of American society). This could be HUGE.Then again, I found it pretty funny just the way it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flippin sweet.....","review":"Honestly...the first time I watched this I didn't laugh too much. However, I gave it another chance and I'm glad I did. I knew that it wasn't supposed to appeal to everyones sense of humor when I watched it the first time, and was more disappointed in myself than in the movie for not appreciating it more.Do yourself a favor, if you dont get it the first time slip in the dvd one more time and watch it again...the more you watch it the funnier it gets....oh and vote for Pedro :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Movie of All Time!!","review":"This is by far the best movie I have ever seen!!

I'm sure that the \\"human condition\\" story of Sad Sack Napoleon will be of interest to some, but not to many.

I don't.I saw it with a group of people who were already into it, Pedro t-shirts and everything. I was all setup to enjoy it, but nothing. I may have chuckled twice. There were a few funny bits, but for the most part I didn't laugh at the places apparently I was supposed to.The odd thing is that . . . neither were they! I've seen \\"Holy Grail\\" (for example) about a thousand times, and I still bust a gut. Don't you laugh when Marty Feldman sticks his head out the door in \\"Young Frankenstein\\" and says . . . \\"Blucher!\\". Yet, this Pedro crowd couldn't even muster a titter at the tater tots scene, or much else for that matter. They just kind of mechanically ticked off the bits for me, as if I was suppose to understand how great they were.This is a film that seems to have been deliberately made to be a cult film, and manufactured pop culture doesn't work in the long run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"After many students have inquired, I decided to watch Napoleon Dynamite.I must say, I found this movie to be rather pointless. I didn't necessarily find it stupid, but I didn't like it.Many of my students liked it, but I think it is because they were laughing at Napoleon because he was, what we commonly call, a loser. I just kind of found it sad that Napoleon was so picked on. I have become increasingly sensitive to that in my old age.I just see a lot of kids like Napoleon, I think most of us have been Napoleon, and it is sad. Maybe that's the point? That we shouldn't pick on people. I just wish students would get that too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Napolean Dynamite is Flippin Awesome","review":"Best comedy of 2004! This will be a cult classic!

I hate, hate, hate hipper-than-thou indie films, and I thought this was one. I was very wrong. I laughed out loud from beginning to end.The movie works because you like Napoleon just enough to root for him, but not so much that you feel badly for him. He's a nerd, sure, but he's also kind of a jerk. He hits like 3 people in the movie and never gets hit himself. He's not a pathetic character, though you expect him to be, given typical movie stereotypes. The understated performances are just perfect, and the little details make the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Casting Masterpiece","review":"Every character in this movie is flawlessly cast, and relatively unknown. The acting is superb, and the storyline is very funny. If you like smart ironic humor, you will love this movie. If you're neither smart nor ironic, you'll probably miss the point.Anyone from a rural background went to school with these people. It is like reliving your teenage hood.I couldn't help but notice how the reviews alternate from five stars to one star with hardly any middle ground.

From the first line of this \\"comedy,\\" I knew it was going to be bad. I had heard some great things, so naturally I had to see it. What a disappointment. I found my self smiling twice, and laughing only once, and that was a completely banal scene where Napoleon's attempt at a bike jump results in the ramp crumbling uder him and him crashing. Point is, it had nothing to do with the story, and could have been in any film.The only saving grace, and in my opinion the only scene worth watching, was the climax, which sees Napoleon defying his nerdiness to put on a great dance routine.I didn't expect much going in; after all, it's an MTV movie. But I have to say: given the choice, I'd watch Beavis and Butthead 10 times out of 10 before Napoleon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love it or hate it relationship....","review":"The movie is basically about a geeky kid and his friends trying to just get by in High School. The movie is surrounded by idiocy and is nothing more. The problem with \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" is it's characters are too over-the-top in the geek department which makes it useless in my opinion. You can't sympathize with these characters because they aren't realistic like many people say you can with these characters. So you're left with characters stumbling through school acting like morons and nothing else. If you're into it then you'll love it and if you're not then oh well. If you want a good form of entertainment filmed in the style of \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" with better dialogue and characters then watch \\"The Office\\"(It's a british comedy series out on DVD) but other than that...

He enjoysvery rich life without obsessing with material things.He loves drawing illustrations, and he value friendship.Just a little thing makes him happy or sad. Just a little thing makes his day.This movie isn't for everyone.If your life is too simple, it's not movie for you.If you are obsessed with material things, it's not movie for you neither.If your life is fairly complicated and feel something is missing, this might be a movie for you.Lastly, I have a friend just like Napoleon, and he rocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"This Film Doesn't Even Deserve A Rating\\"","review":"The following words describe how STUPID this film really is...1.

Even a stupid movie like \\"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure\\" could have some redeeming qualities, or a rediculous movie like \\"Airplane!\\" could provide laughs. But \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" has no value whatsoever except to trick some confused people into thinking that it has some value. In any case, I am convinced that the creators of this garbage knew exactly what they were doing. There is a scene where Napolean is watching his uncle's home movie of his uncle posing with a football. Napolean laments watching it and calls it the worst movie ever made.

She was cracking up the entire time, while the 4 of us were sitting there slightly chuckling once in a while, but mainly glaring at her for making us waste an hour and a half of our time and the money for the ticket. After we saw it though, we started randomly quoting the movie to the point where we did it so much that we wanted to see it again. The second time around it was definitely a lot more funny. I guess this is the kind of movie that slowly grows on you if you don't love it at first. Now all of us love the movie, have a copy of it, and still quote it.

People say this is a rip off of Wes Anderson...it is similar in style to the Wes Anderson movies but the biggest difference is it's funny.

I would agree that this film is comical, but it is comical for the wrong reasons.The main reason that it is funny is because it is so uneventful.

I am a huge fan of indie films and find them much more entertaining than the big blockbuster dramas and crappy comedies with juvenile humour in them, but this one just plain--excuse the blunt word--sucked. The main character will make you want to kill him in the most gruesome of ways because he is not only a complete and utter loser, but he is also a complete jerk who is negative all the time. It was truly painful to watch this film because I was getting depressed at how stupid this character could be. The uncle sounds like a pedophile at all times, and the mexican kid (though orignal idea) sounds like he's drugged up on way too many sedatives.

It stars Jon Heder, as Napoleon, the main character. He's a weird character, and for some reason people find him and his jokes funny. Here's the level of humor we're dealing with here: \\"You're a fat lard.\\" (You're supposed to laugh at that.) And, get this, Napoelon plays dodgeball with himself. Again, this isn't funny, it just kinda weird.

(Both films are MST3k fodder; I am referring to the non-MST treated originals - obviously, the MST treatment turns these into comedy classics and invalidates this comparison.)Basically, this movie is about as far from Three O'clock High (possibly the best down/out teen nerd comedy in this vein - i.e, dry as opposed to the superb Better Off Dead's more wacky approach) as one can get.Avoid this movie.

Napoleon's brother uses a computer which looks like an original Apple, yet he is chatting with babes on the Internet. That scene and many others like it are par for the course here.Yeah, I realize this film is absurb and I realize it asks you to suspend reality.

Couple of funny parts sprinkled in to a story that seemed to have been made up as they went along. To be honest with you I think I laughed at parts that weren't meant to be laughed at.I was pretty let down with this movie after all the hype.

I missed out on it in theaters, but saw it on a field trip bus with my dad. After being seated in seperate sections, our consensus when we stepped off of the bus was, \\"that was funny?\\" My parents have raised me on Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, Airplane!, Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid, and Zorro the Gay Blade. That is our sense of humor, and Napoleon Dynamite just didn't appeal to us. I cringe when I see \\"Vote for Pedro\\" shirts and special editions of this cult DVD. I form instant prejudices against anyone who claims to have enjoyed it, so heavily does sense of humor factor into my opinions of people. I know this seems wrong, but oh well. To those of you who didn't enjoy it, thank goodness there's some sainity left in the world.

I bought the DVD on New Year's Eve, and we've watched it four times in eleven days. My five-year-old laughs as much as my husband and I.

Such a dorky 32 year old, \\"Don't be jealous because I've been chatting with babes all day, Napoleon.\\" I was about doubled over during the \\"glamour shots\\" by Deb. And the climax, the \\"skit\\" at the elections is classic. It's just one of our favorites.

A lot of the humor can be subtle and sophisticated (which takes the movie beyond most of the under-13 crowd), but it is a well made film and pushes a lot of buttons as far as high school memories (especially if you were a nerd).One aspect of the movie largely unmentioned is the excellent soundtrack, particularly the \\"Music for a Found Harmonium\\" by the Penguin Cafe Orchestra which is heard after Napoleon's dance sequence.

Huge fan. However, the designers of this cheese slicer clearly don't understand the forces applied to the wire during cheese cutting.

Stay away from this product unless you plan to treat it as disposable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wheel broke but before that I loved it.","review":"I really liked this product before the wheel broke.

So, this seemed like the perfect solution...a slicer with replaceable wires! Notsomuch. In theory it's a great idea; however, in reality it doesn't work so well. Placement of the wire is easy as is adjustment of the tensioner; however, I find that the wire is constantly slipping off of the top of the slicer thereby rendering it useless. I have tried putting it back on and tightening it, but it still keeps slipping off. There are little grooves in the top that the wire is supposed to sit in, but they don't seem to do their job very well. Guess I'm going to have to go back to getting a new cheese slicer every few years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wire adjuster stripped itself out in a month","review":"I bought this product hoping the extra wires would save me money.Unfortunately the tension adjuster and wire ends are both plastic and the tensioner's threads stripped out in a month making the cheese slicer and the wires completely useless.Maybe the cheese I like to slice is too hard (Tillamook medium cheddar) but I expected this slicer to last at least a year on its replacement wires, not a month."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great for 6 months, then died.","review":"The little black thing that tightens the wire is plastic and just broke off for no apparent reason so the wire just falls off.

It's so sturdy, so easy to grip, & it takes only a very little practice to learn how to control the thickness of the slices. (Hint: Instead of trying to slice off the end of the cheese, slice across the top.)I hope the extra wires won't be required any time soon, but they were included so they're here if needed.The price is definitely good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine while it lasted, but broke after one month!","review":"As Mr. Zimmerman's review noted, the tensioning mechanism for this slicer consists of a plastic wheel which engages slots cut into a plastic block attached to the end of the wire. Turn the wheel, which moves the block, which tightens the wire (at least in theory). BUT the plastic wheel and block are the weak links. In my case the plastic wheel disintegrated after one month of use. ONE MONTH. While it lasted, my wife liked the heft of the slicer and its wide grip, but now it's shot.... piece of junk....This is an inferior product, designed to fail. Oxo should be ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your $$ on this piece.","review":"This is a terrible product, which in theory should be great. However, the mechanism to tension the stainless wire doesn't work at all. The first time you slice a chunk of harder cheese, say, sharp cheddar the threaded tensioner pops and let's the wire go completely loose and actually almost sliced my hand the last time I tried to use it. I sent an email to OXO about the design flaw, and to their credit they have now sent me two more of the new chromey version of the slicer. Nice try, but the new one still does the same thing. On the bright side I was able to use one of the extra wires to fix my girlfriend's antique Presto cheese slicer, and now it works great!

Sure hope OXO comes up with a better wheel because I'll be the first in line."},{"rating":"1","title":"plastic nut breaks","review":"The plastic nut on my original slicer stripped out within a few months. I emailed Oxo and they sent me a new one. My husband took one look at it and said \\" the cheap plastic nut on this one is already broken\\". It had a visible crack in it. He had me fish the old slicer out of the trash, then replaced the plastic nut with a 7mm x1 (1 thread per mm) steel nut and washer (.23 + .11 = $.44). He had to slim down an 11mm open end wrench to tighten it up. He also deepened the groove the wire runs through down to the tightening nut so the wire doesn't slip out. It's no longer dishwasher safe but at least it works. We wonder if anyone at Oxo actually uses this product. The wire tightening mechanism is a great idea, poorly executed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apparently a common flaw","review":"We have had this slicer about a year and the adjustment wheel just broke on ours, too.

Such a disappointment, as I've loved other Oxo products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst cheese slicer ever","review":"I say that because it is not adjustable. Even though they say you can adjust it by positioning your wrist, I don't find that to be true. The slices are waaaay too thick. Also, if you try to cut a hard cheese without letting it soften at room temp you end up having to use a lot of pressure which slams your hand down and pinches your fingers if you're not careful. I hate this slicer. Don't buy it - just don't do it unless you like ultra-fat cheese slices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting design but badly flawed","review":"Oxo generally makes great products, but every so often they come up with a dud. This is one of the duds. The problem is in the tensioning mechanism, which consists of a spiral gear that engages a toothed track molded into the end of the slicing wire. Turning the spiral gear with your thumb moves the track and tightens the wire. Unfortunately, the gear is made from plastic and is prone to break. When the first slicer we bought broke I thought it might be a fluke, given Oxo's good reputation. Now that the second one has broken in the same way, I'm concluding that it's a bad design. If Oxo ever replaces the plastic thumbwheel with a metal one this product might be great, but until that time I'd stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumb Tightening Wheel Stripped","review":"We've had this product for a couple of years. I went to tighten the wire using the thumb wheel and it kept slipping in the wheel. Thought it must be the wire, so went and got a new wire and tried to tighten the new one. Nope.

Don't see an option to replace the wheel, so out in the trash it goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"good slicer poor quality","review":"I have purchased two of these slicers. Each lasted about a month. In both cases the adjusting wheel broke off. After the first one broke, I contacted Oxo. They told me to ship them the defective slicer for replacement. Not worth the effort and expense for an inexpensive item. My husband convinced me to buy a second one with the idea that we still had the extra wires and the slicer really worked very well, maybe we just got a faulty product. $26.00 and 2 cheese slicers later I am willing to admit this is a lemon and the search for a decent slicer continues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting design but badly flawed - I second that!","review":"See \\"Interesting design but badly flawed\\" review. I had the exact same experience of having not one but two of these items plastic tension wheals break after limited use.

Unfortunately, Cook seems capable of writing only one kind of book--a story told in flashbacks. His books never proceed in a linear fashion. Read one or two of his books and you've basically read them all.It's a shame that Cook doesn't deviate from his flashback formula because he is truly an excellent writer.In addition to the formulaic plot device, *Places in the Dark* also suffers from cardboard characters whose motives and lives are never fully examined."},{"rating":"1","title":"the same old thing from Cook","review":"Cook's last four or five books have been entirely alike. \\"Places in the Dark\\" is the same pseudo-poetic bilge he's been shelling out all during the 1990s.

The descriptions of \\"dense\\" from other reviewers is a lesson in a culture of boredom that sweeps modernity to the core. In a subject that needs to be articulated so well to affectively challenge the entire foundation of domestication/civilization, you best be prepared to read and absorb so the same rudimentary, arrogant ideologies don't keep appearing time after time, even into levels of academia.Chapters like \\"Hounding Nature: The Nightmares of Domestication\\" cut straight through the bone on our exclusive love for dogs and horses as \\"man's best friend\\".Easily one of the most important philosophers for the future of humanity, who was way \\"ahead\\" and \\"behind\\" his time."},{"rating":"2","title":"To understand animals is to understand yourself","review":"Paul Shepard's book, The Others: how animals made us human, is a thoughtful analysis of how animals played a role in determining who and what we are as human animals. As in discussions of religion and politics, you will not agree with everything Professor Shepard writes. However, you will agree that he has developed a credible case that you cannot understand people, whether 10,000 years ago or today, without a better understanding of how Homo erectus and Homo sapiens interacted with both food and predatory animals 100,000 or 1,000,000 years ago.

So he's happy, I'm happy!!! :^)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, if it worked!","review":"I think guitar hero is a great game. I think it is interactive and gets the player out of his or her seat. I think it enhances a person's hand-eye coordination. I also believe guitar hero is a great group game, much like the Wii is. Guitar Hero is good for any age group. And Guitar Hero III especially has some GREAT songs and artists. I give this game 5 stars, but this package and it's wireless guitar are terrible.

However, I was very let down by the controller which was the reason why I had to send the product back twice and ultimately decided that the game is what I really wanted. No time for messing around with a controller that doesn't work really well or at all.I was really let down that the description doesn't match the product (the guitar is not a Les Paul replica, it's a Kramer); and they really dropped the ball on perfecting it before it was shipped to stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best GH out of the 4 ever made","review":"This has got to be the best Guitar Hero out of the 4 ever made.

The whammy bar does not work at all! Everything else is fine. I'm reading about how the 360 is having problems with their guitars too, sounds like poor manufacturing. My only other problem is the Devil Went Down to Georgia. Why cant I just play the song? I beat the game on Medium, and just want to play the song. Not battle the devil, just play the song! Am I missing something here? Why do they put a song in the game that you cant JUST PLAY? Hopefully I can get my guitar replace with out too much hassle, 'cause it is the sweetest *Official* guitar they make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely innapropriate for children","review":"Call me a stick in the mud.... or call me person with values... but Guitar Hero III has completely unnecessary sexual innuendoes throughout it and is anything BUT appropriate for children. From the nearly naked women dancing provocatively on stage, to the neon-light replica of a pole dancer, the makers of the game are obviously trying to appeal to both kids AND adults. Version I & II were top-sellers... there was no reason to introduce sexual material.I'm 26 and my husband and I both love the game... until the \\"dancers\\" are on stage. It irritates us BOTH. What a horrible way to ruin a great game. If I DID have children, we would play Guitar Hero II only. Guitar Hero III would never be allowed in my home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone","review":"I am not an avid gamer, but my family and I love the Kanomi Karoke series and have played them out. So in hopes of finding a new family game we bought into the Guitar Hero series. Hearing so much hype I figured buying into the third edition would be just as easy to catch on too and I would get the others later,but start with an all in one deal here.I have yet to catch on and I am so frustrated trying to learn to play that I dread when my husband wants to play. I will say, I have seen guys catch on much faster (very much a hand-eye cordination game). My husband enjoys the game, but all the same,it really does not hold his attention- I was hoping it would be good family fun, fun with friends during our hang out nights when instead its more like Jr high...boys in one corner girls in another. Not for my age group I guess (25-35)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Having to return because it did not work","review":"This is a fun game (so my son says). He had played it at a friends house.

I purchased mine in 2006 and we are still going strong. I agree with the reviewer who says you must carefully follow instructions. It seemed a little daunting at first, so I went through the instruction manual and tabbed the sections that I use the most. I plug in my Yamaha keyboard and lay down the accompaniment track, then add other instrumentation on the other tracks. I love having eight tracks because I can then add all of the harmonies I want using my own voice. Very easy transfer into Master mix mode then onto the cd. I've even plugged in two mics and used it to record one of my student concerts. You couldn't ask for a better home/classroom recording studio in a box."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointed","review":"this unit did not come in protective packaging,... it was missing a button and the mastering light to a very important feature did not work,.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tascam DP-01","review":"I started 42 years ago recording.

I've read lots of books on home recording starting with Craig Anderton Home Recording. The Tascam DP-01 Instruction manual does not translate well. Yea, there is a big learning curve on digital recording when you are coming from analog.But, If Tascam wants anymore of my money they need to put out step by step manuals with lots of pictures or at least get me for another 49.95 for a how to DVD .

It's nothing like the dub or the original version. And the Serena in this book just doesn't seem like the Serena or Usagi(original version) you would see on the anime show. I just couldn't really imagine her liking things like Backstreet boys or saying, \\"Oh my God!\\" a lot. She's not like the Serena(Usagi) I have always known. Plus, there are parts that just go on forever and parts that just weren't in the show. In my opinion, I just don't think these books are really that great.~Kometsu-chan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sailor Moon novel #7","review":"I remember really loving these novels back in the 90s (that is the reason I bought it).

Now about the book. This book is about the episodes where Sailor Moon and Tuxedo Mask are stuck in an elevator-the episode where Neflite dies. The problem with this book is that the author tries to cram too many adjectives into the sentences. She makes Usagi a total airhead, and half the stuff she puts in the book did NOT exist in 1992, when Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon came out! The book seems really fake, especially if you read the manga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Braiding Book for Long Hair","review":"This large spiral bound book is filled with wonderful full page color photos and beautiful ink drawings of the different styles covered in the instructions.Instructions are clearly set forth - and there are many different levels of proficiency.A real treasure - I even learned a few new techniques to try on my 46 inch hair.

It was so good, that we decided that we had to have it!Since I already have a basic understanding of how to braid I was able to follow the directions without difficulty.

I was sorely disappointed. Benecke spends much of his time on popular culture, philosophical musings, and general health tips like vitamins and the effect of alcohol on heart disease.He does not cover the advances of the last 10 years in genetically engineering animals to live much much longer than the norm, using caloric restriction to extend life, the success of synthetic anti-oxidants in extending the lives of nematodes and fruit flies, or any other current scientific topic in anti-aging medicine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating book on life and death","review":"In this book Mark Benecke takes you on an interesting journey through ancient and modern societies' views of death and the constant and often weird ways people have of trying to achieve immortality. Cryogenics, DNA preservation, head freezing as well as vampires and space travel are all covered. Benecke is a genial, skeptical guide to all this. You will learn a lot about why death exists and what biology and medicine and technology can do to prolong it. A book suitable for any popular science reader. Does not require much knowledge of biology. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"I ate a bunny....","review":"This is possibly one of the worst movies ever done. Where to begin with all it's flaws? There are movies that are so poor they are fun and entertaining right down from the dialogue to the acting, then there's the films, like this one, that's a total bomb.The acting is very poor. The main character, Isabelle, is fairly good, but the rest over act. Especially the father.There is no character developement. Just suddenly, here is my character, and here in my secret. And eveyone one in this film has a dirty secret.The writing is very poor. Characters suddenly switch actions in mid sentence. There are logical mistakes galore. At onle point, the demon knocks out the phone line when the priest is calling the bishop. He says to the mother that the phone is dead, he will have to go into town to speak to the bishop, he will call her with the details of the meeting. OK>..if the phone is dead...how?

It turned out that I really didn't like this movie at all. The story was presented in such a bad way that it was very unbelievable. A ranch hand being an ex-priest, the other ranch hand always carring a gun to get his way, the father being an overly jealous husband and father, the non-emotional mother of Isabelle and finally a farm vet that is acting as a medical doctor of the possessed Isabelle. The acting was very poor except for Jacob the ranch hand and for Isabelle the main actress. I understand that the movie was based on a true story, and with respect to the people that were orginally involved, don't waste your money on renting it or purchasing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Linda Blair Has Nothing To Worry About!","review":"Talk about bad acting, bad editting, weak lines, and an ending that left me scratching my head, this movie can make the devil take a break from his evil and he would roll over laughing! If Linda Blair or anyone from The Exorcism of Emily Rose sees this movie, chances are they might demand to get that 90 minutes of their life back. Someone did not carefully stereotype the acting roles and script lines. They never showed what really happened to sheriff as he was attacked and few other scenes where left incomplete. I enjoy watching the behind-the-scenes footage that comes on most DVDs and even that was poorly done. In many segments I could hear the people because they played the background music too loud. I rented this DVD for $2 and that was a little too steep for a movie of this type."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEVILISHLY INEPT","review":"This lowbudget ripoff of EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE fails on many counts: it's acting is mediocre, with even the usually reliable Cameron Daddo not up to snuff; the effects are minimal and shoddy; the pacing is slow, and it just doesn't have enough real scares.

The statistical conclusions are conjuncture and do not support the authors' statements. Her methodology in interviewing a small cross section of the upper middle class, and elite do not constitute a major move toward orthodoxy in America. Twenty believers leaving Campus Crusade does not mean one iota; I don't think that is a significant number that supports her premise.Loyola Press should be ashamed for publishing this book! Oh, but it gives credence to the supposition that people are breaking down the doors of the Catholic Church to become members."},{"rating":"2","title":"It has changed my life","review":"Colleen Carroll has done a remarkable job documenting the current trend toward deep religious commitment by Gen X and older Gen Y. What the author does so well is bring these stories together, written with a sensitivity and understanding that does justice to the individuals lifted up. She then also includes plenty of statistics and analysis to provide inspiration and hope that the Holy Spirit really is working here in America to bring our generation back to Him.My own faith has deepened because of this book. Reading these inspiring stories of young people laying down their lives for Christ, has given me hope when the secular culture tells me that truth is relative and salvation is not needed. I hope you all will be inspired by this great book as I have been. God bless."},{"rating":"1","title":"so-so........where's Raven?","review":"This cd was okay. Personally, the movie was good, the cd for the movie was good but that's it!

She was the star and some dummy cut her out of the group. Raven has a great voice, by the way.Cheetah-licious is not a word but if some loser saw that cd cover and didn't see the movie, he'd think they were being sexual. I think the \\"Cheetah-girls\\" is a baby group name. If the girls picked out a grown up name like \\" The pussycat dolls\\" I HATE THAT GROUP!!! those girls are dirty hoes.anyway, the cd would've been better if it had more style. it was too disney and too \\"ooooh\\" if they grew up, they'd be in. by the way, add Raven back to the group.But seriously, who is that crazy white girl?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is 3LW trying to comeback with a little kids group?","review":"Why is 3LW trying to comeback when they was'nt that good when they were \\"three little women\\".

He is an amazing martial artist, and is probably the best at playing the young budding fighter. In this great movie he plays a young man caught up in the middle of a gang war. The begger Gang, and the bright moon gang. One after another beggers are being slain, and no one knows why untill the killers are found out. After studying for years under the guidance of his blinded uncle, he learns the Butterfly fist , and also the pebble style. Great practice sessions, good lengthy fights, and another drunken master.

Boy, was I wrong. This game is a mess - incredibly buggy, the graphics are a little better than BMG but not by much, and it lacks the stately, thoughful pace of previous games that allowed the player to immerse himself (or herself) in the Battlecruiser universe.Please, save your money. If you want to play a game where the concept worked much better, buy a copy of Battlecruiser Millennium Gold. It's a bit dated, but thoroughly enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aweful!

Good or bad, I pretty much just played until I got bored and figured I had my money's worth.All of that changed with Universal Combat.To put it simply, the game is absolutely AWFUL! Everything that has been written about it - the lack of stability, the graphics straight out of the 1980's, the incredibly complex interface, the myriad array of choices that really don't impact the gameplay in the slightest - are all true. This game truly is a piece of garbage.The only good thing I can say about this game - and I am stretching here - is that the box art is cool.I can't even sell the game to someone else... I'd feel too guilty about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Universal Combat","review":"This game would be great if it had a tutorial on it and a manual that actually told you how to play it, the maker has a good vision but he alone only knows how to play the game.Do not buy this game and you'll be very happy and still have $20 in your wallet."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give 0 stars, I would","review":"Other reviewers have done a fine job of hashing out this title's many bad points so rather than restate the obvious I will just confirm (again) that this title is worthless. I have a very high tollerance for mediocrity in games and can usually find SOMEthing to like about even the most abyssmal title; this game is an exception. I still own pretty much every game I've ever bought, and I have never taken one back because I didn't like it, no matter how bad it was. Once again, this game is the exception.Do not buy this game, for any price. Unless perhaps you can find it for 99 cents in a few years on some dusty little shelf in the back of some store, it might make a nice coaster. Though even for 99 cents, you can probably find something better to spend your money on. If I had to be stranded on a desert island with this game and a computer, I would sooner rig a pulley to drop the monitor on my face than have to play it.Horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"They don't get much worse","review":"I bought this game, hoping that it would provide me with something fun to do whenever I had free time. Yes, the prospect of engaging enemies in major battles for control of numerous spaceports and bases on 4 different theatres of combat appealed to me. So, between this and spending $39.95 on Joint Operations, I chose this.What was I thinking?This game freezes often, and I can't even find the \\"Quit\\" option. Apparently, the developers wanted to make it a puzzle just trying to figure out how to move your ship or fire your guns. You can't do anything in this game, it crashes, freezes, you can't control it, and in the campaign you dont even know what to do. The best part is that you can't even save or load or go to an options screen. This waste of a CD should be taken out of every store in the world. Trust me, I enjoy all sorts of games from Hearts of Iron to Raven Shield to Battlefield 1942 and Starfleet Command III - DO NOT BUY THIS GAME OR ANY OTHER GAME MADE BY DEREK SMART."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Drumsticks!","review":"I'm a huge fan of these sticks. The Vater Fatback 3As are very durable, and I've had pairs last months. I sometimes use electrical tape on the bottom halves to save my hands a little, but it's not necessary and often the sticks feel better plain. They pack a punch, and every time I hit a drum I feel the power of the sticks. They're not so bulky that I can't do fast fills around the set, yet they're still strong sticks. If you play frequently and are a very hard-hitting drummer that still likes to have some mobility on the set, as I tend to be, these are a great pair of sticks. Work great in concert band for snare drum as well. I'd highly recommend them, they're worth your money for how long they'll last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor nonstick","review":"Design of this pot is excellent but the nonstick comes off easily(very soft).

I have been using it to make smoothies for my boyfriend and myself. I have also been using it to make healthy, homemade baby food for my 7 month old baby boy. He enjoys homemade food much more than the likes of Gerber and Beechnut jarred food. It's great because I know exactly what's going into his food: fruit or veggies and some water. I've been making batches of food and freezing it in ice cube trays then transferring to freezer bags and it keeps for months! It's great! Since this is a review, I should say that the blender is very easy to use, it only has 4 buttons and a speed dial. The recipe book has some great stuff in it as well. It lists what speeds are good for which foods. Clean up is super easy, just blend soapy water and rinse or stick it in the dishwasher! There is also space in the blender base to store the power cord. On top of all that, it's a very attractive kitchen appliance! Kickass![...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small!","review":"The selection of colors is great and much more reasonable then buying a three-piece crib set, however, I was disappointed in how small this really is!

For Sacks, each element seems like a complicated and fascinating, automaton toy.His family history, treated almost as an afterthought, is intriguing as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"Typical Sacks fare is an engaging exploration of his scientific interests and some fascinating tangents. That Oliver Sacks is(apparently) a very interesting man helps a lot, too. Like most of us though, Oliver Sacks was not a very interesting child. While \\"Uncle Tungsten\\" has some very good science writing, it is really nothing more than the story of a socialy inept boy who went rather too far with his chemistry set. Again, like most of us, his family was strange. If you haven't picked up \\"The Isle of the Colorblind\\" or \\"The Man who mistook his wife for a hat\\", get them instead. If you're a hard-core Sacks fan, pick this one up at the library first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the hardest kind of book to write","review":"I loved some of the science in Sack's book but the autobiographical part was embarrassing at points.It seemed to me that it's very hard to write this type of book with out sounding like you are bosting of your intelligence. One of the few book's that did pull it off for me, where an intelligent boy tells of his growing up, was Bryce Courtenay The Power of One. In chapter 21 Sacks tells of reading Eve Curie's biography of her mother and how it impressed him. He says \\"it was no dry recital of a life's achievements, but full of evocative, poignant images\\" I only wish this book could have been that way for me. I guess I wanted a book that got to my heart like 'Power of One'this book never came close."},{"rating":"1","title":"frustrating book","review":"I can usually like a book if I try hard enough, but this one won't even meet you halfway. Descriptions of colors, textures, properties of elements. Descriptions of the containers elements are often kept in.

My educational background is in English and Philosohpy. So I cannot pass judgement on the science, a lot of which was above me (or, should I say, a foggy memory from confused high school days). In any event, what struck me about this book is the passion Mr. Sacks demonstrates for the subject act hand--whether that subject be mixing chemicals together or recalling one of his many aunts and uncles or his immediate family. One rarely encounters prose writers whose passion for their family and their work is so infectious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous read.","review":"What a gem this little book is!

It is filled with literary personal and social connections, the stories behind the stories one has never heard in traditional science classes, and makes the awesome lives of pioneers of science come alive through the eyes of a sometimes lonely and abused adolescent boy, filled with wonder and allowed the freedom to explore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful!","review":"This is the most delightful book I have read in ages. The reader is carried along by the sheer joy of discovery - the \\"pleasure of finding things out\\".Although in small glimpses, Sacks' family form the important backdrop, but the main part of the book is about chemistry and, more importantly, the young Sacks' love of chemistry.I wish I had read this book back when I was studying chemistry.

I thought this would be a good idea until I placed her in the bassinet part. The first night when I placed her on her back she ended up on her side and belly with NO effort! she was all over the place due to the swaying and poor placement/attachment of the bassinet pad. ** I would not recommened the use of the bassinet part to someone with a newborn or small infant for it could be dangerous. I think it just needs to be designed better."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this","review":"This portable crib is unsafe. DO NOT BUY IT. It could cause a stragulation risk. Mine will not stay snapped in place and the sides fall down making a v shape that a pulling up or standing baby could get caught in. When I notified Evenflo the answer was we haven't heard of it doing that, it must be the way you are setting it up, but several people have tried it and it's not us. The other suggestion I got was to throw it away and get a new one. No more evenflo products for me! I am boycotting them from now on. This is a serious safety issue that they are ignoring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad you can't give 0 stars...","review":"We bought 2 of these playards for our twin daughters. We ended up taking both of them back because 1. It is incredibly too difficult to assemble as a \\"portable\\" playard. It takes at least 10 minutes to unfold, insert the bassinet, snap everything together, etc. - 2. The bottom latch would not stay down, causing what I consider a safety hazard for an older baby who has learned to move around by him/herself. We thought it was just a problem on the one playard we assembled, so we tried the second one, and sure enough had the same problem. No one could get that bottom leg to stay down (the support in the bottom center of the playard.) We thouroughly read the directions, and neither me, my husband, or my mother could get either of them to stay put! - 3. The bassinet sways way too much for my liking and the center tends to bow, causing the baby to roll toward the middle.I normally have no problems with Evenflo's products, but this was just a bad buy for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not care for this pack n play","review":"My daughter liked to play in it but it is incrediably difficult to put up you really have to pull hard to get the sides to lock once they are up there is no problem if you were going to leave this up I would highly recomend it but I bought it to travel and I really do not like it I am winded once if finlly get the thing up"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product and safety hazard","review":"We've used the Evenflo play yard twice and after the third usage, the bottom no longer locks in place. This poses a potentially dangerous situation where the system could fold up onto the baby. To make it worse, the company only offers a 90-day return policy, which is after they usually break.

Even with the \\"directions\\" in the walkthrough given, you'll end up in the wrong place. You'd have better luck stumbling around a dungeon at random than trying to rely on the information this guide provides. To add insult to injury, more than half of the information in the beastiary is wrong.I really can't recommend this guide at all. Only get it if you simply must have everything Xenogears.

But it's in my cd player all the time. The lyrics are kinda shwazy at times, but i mix music, so that part of it i enjoy a whole lot. The Tsunami Brothers are just Bobby B and Loc spinning and such, everyone else is a guest on the album, so you should listen to the beats and the lyrics are just a condiment, and i dont really think theyre all that bad. Pakelika's voice was not really meant to rap, but the more i listen to that track i even like it. Anyway, its not as long as some Suburban Noize joints, and it wont have everyone singing along like some KMK flows, but its definitely a must have if you know what you're tryin to listen to. And again, the main attraction is the spinning and scratching, and because of that it's a lot more orchestral than mainstream hip-hop. If you produce yourself, you'll enjoy, no doubt.

Upon seeing it, though, I found it was not what I was expecting.The photography is quite beautiful, but much of the film is of landscapes or ancient monuments having the sunlight change as it moves in the sky. Pretty, but it doesn't show me the world from a time perspective that seems unusual or foreign. The scenes of people and cities were much more fascinating, I thought (although my favorite scene is of the tide rushing in around the French monastery). You can see the pulse of a city or the frenetic motion of people that you simply can't discern at normal speed.This is probably a great movie in its original IMAX format, where the pretty scenery and cockpit-eye-view of navigating canyons would be very impressive, but on the small screen, it was not as engaging as I had hoped."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD is a disgrace to IMAX!","review":"IMAX is the final word when it comes to image quality - so maybe I was expecting too much when I bought this DVD.It just looks awful on my 9 ft screen.

With this hindsight perspective it was hard not to be comparative. In some ways i have the impression that Chronos was a study for Baraka; and it would make sense if all of Ron Fricke's work were cumulative. However, i found Chronos to be a powerful film in its own right, with its focus on time and its acceleration in the modern technologically-driven life. The cinematography is a heightened visual voyage: absolutely gorgeous, wondrous, expansive, at times inspiring and at other times devastating. The integration of the soundtrack and images is seemless and potent. Fricke's skills were taken to new heights with Baraka, but i find this to be an excellent film of itself, certainly worth having in one's collection for multiple trips!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I love this Imax original...but this Blu-ray disk is not up to par!","review":"I LOVE this movie....love it...but after watching it for 5 minutes, I realized that the transfer is just crap!

Most of my SD DVD's look better...and this is Blu-ray! HD! Honestly...it's crap. If you want to see another film by this legendary director, get the Blu-ray of Baraka...the transfer to Blu-ray is the best out there....BY FAR!! I highly recommend it.

King's early work -- I listen toit all the time. Don't be fooled by this CD: these are not theoriginal recordings they purport to be. In the late 60s, King's old label, Modern Records, wanted to cash in on his newfound popularity. They decided to reissue his early recordings, but they apparently thought that the sound quality was lacking. They overdubbed new bass, drum and horn parts onto them -- destroying the original character of the recordings, and making them all sound the same. This CD is a reissue of THAT release -- NOT of the originals. For a fantastic CD of the original, unadulterated cuts, get \\"B.B. King: His First Two Original Albums on One CD\\" on the Flair label.

It looks like it was drawn with pastel-coloured pencils, and it doesnt speak to me.I've eventually ordered a reproduction of the Minchiate Fiorentine - it's one of 2000 reproductions and I use it with reverance (for fear of ruining it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I love the Ancient Minchiate of Etruria deck by Lo Scarabeo, but unfortunately it's out of print, and any copies available are very expensive. I decided to settle for this deck, and unfortunately, I'm pretty disappointed in it. The artwork reminds me of pastel line drawings and I suppose art is subjective, but I don't care for it.The accompanying book is large and extensive with lots of research and history about the cards, while the actual divinatory meanings are usually left to one or two sentences. As if those few sentences weren't flimsy enough, the reverse meanings have also been completely left out. The author notes that he's leaving the reverse meanings up to you to figure out.If you're buying this tarot set because you're interested in the history of the minchiate, well, you wont be disappointed. But if you're buying it because you want to actually use the deck, there's much to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pagans, don't bother.","review":"He worked hard, he did the research - and I don't care for it. The deck looks like it was done with Bic Bananas, and he's completely changed the Fool from the true fool he is on the old Minchiate decks, to what Barney would look like if he didn't wear a dinosaur suit. I already had the Lo Scarabeo Minchiate deck, and wanted to learn more. This book offers very little in the way of fresh, usable knowledge. The card interpretations have a fluffy, self-help-paperback tone to them. This is the Tarot equivalent of Ralph Blum's Book of Runes - which a lot of people liked, but many of us find to be too Christianised, too fluffy, just not very \\"occult\\".

The \\"vibrations\\" and \\"heat\\" are a joke. I put very warm water in it and it was cold within minutes and the vibration did nothing to massage my feet.

The water cools so quickly because of the wussy aeration from the jets & bubbles. If you removed the removable rollers on the bottom, you are stuck with the very poky and sharp roller holders that make it so you can't even put your feet down without pain. If you have anything like a normal foot, above a size 7 or so, you won't have enough room to even use the rollers. The attachments are lame and unusable due to the position on the machine you place them. The loofahs kind of grossed me out, because after a few uses, they are gonna get nasty (just like a loofah in the shower does)and then what are ya' gonna do with that part of the machine? Save your pennies and buy a large dishpan, it will stay warmer longer and won't poke the bottom of your feet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely useless","review":"They have a lot of nerve, selling this as a unit with heat.

As mentioned by other reviewers, it does not warm water at all. You have to add the warm water. While the product claims to keep said warm water warm for a while, it will get cold within 5 minutes. Honestly, I think the machine cools the water. There are no moving parts, so to use all the attachments you have to move your foot over them. Another problem I've found is the particularly low maximum water level which leaves half my foot out of the foot bath. Even when you don't exceed the max water level line, a lot of the water is thrown out when using the bubbles function. As was also mentioned by other reviewers, the water jets are practically useless. The water is thrown at your ankles and I wouldn't use \\"jet\\" as a way to describe it... it is more like a water stream.

It holds water (does not heat it) and vibrates. I recommend just buying a bucket, filling it with warm water, and then humming your favorite song very loud to create some sort of vibration throughout your body. Nothing on this moves or massages.

To be truthful, some of the illustrations are so poorly drawn that you cannot really make out what they are. The text is easy to read and the topics covered numerous. I would use this book with caution, however, checking Williams' interpretations against other, more recent sources. For the record, I am giving this book a two because the only other reviewer to write about it gave it a five and that is far too high for it. I think this should yield an average of three, which is about right for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"just too many howlers","review":"Well, what do you expect from a scholar who doesn't even understand German?

I really had to stop reading this piece of trash when the author asserted that the song \\"The End\\" was good until ruined by Paul's lyric \\"and in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make\\".

I'd give this Zero Stars if it was possible. This worthless tome spews all sorts of fantasy that seems to have been made up as it was written.

The purported \\"secrets\\" mentioned in the publisher's blurb seem to have no basis in fact either, so please find a more worthwhile book if you have any interest in the Beatles' music. A good place to find solid information is Mark Lewisohn's \\"The Beatles: Recording Sessions,\\" which are the Abbey Road studio notes taken by listening to the actual recording session tapes!

The movie was an hour and a half, but it ended before it began-the woman was still there after everything was over. Maybe they wanted to make it interesting-she waited for revenge-but it was just dull. It made me feel as though they just didn't have enough running time after they killed off everyone.

From casting himself in the role of \\"Doc\\" to putting his own son in a large supporting role, sans shirt for a majority of the running time, Pierce misfires on almost every level. The flashback stories almost brought back the flavor of the original Boggy Creek (the outhouse scene alone is a hoot), but then he offsets that with the hilarious \\"mad dog!\\" scene. By the time Old Man Crenshaw shows up, the wheels totally fly off this shaky cart and promptly bursts into flames!

I also like the last track \\"Butterfly\\", which is a short love song, and one that I've put on many mixed-tapes. Though I think Lenny could do it, I think this one will be hard for him to top."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crying for Lisa Bonet","review":"This is a really good album, however, it is kind of funny to hear Lenny whine from song to song about Lisa Bonet. I would rate his \\"Let Love Rule\\" album a little bit higher than this one. There is less sappy stuff on that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack of all trades, master of plenty","review":"Lenny Kravitz's unique talent lies in his natural ability to marry the sounds of the 1960s with those of today. A trained voice and an ability to write songs and play drums, guitar, bass guitar, sitar and the keyboards also helps.By resisting the temptations of rap, house and hip-hop, the former choir and opera singer has become a sanctuary for those listeners jaded with the sounds of many of his contemporaries.The Beatles' influence throughout the album is unmistakable and there are the occasional brushes with 1960s psychadelia.Kravitz has opted against an over-produced sound and kept it nice, simple and sometimes quiet. He peppers it however, with the odd harsh word and some punchy guitar work with the help of Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash.Mama Said is another indication that Kravitz has carved himself a roomy niche from which we will be hearing him for some time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Healer's Way: soothing music for those in pain, Vol. I The Healer's Way: soothing music for those in pain, Vol. I","review":"Beautiful music.

I was tempted to start a count of how many criminal laws the ex cop turned investigator broke but gave up.

There a few deep chuckles in the first quarter of the book, but the book is not a comedy; it is a quick narrative of his life. It was a \\"Cliff Notes\\" version of a full autobiography. Given the title, I expected to hear more about his father and the 700 Sundays he spent with him. Instead you get a glimpse of his numerous relatives and his life with them.Unlike other reviewers, I felt that I needed to hear Billy telling the story himself. The book misses his on stage delivery.It isn't a long book to read or an expensive investment. If you want to know some interesting details about Billy Crystal's life (like the fact that he saw his first movie sitting on Billy Holiday's lap), then buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Get It, He's A Jew!!!","review":"That's not supposed to be anti-Semitic by the way.... I absolutely hated this book. I bought it thinking it would make me laugh, unfortunately only one part made me laugh (punching a guy in the balls during a basketball game - good stuff) other then that it was a pretty boring book in my opinion. While some of the stories were neat, a lot of it just got plain annoying. There seemed to be too many parts where Crystal tried to throw in some random stand-up material that had nothing to do with anything.As far as the \\"I get it, he's a Jew\\" statement I had above... I've got no problem with Billy Crystal, and I've got no problem that he's Jewish but dear God does he need to mention it on every page!? That was almost as annoying as the random tangents!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what a waste of time!","review":"Amazon offers a funny 2 minute 34 second movie clip about this book. The firsttwo minutes are funny, but have NOTHING to do with what is actually in the book,so don't be misled. The humor in the book is paper-thin, unless you like storiesabout farting, seeing his obese grandmother naked, and an uncle whose skimpyboxer shorts could not conceal his testicles. Before I bought the book, I was sadthat I had missed seeing the show in New York and that the San Francisco roadshow is already sold out. Now I am glad that I only wasted $20 on the book,instead of $100 each on two tickets for this wildly over-rated exercise. BillyCrystal admits he is amazed at the success of his show - and I share his amaze-ment. Without the sight and sound of him performing, the words lie flatand liveless in this painfully meager little book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Service","review":"This arrived way a head of predicted time. It looks great. I am giving this to my husband for Christmas. I will not be the one reading this but know he will like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth Reading","review":"This was purchased as a gift for my parents. They thoroughly enjoyed it. My mother is a big Red Sox fan and since she adores Billy Crystal he was given a pass for being a Yankees fan. ;) That being said she enjoyed the baseball discussions. My folks live rurally, as such the insights on city living were very interesting. If you like Billy Crystal you really should read this. I'm pleased as it was a great gift and I can't wait to borrow it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Loved This Book!!!!","review":"Billy Crystal had me in stiches. He is a wonderful storyteller and writer. I bought four additional copies of this book after I finished mine, to pass out to friends. This is a definite must read for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Billy's Family Album","review":"For a book written by a Hollywood vet, this book barely touches Tinseltown. Billy Crystal looks back at his youth through rose-colored glasses, and offers us a glimpse at his roots and how he grew to become a comedian. The stories are like those your family tells at Thanksgiving, full of warmth and humor. This isn't an in-depth biography, but it does provide an entertaining couple of hours of reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"How can you NOT love this book?","review":"I have read this book three times, and every time I cry, laugh and smile. It is so well written I am now sure I grew up with Billy Crystal. Read this book! You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"700 Sundays","review":"This is a delightful book. Billy Crystal's description of his family and the people that shaped his childhood is an easy read and quite funny. This is one of those rare books that is hard to put down. If you like Billy as a comedian you will love this book. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost In Translation","review":"Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to see the Broadway presentation of '700 Sundays'. Based on the book version, I can imagine that as a one man show, starring the extremely talented Billy Crystal, this was both a funny and sad, heart tugging and poignant performance. However, only some of these elements come through in the text version, particularly Billy's warm memories of his mom and dad. Although I enjoyed the book very much, reading it makes me even more mad at myself for not seeing the play. For example, there were only a few times I found myself laughing.What must have been hilarious in the theater with an audience reacting to Billy's stories, enhanced by his humorous mannerisms, gift for mimicry and overall 'schtick' for the most part doesn't come through in the book. Still and all, '700 Sundays' is an entertaining and oftentimes moving memoir."},{"rating":"2","title":"700 Sundays","review":"Loved Billy Crystal's book! I read it long a ago and decided to have it for Book Club. It is, of course, cleverly written, uniquely descriptive of his family life, funny, sad, and thought provoking.

I haven't tried the fork, but it seems like it would be able to spear or pierce soft foods (cooked veggies like potato, pumpkin, etc) but I don't know about harder foods like a veggie with a membrane or meat. The handles are curved and seem to be a good shape for little hands, and don't seem flimsy.

He smoothly moves between presenting a visionary's alternate worldview and its consequences, then meticulously focusing in on a character's interior landscape. Quite an art!In decades of reading fiction, I don't recall another male author who seemed so adept at describing female emotions, or detailing the feminine response to an intimate encounter.

She has also chosen the most important elements in design to cover. It's amazing to me how many high level designers break basic rules without thinking.

However, I agree with the challenge presented in the book that as Americans we spend way too much time watching televsion and that we should spend at least one week television free. I have known for some time that much of television is a void. However, even I was challenged by some of the observations the book makes. The only negative comment is that the book is rather short and does not expand upon some of the issues it raises. Of course, that is why it is a guidebook.

I don't find it added to my understanding of Underworld.3) There are tons of typos in this book.It basically reads like some college student's senior thesis that they turned in without even proofreading.

A lot of the reviewers of this products had much older dogs & seemed to have great results so I went with this product.Unfortunately I'm not impressed. The product took forever to come & didn't come in the stated time frame. I've been giving it faithfully twice a day (this is the start of the 4th wk) & no improvement with his limping. He doesn't care for the taste one bit so I literally have to give it to him w/a syringe (which is a small price to pay if it improved or stopped the limping).

The majority of the text is written in the form of quick diary notes commenting on some particular topic of the day. Next day's notes might concern a completely unrelated issue. Then there could be an inexplicable gap of a few days with no entries in the diary at all. There is no sense of continuity of events. The book does not present even one map - how one can discuss military operations without maps is a mystery to me. On top of all that, the editor has done a terrible job too. The introductory essay as well as the subsequent chapters is riddled with grammatical mistakes, making the book even more unbearable.Unfortunately, none of the above becomes immediately apparent upon quick look at the book, which is beautifully bound, has great paper and exquisite selection of fonts.Mind you, I am not suggesting that Fedor von Bock himself is not a fascinating commander - he may very well be, but there is no way of telling from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative","review":"You often read about von Bock with the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941.

Charlie, the German Shepard mutt on the front cover, is my favorite type of character: a wise-cracking, money-loving guy on the outside with a big heart inside. His pal Itchy is everything you can hope for in a sidekick. While I agree this movie is not \\"Cinderella\\", I first saw it at age six and it did absolutely nothing to upset me. This movie is about hope.

ADGTH wasn't my favorite animated film when I was young, but I did find it enjoyable and filled with meaning. Animation isn't top-notch, but it's still visually interesting. The characters were all lovable (except, of course, the vilains); I didn't even mind Anne-Marie the little girl at all. The violence and adult situations are not clearly obvious, but little kids will probably be horrified at some of the images put on screen. As one reviewer mentioned before, this isn't really for young children, so every parent is warned. The one problem I had with ADGTH was the songs. They weren't very memorable and spectacular, and sometimes it felt like they just came out of nowhere. But beside that, this is still a very good animated film from Don Bluth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased :)","review":"I was very happy with my purchase!

Although I didn't appreciate the extremely dark tone of the movie at the time, I certainly do now. Keep that in mind: this is not your typical children's movie. The lead character is gunned down in the first segment of the film, for instance.The assault on Don Bluth's wondrous work continues with this DVD, which is totally devoid of the extras it deserves (widescreen and commentary, to name a few).

While the animation is quite dazzling, the images it displays are so negative, it's a wonder this is a kid's movie. The movie contains gambling, murder, death, smoking, and a truly upsetting nightmare sequence. When I wasn't cringing, I was bored. I had seen a website for the late child actress Judith Barsi (who voiced Anne Marie), and I learned what had happened to her shortly before this movie was released.

When I read about golf, I try to balance my reading on books on instruction with books about peoples's lives at it relates to golf. I read most of this book, thinking that the premise was decent, and the appearance of the book was quite 'new' (I read it in March 2002). I have probably read 25 to 30 golf-related books and this is one of the worst. I feel there is no depth to the stories about the book. I feel like it's just some person who is trying to make a quick buck. It really left me dissatisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"A non-golfer's perspective","review":"As a non-golfer whose father was a serious golfer, I have watched my share of tournaments and have more than a passing knowledge of the game. Although I never took to golf, I thoughly enjoyed this book! The descriptions of the courses and holes were great. Any American who is thinking of taking a golf trip to Scotland should read it to see if they have the temperament for links golf. While in many ways Darren is a \\"typical\\" American and the references to Harvard are many, he managed to learn to enjoy the game without worrying about his score, end his club breaking temper tantrums and I think is a nicer person than he would have been had he not made the trip. A delightful read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful, accurate, and quite readable","review":"This is an approach to golf books that I would really like to see more of. The author has a very keen perception and attention to detail when it comes to describing the best that Scottish golf has to offer, but so have many others that have come before him. The wonderful part about this book is that Kilfara also opens up a part of his soul so that the reader can try to relate to or understand him as a person while he describes this journey. Many times have I read a book about sports and wondered about personal details of the author that determine his perception of what he is desacribing. Kilfara lets us in to a part of his psyche and should be roundly applauded for it. Anyone that did not enjoy this book I believe does not like, understand or appreciate golf or is plainly jealous of the wonderful courses the author has been able to play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"From the beginning I thought that book sounded pretentious. After reading some of the great travel golf books such as the Dewsweepers and Final Rounds, this book just cannot compare.

I bought it to take up time on a plane trip from the West Coast and I was sorry that I did not just watch the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Stuff.

I have become somewhat obsessed with reading about golf in Scotland and most of the non-fiction reads like a listing-guide to the courses in Scotland.If you are interested in reading first hand accounts of people playing/living in Scotland, I'd also recommend \\"Two Years in St. Andrews\\" by George Peper and \\"Playing Through\\" (I forget the writers name) - but the book is about Gullane and the courses in and around East Lothian, Scotland....Enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"I read it twice","review":"This was recommended to me by a friend as a \\"great story.\\" And yes, the story's fine as far as stories go, but that's not why I read fiction. I actually look for the (gasp) writing itself.The pleasant surprise was what a wordsmith this guy is. The sentences flow seamlessly, and his use of figurative language is masterful. A freezer \\"opens like a spoiled February\\" and his definition of war as \\"murder with a work permit\\" is the best I've heard yet. And I won't even give away the beautifully crafted first sentence and first page, a wonderfully wry description of a morning in suburbia.A joy to read, and I hope to see more from this author in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical desert racing documentary","review":"I suppose this was a great movie back in the 20th century when it was made.

It does not heat, it does not massage, and it most certainly not relaxing, given the headache you'll receive from the drone of the motor. Despite it being as loud as a vacuum cleaner, it has none of the power and propulsion force you'd expect with all that noise. The jet is very weak and I could barely feel it. About all it's good for is making water sputter around and using up electricity. The \\"massaging\\" comes from you rubbing your feet over the raised surfaces, not that there's much room to wiggle since the motor takes up the entire middle. Emptying it is also clumsy because it doesn't have a spout or angled mouth.This thing is absolutely worthless. I rarely give 1 star reviews, but this product is not even deserving of that much.

I think it's a ripoff because the box says \\"with heat\\" but there is no heat, and gives you the impression that the center attachments actually work.

The unit works and everything, it just is not what I was looking for. The massage element is almost non existent, though there are plenty of bubbles. The insert says that the heating element part does not heat up cool water, but maintain the warmth of already heated water, which is false. Because of the aerated bubbles, the water went cold very quickly. It comes with three attachments that you are supposed to affix to the middle portion of the unit, one for arches, one for soft massage and something else, but the post where you connect the attachment does not vibrate for the massage at all.

The bubbles do feel good, but that is the only good thing I can say about this product. The water gets cold quickly, even though the description claims this product keeps the water heated. Worst of all, it is not relaxing because the noise is like a vacuum cleaner. I even tried putting in earphones while using it, and I still couldn't drown out the noise. I still use it occasionally, but I get more relief from using a cooling foot lotion than using this foot bath."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks are deceiving","review":"A plastic dish tub would work as well. The heater does not maintain the heat any longer than not having a heater at all--about three minutes. The max fill line is so shallow your ankles freeze. The bubbles could be recreated using a turkey baster and squeezing the empty bulb into the water--there isn't enough action to serve any therapeutic purpose. The massage feature is, as commented before, a choice between one of three hard knobs that do nothing.

If you have read all the Heralds of Valdemar series, and are looking for that depth and quality,I think you will be as disapointed as I was. The depth of characters and storyline is just not here. Girl has healing powers, heals forest creatures and faery, enter a magical horselike being, father dies, enter bad-guy and suprise arranged marriage, saved by man of her dreams, with suprise ending similar to a Hans Cristian Anderson tale.This should have been a short story. The cute little book with borders and embelishment,takes up just enough space to stretch it into a hardback.

While Rush Rush was beautifully sung, I can't say the same for the rest of the album.Something is not working here. It could be poor song choices and plenty of fillers. The other problem is the music arrangements which kind of showcases Paula's vocal weaknesses. Sometimes, she comes across as flat and sharp as on the track Spellbound.The CD left me feeling all queasy, kind of like when you drink oil with water. Oh dear."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment...once you've read this review, you'll know","review":"Basically, I don't think the dance music here is very genius nor does it do her justice very much, \\"Vibeology\\" sounds like something you'd hear at an adults-only club, but \\"Promise of a New Day\\" hits home.

Forget what the critics say. Buy this one! The songs are great! Non-stop dancing, especially with the back to back \\"Vibeology\\" and \\"U\\", penned by Prince himself.I even got my boyfriend into her after I had him listen to this CD and bought it for hm.

You can't help but to let the songs on \\"Spellbound\\" catch your ear, pump your blood and make you move & groove. Great production goes into the #1 smash hits \\"Rush Rush\\" (a sweeping, soaring pop ballad) and \\"The Promise Of A New Day\\". But there's more to this CD than the inevitable hit singles. \\"U\\" shows that Paula has definately matured as a singer and performer. \\"My Foolish Heart\\" is pure 90's pop fluff, but it's instantly catchy. I also liked the title track and \\"To You.\\" You can tell how much Paula puts her heart into singing. \\"Will You Marry Me?\\" is an amazing ballad, with harmonica recordings by Stevie Wonder himself! I was surprised. A sure winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paula's Best Effort","review":"Paula Abdul was attacked by critics because of her corny bubble-gum pop. But on her second album, she attempts to expand her musical horizons, and the girl succeeds. Many songs here are daring (\\"U\\" is a moody track written by Prince), imaginative (\\"Vibeology\\" will make you get up and dance) and just plain beautiful (the ballad \\"Rush Rush\\" and the upbeat \\"To You\\"). My personal fav is \\"The Promise Of A New Day.\\" If you like pop/soul, pick this one up. If you can get past her limited vocal range, you'll find this a worthy purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author needs a remedial writing course","review":"This is probably the worst written book I have ever read.

For me all the book had to offer was one interesting concept. Even the \\"horror\\" was B- movie contrived. Less forgivable, her science is newspaper article thin.

Gerritsen is the master of the medical thriller, and this time, the scene is out of this world. Once again, she gives us an excellent plot with a few great twists; politics and intrigue, in a unique environment and under extraordinary conditions. A Gerritsen winner"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and Quick","review":"I needed a book to read over the past fall and I had a read a couple of Tess Gerritsen books previously and I thought I would give this one a shot. I have a fasination with space travel and NASA, so I thought I would enjoy a mix of a murder mystery and the space travel. I was right. There was a perfect mix of the two. Gerritsen was able to be very technical about everything (don't worry if you don't have the background in the terms, there is a glossary in the back to help) yet she still able to put in a back love story to it. I really enjoyed this book. It was a quick and easy read and would suggest it to the regular mystery reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"This book was given to me by my mother-in-law and I didn't know what to expect.

Dr. Emma Watson is on the International Space Station doing scientific experiments when something goes terribly wrong. One of the crew is afflicted with stomach pains, vomiting and blood-red eyes. Soon, he's dead and his body seems to be liquifying before their very eyes. NASA is being told they have to abandon their astronauts; they have no clue what is happening to their crew members, so they can't allow it to come here and kill more people. But Jack McCallum, Emma's soon-to-be ex-husband, is back on earth trying to figure out what has gone wrong - and how to save Emma and the rest of the crew from dying from this strange disease that has somehow made it onto the space station.

I do wish that authors would stop portraying people who work for the government as ignorant, arrogant and incompetant -- some are, but not all! From the time the spacecraft lifted off, it was one disaster after another and frankly, I was delighted when our heroine, left alone to fend for herself, came down with the dreaded whatever.

It had an eerie feeling to it. Definitely highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"GERRITSEN IS A MASTER OF MEDICAL THRILLERS","review":"While the subject topic, space travel, is not on the top of my list, I was immediately engrossed by the lastest book by this gifted author. I have only read one other of Gerritsen's books, Bloodstream, and this one is just as good. She doesn't seem to disappoint her readers. She does an enormous amount of research with each book and it shows. I had no idea how much money companies are willing to pay to get their experiments included on these space shuttles. Unfortunately in this book, it is an experiment gone bad. This work is replete with a rescue mission, payload experiments, scary viruses and even a love story. If you like medical thrillers, add this one to your list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Tess' first few medical thrillers, but I lost enthusiasm for this book about halfway through. It was too predictable. There were entire scenes which could have been tossed out, like having both the USAMRIID people AND the heroes discover that the creature's DNA includes strands from three species. And the \\"required\\" Hollywood scene of the hero losing patience with the Army guy and attacking him, making the Army guy cave. At times I felt I was reading a screenplay for another hackneyed alien-invader story. And this is one had a premise I was very excited about reading, too. Less jargon (all right already, you did your research--yawn) and more emphasis on characterization so I CARED what happened to these people would have greatly improved this read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great cover masks mediocre book","review":"I love science and modern medicine thrillers (as opposed to science fiction) and anticipated something rather special with this book: something well written, intelligent and original. Sadly, I was disappointed. GRAVITY has some good detail and a plot that basically works, but the writing was surprisingly flat and unintelligent. Above all, I felt the story lacked a clever or original premise - which for me is the main thing. Good new ideas are obviously in very short supply. But what a cover!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where will she go from here?","review":"Tess Gerritsen just tells better stories with each book. This one is the topper so far.

I filled them with strawberries sweetened with splenda, and bananas. Then fat free whipped cream and more straberries and banans. I drizzeled with a little chocolate syrup for looks.

At under/at $10 it's priced well. The pan is very good for crepes. I had never used a crepe pan before and the edges are made for easy flipping and cleaning. I still find it helps to coat pan with a thin layer of butter/oil and when the crepe is almost done, I loosen the crepe from the pan with flexible spatula. If you like your crepes rather thin, you do need to swirl the pan to spread out the batter.My boyfriend likes making pancakes in this pan, as they come out a nice size and he finds it easy to flip. I prefer making pancakes in a larger (fry) pan where I have more 'room' to flip (without hitting the side of the pan). The texture of the pan coating makes the pancakes taste a bit spongy, to my taste. But the texture is much less noticeable with crepes.All in all a good little pan and a good purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the originals!","review":"This dvd is an excellent introduction to the new animated series.

These guys combine to make this album an above average hair-metal release. \\"Tainted Angel\\" boasts some pretty solid hard rock tunes. \\"Boys Night Out\\", \\"Georgia Lights\\", \\"Tainted Angel\\", \\"Love Ain't Enough\\", \\"Love For Sale\\", and \\"Shoot Me Down\\" are all first-rate tracks. The rest of the album isn't bad either, but it's not particularly memorable either.I recommend this to anyone who likes late 80's/early 90's hard rock.

Why couldn't we have gotten footage of Richard Manuel singing \\"Tears of Rage\\" instead of those other two? Anyway, their performances here are great, vocally shaky, but they were beginning to hit their stride. At least we have a live \\"I Shall Be Released\\" with Richard, and a ROCKING \\"Slippin' and Slidin'\\".

The story line could be intersting, however, the errors keep the reader back- tracking to get the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good but..","review":"Since finding Gillan best albums is almost impossible (Mr. Universe and GLORY ROAD, mainly.

Also, in CD 1, for example, there are two shows, qwith exactly the same songs.

I found it on Amazon and am so very very glad! I trust they can continue to supply this product and tell the manufacturer that there are those of us that want to use it all the time. I am allergic to silver, and aluminum so this is a great product for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinky Product","review":"Being an avid Howard Stern fan, I tend to listen to him when it comes to products that he likes. He was searching for a deoderant that didn't contain aluminum because there are studies that link aluminum to certain cancers. He came upon Nature's Gate and was so happy that he found an aluminum free deoderant since he is very health concious. I decided to also try this product. Shortly after purchasing and using it I realized that it had no staying power for body odor. My job doesn't entail any physical labor but by the time I would get home from work I noticed that unwanted aroma wafting from my arm pits. I immediately stopped using it because I want to smell like a female, not a physical laborer. Shortly after I stopped using it, Howard starting mentioning on air that he was smelling 'a whiff' with this product and he has since stopped using it. So, this product MAY be safer to use health wise but stink-wise it doesn't cut the mustard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scent great but side effect","review":"I love Nature's Gate products, especially their shampoos and face wash so I figured I would give their Lemongrass and Clary Sage deodorant a try since the last natural deodorant I found without aluminum actually had Triclosan in it. The scent was great but it lost its effectiveness about halfway through my work day (mostly computer desk work). Unfortunately the second day I decided to use a fair amount more given that it was not as strong as normal deodorants. After working out I found that my underarms were very swollen, red, and irritated. Apparently I must be allergic to something in the deodorant. Possibly its the sage i'm allergic to as I have come in contact with lemongrass many times even in drinks so I'm gonna keep using Nature's Gate stuff but I might veer away from their deodorants for now. Allergy sufferers be careful and test it lightly first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too manly for a woman, not strong enough for a man","review":"I got this for myself, thinking out would be a pleasant smelling natural deodorant. The smell was much too strong for me to wear. It smells like old school Old Spice . I smelled like my dad, circa 1988. I gave it to my boyfriend to use, and it works for all of two hours before he starts to get ripe again. I will not buy this scent again."},{"rating":"2","title":"strong scent but does the job..","review":"this is definitely more a man's scent than for a woman, but since it does not contain aluminum, I was glad to find this. Does a better job than Toms of Maine and Arm and Hammer in terms of sweat resistance. My wife feels like its too strong a scent for her, though so I think they should consider coming out with some less manly scents for women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like others have said, not working for me","review":"I'm with the others.

However, the effectiveness is just plain awful. Under normal usage, I'm lucky if I go half the day before it's like I'm wearing nothing at all. I can't even go an entire work day without it wearing off. That's terrible. I've used Axe or Right Guard for the past 12 years or so, and they provide 24 hour protection, so I haven't smelled my armpits since I was in my teens! I honestly think this stuff might have ingredients in it that CAUSE your armpits to smell! I never, ever stink or smell, but after wearing this stuff, I smell like pure B.O. at the end of every single work day. It's incredible. This stuff is garbage! Back to Axe I go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing product","review":"I purchased this product originally because I was beginning to react to the products from the big companies, p&g etc. I bought two sticks. 1 lasted for over a year and a half.

We are mainly concerned with getting attractive rugs that last for awhile, don't slide around or snag and are easy to clean and vacuum. This rug works on all counts and because of the great price really deserves 5 stars. The colors are maybe not what we would have chosen at the store but they look great in the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, But Forgettable","review":"My reaction to this and the two subsequent volumes of Molique quartets on cpo is exactly the same as my reaction to the work of Louis Spohr. It's utterly captivating music to listen to, but when an individual work is over, nothing about it sticks in the memory. Such a description might cause you to put these discs in the Save for Later bin. But I don't recommend that: not everything needs to be Beethoven!Spohr was on my mind after I'd listened to this album and then took a look at the liner notes. So I wasn't at all surprised to learn that Molique, despite the French name, was actually German -- and a pupil of Spohr. If second-tier composers are too lowly for you, you'd be missing a mental and emotional treat here. So what if, when you put this in your player, you have no clear picture of what you're going to hear. When you do hear it, splendidly played by the Mannheim String Quartet, it's a joy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Great CDs.

We kept it there, since it was a slight (a very slight) deterrent - bought us about 2 seconds before button pushing ensued - but with all the bending, he broke it off in 6 months.

It sits on the shelf in front of the stereo receiver.

Not a useful item in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mama at home","review":"We bought this guard because our 12 month old was persistent about playing with the buttons on the TV.

They have watched me do it many times, and caught on quick. Now that I use the tv guard, they have ignored the buttons. although the first day that I put the guard on, there were a few frustrated screams, but after that they don't even bother to notice. Now the only problem is that they steal the remote. I recommend it to any parents of children who aren't little terrors that are going to rip the guard off, or break it in half."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intensely psychadelic performance.","review":"With less annoying crowd chatter than other Bootmon releases of their concerts this lets you enjoy the music for what it is...raw mindaltering electronic nirvanna.Not as slick and polished as modern day Tangerine Dream and sure the technology is a little bit dated but the performance has a palpable sustained almost feverish intensity that can never be recreated by anyone else(not even Tangerine Dream themselves).A literal blast from the past and a great collector's item."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was brought up on the movie....","review":"To me Indiana Jones is Harrison Ford, brown leather, and fedora.When reading the book, i kept replaying the movie in my head of that scene.Nevertheless, reading this book, I do recommend. It'll fill in gaps that the movie missed, and like all books will paint a much bigger picture that does a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The novelization is a s good as the movie.","review":"If a novelization of a movie is done well, such as this one, it will entertain you as much as the actual movie.

Well, it was totally unoffensive, predictable and had way too much Mormonism"},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess it will do","review":"This book has entirely too many subplots and characters. The main storyline gets lost in all of the fluff. While I understand the need for \\"clean\\" novels, substituting \\"Szz!\\" for profanity is not a step up on the clean stories ladder. However it certainly is readable if you really have a lot of extra time on your hands and absolutely must have something, anything to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many plots","review":"From this book you could write at least two different books. Some plots are good, some bad and some plain boring. When you read the good parts you'll be thrilled but when you are reading the boring plots you'll like to throw away the book... just do it. There are at least two plots that are awfully long and they don't have to do anything or almost anything to the main plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mayberry Murder Mystery","review":"Picked this up at the used book sale the other day. Every character could have been from Mayberry RFD. When one of the main adult charcters is shocked, and asks her love interest \\"you drink beer?\\", I dropped the book in the wastebasket.

Wish Amazon would let you give less than 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try, but falls far short of goal","review":"I had to read this to see what a \\"clean\\" thriller was like. While his attempt was certainly laudable, the results are far from exemplary. This novel is rather schizophrenic, as if a modern thriller had been transplanted onto a 1950s TV drama; I almost expected The Beav or Andy Griffith to step in and solve the whole thing. The writing runs hot and cold, the characters are either squeaky-clean or evilevilevil, some of the characters' actions are questionable, and the attempts to work around offensive material are more often than not awkward. His strong point is plotting-- in fact, there is probably enough plot for two or three thrillers. There is so much that at times he is reduced to summarizing events instead of really getting into them in detail, despite the book's massive length. For something like this to work, you need to have a lot of psychological depth. An interesting read, no more."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Landlord","review":"Received the book free in the mail from you -- THANK YOU!!! My gosh what a terriffic book!

The only reason to read this book is if your religious or other beliefs prevent you from reading a real thriller (such as one written by Thomas Perry or James W. Hall): one with well-drawn characters, realistic dialog, a plot-line free of contradictions, professionally edited, tighly written and with no glaring grammatical mistakes. If you don't care about those things, and if you can't abide even a hint of sex, profanity or bloodshed, and if you like to read about people praying every five pages, then this book is for you. And don't be misled (like I was) by the high reader rating - it's pretty obvious that most of them were planted."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Landlord Review","review":"The Landlord is the best clean thriller I've read in a long time. I started reading it and couldn't put it down, it was a real page turner, in fact I stayed in my pyjamas all day reading this book. Mr. Merrel's style is quite unique and very refreshing to see. His characters Don, Christina, Cecily, and Officer Rick Stacey will find their way into your heart. I give it a 5 out of 5. My suggestion read this book, because its a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Landlord--Suspenseful from beginning to end!!!!","review":"Even with Stephen King and Dean Koontz, I have never became so totally engrossed in the plot of a book and it's characters!!! It does take some concentration to follow the plot line and not get the characters confused with so much going on!!! But that only adds to the drama of this story. The writing style is wonderful, the plot EXTREMELY interesting, the characters so lifelike- they could be someone you know, and the suspense so intense and ongoing that you find yourself unable to put the book down until your finished and know how it all turns out !!!The best book I've read in a long, long time!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbinding","review":"I was skeptical at first reading a book by a first time writer, but then, all writers have to start somewhere.From the first page until the last page, Ken Merrell holds you captive to his book.

Using his background as a master machinist and engineer, Chris has seen the Great Pyramid as it really was and is, a magnificent structure built by master craftspeople (scientists and engineers) to be a practical device, a power plant. Chris explains why it was built so precisely, why the particular materials were used and how advanced machining and techniques had to be employed to accomplish the task. Anyone interested in recovery of ancient wisdom, understanding how the Great Pyramid could not possible have been originally designed and built as a tomb for a king, and interested in the concepts of sacred geometry, acoustical harmonic resonance theories and the great knowledge of the Ancient Khemitians (Egyptians) must read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Destroys the last vestige of the tomb theory","review":"An excellent work that obliterates the last shreds of the pathetic tomb theory. Despite the fact that there is NO evidence to support the tomb theory (see the old William Fix book Pyramid Odyssey), the subliterate morons who call themselves Egyptologists have stuck with it because they lacked the intellect, imagination or integrity to initiate an original thought. Dunn may not be 100% correct, but he's certainly on the right path. Now I hope he gets a chance to analyze the other two large Giza pyramids as well as the two large ones at Dashur. All four of those pyramids have intiguing and unique interior architecture, the purpose of which is unknown."},{"rating":"1","title":"He had me until the magnets","review":"Dunn wrote a very good book chuck full of detail and good arguments and reasoning until he started talking about magnets lifting rocks. After that the book went down hill and I took him less and less seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Giza Power plant","review":"Very compelling scientific and engineering focus on the interior aspects of the Giza Pyramid. Obviously a new look at the internal mechanisms of design, rather then the currently accepted theories. As a believer in connecting with Spirit through ceremony and ritual, I find this book actually reinforces the concepts I practice - vibration raises the frequency which in turn connects you with Spirit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Book","review":"This is easily one of the funniest books I've ever read, but I gave it two stars because it is well written. Yes, the pyramids as power plants to run all the tools used to cut the stones for the pyramids--well except the first pyramid--and of course operate the spaceships and the blenders and TV's etc. Or maybe they were only built to provide the resources needed to build pyramids which would then provide resources to build more pyramids.Please, there are a lot of fascinating aspects to Egyptian civilization--this isn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty boring","review":"This is a great book....IF YOUR A SCIENTIST! Christopher Dunn tries to explain to the reader the technical aspects of the great pyramid and why it would be logical for it to be a power plant. Dunn is a mechanical engineer and writes in a way that only another mechanical engineer would understand. Even though most of this book is tech-speak there are others parts that just rehash old theories. All in all it was a pretty boring book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheer idiocy!","review":"Wake up, people! The ancient Egyptians used slaves, not machines, to cut and polish stone. This hypothesis is utter nonsense."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I had to read one book on the pyramids, this is the one!","review":"I've read several books on the ancient pyramids of Egypt and this book rates very high on my list!

Unlike a previous reviewer, who seemed shocked at the notion that this work should include literature, art and music as \\"culture\\", I find it provides an adequate cross-section of various genres and media. This is not a \\"travel guide\\" or a touchy-feely \\"insider's guide\\" to Spain, but a serious scholarly introduction to the men and women who have defined Spanish culture in the 20th century. If you are looking for information on tapas, look elsewhere; if you want to know how the Spanish civil war impacted the arts, this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"For the purposes of this book, culture is defined as the arts, so the essays by various authors included in this book deal with literature, theater, dance, painting, etc., which could be very interesting, but not in this case. I got the impression that the essays were all examples of experts showing off how expert they are; very dry, lacking emotion, failing to inspire or excite. Too analytical, all head and no heart.

The basic gist is God and Satan battling it out and using Jakki as their pawn. Satan sets up a series of scenarios to make Jakki trip-up morally...Satan is trying to test Jakki's belief in God.Without spoiling the album, Satan's scenarios vary from battling with Aliens, to battling with AIDS.With production from RJD2, Camu Tao, Copywrite, and more, this album was set to be a hit. But the focus (as with most theme albums) was primarily on the lyrical content, and the ideas. Jakki's lyrics are great, with intelligent use of metaphors and ideas.If you liked Sticky Fingaz's theme album, you should love this. Although it doesnt follow the same story as Sticky's, this is definately a good break from the normal hip hop we've been hearing recently. Good underground music."},{"rating":"2","title":"big, quality mirror mobile for baby, just hang it on the wall","review":"Our baby loves looking up at her reflection on the mirror of this mobile. The mirror is big and of good quality, the image does not come out distorted. We just hung it on the wall above her playard on a coat hanger mounted on the wall. Great distraction when baby needs to be put down for a few minutes. Mirror comes with a velcro so it can be folded. The lion's legs make noises when jiggled for added distraction. Overall, cute, easily hangs on a hook on a wall, and best of all baby loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our baby LOVES this mirror.","review":"We installed this over our changing table when our baby was born. He LOVES this mirror. At first he stared at the lion, but now (4months) he laughes at the lion and the little boy in the mirror. He also explores the rest of the mobile. The printed animals on the \\"backsplash\\" is also fun - he now discoved that part and points at the different animals.For my 2 year old we had another mirror, and from our experience a mirror over the changing table calms them down. It also helps them see what is going on and over time what to expect. Our older son very quickly learned, for example, to push his arms through his sleeves as he could see what we were doing before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes changing time fun","review":"I have a contoured changing pad, and it's hard to tell, but I am not sure the mirror comes out far enough from the wall for my son to see himself, and the mirror has a bit of distortion. Also, only 2 of the feet have rattles or bells in them.............With that said, this is THE BEST toy I have bought so far. My 4-month old son loves to stare at the lion's face, bat the feet, touch the cloth pictures of the animals and loves the bright colors and fun patterns. I love the fact that it is cloth and lightweight so I don't have to worry about him pulling it down and hurting himself. There have been so many times that he has stopped crying once he saw the lion. He always smiles during changing time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for distracting squirmy babies","review":"My 5 month old daughter has had this above her changing table since she was about 2 months old and she loves it! Everytime I lay her down she starts smiling and giggling like its the first time she saw it.

They close in the center with a little bubble and none of the corners seal shut. Moreover, the soft plastic cases are all warped a little and don't sit perfectly flat/square. Cheap, Chinese junk, not that I expected much more...but they offer little if any protection and are just cheaply made.I could value the stack sitting here about to go back at $7.95, tops."},{"rating":"1","title":"Convenient but not good for hummingbirds!!","review":"This product might be convenient, but I recommend NOT using it. It contains red dye and a preservative, both of which may be damaging to hummingbirds. You do not need red food coloring in nectar in order to attract hummingbirds. Most hummingbird feeders have plenty of red on them to attract the birds. A simple mixture of 4 parts water to 1 part granulated sugar is all that is needed for hummingbird nectar. Never use honey or sugar substitutes. It's simple to make nectar and keep refrigerated and certainly safe for the birds. We prefer safeguarding the health of these little birds rather than the supposed convenience of this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"RED DYE may cause tumors","review":"There is some scientific testing showing red dye may cause tumors in hummingbirds.

I found out that this hummingbird food is absolutely rubbish. You should not buy it. It contains dye and preservatives which are harmful for hummingbirds. I do not get it, first we destroy their habitats and than we feed them something what makes them sick and kills them in the long-run.You could mix your own hummingbird nectar, 1 part sugar and 4 parts waterheat it up until the sugar is dissolved.

There should be minus stars!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"RED DYE#40","review":"I gave this two stars only because I had to assign a rating to make this comment. I have not used the nectar and the rating is mere speculation. I am wondering if FDA Red#40 is the same as Red Dye 40 (red food dye). Most birding experts advise against using red dyes in hummingbird nectar. There is some evidence that these dyes cause tumors and other health problems in hummingbirds. If the concentrate contains red food dye, I wouldn't use it. It's not necessary to use red coloring in nectar to attract hummingbirds; the red in the feeder is sufficient."},{"rating":"2","title":"This stuff is great, it works fine......","review":"I have used it for a few years. No dying birds, no coughing birds in blankets leaning over humidifiers, a little referral to Felix Unger ;) . Anyhoo, the birds leave the neighbors' yard for my house as soon as I put it out.As to the business about preservatives, just because something is a preservative does NOT make it bad. SALT is a preservative! The most widely used preservative on the planet.It is no accident that I used the word \\"business\\". You will note that the 1-star reviewers are bird-store OWNERS. Which makes their reviews highly suspicious.The only bad thing about the nectar is that I have been told by the local Ace Hardware (my local source) that the company has discontinued the product. I fear it is because new shoppers thought it was expensive (not knowing how concentrated it is) and us \\"oldies\\" take a while to go through a bottle. Not a lot of profit in that......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hummingbirds love it!","review":"I'm amazed at how quickly the hummingbirds are going through this nectar!

Having red on your hummingbird feeder is enough to attract them; having red chemical dye in their food is totally, and I mean totally, unecessary.

Now I know why people say you should trust your gut. I don't think anyone but true fans of the show will even buy this, however, I don't think anyone, know matter who you are, will enjoy this. The story is ludicrous. It is basically a summary of the first season of Dragonball Z with some characters missing. In summation, the truest fans of the show will enjoy this for the comedy, but the magic of watching a small goateed man with a shell on his back try to jump on a flying cloud doesn't last that long.

Also, our cat has learned how to break the string, requiring a never ending supply of new strings.Without these problems this would be a great toy. With them, I'd be reluctant to recommend it to anyone one. Broken strings are common with cat toys, but the problem with the motor has made it unusable.

It's all here...planning, benchwork, trackwork, scenery, electrical wiring as well as color photos of small and large layouts. This book includes a listing of the tools you will need, a list of suppliers and organizations, illustrations of the different locomotives, servicing and repairing your engines, choosing couplers, lingo you will need to know, and there's even an N scale ruler printed in the margin, plus much, much more! I purchased the first edition of this book over twenty-five years ago and literally wore it out. I now have this edition which has been extensively revised and updated. You won't find any outdated or confusing information here. Beginners Guide to N Scale Model Railroading will more than pay for itself and will serve you for years to come. It's the one book you will want to have at hand as your model railroad progresses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"This book was useless for me. Very dated.

Good basic information on the basics of setting your first layout on the N scale hobby"},{"rating":"2","title":"The real Entourage","review":"I can't believe the makers of this movie haven't promoted it as being Entourage in real life--except if Turtle and Eric are successful actors, too. In My Big Break, you follow the (real-life) careers of four young aspiring actors who live together in a messy house in LA. Three of them make it fairly big--and one of them, unbelievably big (Wes Bentley, who did the amazing job as the troubled kid in American Beauty). Then things start to fall apart, and Wes's career (among others) starts to crumble. (Vincent Chase, anyone?) This movie is an amazingly honest, searching portrayal of the Hollywood star machine, and how it eats people up. It's unlike anything I've ever seen before. I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough TMNT","review":"This is the second volume of the new TMNT series. A lot of plot points are introduced in these three episodes, including the Turtles' first encounter with vigilante Casey Jones, their discovery of some interesting secrets concerning their new lair, the construction of their Battle Shell assault vehicle, and the introduction of the mystical Sword of Tengu. The Turtles also encounter a microscopic robot known as the Nano, which leads to an above-average filler adventure. If you're a Turtles' fan, these episodes are essential viewing.However, see if you can either rent this DVD or catch the re-runs on TV. 3 episodes a disc is a blatant rip-off. WB puts at least 4 episodes on its Batman/Justice League DVDs. Those are bad enough, but 3 is inexcusable. As much as I love the Turtles, I'm not wasting my money on these DVDs.TMNT is a quality cartoon series. This DVD is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to look at","review":"Very nice looking product. Not seeing a preservation difference in my bananas, but the item serves its puprose otherwise. Good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well made, but can bruise fruit","review":"Length:: 1:53 MinsPros:- integrated banana hanger with fruit bowl- large fruit bowl- sturdy metal rod construction- washable (unlike some woven baskets)- attractive designCons:- significant footprint on counter- metal rods don't support soft fruits well - can bruise/indent ripe fruitsI previous had a woven basket for fruit and a separate banana hanger. The genius of this design is to integrate the two. It is quite sturdy; I can hang two bunches of bananas and has an attractive design. It is larger than I had anticipated so it can hold a lot of fruit. The biggest downside it that the metal rods are narrow so they can bruise and indent fruit, especially soft fruits or if you stack the basket full.If you found this review helpful, let me know with your vote below."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you like miniature fruit","review":"I bought this based on the picture and made the mistake of not carefully looking at the measurements. The picture shown must have miniature fruit because in reality, the bananas hang so low that they actually touch the fruit in the basket which makes the whole thing look kind of weird. I'm adding a picture with real, normal-sized bananas so you can see the comparison between the image on Amazon and how it really looks. It is also pretty flimsy and the hanger bends when you put fruit on it. I'm sending this back.If you usually buy those cute little bitty bananas, though, this would be perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Affordable and Fresh Fruit!","review":"I had the hardest time finding a decent fruit bowl until I saw this one. It is much larger that it appears in the picture. I can easily fit 10 apples in the bottom with Bananas hanging on the hook.. plus they all stay fresh. In fact, my brother saw it and asked where I got it. Now, I am ordering one for him. I haven't been able to find anything close to this in any store. If you have ever been frustrated that the fruit you buy wasn't lasting, try this product because it really extends the life of fruit. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Banana Tree and Fruit Bowl - (Silver)","review":"I bought this for my boyfriend's sister as I'd broken her old banana tree. I holds 2 bunches of bananas easily and a whole box of clementines (I think it's a 3 or 4 pound box) in the bowl!!! It fits between the cabinetcabinets on the counter of her kitchen, and looks GREAT! Everyone (her, her kids, her husband, my boyfriend and I) loves it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fruit anyone?","review":"Good day! This is a great fruit basket. I received this really quickly and it is huge compared to the size I pictured in my mind. You can easily fit about 10 apples in the bottom, good sized, and still have room for the bananas to hang. It also helps to keep fresh fruit. I have apples that have been in there for a week or two that are just as fresh as when I brought them home. Even if you have to pay shipping, trust me, this product is worth every cent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"nice product","review":"nice bananna stand this thing fits in well with my kitchen decor and really holds the fruit well. id highly recommend it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this - but largest hole in center of basket might be too big","review":"My husband was sick of me using a metal bowl to store fruit and purchased this for me as a gift. I LOVE the idea, BUT the center hole in the bottom is big enough for a clementine or a medium apple to fall through. It could use a slightly larger basket. This one probably holds one bag of apples, but if you have bananas hanging, your stacking ability will be limited. For the price, though, I do believe it is better than the aforementioned silver bowl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Came Broken","review":"This product looked very nice, but arrived broken. There is a small weld that holds together 2 pieces of the bannana holder that had seperated. Perhaps if the packaging was better it may have been ok.

Although the design seems to be a great space-saver, this will cause your other fruit to go bad more quickly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well balanced","review":"I found the bowl to be very well balanced. It allows you to move it around easily by lifting at the top of the banana hook. It doesn't matter if the bowl is empty, has only bananas, only fruit in the bowl, or has both bananas and other fruit. It always lifts squarely and never tries to tip over.The fruit bowl is quite large and easily holds 10 large apples."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this","review":"I love this, it is well-made and large enough size. I couldn't be any more satisfied with this item.

My plums, apricots, and nectarines all went through the hole as soon as I picked up the bowl. It is a poor design. OK, 2 stars for making it look pretty on the Amazon's picture. Feels cheap when you hold it in your hands. Thanks for Amazon's return policy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it if shipping outside USA","review":"I wanted a fruit bowl with a banana hanger. Since I'm Canadian, I looked at the ones available at amazon.ca but alas, none had banana hangers! So I ended up stupidly paying $60 in total to ship a fruit bowl that would've cost an American $12.95 + shipping and handling. Ridiculous shipping fees! And of course, they don't provide a quote before you click buy! To add insult to injury, the item was poorly packed in a too large box and the banana hanger weld didn't hold. I had to use a clamp and krazy glue to get it back together. I feel like a fool. Caveat emptor indeed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bruises fruit","review":"Nothing soft, like peaches or plums, can be kept in this basket because the rods bruise it really fast. Even if there's just one peach in the basket, its own weight presses it against the protruding thin rods and bruises it badly enough to break the skin. I suppose if you never eat anything but thick-skinned citrus this would be okay, but for a fruit basket, it's a terrible design. You want something open to allow air to circulate, but flat so it doesn't poke the fruit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap product!","review":"This item broke within a matter of weeks! It might look nice and sturdy, but its not. Its cheaply made and cannot withstand more than a few bananas at a time. The glue on the basket section did not hold for very long.I tried to contact the seller multiple times but never got any response! Very frustrating!!Don't buy this product because even if it breaks, the seller does not respond to contact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its amazing","review":"Nothing to complain. I'm using it very well. Hardly anything to complain about the product and it was what it was described to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this fruit bowl! Still using it 3 years later :)","review":"Bought this in hopes of getting a 2-in-1 deal - fruit bowl and banana holder - and it works great!

Great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Banana/Fruit Bowl","review":"I searched my local stores for this item and could not find it. I knew exactly what I wanted, it had to be a fruit bowl combined with a banana hanger in chrome or stainless. Finally, I decided to search Amazon knowing I would find what I was looking for. The chrome wire fruit bowl goes with my kitchen decor and is of good quality. I like the construction and the size of the bowl is large enough to hold lots of fruit. I am totally satisfied with this purchase. I would definitely recommend this product to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"exactly as pictured","review":"great product- nice size.

The crime : character. In addition to mother, father and the two girls who watch all but say little, there is a dusty grandmother with chicken feathers on her eyelids. Uncle Jaime makes \\"pointed brassieres that make adequate cat bowls\\", while Uncle Rico is branded as \\"incorrigle tango player, copious weeper\\". Set in an unnamed South American country, this should be a book of color and delight. But, though fanciful, the characters are distant - there is little chance to meet them directly.

The author clearly thinks she's being very clever-- the smugness and self-satisfaction seep greasily out of every line-- but she's just spinning her wheels.

His books are in the tradition of J.I.M. Stuart, an Oxford don who wrote under the name Michael Innes -- literary, erudite, and mischevious. This one is primarily an intellectual enterprise, though it does have some of the mad humor that fills his better works. I found the climactic scene too similar to part of his Frequent Hearses for comfort, and he tends to deal with his villians by having them die in a ball of fire, but we all have our faults.If you're looking for a quick and stylish Brrrrrritish Mystery, this is a pleasant read.

I ended up getting an ATT phone That does show the country code. This is also a nuisance when adding numbers from your caller ID as it will not show the number 1 for the USA country code unless you push the * button, which isn't so bad if you can remember to do that.

I tried placing the base unit in different areas but our Master BR unit usually would not ring when a call came. That can be important. But the most serious problem is that now the base unit gives me an E2 message and doesn't work. Uniden Support responded after my second email to say that E2 represented an \\"internal issue with the unit\\". They offered that the only recourse was to send the unit back for warranty work.

I have emailed both 2Wire and Uniden, and the answer is completely unacceptable. They said that a 5.8 phone could revert to 2.4 and thus interfere with a wireless connection.

In doing this, the scene access for the second half of an episode will not play; it jumps to the beginnig of the next episode. The only way to view the 2nd part is to fast-backwards all the way to just after the start of the scene and play from there.

My physician could find nothing wrong so I began to look for other avenues of relief. That's when I decided to try some probiotics. In searching for various types I came accross these pearls and since they were so cheap I gave them a try. Almost immediately my nausea went almost completely away. The pearls really helped.

Outer coating is superior than products without it.","review":"These come in extremely convenient blister packs, and you can break off a 10 day supply. The pearls are very easy to swallow and smaller then the size of a pea. If you have lots of medicines like me, you will like the tiny packaging it comes with. These are cheap and get the job done. They include acidophilus and bifidobacterium longum which is another good strain of bacteria. I think the protective coating is superior to ones without it - the bacteria actually survive your digestive tract, which is most important. It doesnt matter if your probiotic boasts 100 billion bacteria if none of them can survive. This contains 1 billion CFUs which is an effective dose - the capsule protects the bacteria from the harsh conditions. Refrigeration not required, but they should be kept at room temp. or lower. All probiotics are sensitive to temperature."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disappointed","review":"As a candida sufferer i take pro-biotics regularly, i found that this one has little or no effect.

For instance, how can one write a book about Notable Women of the Ancient Greek and Roman world without an entry on Hypatia, or the Empress Pulcheria? And why did the authors leave out the incredibly brave and women's rights models of the early deaconesses of emerging Christianity?I wish I could recommend this book wholeheartedly, but I cannot.

It's not exactly the most appealing form of rock, and this particular album is not even a very good one by 38 Special standards. An arena rock album should at least have hooks, then it could be considered a guilty pleasure, there are none here. Fans of the band should stick to ROCK N ROLL STRATEGY or SPECIAL FORCES; casual fans would be better off with a comp.

These are both American classics as far as I am concerned and anyone who loves the southwest, has traveled there,wants to travel there, or even is an armchair traveler must read at least one of them.Each chapter is a short story, each short story is a picture within a mural that represents a time, purely Americana."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for anyone from the east dreaming about the West.","review":"This was my first Eddward Abbey book, but it certainly will not be my last. The book allows the reader to view many parts of \\"the West\\" from his authentic perspective. From his time in a firetower in Montana to retelling and following John Wesley Powell's story of exploration, Edward Abbey will have you hooked on each subject and adventure that he eperienced on his Journey. I think there is a part in all of us to want to live this type of life, but only a few of us have the courage to follow our heart and dreams the way Abbey did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!!!","review":"This is one of my favorite albums of the year thus far, and a complete shock and surprise. Filter have become masters at creating the rock 'hook'. Songs that stick in your head, and a cd that continues to spin in my car. Standout tracks include the ministry tinged 'Columind', 'American Cliche', the ballady 'The Missing', and 'Where do we go from here'. This is one heck of an album, and should find its way into every fan of hard rock's cd collection this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Record of the year!","review":"I bought this CD on Tuesday when it came out and have not stopped listening to it.

I am almost familiar with all the songs, and I just received it in the mail yesterday. A definate buy if you like Filter's music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great mix of music","review":"If you liked Title of Record you have to get this one. There are some really mellow songs and some really rockin' songs as well. I'm most impressed with the sound quality of the Filter CD's. They do a great job in the studio of making their albums sound good no matter what kind of stereo equipment you have. I love the hard stuff and the mellow songs put you in a dream like state. The only down side is the last two songs are a waste unless you're just totally wanting to zone out. So my opinion is if you're are true Filter fan you will love this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album!","review":"Filter's third album is fantastic! People who enjoyed the first two albums will no doubt like this one! The top single is \\"Where do we go from here\\" but my favorite on the album would have to be \\"The only way is the wrong way\\" This album combines both the previous albums since \\"Short bus\\" is the heavier side while \\"Title of Record\\" is the softer side. For fans of Filter, this is a must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"This has to be the best music CD I have ever purchased.

CD was enhanced too so I watched the video and the overwhelming feeling I had was to open the cd drawer and break the CD in half. Sure I should expect that the type of music I listen to doesn't always have a clean message but I feel this newest cd shows Filter's lyrics and message go darker and reaches for nothing more than a proclamation to give up, it's over. I buy explicit lyrics over clean because I'd rather stay in tune with the real message a band puts out and I'm not sure how the clean CD could really do them anymore justice. I'm deeply disappointed with the road Filter is taking...I bought the 3rd and newest CD because the 2nd was great and I like some yelling in songs and their music but the 3rd puts me in a \\"no sale\\" mood for future recordings. Buy the single with the remix if you want to hear the Filter you knew a CD back. If your in love with the music then the 3rd will be just as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Gem","review":"I just picked this disc up....wow...I'm behind the times. Anyhow, I'm glad I did. There's some really great songs on this album. What I like most about Filter's latest work is their ability to create ass-kicking songs that get me pumped up while also creating more toe-tapping songs that show their range. THE ONLY WAY and WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE are great songs...I love the guitar work and Richard's voice is the best it has ever been.Get this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Filter picks up where their last album left off","review":"It's good to see that Filter has continued to produce the style of music they conceived on 'Title of Record.' I was never a big fan of the 'Short Bus' album and they have definetly changed for the better. Besides the fact that the last two tracks are wasted on some strange surreal garbage, this album is a must have.Although the second album edges this one out slightly in quality of songwriting, I believe there are a few tunes on 'Title of Record' that would have been hard to reproduce an equal to. Track number 8 comes to mind. This album is an excelent continuation of the last but changes enough that it has it's own identity. I strongly advise that you buy this album, and not just because the brainwashing short film that plays on your PC when you load this CD told me to say that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Title of Record and Short Bus before even thinking about wasting your money on this one","review":"In attempting to follow 1999's dynamic Title of Record, Filter released an overall much heavier CD, with only \\"Goddamn Me\\" and \\"Where Do We Go From Here\\" to save listeners from the nonstop barrage of poorly-played, over-distorted downtuned guitars.All of the songs are tolerable, but it cannot compare to its predecessor. The lyrics take a sharp downhill turn, with self-conscious wording and cliche themes (Marilyn Manson had the right and a reason to comment on Columbine, because he was blamed, and Korn did because of their ties to dark and violent music. But who cares what Richard Patrick thinks?).Patrick once claimed that this would be the best record since the Defones' \\"White Pony.\\" He was wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"World Today\\" by Filter","review":"\\"Only the last two tracks seem out of place. \\"World Today\\" is weird and disturbing, like a child in an insane asylum. \\"I like the world today, I like the world today, I like the world today, when it's green...And sometimes it's mean, and sometimes it's mean, and sometimes it's mean as can be\\". Richard Patrick can still scare the pants off a banshee...,You have no idea what that song, \\"World Today\\", means to me.During my year in Afghani-land it was my \`prayer' song when our own blood was lost.Filter, this CD, amongst so many, helped me keep my sanity.\\"But sometimes it's mean as hell; helluva price to pay\\".That would be a fact"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete let down. What were they thinking?!?!","review":"I loved the last album and still listen to it at least once a month. It set the stage for what Filter was all about for me. This new album was like they produced it themselves and didn't ask anyone's opinion if any of it was any good. Two songs are marginal and the rest are B-A-D BAD! I was completely disappointed and let down. I will go back to the old album and hope that the next one is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Tracks and Poor Tracks","review":"About half of this cd is quite good. But many songs bother me or are just very poor. Like the last track especially. It's 8 min are smooth bass pretty much. There is no point to it. The 2nd last track is extremely boring as well. I do not care for the song GD me because of the GD's, and my long walk to jail would be good if it wasn't for some of the lyrics bothering me. Now however:you walk away, american cliche, and where do we go from here are excellent songs. Columbind is quite good, the missing is quite good, the only way is the wrong way is quite good, and so I quit is good. So even though there are quite a few tracks on here that aren't too good, I still think that this is a pretty stinkin good album.So people that like good music, go and pick this puppy up and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"It won't leave my stereo","review":"Filter has got a lot of good ideas.

Kaiba's suicide threat is sugar-coated and Tea's attacker is a mugger not a perverted gym teacher. The dubbed version dialog is a little more about fate than friendship.I think the music and voices are better in the dubbed version. Pegasus' fey voice in the Japanese version is actually a little annoying.As for the DVD, a scant total of 3 episodes is too few to pay for. Just tape it off Saturday morning TV or find the dubbed first season DVD set somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"this dvd sucks","review":"1 wrote a review once before but this is the worst episode of all the yugioh dvds i am a big fan but man they had to make this dvd suck. man and this is coming from a kid i think that the japenese way is better japenese voices japenese names and japenese intro they made this suck in america they should of made this just like its supposed to be but no they had to make this for 4 year olds i can handle violence i am mature for my age i am (...) a girl i agree with other reviewers that wrote here a while back ago THE JAPENESE YUGIOH IS SO MUCH BETTER. this show should be for 11 and up and the other way where it has the deleted scenes i think 4 year should not even watch this show. go like some other show like pokemon. so i like reading the books alot and parents dont even let 10 and younger read the books because its to violent they would cry. just to let you know of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Yu-Gi-Oh fans","review":"My husband (yes, I said husband!) is an AVID Yu-Gi-Oh collector, as are our kids.

The album itself is okay. But people - Have you heard her sing live without benefit of studio production to keep her sounding in tune? I am a huge Rufus fan, and the first time I heard him in concert I thought, \\"Who is that woman screeching on backup vocals?\\" She stands back there and howls with apparently no idea that backup singers are not supposed to be louder than the main vocals. And when she does the solo numbers - Please! So many people have described her voice as \\"unique.\\" It seems that \\"unique\\" is a euphemism for loud and unapologetically out of tune. I know this won't be a popular review, but I couldn't let all those starry-eyed optimists go on saying she is an incredible artist when all she seems to be doing is hanging on to her famous familys' coattails."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Eye-Opener...","review":"This book changed my approach to drumming in unexpected and positive ways. If you put the time into approaching the systems outlined here, you will surely advance from a drummer to a musician. Gaining independence between a drummers hands and feet opens windows of musical expression that would otherwise not be available. If you are serious about drums from a musical and artistic point of view, I can't recommend this book enough to help get you there. Plus, the addition of a CD interview with Gary Chester and Danny Gottlieb (original drummer with Pat Metheny)is quite insightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly challenging book; but very helpful","review":"This is one of the best drum books for drum set available today, hands down. It basically has a list of patters to be played over ostanado patterns (that is, ones that do not change). It starts simple, with quarter notes, and by the end of the book, its highly syncopated 16ths and whatnot. Very challenging, but it' the type of book that will really, really help anyone develop their creative mind with the kit. Most importantly, this is NOT one of those 'play through and then throw into the closet' kind of books. NO!! This book can be used for entire careers endlessly. It's like Stick Control. It's a bible of a book, it's to be interpreted not just read and played! This book will separate the men from the boys!!

The style of writing is so satisfying and refreshing. You ache for more when the book is finished and then return to your favourite sections to indulge in what to me is the best read I have had for years. The story is great and the issues raised are thoroughly interesting and very relevent. I found being a young man growing up in the same world as John Self very revealing. The appearance of a real-life character is most thought-provoking"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amis at his dry best","review":"His best work to date, dry as a bone, pedantically loquatious and yet totally down to earth. Martin Amis has a rare gift and shares it with us here in all it's disgusting beauty. He examines life as proctologist might examine a soiled daiper and reports on it's contents in unashamedly graphic prose"},{"rating":"2","title":"a wild ride through 1980s excess","review":"'Money' is a curious and often wickedly funny tale of a British/American 35 y.o. slob who gets \\"his money for nothing and chicks for free\\" (..well, usually for free). The humour is crude, along the lines of what is found in the 'Men Behaving Badly' sitcom. And while the story gets a bit repetitive, with scenes constantly switching between London and New York, Martin Amis wraps it up with a clever and unexpected ending.My only complaint with this generally well-written novel is its sporadic lapse into rather offensive material as a guise for humour. There is one scene where the main character repeatedly attempts (and fails) to rape his girlfriend. Funny? ...er, no.But overall 'Money' is a fun read. It will probably appeal to men, more the Brits than Americans. I can imagine most women will find it offensive. And parents, don't let kids under 16 get near this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"What can you say. A high octane trip through the mad money-crazed world of the 1980s. Everyone's out for themselves, not giving a monkey's for anything, anyone or even themselves. And then comes the big payback when the whole thing's a cynical lie and you're nothing more than a little fish trying not to get eaten. It's a real world version of the US film, The Trueman Show - except no children would ever be allowed to watch and everyone is a loser.Five stars, just for the swearing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Money: A suicide note","review":"I am not a bookworm and do not read as half as many books as I should, but what i would like to say is typed below. When one is reading any book from any one of the BILLIONS of titles available worldwide, you have have to consider the images protrayed in ones imagination. Every individuals is different, but if a author such as M Amis can move me as much as he did by \\"money\\" im sure he can do the same for you. Just read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious, painful","review":"Maybe I tend to become too emotionally invested in books and overreact, but this book had me physically recoiling in disgust, yelling with frustration, and frequently laughing out loud.\\"Money\\" was so painful at points that it's hard to say that I really enjoyed reading it, but I'm certainly glad that I did. I also really cannot remember the last time I laughed so much reading a book, or at anything really. So read it, but know that it's basically 300+ pages of comic alcoholism, porn, and violence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vanishing","review":"Martin Amis has a exquist and unique writing stlye. In \\" Money\\" however, the threading gets lost along the way. It becomes difficult to follow the storyline: storyline which eventually vanishes midway through the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money is passé.","review":"Martin Amis is an excellent writer, but the book is dated. I should have read it years ago when it first came out. The ego of the men in the book is too big a hurdle to jump at this point in my life. I feel somewhat bad in writing this because Amis is a writer I admire. Nevertheless . . . it is what it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't quit this book halfway through","review":"After the first few chapters, I really started to dislike this book. The lead character is loathsome, the plot contains some really twisted moments, and the language is a bit more flowery than I normally prefer. However, like the title of my review says, STICK WITH THIS BOOK - it is worth it in the end. John Self (the hero/anti-hero of the novel) really started to grow on me. I actually began to sympathise with him and care what happens. While this was my first Amis novel, I doubt it will be my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"sketch w/o substance","review":"Like the other reviewers, I share an admiration for Amis' prose, creativity, and wit; unlike many others, however, I thought the book was pure, self-indulgent (no pun intended)..., a work of brilliant creativity, but lacking utterly in substance or thought. Beyond an amusing character sketch, it has no plot, says nothing new, and adds nothing beyond (still another) caricature of 80s materialism. After the first 100 pages, I could have skipped the remaining 250 -- same stuff repackaged, variations on a theme that, however creative, becomes a bore when it hits you that the book is not going anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely the best","review":"This is one of the most well-written and funny books you'll ever read. My copy has multiple dog ears because I keep going back to look up this or that hilarious passage: Lorne Guyland's rambling dissertations, John Self's drunken careen through a NY restaurant, the chess game near the end (an amazing metaphor-packed *action* scene that you'll read wide-eyed at the fact that anyone could write with such style). Some readers don't seem to understand that you're supposed to despise John Self while still marveling at his antics. I feel bad for those people; I feel pity for those people--oh yes. But for those who like densely written, wildly stylish fiction that also has a point, from a writer at the top of his game, you *must* read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that reflects your lowest experiences.","review":"\\"Money\\" is a book that reflects your lowest experiences, but it does with the hard to come by knowledge that life is not a simple, by-the-numbers exercise. Amis reconizes that everything -- experience, fun, sex, drugs -- is overrated; what really counts is honest human contact. And that is something that has escaped our present age. A wonderful, life-changing novel. Please read it, now!!! Besides all this, it is howlingly funny, and it skewers the superficial stylishness of our time like nothing yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"I decided to quit at p. 78.","review":"I wouldn't even give it one star. The best word I can find to describe this book is cheesey. It's about as compelling as a car wreck. I'm wondering how to get rid of it. I can't recommend it to a friend. It's not even amusing, just dumb and kind of annoying, especially a few pages before 78, when the narrator mentions the author, Martin Amis, by name, as someone whose stalking him. Just dumb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I loved London Fields, thought it was absolutely brilliant, so based on the ratings here picked up Money. It was entertaining for the first quarter of the book then really fell apart. I must admit I never finished it, I couldn't stand it anymore. I ran out of any empathy for the main character (in fact I began to hate him) and when M.A. inserts himself into the storyline it was too corny to handle. Pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drunks don't make interesting protagonists","review":"For the most part, I believe drunks like John Self in this novel, crazy people like the Australian pianist in the movie who's name I can't remember, and blow-hards like Citizen Kane don't make interesting protagonists.It takes a Dickens to create works of art based on characters whose mental life seems so circumscribed and repetitive."},{"rating":"1","title":"repetitive and shallow","review":"It is seldom that I leave a book without having finished it. It seemed to me to be extremely repetitive. John Self is (ha ha) an egotist advertisement-director Britishman who travels to the US to negotiate his first major film. An alcoholic and drug-addict, Self lives obssesed with a woman who cheats on him on a permanent basis. He gets drunk so many times it stops being funny. Amis can write and has a good sense of humor, but the story goes nowhere. Maybe other books by him are better."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"This is one of the worst books I¡ve ever read.

It's a fictionalized memoir of Julian, the last pagan Roman emperor. Nephew of Constantine, Julian suffered his father's murder by his cousin and spent his youth closely guarded, expecting he'd also be killed at any time. Early in his life, he planned to go into the priesthood, but reading Greek philosophy--combined with the bad examples of his Christian relatives--turned his views to the \\"old ways.\\" This is a fascinating account that shows Julian's transformation from a scared boy to a thoughtful and brave man to a clever emperor who, inevitably, reaches too far. After a little bit of a slow start, the book fascinated me."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new favortie book.","review":"I like history, especially about the Roman Empire.

But this is a movie that is worth seeing - not exactly a fun popcorn movie, but one that works to pass the time and, at the same time, trigger some thinking. I believe the movie does its best work in portraying the all-pervasive nature of the Nazi party and the corresponding youth movement. In the end, you wonder that anybody had the courage to resist, when it was so much easier to keep your head down and follow along with the crowd. The swing music adds a fun element, and I'm pondering picking up the soundtrack for the great music. As for Kenneth Branagh, I heard that this was the one movie he regrets making. Regret soulless pieces of garbage like Wild, Wild West, Mr. Branagh, and not movies that, at the very least, made the attempt at being something more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swing Kids: Just a good movie","review":"The movie made me want to get up ad dance.

In Swing Kids, the story is a bit strange, but it still works, in my opinion, because of the atmosphere and the great acting. Swing Kids is about two best friends who are torn apart during the Nazi-era; one becomes a full-blown Nazi, and the other, Thomas, wishes only for peace and justice---soon, the only thing that Thomas can rely upon is the up-beat swing music, something the Nazi's are fully against...worth checking out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFULLY PALATABLE LEARNING!!","review":"I saw this for the first time when I substituted for a history class, so I got to see it 5 times over 3 days. :) I loved the music and dancing. Beyond that, this was not just good family entertainment, but informative and a wonderful, and very palatable way to teach a little known segment of history to a sometimes resistant \\"student.\\" If this couldn't get around the resistant, then nothing can! It wasn't meant to be a documentary, (for those who are so critical), nor a more adult fare drama like Schindler's List. In fact, the documentary format is usually not so palatable, thus not so readily learned. BRAVO! Great movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated film!","review":"I was pleased to find Swing Kids has recently been released on DVD, since it has been out of print on video for many years. This is one of the most underrated films of the '90s - it is surprising how many people have not seen it or even heard of it. The cast is superb - Christian Bale, Robert Sean Leonard and Frank Whaley are excellent. The ending is truly heart-wrenching and unforgettable.

Yes, I have heard people say that the plot is pretty dumb--\\"Who would go to a concentration camp for dancing?\\" That may be true, but I think the real point was that he was standing up for something that he believed in.

However, I purchased the movie from z-shops, the other week. It is a good film, with good acting performances all-round. It also managed to capture the atmosphere of 1939 Hamburg, under the National Socialist regime and showed how hard it was for the those amongst Germany\`s youth who went against the prevailing Nazi flow. Because, make no mistake, the Hitler Youth membership accounted for 90% of German males aged between 14 and 18 years of age, by 1939. So, it would have been extremely hard for teenagers to resist the Nazi propaganda that was prevalent in all corners of 1939-German society. Swing Kids was all in all a good film, though the ending was far too corny for my tastes, been a 23 year old male.

The message seems to be that Hitler would have been OK if he'd just let those kids dance. It was pure punishment to sit through this mess, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with any love for the movies or any understanding of the Nazi era."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who knew the Holocaust was such a Hootenanny?","review":"The music is great and the actors try very hard to bring some credibility to this bouncy take on Nazi atrocities, but it's \\"based on actual events\\" stretched beyond recognition. Distinctly American actors, dialect and vernacular do nothing to enhance this schmaltzy soap opera full of stereotypes.The soundtrack, however, is a great collectible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost.... but all too corny in the end.","review":"This movie had a chance to be great. It took a subject of great importance and potential interest and threw in enough cornball lines (especially the goofy and uncomfortable ending \\"Swing Heil! \\") to put off anyone with half a brain.Robert Sean Leonard and Frank Whaley are good as usual, especially Whaley, but the dialogue is just too cheesy for any actor to pull off. Kenneth Branagh, who did well to keep his name off of the credits of this one, is also excellent as the official who lures Leonard into the Hitler Youth. This movie is also a good chance for people to see pre-ER Noah Wylie do a decent job with an odd role.All told, this movie was not nearly as good as it could have been. With better dialogue and more action, it really could have been a very good movie. Unfortunately, though, it gets lost in stupid lines/song quotes at the most inopportune times. See it, but don't get your hopes up too high."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swing Kids","review":"Swing KidsI really think that in the product description of movies you need to put a rating, and why it has the rating. This movie was well-acted, but the content was objectionable. This is not a family film. The foul language was not necessary. It was serious subject matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very silly, preposterous film","review":"Even though the dance numbers may be well choreographed and the time period is pretty realistically recreated, the idea of young people in 1940s Germany using swing music as a way to protest the politics of the time just seemed a little too far out and silly to me. Some of the dialogue here is just ridiculous (as are a lot of the set-ups of this movie). Even though it is well-intended and the messages here are clear, it just feels very odd and even unpleasant at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are these people thinking????","review":"Ok - I just had to write this review because there were so many rave reviews of this film. COME ON PEOPLE!!!! A movie about kids swing dancing to defeat the Nazis????? Even that one sentence sounds bad. Yes Kenneth Branaugh and Christian Bale are two of my favorite actors but they both need to be embarassed by this horrible film.This is ludicrous. What is hilarios about AMAZON.com is that you can put in any bad movie and see people who LOVE it. Just put in HOWARD THE DUCK as an example.Some of these people should not even watch movies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Supermergentroid!","review":"This one word (from the movie) sums it up. I watched it for the first time late at night and by myself. (don't do that) As I walked out of the room and up to bed, I wanted to do something amazing. I had tears pouring down my face and just wanted to inspire someone the way that 'Swing Kids' inspired me. This was before swing became popular. I didn't know how to swing, but after watching the movie, I knew I needed to start. It was a statement I needed to make. For all us swingers out there, I know how you feel, especially about this movie. I now swing dance to say something about myself. I am part of something. Something good. And like Peter, I will fight to keep my spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie...","review":"this movie was really good. it was kinda sad, too, but that peter guy was really hot... check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping Moving Account","review":"I have always been fascinated with the swing/holocaust era and Swing Kids combined the two in an amazing story with amazing actors and screen play.

The fact that it is directed in the style of \\"Dead Poets Society\\" is one of the few aspects I did not like. Otherwise I think it is a passionate, and rather informative movie about struggles of belief, and of course, the power of music.Jazz legend Dizzy Galespie, after learning of these kids, expressed his respect and admiration, and stated that it was a testament to the power of jazz: \\"Men have died for this music, you can't get more serious than that.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites!","review":"Excellent film with some history, some fun dancing and some serious tear jerking...The music and dancing is amazing in this film but the story is really powerful too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Swing Kids","review":"This movie moves your feet and your heart.

Since their paper several physicists tried to discuss and address this foundamental problem. The book by Selleri and Afriat is an exaustive analysis focusing on EPR paradox in several research fields of the physics. The book, starting from the original argument of EPR (chapter 1) goes down to all the proposed solutions for EPR paradox (chapter 5). Though, according to EPR arguments, Quantum Mechanics cannot be considered \\"complete\\" in describing the Physical Reality, this book can be surely considered \\"complete\\" in discussing the EPR paradox and its implications in modern physics."},{"rating":"1","title":"look elsewhere for better training methods","review":"The trainer in this training video uses negative-reinforcement techniques and physical manipulation consisting of aggressive alpha-rolling via limb twisting (to teach not to jump), digging your finger into a puppy's tongue (to teach it not to bite), forcing the puppy's hips down with hand (to teach it to sit), pulling front paws forward (to teach down), along with leash jerks (to teach come).There are much better and more effective ways to communicate with and train a puppy compassionately by using positive-reinforcement techniques.

Well I had problems installing it because it didn't fit over the rear tow loop and at the same time bolt up to the frame. Since I didn't have time to send it back and go through the hassle of ordering a different brand, I decided to modify the hitch so that it would fit over the tow loop. After finally getting it to bolt on, the twin tail pipes would rattle against the frame rail arms of the hitch because they were so close. I would not buy any Curt products again. I do not trust their quality control."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product does not fit a 2008 Hyundai Sonata","review":"This product does not fit a 2008 Hyundai Sonata. The tow hoop on the back of the car prevents you from installing the hitch, plus the bolts that came with the hitch to connect it to the frame were fine thread and you need a course thread.My advice is to buy a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really poor design -- installed on 2009 Hyundai Sonata","review":"I spent way too long trying to make this hitch fit my 2009 Hyundai Sonata. When I first lifted the hitch into place, the space between the mounting brackets and the weld-nuts on the frame rail was about 1/2\\" - 1\\". I tried using the supplied bolts but could not get them threaded because they were too short to make the gap. I went to the hardware store and got longer bolts. That helped, but I still had to first thread the passenger side and then use a jack to tweak the driver side into position. I should've paid the extra few bucks for the Hidden Hitch. The design looks a lot better and only uses a single bolt on the bracket so you do not need to move the muffler."},{"rating":"2","title":"The title track alone justifies your purchase","review":"As a songwriter, Julia is more of a photographer than a journalist.....she captures the essence of a particular feeling at a moment in time, melding together lyrics, melody, arrangement, and production to create a singular effect (or snapshot). At her best, this creates some wonderfully intense music. 'Swept' is a good album, but years later I'm drawn back chiefly to the hypnotic title track.....remembering what it felt like to be swept up in a new romance. Pop music doesn't get any more evocative than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"the silky chocolate voice\\"","review":"julia \\"what a VOICE\\" this beautiful lady has a silky voice that is so smooth,its just awesome. i can listen to her silky voice all day. this lady deserves to be more fames. \\"this lady can sing\\" amen"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"the silky chocolate voice\\"","review":"julia \\"what a VOICE\\" this beautiful lady has a silky voice that is so smooth,its just awesome.believe me!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless","review":"I'm a MSU Spartan and overall college and pro football fan who recently got married. My mother-in-law started watching the Spartan games now too but she didn't really know much about football. This book was the perfect primer for her. It's a fast and entertaining read and I was pleasantly surprised by Madden's writing style (and by his insights). I felt like a kid reading it and I couldn't help but read it in Madden's voice. He succinctly describes some of the basic rules, formations and jobs the players perform as well as why coaches call certain plays in specific situations. I completely recommend this book for anyone who has a family member or friend who is just getting into football. It doesn't get into the nuances between college and pro nor is it a complete explanation of the rules. What it does, it does very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joel Rosenberg has outdone himself!","review":"I have to say that I was thoroughly impressed with this outing. While most sequels are stale and transparent, Joel Rosenberg manages to take up where The Sleeping Dragon left off and create a mystical tale that keeps the readers attention from the first page to the last.Admittedly, I let out a yelp of joy when Karl announced to the slaver, \\"Tell you masters that I am hunting them!\\" It showed a glimmer of what was to come in this series (especially this installment), and it did not disappoint.I won't allow myself to announce any spoilers for those who haven't enjoyed this, but let me say that it was delightfully intriguing when the secret of Deighton was revealed. The implications of this information should have an enormous impact in future volumes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting Dated","review":"This was probably an ok book in 1996, but I really feel that it has lost relevance, many more couples these days are choosing not to have children, and I think the issues are different. I would like to see an updated book that talked about what the choice is like now. Some of the issues are still the same ... who do you leave your stuff to when you die, but that was not an issue I thought was well covered in the first place.The women Jeanne Safer seemed to interview for this book were also heavily weighted towards the arts/entertainment industry.

Thoroughly detailed, Caufield chronologically accounts the events of Easter Week, 1916. This is a good introduction for those researching the events of the week. Some of his characterizations of the individuals involved in the events are off a bit, or in some cases just plain wrong. Use this as a starting place in your research, but don't accept everything in this book as truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Èntertaining but not always accurate","review":"Caulfield's history is a good read and good fun, but has its odd moments - for instance he weirdly typifies the funny, dreamy, sweet-natured poet Thomas MacDonagh as \\"arrogant\\", which would have surprised those who fought by his side and were taught by him.

It is written very fluently, and it provides a great starter for those who are just getting into science. No, he doesn't cover all of the minor details, but how could he when the book covers everything from Copernicus to modern day science in only 600 pages?He does go into detail about the major shifts in science, like Darwin's Theory of Evolution and the Rules of Thermodynamics, but the rest he mentions and describes. This method works wonderfully, and this book proves to be a great way to do research. Got an essay on Thomas Young? Well, with this book you can read about him in a couple of pages and find other things that you could look up that you previously had not known about. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book - evolution as a FACT, not a theory","review":"This book is very entertaining and enlightening. It reminds us that Darwin did not introduce the idea of speciation, and that evolution is a FACT, not a theory. Kudos to Gribbin for always writing \\"the fact of evolution\\" rather than the \\"theory.\\" Especially since this is written to the general audience, this is great. Perhaps if more people just started writing like this, the general public would (slowly, perhaps over a few generations) change its views.It intertwines the scientists' lives with the science, bringing even the most brilliant into view as people (albeit of many different varieties).

I received the product in like new condition, I have been very happy with theService on this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"better late than never","review":"Been a Marty fan for a long time, really like his theme offerings like Pilgrim. This one didn't hit my radar screen until just recently and it did not disappoint. Soulful renderings, excellent musicianship, sincere connection to the Great Spirit. A new favorite in the collection. If you are into poetry, native American wisdom, or just good country/folk music, you'll enjoy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like I thought it would be","review":"I thought this would be a lecture on physics (and somewhat like Sagan's Cosmos) but it's more a lecture on philosophy and \\"one with the universe\\" pseudointellectual babble. I feel like I'm watching a lecture on \\"The Power of Now\\" more than a lecture by a scientist. I'm more disappointed that the description wasn't more clear about that than anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"May I suggest Another Book?","review":"I used this book for Japanese 1 and had to retake Japanese 1 in San Diego because I wasn't up to par with the Japanese 2 students. Key in the ISBN #0-8248-0881-9, Learn Japanese: New College Text Volume II; of couse the Volume I is also avaliable. I used both volumes and plan to goto the third. NTC's book was OK to satisfy the foriegn language requirement, but I wouldn't use it if I were planning on speaking Japanese or planning on taking Japanese at another school, my instructor was native Japanese and disliked it more than I. The price is totally unacceptable! Learn Japanese: New College Text is $12 at Amazon.Com, and I speak Japanese with confidence; where as NTC's Basic Japanese is $53, and I was being corrected, and ultimately had to retake Japanese 1 because of the lack of Kanji, vocabulary, and sentence structure knowledge. This is 100% my opion, and not Amazon.com's."},{"rating":"1","title":"NTC's Basic Japanese","review":"I've never personally used this book, but I have reviewed it in a class focused on teaching Japanese as a foreign language. This book is probably one of the worst I've seen. Much of the Japanese used in this book sounds odd to non-foreign Japanese speakers and is often inaccurate and some examples are just plain wrong. For example the book translates \\"Warui tenki desu ne\\" as \\"It's warm today.\\" when it really means \\"The weather is bad, don't you think?\\" Many of the lessons are not organized well, and absolutely no explanation is given on grammar patterns covered within the book; instead of letting students figure out how to use grammar patterns within other sentences by explaining how they work the book seems to focus on just teaching raw phrases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use","review":"I had an electric steraliser (which died) before buying this one. I wish I had had this steraliser all along. It's so easy to load up, everything fits snuggly and has it's place (I had trouble with bottles falling over in my electric steraliser), and extremely easy to wash and keep clean (the electric steraliser was a pain to clean - especially the element).As we use Avent bottles - 4 fit perfectly and are steralised in 8 minutes (our microwave isn't very powerful). From the instructions it looks like other bottles fit easily as well.I use this daily and haven't had a problem with it - easy to use, easy to secure the lid and I use it for my bottles and dummies.Recommended if you are using bottles and especially the Avent brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not worth it.","review":"I have to admit, being a first time mom, I wanted the BEST for my baby. I wanted the bottles, the pump and pacifers to be sterile. I found the same problem with the condensation. It was more of a hassle than a help. When my lactation specialist informed me it wasn't neccesary to sterilize everything after each use, I didn't see the point... Hot soapy water works just fine. Save your money for something you will need; like diapers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Those Without Dishwashers!","review":"I am one of those without a dishwasher, unfortunately. I use this sterilizer a few times a day for my baby's bottles and parts. I don't use Avent bottles - works fine with other bottles. I have to agree about making sure it's shut/snapped properly. You have to make sure it's just right before you snap -- otherwise, you will break a nail or two. Also exercise caution when taking it out of the microwave. I always use an oven mitt to take it out and when opening the lid to avoid steam burns."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am soooo glad I registered for this!","review":"The express steam sterilizer is really the easiest and most efficient way to go if you want to be assured that your baby's bottles are truly clean. When I first started using bottles I would use the sterilizer between dishwasher uses. But after repeated cleanings in the dishwasher, the ounce markings on the bottles started to fade away, and the plastic caps to cover the nipples started to change color. From then on I've used the sterilizer exclusively. It is quick, easy and effective. I have taken several extended trips with the baby, and it is so easy to travel with and store her clean bottles in. This is one of those products that may not be necessary to have, but I am so glad that I do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a quick way to sterilize bottles and especially pump!","review":"i found that if i rinsed the bottles with cold water after they were sterilized, they dried much quicker. this sterilizer has worked well for me, but i don't know that i'd purchase it again, as i don't sterilize this terribly often. the dishwasher seems to work just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indispensible, Portable and Affordable","review":"This sterilizer is absolutely wonderful, especially if you take your baby on the road, i.e. to the grandparents' house. If they've got a microwave, then you're ready to go.It's also very durable. Ours gets lots of use every day and yet looks like it just came out of the box brand new. Plus, unlike a bottle warmer appliance, there are no moving part or electrical components to wear out or break, so we expect we'll be using ours for years/babies to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Have!!!","review":"This has been a lifesaver!!! It can sterilize 5 small bottles & nipples 5 minutes at a time!!! Just add the correct amount of water, pop it in the microwave, and go!!! It's saved me so much time and hassle... At first, I didn't think that I wanted to spend the money on a sterilizer when I thought I could boil them myself for free, but this has more than paid for itself in it's first 3 weeks of use... A definate must have for new moms!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulky","review":"Too bulky, I ended up returning it. I love the Avent bottles but found this to be useless. I sanitized my bottles in the dishwasher instead with sani rinse cycle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!","review":"I bought this product thinking it would be a very good purchase with the bottles included, but I soon came to realise that the avent bottles leak b/c the top doesn't seal properly. This happens with all 4 bottles and is very disappointing since I thought Avent was a good product recommended by mother's worldwide. The sterilizer has been the best part of this purchase as it definitely comes in handy when you don't have a full load in the dishwasher and you want a clean bottle in a matter of minutes. I wouldn't recommend the bottle especially with being a first time mom - it just adds to the stress and lets face it, who needs more stress with a newborn!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"I thought this would be a great way to get my bottles clean but you still have to scrub them clean first yourself, THEN prepare this thing to stick in the microwave for x-amt of time, THEN wait for it to cool.... too much to do prior to getting a bottle ready for a fussy baby!<br /><br />If your baby has an immune promblem, then this may be great for you, otherwise, skip on this and just buy a nice bottle brush.... I like the one by Munchkin.<br /><br />BUT if you still decide to get this, check it in the store first, because when I got mine home it was USED- it had obvisiously been returned (someone else thought it was useless too I guess) with milk residue on the bottles- yuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate this","review":"I can't stand this product! It's a pain to fit four bottles, nipples, and rings in! Have trouble getting the lid on and off! I have had a problem with it spotting bottle nipples white mostly the gerber one's! Had trouble tell what wattage my microwave is! It's a lot bigger than I thought it was making it hard to store! The only things I do like are sterilized no worry bottles and it cleans pacifiers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Choose another way to sterilize your bottles","review":"After watching the news, I never will put plastic in the microwave again.

I don't know about you, but I don't want my baby getting breast cancer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"If you've dropped the bottle and nipple in toxic waste, this might be more helpful than washing in hot water with antibacterial soap or a dishwasher. Otherwise, I think washing the bottles is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE this sterilizer...makes life with newborn easier!","review":"I am the mother of a 7 week old little boy, I didn't give a thought to having a steralizer since I am breastfeeding. I always knew that I would have to return to work and eventually introduce a bottle. I bought the Avent Isis breastpump and it was such a hassle to boil it every day. I saw this product on the Avent website and knew that I had to have it. I pop the pump into the rack...add 7oz of water and throw the whole thing into the microwave...nothing could be easier. Another great product from a great company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timesaver","review":"This product is so easy and efficient when sterilizing anything from bottle nipples, pacifiers, breast pump accessories and bottles. Beats boiling all these items!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth The Cash","review":"Like many others, I did not think about getting a sterilizer until it came time to wash those bottles by hand and then boil them to be sterilized. This product proved to be well worth the money. It was fast,safe, and easy. I also got a great satisfaction of know that my daugthers bottles were sanitized."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speedy way to sterilize","review":"We love this sterilizer. It is quick, easy to use, and fits other brands as well. We wouldn't want to sterilize any other way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"It takes 4 minutes to sterilize lots of bottles, nipples, passifiers and even some toys. Very useful for busy moms with no time to be boiling water. Just be careful with the steam when you open it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have!","review":"This sterilizer is great! It is easy-to-use and it works with different types of bottles / cups / pacifiers / etc. We used Avent and Ventaire bottles and both fit in this sterilizer. At first, I didn't think we'd get much use out of it, but it's perfect for when you need to sterilize those baby items but don't have enough to run the dishwasher (or if you don't have a dishwasher!). Now I recommend it to all new moms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy as 1-2-3","review":"I got this as a shower gift. It works great. Very simple, just put the bottles in and pop it in the microwave.

But all in all, it's a great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick & Easy","review":"Does the job in the microwave, add some water, throw it in, and your done. Worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Have for Bottles & Binkies","review":"I would put this on a must-have list for new parents. I gave the sterilizer 4 instead of 5 stars because of the price. $30 seems a lot to pay for essentially a plastic bowl with a lid. But I suppose I've gotten my money's worth, because I still use it several times a day to sanitize breast pump parts, bottles, nipples, and pacifiers. I'm not a germaphobe, but I get peace of mind knowing that the nipples and pacifiers I'm putting into my infant's mouth have been sanitized. It's especially good for pacifiers, which are always getting dropped on the floor - you don't have to wait until you run your dishwasher, you can always pop the sterilizer in the microwave on a moment's notice. Just be careful and make sure the items you plan to sanitize can withstand the heat - for example, some pacifier cases are meant to be sanitized but others will melt in the steam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life saver","review":"This is truly a life saver. No boiling of water. Simply wash bottles and place in sterilizer. Set in microwave for 4 minutes [pending on microwave watts]. That is it ready for breast milk or formula. You can use any bottles not just avent. We use Dr. Browns 8 oz bottles and fit 3 bottles no problem. This sterilizer and bottle warmer are a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I have never used an Avent bottle, but found this sterilizer a life saver. Using the Playtex nurser system since my 3-month old was born I only needed to sterilize nipples, but I also used a Medela pump for 8 weeks and this is great to sterilize those parts as well, which has to be done every day. Anyone who has pumped knows that you have NO time for extra cleaning!I am not using it as much right now, since I can wash nipples by hand after the two month mark, but I'm sure I will use it occasionally in the future and for the next baby. It is sooooo convenient!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for this Breastfeeding Mother","review":"I love this sterilizer. I am a breastfeeding mother and use the Avent Isis to pump milk from time to time. This sterilizer fits the Isis perfectly along with a few bottles, nipples and sealing discs. I wash my bottles out after I use them and put them away. When I'm ready to pump, I load this up and 7 minutes later I'm good to go. You don't need to dry the bottles or pump before using, if you use them right away. When I'm done, I wash my pump and store it back in here to dry. It stays there until I'm ready to use it again. I've never tried sterilizing any other bottles but the instructions specify how to place others in here so they fit well. It is very time saving, rinses easily, and works very well. I'm glad I've never had to resort to the boiled water on the stove."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Useful","review":"I bought this a few months ago and after reading a little about it, I thought that I wouldn't use it. Boy, was I wrong. I use it for all sorts of things.My niece dropped a sippy cup of juice in my car that wasn't discovered for a week. I washed the cup. When I removed the valve...NASTY. I don't think it's ever been taken apart and washed. After a second washing, I put all of the parts in this and let the microwave work it's magic.I love the lift out tray because whatever's in there that I'm sterilizing isn't sitting in the water. It can also hold the Avent Isis breast pump. The sterilizer is actually a great place to store your pump when it's just been cleaned and not in use."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the few MUST BUYS on the planet!","review":"Don't even think twice about buying this...as Nike says...\\"Just do it\\"! The system is easy to use, the bottles are as sterile as a NASA lab (THAT is pretty darn sterile). It is durable as well, mine has lasted through two children (and is on loan to a friend for their newborn) I cannot imagine any other way to handle the bottles. BTW, buy the bottles and nipples, truely the best choice out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"lid doesn't close","review":"I got this sterilizer because of the Avent name. My main complaint is that the lid doesn't lock into the base when closing. You have to use alot of power for it to close. I have to place it on the floor and stand on it for the sides to lock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple for the whole family!","review":"I am a first time breastfeeding mom who is preparing to go back to work. This sterilizer is so simple for my husband who will be bottlefeeding our daughter while I am at work. Great quality and construction. I would recommend this product to any family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Investment","review":"My daughter is nearly 6 mo. old now, and we have been using this item since I started using a breast pump when she was 3 weeks old. It is still in great shape, and I imagine that it will still be when we have another baby in a few years. It is so quick and easy to use, and it really gives you that added peace of mind about your child's health. Just add 7 oz. of water and set the microwave on 4 minutes. Word of caution: the sterilizer does get EXTREMELY HOT (in order to do its job), so don't even try to handle it with your bare hands...use oven mitts. I use a Medela Pump in Style and the milk containers for it fit nicely into this sterlizer. I recommend this item to everyone that uses a bottle, either occasionally like me or those that strictly bottle feed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"more downside than upside","review":"I am breastfeeding but offer my baby bottles every now and then. This was pricey - there was another brand that was much less, but this one attracted me because it holds the Avent pump pieces. Well, this just means that there are some slots that the pump clicks into. I have not bothered with that 'feature' since the pump sits in it fine even if you just lay it on the rack (ie the pump will fit in any sterilizer!).My biggest peeve with this is that the bottles and pump are covered with condensation when you take them out - if you leave them on a bottle dryer it takes more than 24 hours to dry them. I rinsed this every time I used it but there are water stains in the bottom still - it really needs to be scrubbed out. It is just making extra work!I am putting this away after using it for two weeks since my Doctor said that it is really not necessary (the dishwasher or hot soapy water are fine, he said). So for me this was an expensive countertop decoration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my express sterilizer","review":"Who needs to watch the pot boil when you can sterilize your equipment in 5 mins? This microwave sterilizer is fast, clean and efficient. You can sterilize just about anything in it from bottles to pump parts, from feeding equipment to bottle brushes. The plus is that you don't get the lime scale on your equipment that you would if you boil stereilzed.This sterilizer fits all size bottles.If you use bottles for your young baby, you need one of these sterilzers.A great shower gift!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works OK...but I didn't need it","review":"The Express Microwave Steam Sterilizer works OK, but I didn't need it. All that was needed was to boil all of the bottles once before the first use, then wash them with hot soapy water after subsequent uses. The Advent bottles that come with the steamer do not seal well and leak when you shake up the formula. I wish I had not purchased this...it was not needed and now takes up space in my cupboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do people like this???","review":"I don't understand why people like this product!?! I bought this because I didn't want to boil my bottles anymore. I use both Avent and Dr.Brown bottles and everything seemed to fit just fine.... so what - After 4 minutes I had to rewash everything and then boil it because EVERYTHING I put in the sterilizer came out FULL of condensation and with a VERY VERY strong smell of plastic. The only way to get rid of the smell and the condensation was to re-wash, re-boil. I put the product in the dishwasher several times hoping it would reduce the plastic smell and tried the process again (several times). The results were exactly the same. So basically, whenever you feel like washing bottles, then sterilizing, then washing again, then boiling -then and only then should you use this ... product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"This was given to us as a shower gift. It is a great product ,very easy and practical. We use it to sterilize bottles,pacifiers,my brest pump parts.. it only takes 4 minutes and its done. My mom thought it was great,she said when my siblings and I were born boiling on the stove was the only option and she wished they had stuff like this then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessary, but ok","review":"I'm a new Mom, which means I'm boiling everything the baby touches. I'm not knocking Avent. I love the bottles and the breast pump, but this sterilizer is hard to use (only a Ph.D. in engineering could get the bottle parts in the M.C. Escher design outlined in the user's guide.) and it turns out we don't need it. Our pediatrician and lactation consultant assured us that the diswasher gets the bottle parts hot enough to sufficiently sterilize them.Now I only use it for the breast pump parts, which again, is working great for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes life easier","review":"It is so easy to keep bottles and pumping material sterile with this piece. I do not find the lid difficult to put on like another reviewer said. I wish it were bigger, so it could get all my double pumping materials and two bottles in at once, but I understand that not everyone has a huge microwave like I do.When our dishwasher broke this saved my life. If you already use your dishwasher for sterilizing bottles etc, you may find this helps when you don't want to wait for a whole dishwasher load. I really like how simple this is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great TIME and WATER saver","review":"This product is great and NOT just a gadget. While I do run my bottles through the dishwasher when I don't want or need to run a full load this product is a life saver. I can sterelize 6 bottles (or sippy cups or pump parts) and have them ready to go in 5 or so minutes. I don't have to run an entire load of dishes in the washer or wait and hour and half to have them ready, this sterilizer gets the bottles ready quickly and with little water usage. Would recommend to anyone with a baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth The Money","review":"This was a product that every mother should have it was definitely hard to part with when my daughter got older. It cleans not only avent but dr.Brown bottles too when placed correctly. It's definitely worth the money and its very efficient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't have done without it","review":"I would recommend this steamer for anyone who plans on using bottles, breast pump and or pacifiers. Since I was nursing i didn't buy a lot of bottles and hated to run the dishwasher for 3 or 4 bottles. But when you need them, you need them and this steamer was awesome. Just load the bottles, etc and water and zap in the microwave and in a matter of 5 minutes or so they're ready to go. I would list this as a must have and have recommended it to a couple of friends who have tried it and feel the same way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This sterlizer is so easy and convenient to use.

We sterilize lots of stuff in it, including toys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't useful at all","review":"I added this item in my baby registry but was not of any use at all. I didnot know that most manufatures recommend not to microwave or steam sterelize bottles. The same is true with nipples. Latex nipples can't even be boiled. So if your child has difficulty taking the bottle and you try out different brands and different nipples, this does not work.This is the one thing in my registry which i could not use much. I will not recommend it to anybody who won't be able to stick to this brand of bottles, becuase if you choose to breast feed the baby makes the choice of the bottle he likes :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for those who don't run dishwasher every day","review":"I bought this before my son was born and now that he's here, it is a lifesaver! My husband and I believe in the power of good old-fashioned \\"elbow grease\\" and we wash our dishes by hand and use our dishwasher as a drying rack (unless we cook a really big or involved meal).The baby is our first, so we don't really make enough dishes to run the dishwasher all the time, anyway.This sterilizer allows us to sterilize everything for baby's feeding without having to waste all the water used to run a full dishwasher cycle. I especially like that you can use it any way, you don't have to put everything into the little pre-designated slots if you don't want to. When dealing with a newborn, sometimes it's all you can do to get all the bottles, rings, nipples, etc. piled into the thing before you have to tend to the baby.Be careful though when you first take this out of the microwave. The sterilizer itself can get hot enough to make you wince."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product","review":"I have gotten alot of use out of my sterilizer. It's nice that it only takes 4 minutes in an average microwave to get 4 bottles or one breast pump and 2 bottles sterilized. My only complaint is that the items stay wet and have to be dried off which means they're not sterile anymore, I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the Job, But a few drawbacks","review":"This item is very fast and somewhat convenient to use. We are first time parents and are trying to keep everything (Bottles etc..) sterile as possible. Yes, everytime we have used the the Sterileizer it has condensation left in the top lid and it is sometimes a little hard to open up. Overall, it is just simply faster and seems to get the bottles very sterile. We have used this product approx. 2 weeks. I would reccommend this product for other parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very convenient and easy to use","review":"This product has been very helpful. At first I thought it's a waste of money since we can boil the bottles. But boiling is a big hassle, and you really don't have time for it! The reason I gave the product only 4 stars is because the bottles do come out with condensation, and it's hard to get rid of it. All in all my husband and I are happy with this bottle sterilizer."},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome!","review":"I love this product. It only takes 4 min. and 4 bottles are done. This was the best present I received!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I absolutely love using the Avent Express Microwave Steam Sterilizer for sterilizing the bottles! It's quick and easy to use. It sure beats waiting for the water to come to a boil and then having to boil the bottles. Definitely a time saver!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, but not really necessary","review":"This product is easy to use, works well and is FAST . . . and everyone knows that time is precious is a new baby. I use Advent bottles & pacifiers and they fit perfect as do all the parts to my Medela breast pump. I don't use the sterilizer every time anymore since my daughter is a little older now. I run the bottles & pacifiers though the dishwasher so I feel comfortable with the heat they get from that. This sterilizer is great though as it is very light weight and easy to store in between uses. It's up to you & your doctor whether you need a sterilizer, but if you do decide to get one, definitely get this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for those without dishwashers","review":"We don't have a dishwasher so I throw everything in the sterilizer (bottles, breastpump parts, binkies, etc.)after washing with soap and water. It is easy to use, just throw items in, 7 ounces of water and microwave for 7 minutes. I use this sterilizer daily.I only gave it four stars because I put in the breast shield from my First Years breast pump and it melted a bit where the shield sat in the appropriate slot. I can still use the breast shield but there is a permanent dent melted into it. Otherwise, I love this sterilizer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product!","review":"This is an excellent product, especially for busy new moms. Not only does it hold 4 Aevnt bottles and the breast pump, but it also holds up 6 regular sized Gerber bottles and 2 small Gerber bottles - total 8 bottles!! It is very convenient as it works quickly in the microwave at an average of 6 minutes. The price is great for the value you get from it. I highly recommend it over the stove top types. I have been using it for 5 1/2 months now and it is still sturdy so I expect it to last me for quite a while. The dome is high enough that it could sterilize items that baby uses other than bottles. This definitely one of those products that will \\"grow\\" with your baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sterilizing made easy","review":"I received the Express Microwave Steam Sterilizer as a baby shower present and I plan on giving it to any friend expecting in the future. This product makes sterilizing bottles, nipples, breast pumps, and pacifiers easy. I can't imagine making bottles without it, within 6 minutes everything is ready for bottle making.The sterilizer fits four bottles, including the nipple, cap and ring at one time. After four minutes in the microwave(depending on the microwave, you mat have to leave it in for a longer period of time depending on the wattage of your microwave) and 2 minutes cooling off the bottles are ready to be filled.This is a definite recommendation, this product makes bottle making easier...after all being a new mom we need all the help we can get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super easy!!","review":"WOW! This product is a lifesaver! No more boiling bottles. I wash my bottles, fill with 7 oz. of water, cover, microwave, and POOF - sterilized bottles and nipples in 4 minutes. A word of caution, make sure to let it cool before opening the top as the steam gets VERY hot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spend time with the kids, not Sterilizing","review":"Wow, what a great product. I purchased this for my sister - who just had twins. This saves her HOURS of preparation as she is very careful to have no germs anywhere near her precious babies. As a 31 yar-old first-time mom, she cried and was worried that she couldn't handle motherhood when she initially got home with her twin preemies. Products like this really made the transition much easier for her, and after four weeks, she feels pretty confident with what she's done and learned already. This product is a *snap* to use, and she can spend her available time doing other needed things. I highly recommend this to every new mom - ESPECIALLY of multiples!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thing since sliced bread","review":"This sterilizer is so easy to use even a dad like me can use it. The tray holds all types of bottles, caps, etc. Best of all, the bottles are clean and sterilized in four minutes, without boiling water or running a half-full dishwasher.I know, the price seems high, but this is one luxury that is truly a necessity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sterilizer vs. Dishwasher","review":"In reading the reviews from those who feel that a dishwasher works just as well as this sterilizer, I wanted to add my view. I live in an area where water is expensive. We ration water during the summer and have set schedules of when we can water our yards or wash our cars, etc. So running the dishwasher vs. using 7 ounces of water to sterilize my bottles is a no-brainer.We were using the Medela steam bags before I found this, which only steam 2 bottles at most at a time. Then I couldn't find any replacement bags, and they are supposed to only be good for a limited amount of uses.I have gotten a lot of use out of this sterilizer and I like its convenience.

Avent says this is not possible, but what a cooincidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"too hard to open","review":"I found that the lid was almost impossible to get open after use. and the bottles had to be sqeaky clean before going in to be sterilized because they would still have residue when they came out. too me this sterilizer added an un-needed step. I never used mine. It kept me breastfeeding anyway made me decide bottles were too much of a pain. Use the playtex diposables nurser system- it's sooo much simpler anyway, less accessories, less clutter. I'm way dissapointed with all of my avent products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very handy porta-breast","review":"My mom is breast-feeding my baby sister, Juliette. We travel a lot and it was hard to travel with a two-month-old infant who is constantly crying and sometimes demands frequent feedings. My dad suggested switching to bottle-feeding, since it would be more portable and mom wouldn't have to unbuckle her seat belt and get into the back to nurse Juliette which caused traffic. But mom didn't want to, because she has heard that bottle-fed babies tend to weigh more and have more food allergies. Mom got smart and bought this cone-shaped pump and set of two small bottles to pump breast formula into the bottles. Now, mom pumps the milk into the bottle and passes the bottle to me. I give Juliette her bottle and she drinks. Now we don't get into traffic and Juliette still gets the nutrition she needs and also, bottle nipples tend to help her through the teething and sucking phase."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best item on my registry!","review":"This is such a great item and I can't say enough good things about it! I use it several times a day for pacifiers, baby bottles, and breast pump bottles. It couldn't be easier than popping things in the microwave for 5 minutes and knowing that your baby is getting sterilized items.A word of advice- be careful about removing it from the microwave. The water inside and the steam can scald if you are not cautious. Let it sit for a few minutes before opening, because the water can splash when opening the lid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect if you don't have dishwasher","review":"I don't have a dishwasher, so this saves me the hassle of having to boil water and sterilizing. It says that everything inside will remain sterilized as long as you keep the lid on. But then how will it all get dried? That's the only down side. You're suppose to take out the water after 2 minutes, but you have to leave the lid off or else the water won't evaporate. When you boil water to sterilize, the water inside the bottles evaporate much more quickly. This uses steam, so condensation is still left inside the bottles. Just so you know. Don't get me wrong, I like it a lot and it saves me time, I use it to sterilize my bottles and pump parts every night. Just wished it allowed the water to evaporate more quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love This Product","review":"I am so thankful for the Steam Sterilizer. I am very careful to keep all of my son's things sterilized and the microwave sterilizer makes it quick and easy. I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"USED IT ALL THE TIME.....","review":"When I bought this item I wasn't sure I'd use it all the time, but I ended up proving myself wrong. It always seemed that I would run out of clean bottles before the dishwasher would get full and so I would just throw the bottles and nipples right in the microwave and instantly they would be sterilized. It's much faster than waiting for your dishwasher to run its course. Also, this worked great with pacifiers and small plastic toys that had been dropped on the floor or handled in public places. Just throw them in this sterilizer and they too get cleaned."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think its great","review":"No more plugs to plug in or pots to boil. Just pop it in the microwave and walk away. It fits all of her bottles and pacifiers in one process and it fits perfectly in my small kitchen when I am not using it. Definatly worth buying! you will get good use out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO EASY","review":"I used to HATE sterilizing bottles. Now it is a cinch.1. Place the bottles, pacifiers, pump accesories, etc. in the unit. Even has premade places to put AVENT bottles and accessories. Also, works great with Medela pump system.2. Add 7 oz of water, which I measure out with my bottles.3. Microwave for 4-7 minutes(according to microwave wattage.4. Walk away. No waiting for water to boil or chasing tiny parts or anything for that matter out of boiling water.5. Allow to cool for 2 minutes.First Years drying rack works great with this.Handles would be a nice addition to help remove from the microwave, but otherwise it is such a GREAT product that that almost seems like a mute point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing's Easier or Better","review":"I purchased this product after realizing that boiling water to sterilize things was as much fun as going to the dentist. I love the fact that you can just load up the sterilizer much like you do your dishwasher and add the reccomended amount of water, four minutes in your microwave and you have sterilized your pump, your bottles or whatever. You can leave the items in the sterilizer for a couple of hours and they still remain sterile. Most importantly with this product is that it's quick and simple and easy and with a newborn, you need things that make your life as simple as possible. Avent has scored another hit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use and convenient","review":"This is such an easy to use product!!!

I started using distilled water to boil my bottles, but I was going through about gallon a day and that starts to get expensive. I saw this and had to try it.I absolutely love it! (The product description says it comes with 2 bottles, but mine came with 4!) It is so much faster and easier and safer than boiling water on the stove, and since it only takes 7 ounces of water, a gallon of distilled water goes a long way. It only takes 5 minutes, so I can have sterile items quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A must have!","review":"This is one of the best baby products that I own!

There are other options out there, all glass bottles are safe, as well as Born Free, Mam by Sassy, Green to Grow and Adrini. Do your own research. I'm really surprised the non Bisphenol -A Free bottles haven't been recalled yet! I'm sure it's just a matter of time, before enough people are educated."},{"rating":"2","title":"great item","review":"This is a great item if you don't run the dishwasher alot. We don't need to run ours daily, so the sterilizer works great and takes very little time. Get a drying rack though, because the items will need to dry if you're not using them immediately. Once I got a lot of bottles, I started running the dishwasher more and this became obsolete."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Cleanaholics only","review":"OK - I admit that I registered for this product and thought it would be an important item to ensure my baby's health. Then I spoke with the mother of six children (who are all grown and very healthy) who raised her children while doing mission work in West Africa.

We just drop them all in, add the water and set the microwave for 4 minutes. Viola! Clean and sterile paci's! The only thing you have to remember to do is get them out and lay them on a paper towel to dry. Also, squeeze the nipples (with a clean hand) to get the excess water out. It works great for his spoons too, non metal ones of course! Great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!

Since I was afraid I would leave items boiling on the stove, I got the Express Microwave Sterilizer.. Once I figured out how to make the bottles attach to the little tags, it was a breeze!! It is a little annoying that I have to throw my plastic and metal caps into the dishwasher and that the pacifiers only go for 1/2 the time that the bottles do. But otherwise..GREAT PRODUCT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Successful Sterilizing","review":"What an ease it finally is to sterilize everything...And I mean everything! I am a breastfeeding mom and pumping. I put all of my pumping supplies into this sterilizer as well as the Avent bottles. It is great for Medela's tubing without worrying if boiled water is too hot to melt them. I simply wash the bottles by hand by flipping over the large container as my wash basin, place them in the sterilizer bin, pour water, set in microwave, and it is done! What parent couldn't live with out it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product! Love it!","review":"It's been using a couple times everyday since I bought it.Easy to use and quick sterilizing.

From day one I've been using the Avent Express II Steam Sterilizer which is similar to the Philips Avent Express but it is bigger; and I am very happy with my purchase. I use it to sterilize not only bottles, nipples, pacifiers, etc., but also for my breast-pump items and it works very good. It is easy to use, clean, not heavy, it does the job real quick and only uses 200 ml of water to steam sterilize things. As other reviewers have pointed out, I have also read that as long as the baby is full term it is not necessary to sterilize bottles etc- the dishwasher does the job. However, if you are a working mom -as I am, with little time to cook and are not using the dishwasher frequently, It is faster and cheaper to use the Avent Sterilizer than the dishwasher -you save money on energy, water and also save time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"this is a lot faster than using a pan of boiling water and a lot faster/safer and energy efficient than using a dishwasher. all it takes is 4 minutes!!!!for those who complain about residue: you really are supposed to WASH YOUR BOTTLES THOROUGHLY b4 sterilising them! it is a steriliser...not a CLEANER/WASHER!!!for those who complain about leaky bottles...do not tighten it close too hard!for those who complain about hot steam...you are supposed to wait AT LEAST 2 MINUTES after the sterilising is complete b4 trying to open the steriliser!frankly, i dont know why people do not read manufacturer directions! this is a great product if used correctly and it deserves all 5 STARS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't bother.","review":"We found that this was a waste of money. It is just as easy for us to sterilize the old fashioned way. You can't fit all of the bottles you need sterilized in the steam sterilizer at the same time.

This does not apply to the text itself (it is the Nestle-Aland 27th ed., and it's the best we can have) but to the critical apparatus offered.First of all, very few textual variants are chosen (and arbitrarily so), so that you may miss important evidence even for some crucial points. Of course, of these few variants we are told how all the Coptic versions stand, and what Athanasius (remember him?) quoted about. If the variants are chosen haphazardly, what is the point of all this, specially for translators?The third edition had a most elegant, big greek typeface, a delight to the eyes. In the fourth one, we've lost even that.So, stand by (or even switch to) the Nestle-Aland 27th ed., just in greek or bilingual.

It is so well regarded that you should see what all the fuss is about.For me, however, it was such a disappointment that I turned it off before I got half way through. Each situation seemed like more of the same, which I suppose is great when you're enjoying it. But I found the humor forced and stale.

The acting is fine, as could be expected from such greats as Hepburn and Cary Grant. But the characters are not sympathetic, fun or interesting.

Cary Grant has a few mildly amusing moments, but Katharine Hepburn's character is simply excruciatingly unfunny. And she's so shrill most of the time! I didn't crack even a smile at any of her antics. Tonight, I was bored to the point that I actually fell asleep while I was watching.

The screwball comedy was never better and alas never will be better. I suppose you could say this is a gimmick picture as they use a live leopard in a number of scenes. The Cary Grant brontosaurus has a small part as well.Hepburn sees Cary the four-eyed prof and goes after the befuddled handsome man with everything a 1930's girl has. Madcap motor-mouth one liners rip away. Cary is embarrassed, disgraced, and horrified for ninety minutes till Hepburn cannot be denied. Amazing fast pace and editing for one of the finest comedies ever made; it can be watched again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old time movies","review":"I grew up with the older movies and so have my daughters--the general population or my kids friends do not even know who Cary Grant or Katherine Heprun are---These movies are classics and it is a shame they do not show them on cable"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gary Grant Movies","review":"For those who love Gary Grant movies, this is one of several best movies he has made, the other being North by Northwest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding slapstick comedy","review":"Bringing up Baby may be an oldie but it is most definetly a goodie. Cary and Katherine may be the stars but we can not count out George the dog or Baby the leopard. All the action is fast paced and the supporting cast was well picked.I would reccomend this movie to anyone who wants a good storyline, lots of crazy action and laughs. This movie is one year older than I am but it is timeless. It belongs in everyones collection. I'm not too good at these reviews but I really think this movie is the best!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful comedy.","review":"The comedic timing is remarkable.

Cary Grant is a paleontologist who needs one more bone to complete a dinosaur skeleton; he runs into Katherine Hepburn, an heiress, who owns a dog named George and a leopard named Baby. George steals the bone, Baby gets loose, and everyone ends up in a rural Connecticut jail, among other things. In the end the bone is recovered, but the skeleton collapses; of course Grant and Hepburn are left with each other. Almost nothing in the movie is connected with reality, and although it's not the funniest movie ever made, it's among the zaniest. Definitely worth a watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"for dog barking incessantly lovers....","review":"grasping at straws for comedy gold when the cacophony of that darn dog barking and being most uncooperative and shrill voices at the same annoying levels just kept me rolling over from....??? hmmmm, the PR surrounding this mess created such an air of expectation and the joy of wanting to love a film to be thus misinformed and deflated makes for one unhappy reviewer... madcap....mad yes, cap unclear... abs adore the leads and guess the leopard twins should have parlayed comical excitement but I have laughed so much harder at silent films i.e. Buster K. or Charlie... oh well, so sorry can't recommend except for cultural refs as it is included in the top 100..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never a better time","review":"This is not merely one of the finest screwball comedies - it is also one of the funniest,most charming,most energetic and most inventive comedies ever made.Beautifully directed - almost unnoticeably,in fact,which is how it should be with a great comedy - and superbly acted - not just by the brilliantly intelligent and playful Grant and the cast-against-type Hepburn,but also by the likes of the crafty Walter Catlett,the ever-reliable May Robson and the gloriously artful Charlie Ruggles - this is a fabulously engrossing comic fantasy.Buy it,watch it,and then return to watch it over and over again.It never loses its magic.It really is a genuine delight.(Completists might also like to track down the colorized version:sacrilege,I know,but the colour is not too bad,and -this is really sad!- this particular print is a fraction longer than the current black-and-white version)."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Problem with DVD","review":"There is one problem with this DVD.

This was an exception, as it was rated so highly on AFI's top 100 movies of all time, as well as other lists.The movie from the beginning was difficult to watch, with Hepburn being extremely off in this role, and Grant having a few good moments. The script never fully developed, and throughout the movie I kept thinking \\"this has to get better\\".It was a flop and panned when it came out in the 30's but somehow started to gain popularity to the point that it was selected by the National Film Registry for preservation. Director Hawks was fired for the film and Hepburn was forced to buy out her contract. Now it's a \\"revered classic\\". I think I'm missing something here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Classic Disaster","review":"This film was a box-office disaster when it was released in 1938 and remains so more than a half-century later. Even legendary film stars Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant can't rescue a terrible script and lousy directing. For all its frenetic pace, there isn't a single laugh or even a chuckle in the entire reel. One feels embarassed for the actors, particularly Hepburn, who bought out of her contract after the film flopped. She must have been mortified at the screening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated nonsense","review":"Just finished watching this and I hated it. I normally like Grant and Hepburn, but here they have little or no chemistry and little in the way of direction. A fairly promising beginning decends into an unfunny mess. The plot is non-existent. The script is worse and the over-acting is idiotic and just embarrassing.

Cary Grant had the ability to go from dashing and confident (it takes a thief) to bumbling and clueless(bringing up baby and monkey business) and to do so effortlessly. The pairing of Grant and the gorgeous Katherine Hepburn in this film was inspired. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wishes to see what real movie stars were about, and to anyone who loves a good zany comedy with loads of star power. I can't say enough good things about \\"Bringing Up Baby\\".

She plays the ditsy blonde so well it's surprising she wasn't cast in more of these parts, but perhaps it's testament to her acting ability that she managed to be so versatile. Cary Grant is on form as a staid scientist engaged to marry his rather boring research assistant. Katherine Hepburn turns up, all hell breaks loose, and of course Grant ends up falling for Katherine and being ditched by his fiancée. The 'Baby' of the title is a baby leopard and all the animal scenes are handled skilfully and seamlessly by director Howard Hawks. This is a textbook example of how to make charming 1930s comedies and good fun to boot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BROADCAST TV QUALITY IS AS GOOD OR BETTER","review":"Don't spend the high price for this DVD! Everyone already knows this is a \\"5-star\\" FILM; however, the quality of this DVD transfer is not that great. You can get as good or better copy by taping one of the frequent showings on TCM (Turner Classic Movies.) Most reviewers concentrate on reviewing the film itself rather than the quality of the DVD or VHS transfer, however, I want to emphasize that I was not impressed with the DVD quality. If you want the DVD strictly for the film, that's one thing, but if you expect a quality DVD transfer (considering the higher cost), you'll probably be as disappointed as I was. But, it's your call and your money--just don't say you were not warned. Ratings: Film 5, DVD quality 2. ADDENDUM 9/2009: The selling price was about $30 when this review was first posted.

It was not the easiest border to put up, but we did it. We spent a loooong evening trying to get it right. It didn't have enough self adhesive paste on the back so it kept peeling up around the sides. The next morning we could just peel the whole thing off. We ended up having to go out and buy wall paper paste and put it up that way. I think that if the walls were really smooth it may have stayed up better. We have textured walls which was what probably made it almost impossible to hang with the amount of paste that is on the back...Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For Selena's fans","review":"It seems to me that Selena's family is still reproducing the same material again and again.

I used it to \\"prepare\\" for this year's opening concert at Tanglewood, with the BSO under James Levine. The live performance was awe-inspiring, but there were some parts [i.e., the finale] that built to a higher [and more satisfying] crescendo on this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold","review":"There is nothing that Rattle does with Mahler that truly moves. In music that requires both awesome sound and spirituality, EMI engineeers fail in the former and Rattle in the latter. It is rather puzzling that, in our age of super-technical accomplishments, such is the case.I just heard a \\"Made in USA\\" 1950 Live recording of the 8th with Stokowski at the helm. Well, even with merely adequate monaural sound, the conductor makes eveything sound spontenous and right. At the end of the journey, you get a chill up your spine.

It contains several understanding checks and answers in each chapter, enabling the reader to stop and review difficult information.

These authors have made this text easy to read and easy to understand, which is a difficult task for such difficult mathematical information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incorrect","review":"Many things are factually incorrect, and the applications are irrelevant.

With the amount of bottles I went through in a day (especially when I began formula feeding exclusively), it is easier to run them through the dishwasher. Most dishwashers have a sanitizing cycle, which eliminates the need for this bottle sterilizer. I did use this for the breast pump parts on occasion (because usually I handwashed these).Based on ease of use, I give this item 4 stars.

I got a receipt and contacted the Avent representative because it's got 1 year warranty. They told that you have to clean it every so often with vinegar. If they feel that we didn't clean it, they would not replace or fix it. I sent it in to them, they returned back to me saying that it was my fault and I have to eat the loss. This really sucks because I used it only 4 times. How convenient would the machine be if you have to always vinegar it. I agree with \\"New mom from CT\\", this thing doesn't dry for you. I have to always tranfer to a rack afterwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"My friend gave me this sterilizer and I just love it.

I also feel that once your baby is a little older you realize that they don't need to live in a sterilized environment and it really is better to just thouroughly wash things with an antibacterial dishwashing liquid.

We thought that we needed to \\"air them out\\" for a short period to get rid of it; however to our dismay, letting them \\"air out\\" was not the solution. The only way the condensation clears up is if you have the bottles upright and not the on the rack, which to us seemed to defeat the purpose of them being \\"sterile\\" if we had to have them upright on the counter to get rid of the condensation.

But after they are sterilized, they are still soaking wet, and take forever to dry out. You still have to wash all the bottles and parts in hot soapy water before putting them in the sterilizer. For me it just ended up being much easier to put all the bottles and parts in the diswasher, because they get sterilized in there and you can fit more in there. I wish I would have known this earlier because I would have never opened the box. It's a waste of counter space, and not worth the money. Your dishwasher does just as good a job. Even if I didn't have a dishwasher, the washing out of the bottles in hot soapy water and drying them on a rack is just as good. They take the same amount of time to dry in the sterilizer as on the rack."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"I never use it.

I've never done that...I'd rather sterilize the bottles and nipples and stuff using the steam from the water and not use detergents from a dishwasher...my baby's not even a month old yet...maybe after he's older, I'll use that feature as well.

You have to wash the bottles/nipples, the sterilizer does not clean the products. Hopefully you use soap and hot water and according to the nurses at the hospital, our pediatrician, my obgyn and friends using hot water or a dishwasher is a suitable form of sterilizing.I wish I would've known that before I opened the package."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This steam sterilizer was a waste of money. I used it once, and it left spots of water all over everything. It might have been sterile, but it seemed dirty. It also took forever to dry. I've been much more satisfied washing the bottles, etc... with hot, soapy water, or, occasionally, in the dishwasher. I didn't think I'd wash the baby's stuff by hand, but I've been happiest with the results when I do this. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it probably does sterilize the bottles. On the other hand, I wish I had saved my money, since I don't use it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black particle after the first usage","review":"This is my first purchase of a bottle sterilizer.

Has anyone else encounter this before? I am sending this unit back."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 80's aren't over yet.","review":"\\"If You Leave\\" from the 1985 Pretty In Pink soundtrack was one of the top 10 most infectious, sing-a-longiest and durable songs of the 1980's, but if that's all you know about OMD, then you got up from the table way too soon.Powder your wig and pinch your cheeks, 'cause it's time to head back to the dining room for the second course.This album was released in 1991 but it's 80's music just the same.The 80's aren't over yet until you've heard the full OMD discography. Whether you prefer the Techno-Dance or melancholy Synth-Pop, you're bound to find several songs that you'll kick yourself for having not added to your collection sooner.Not only are the 80's not over, they're about to grab you by your chin-hair and slap you stupid.My personal faves on this album:1. Was It Something I Said?2. Speed of Light3. Pandora's Box4. Big Town5. Then You Turn AwayIn General:1. (Forever) Live and Die2. Dreaming3. So In Love4. Souvenir"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical Manoeuvres","review":"In many ways Sugar Tax represents a return to OMD's roots: majestic melancholy songs, shimmering choral arrangements and an abundance of electronic acrobatics. Sailing The Seven seas is replete with blues piano, heavy drums, those trademark choirs and a seductive and hypnotic chant.Apollo XI harks back to Dazzle Ships days (remember Radio Prague?), being made up of samples from the first moon landing set to a decidedly dynamic dance beat. The voices of presidents Nixon and Kennedy are used as effectively as those of Kennedy and Pope John Paul II on Psychic TV's \\"Papal Breakdance\\" from 1986.Sweeping strings soothe on Walking On Air and All That Glitters, while the title track sports a harder edged lyric (about emotional blackmail), but the real beauty is Was It Something I Said, a song of initially muted power reaching a crescendo of invective that sweeps the listener along to its powerful climax. This is a strong album of great songs.Architecture & MoralityThe OMD Singles"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Old Stuff Is So Much Better","review":"OMD made so much great music it is sad to see them create such boring fluff.

I bought this one specifically because it said it could handle high heat. After two uses, it is burning, melting, and flaking off just like my old ones. Plus, the angle is good, but the surface isn't slick enough for pancakes, so they fold instead of sliding easily on to the surface. The price was right but the product didn't meet my needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and confusing","review":"It started out ok.

One of the best books I have read in a really long time"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pursuit of Holiness","review":"I purchased this book for my husband, and he thoroughly appreciates it. He has several of Jerry Bridges books and was eager to have this one. Tho it's not a newly published book, it promotes values that are timeless, and are the true essence of a Christian life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical truth for a seemingly impossible topic","review":"When I started reading this book I had the \\"fear\\" that true \\"holiness\\" was something I could never achieve. Yet scripture calls us to be holy (1 Peter 1:13-25) so it must be possible. As I went through this book and examined my heart, I realized the obstacles that stood in the way of holiness and came away from the book with a whole new understanding and sense of hope and purpose. I now encourage other men to step up and TRULY pursue a life of holiness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"As in his other books Jerry Bridges takes the subject of holiness and breaks it down so that it is clearer and more understandable. Mr. Bridges presents the fact that for a Christian Holiness is not an option. I think that the most helpful chapter would have to be the one entitled Help in the Daily Battle because for me it is the daily striving for holiness that is the most difficult. This is a great place to start if you are seeking to learn more about holiness and how it applies to the Christian today. Great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pursuit of Holiness","review":"There is a movement about where the Holy Spirit is moving in the hearts of believers in Jesus, drawing them to experience knowing God in a deeper way. In \\"Pursuit of Holiness\\" the author, Jerry Bridges, explains through the use of the Bible, the reason and process you'll experience as you begin this life long journey of the Pursuit of Holiness. Bridges clearly explains the damage that indwelling sin creates for the follower of Christ. Furthermore he makes it clear that holiness is not a series of do's and don'ts, but a conformity to the charactor of God and the obedience to the will of God. All this made possible through the indwelling presence and power of the Holy Spirit in the believer. I have found these explainations to be transformational in my life and relationship to the God of the Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have Book For Every Sincere Christian","review":"Jerry Bridges deals with the subject of personal holiness also called sanctification, and how it is not passive but rather pro-active in the believer. Bridges talks about our responsibility to pursue personal and corperate holiness. Bridges talks about how God operates in us, as we co-operate, or surrender ourselves to His molding influences. God has given us the responsibility for doing the walking. This topic of holiness, is one much over-looked in most evangelial circles in these days of a watered down and sugary gospel that is currently being proclamated.This book will change your life, and your relationship with Christ, Jesus. Not a book for the \\"stop trying and start trusting\\" mentality that is prevailant today. Jerry Bridges is at his best in this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Classic - and Practical","review":"It's not only God's will for us to be holy but also His command. We cannot just sit back and wait for God to sanctify us, but we must actively pursue putting off our sin. And although we are blessed with the outcome of victory in our own lives by this, even more important is that our obedience brings glory to God. This book is full of practical examples, AND practical applications for many areas we can walk in obedience by pursuing holiness.This classic is short and easy to read or listen to. I highly recommend that you do. You will be blessed.I reviewed this audiobook under the christianaudio Reviewers Program."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Christian books on holiness I've read.","review":"Jerry Bridges shows us in this great book how Christians must depend on God's grace at all times and yet also striving with perseverance to pursuit holiness. We will never be perfectly holy in our present life, nevertheless it is God's will that we must always pursue such holiness so that we may be increasingly changed into His Son's image more and more everyday. This book will greatly humble and challenge every Christian to stop flirting with sin (however small it may be), and to start living a life that is pleasing to the holy God whom we worship and adore."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most helpful and practical book to date on the subject!","review":"This book was loaned to me and as soon as I opened it, my eyes were glued!! Jerry Bridges, a well respected author and teacher does a superb job presenting the teachings of scripture on this subject. Lots of verses presented in this book--it's loaded! I also recommended this book to a bible study group I'm apart of--tremendous praise from the participants. This is a must read for any Christian who wants a comphrehensive reference and study on the subject of growing in holiness."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have ever read","review":"Encouraging, convicting, Scripturally accurate and filled with references.

What a complete lie!!! If it was supposed to be a return to their roots then where are the heavy/thrashy skacore parts?????? There are none. 'Mr. Moran' is the only good song on the cd.

And there's no auto off like the night and day system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Careful with this one!","review":"Heats up the bottle in much less time than the directions say (I boiled my first bottle). The lack of on/off switch is unsafe. My hand slipped pulling the plug from the outlet and I hit the warmer and knocked it over -- scalding water and all! I was (thankfully) holding my baby away from the counter - but this could have been a disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh...no","review":"This product is garbage. It has no ability to heat a bottle to specific temperature, and will eventually get the temp to near boiling if you are not careful. No different than water in a pot on a stove, you have no temp control. It's going back. I don't understand why it is do difficult to find a product that will get the temp of a bottle to the right temp, and keep it there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"This warmer was aweful. I bought it for my kitchen, used it once and started walking to the other in my bedroom. Yes, it does have a fill line, and the directions are pretty easy to follow. It takes forever to warm and it has no on/off switch. This was as much a safety factor as a convenience issue. I returned it and bought a cheaper warmer that works much much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"I registered for this product and received it as a shower gift. It gets too hot and also does not have an off/on switch. You have to unplug it! The water also evaporates really fast if you leave it on so that it will always be warm (for easy access when your baby needs it) It was pricier than all the other warmers. I took it back and bought one for half the cost at [local store]. It is much better than the Avent one and much cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avent fan except for warmer!!","review":"I LOVE the Avent bottles, liners, nipples and steriler but the bottle warmer concerned me because the 3 levels all seemed to warm the same, there was no timer to tell how long bottle had been in (my milk got way too hot) and the advertised 4 minutes for heat up time is not necessarily accurate according to the instruction manual. This is the only Avent product that I have used that I am totally disappointed in and that I have returned to the store."},{"rating":"2","title":"works for me!","review":"This bottle warmer is great! It's compact, very easy to use, and heats the bottles very quickly -- actually in less time than the 4-6 minutes that Avent lists. Another big plus is that it's the only bottle warmer I've found that can be used with disposable bottles. I used to warm bottles in hot tap water, but that takes so long -- first to get the water hot enough and then to wait for the bottle to heat up. This bottle warmer does the job very quickly. The only improvement I would make to this product is an automatic shut off after maybe 6-8 minutes to prevent overheating. It's another great product from Avent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless Product","review":"I was very disappointed with this product due to the fact that the only way to turn it off is to unplug it. That is something I don't always remember at 3am. It also takes a long time to warm. I soon found the easiest way to make a warm bottle is to use my bottled water cooler, half hot and half cold and it's the perfect temp. Done in about 5 seconds, instead of 5 or more minutes. I only wish I still had the box because I would return it and get the [money] back and use on something alot more useful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works perfectly","review":"I give my baby frozen breastmilk and have used this warmer to get the milk ready for her.

It's very dangerous and can make the bottle too hot and dangerous for baby. It is much safer and easier to warm a cup of water in the microwave for 30 seconds and then place the bottle in the cup of water. Same concept, $40 cheaper and much easier!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst product I have ever owned","review":"Does not get any stars...I wanted a convienient safe way to heat a bottle ..granted this product does heat quickly....but if you turn your back for 1 minute you have a bottle that is to hot...many times I had to sit it in cold water while my child screamed. There is no shut off on it so it must be unplugged or the water evaporates and is then a fire hazzard. You would think it would only heat to a certain safe temperature....but it is scalding if its in for more then 3 minutes, there are to many distractions in life to use this product safely...I do not allow anyone sitting with my child or even other family members to use this product...I tell them to just sit in cup of warm water.....very unsafe product....and dangerous ."},{"rating":"2","title":"It DOES have an ON/OFF button","review":"I may have a later model than others, but mine does have an on/off button in the back. I really like this product. Before buying it, we were trying to warm the bottle in hot tap water, which took upwards of 10 minutes just for a couple of ounces! In the meantime, baby was crying her head off for food and was then so worked up she wouldn't take the bottle. Now I put it in the bottle warmer and it warms up in just a couple of minutes for a few ounce. You do have to be CAREFUL, though, the milk can get hot fast - so just test it out on your wrist first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it..","review":"After everyone told me not to buy this - I bought it.

You can accomplish the same bottle-warming task in the same - or less - time using hot tap water and bowl or large measuring cup. This bottle warmer doesn't even have a timer, so you still have to watch the clock while it's heating your bottle. Depending on your bottle size, it takes 4+ minutes to warm, and you have to stay on top of it... miss your timing by a little bit and you've got scorching hot milk on your hands. My bottle warmer found its way back to Target."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amanda's Mom","review":"My husband and I love this product. It does have an on and off on the back of the unit.

I would buy this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST bottle warmer!","review":"I highly recommend the Avent Bottle & Babyfood warmer! It heats quickly and evenly and is very light and easy to transport. I have received many compliments this summer as other envious Moms look on by the pool.

I am so happy they added an on/off switch to the newest model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avent dropped the ball","review":"I used this for a short time. It was more of a pain for us.I hated that you had to keep on top of it or you would never know how long it was in there. A timer would have been nice (and cheap enough to add).I hated how I had to unplug it and plug it in every time I wanted to use it.Yes, it may be the best there is out there, but that doesn't mean too much. It still has many flaws.Now I love Avent items but this one they dropped the ball on. There is so much they could have done with this that they didn't. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointed","review":"Definitely think it's not worth the money. It does heat the bottle way too hot so be careful! I hate that the light goes off throughout the heating and you never know how much longer you have before the bottle is ready. It needs a timer. I just don't think it's worth the $40. And you can't see how much water you need - I always end up over filling it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless you're standing there watching it...","review":"No beep-beep timer on this; no auto-shut-off -- so a frazzled first-time mom or dad can easily wind up with a bottle of scorched breastmilk. SO UNCOOL. And, crying while pouring the milk down the sink, you *still* might not learn your lesson with that first bottle. If you own the product and its design flaws bug you, call Avent and tell them. If you don't own the product, you're better off placing your milk bottle in a bowl of hot water, which at least won't scorch anything. If you still think this product is one you want, by all means go for it, but, especially if you are warming breastmilk, DO NOT WALK AWAY FROM THE WARMER UNTIL THAT LIGHT FLASHES."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heats however it boils over","review":"We used our warmer for the first time, and have continued using it because we are afraid to melt the bottles, however, the water boils as soon as it gets hot, and the boiled wateer spills all over the place.

Since I have had this warmer I have overcooked and undercooked the milk. It has never heated up my daughters bottles warm enough in the 4 minutes, and it overheats it if you use a higher setting. I was extremely surprised when we got it home and noticed that there was not an on/off switch. Had a read the reviews before purchasing this warmer I would not have done so. When your baby is screaming because of hunger having to wait another 2 minutes to get it warm seems like eternity! I use Advent bottles and the microwave sterilizer and I am completely satisfied. I think the warmer though needs a few changes."},{"rating":"1","title":"boils everything to scalding hot","review":"Very disappointed in this warmer which boils everything to scalding hot.

That product made the milk scalding hot and we had to cool down the milk...not very pretty when your baby is screaming at 2 AM. The Avent warmer is great. It quickly takes the chill out of refridged bottles in about 3-4 minutes. You can't walk away though, the bottle may become too hot if left for multiple heating cycles.

Besides all the lack of features, on/off switch and such this thing is piece of junk. In the manual it says, and I quote \\" 8) When the water has reached the correct temperature, the light will come on and off to indicate that the water surrounding the bottle is being kept at a constant temperature.\\" end quote.That would lead you to believe that you can leave it and it will keep the milk at the right temp. reguardless. Well, when I checked it the milk was at 120 [...] degrees!So basically this is just as accurate and helpful as placing it in boiling water on the stove.

The problem with this warmer is that it doesn't have an automatic shutoff, and it doesn't control the temperature. If you put a bottle in, and get distracted (and what parent of an infant doesn't get distracted), the water just keeps getting hotter and hotter. I have used a thermometer to measure the temperature of the water around the bottle, and after turning my back for less than a minute, the water went from 120 degrees to 160 degrees. The only way to control the temperature is to unplug the product. Not too safe!Don't bother with this product. You can do the same thing it does with a pot of water on the stove and a ... meat thermometer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love The Avent Warmer","review":"I have the previous version of this warmer and absolutely loved it.

I love this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"This bottle warmer does the trick. After reading other reviews it does have an on and off switch, they just never looked for it. If your bottle is floating then it's obvious you have too much water in it. As for the timing of the warmer. You do have to guess on how long to leave it in.

It warms the bottle evenly."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better warmers for your money","review":"This warmer is one of the most expensive ones to purchase and the least favorable to use. It is very easy to overheat a bottle in this warmer. It lacks an auto shut off feature which most other warmers have, which would be convenient when changing the baby's diaper.

If I had to do it over I wouldn't bother with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks important features, like an automatic shut off","review":"I like several of the Avent products, so I thought this bottle warmer was probably worth the extra money (it's one of the pricier models offered). After owning mine for about a week, I returned it to the store where I bought it and purchased a much less expensive model that actually works better (the Munchkin brand). The Avent warmer worked okay, and the variable heat feature could be valuable, but the darn thing did not have a timer nor an automatic shut off. I became very annoyed trying to keep track of the time, etc. which defeated the purpose of having a bottle warmer for \\"convenience.\\" I will say that it warmed evenly (about the best on the market as far as heating evenly). However, on a couple of occasions I didn't get the bottle out right at the 4-minute mark and it over heated the contents...very hot. Had this item had a timer or an automatic shut off feature it would be a much better value. Definately not worth the extra money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heats good if you can get past the other annoyances","review":"First let me say that this unit heats the bottle very well in the suggested time frame. It doesn't have a timer on it so I just set the timer on my microwave right after I put the bottle in. This is annoying but once I made it part of the routine it hasn't been too much of a problem. My biggest complaint is that it doesn't have an on/off switch. I can't tell you how many times I have forgotten to unplug it only to find it later with steam rising up from the very hot water in the unit. I find this a safety hazard. I don't know of many other electrical appliances that don't have an off switch. I don't want to buy another brand since this one heats the bottles really well. Just wanted to pass on what I've found."},{"rating":"1","title":"For this price I expected more","review":"I bought this warmer thinking it would help me with middle of the night feedings, but after testing it out once, I promptly returned it. I should have listened to the reviewers and not thought they were being petty. This thing has no auto shut off, the user has to set a timer for how long to leave the bottle in and even though there is an \\"off\\" switch, you still have to unplug the machine. Not very helpful at 2 in the morning when you are half asleep and have a frantic hungry baby. For the amount of money I paid, I would have expected much more than a glorified hot plate. I ended up getting the First Years version for less money and while that one is not perfect, it beats the Avent model. Too bad too, because I have been happy with the other products in this brand line."},{"rating":"1","title":"no off switch","review":"There is no off switch or automatic off... which in the middle of the night unpluging the thing is not always done.

Safety feature needed.","review":"The recommended setting for avent bottles is the highest setting, which (according to my measurements) keeps the water at just over 175 degrees F, for as long as the unit is plugged in.Recommended durations are on the side of the unit, but if your bottle isn't full, the duration is much shorter and you have to guess.I always end up putting the bottle in warm or cold tap water for a minute to \\"fine-tune\\" the temperature after I take it out of the avent bottle warmer, so this product doesn't save me any work, just a bit of time.If you leave the bottle in too long, it will keep climbing towards 175 degrees F. Some sort of safety feature is missing. Certainly a shut-off switch on a timer would be good, and easy to make. Ideally the heating water would cool so that the bottle and the heating water would converge towards 98 degrees over time.Summary: If I want instant hot water, I'll buy an electric teapot, not a bottle warmer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avent Bottle Warmer","review":"This is the WORST bottle warmer invented!

It seemed to never heat the bottle by the amount of time indicated in the instructions (it would always take longer-with a screaming hungry baby-that's not good!). We always seemed to either put too much water in it or not enough (an included measuring device would be very handy, but there's not one). However, there is a fill line in it but if I filled it to where the formula in the bottle came too (like the instructions say), it would still overflow. I haven't used it in a while, so I may try it again when I start my baby on babyfood. Overall, we were very disappointed with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This warmer lacks important features","review":"Not knowing what to look for in a bottle warmer, I was attracted to this model because it was small in size and didn't take up a lot of counterspace. I have no complaints about its warming capabilities, but after using the warmer several times, I found I really needed a few more features than it offered:The unit does not have an automatic timer, which means YOU have to keep up with how long the bottle has been in the warmer. And when you are trying to deal with a fussy infant, it's easy to lose track of time and overheat the bottle.The unit has no Off/On switch and must be unplugged after each use.Another small annoyance is the bottle does not sit flat, but floats unevenly in the water while heating.I finally purchased another model which included these features."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a warm review","review":"Of all the great products made by AVENT this one is the only one I dislike. I gave it a \\"2\\" because the unspecified water measuring for bottle warming lead to bottles floating and possible chamber overflowing (a messy cleanup for early a.m. feedings). It lacks an on/off switch and must be unplugged every time (which at 3 a.m. is not always easy to remember ),thus the placement of the unit must be near an easy to reach outlet. The warming time, according to manual, is not always correct and overheating is usually the result if you walk away.It does have a few good points : a) it accomendates AVENT bottles and not all bottle warmers do. b) cleaning the unit is EASY. c) allows warming of both reusable and disposable bottles. d) warm food, frozen breastmilk, or formula quickly. e) IT BETTER AND QUICKER THAN WARMING UNDER TAP WATER !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not so warm review","review":"AVENT has great products however this one is not one of them. Here are a few reasons I feel this way: This warmer lacks an \\"on/off\\" switch and must be unplugged with each use (which with early a.m. feedings is not always easy to remember). The absence of this feature also requires unit to be placed near an easy to reach outlet at all times. Due to the absence of any premeasured units for filling water into chamber, overfilling causes bottle floating and messy clean-ups. Lastly the specified times for proper warming in manual is not always correct , thus overheating is usually the result if you walk away.This product does have a few good points: It fit almost all bottle types (both reqular, disposable and wide mouth).

This can be very dangerous to baby if you are not careful. I purchase one for myself and one for my cousin since our babies are one month apart. I used mine a few and it over heated the bottle and I followed the directions and everything. At first it feels warm but when you shake the bottle sometimes you feel the temp of the bottle getting warmer and that tends to happen because the center of the bottle gets the hottest. It has NO timer or on/off button so you have to babysit the thing. BE CAREFUL you may scortch babys mouth with the hot milk.

If you are heating a full bottle, consider turning the knob to 2, it has been known to splatter. Clean up is a breeze! I recommend this warmer as a gift or even for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"This warmer is not worth the money. I bought the Quick Serve Bottle Warmer which is manufactured by the First Years. The Quick Serve Bottle Warmer is only $17.99 and it is much better than the Avent warmer. Unlike the Avent Warmer, the Quick Serve takes a small amount of water to create steam to warm the bottle. The Quick Serve automatically shuts off after the bottle has warmed up."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just returned mine!","review":"I got this warmer thinking it would be much easier to use this than to boil water in the middle of the night to warm up the milk. I tried it yesterday and was really dissapointed with it. The fact that it will not shut off by itself, nor that it has a timer, make this an awful product. The last thing I want to do in the middle of the night is keep my eyes on the clock to make sure I don't overheat the milk. I returned it today and will read up on other brands to see if I can get a better one."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you don't want fire in your place, buy something else.","review":"This warmer is excellent in every way except one thing - it lacks on / off switch. I can't believe that they wouldn't implement this critical feature as many parents of new born babies are so consumed by babies, prone to forget about unplugging. It is more amazing because this really is an excellent warmer & expensive. When choosing a bottle warmer, please consider the fact that you will be very very tired, busy and occupied with the baby that you are likely to forget about silly but critical things like unplugging power. My wife and I can tell you this for sure. We had a fire in the kitchen as my wife fell asleep after turning the switch on. The smoke alarm saved the lives of the mother and the boy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So product","review":"My baby is an Advent baby. I love all the Advent products, but was a little disappointed with this one. The bottle warmer, is maybe too good of a warmer, as it tends to overheat the milk even before the recommended time limit. The timings really should be precise."},{"rating":"1","title":"The product is a joke ... don't buy it","review":"This warmer is an absolute joke. Thank God I was able to return the thing and get my money back. It would be a great product if it had a thermostat that allowed you pop in the bottle, and it'll only warm it to the safe level and keeps it at that temparature. But it doesn't. Any jug with hot water will do the same. In the end we prefer to use the Microwave now ... it's quicker and thus more reliable as the bottle is warm in 30s."},{"rating":"1","title":"why a warmer??","review":"I don t know why anyone would buy a counter top warmer. They say that microwaving a bottle \\"zaps\\" the nutrients in the mix. Well, there are no nutrients in water. My wife and I first heat the bottle of water in the microwave then add powdered formula mix. We have it down to a science and after heating the bottle for about 5 seconds at a time you can figure out how long it takes exactly. He's 8 months old and we've been doing this since the beginning. For you liquid formula people...Oh well!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overheated ratings","review":"This bottle warmer doesn't have an on/off switch which is dangerous if you are a drowsy new mom. My biggest complaint is that it overheats breastmilk and ruins it if you don't stand there and watch it. Breastmilk is like gold and to have ruined so many ounces of it is just heartbreaking. It does fit their bottles but it's hard to tell how much water to put in around your bottle. This company is so pro-breastfeeding - they should really have a more accurate warmer on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Temperature control?","review":"This thing certainly \\"warms up\\" but no reliable thermostat to ensure that the content of the bottle remains at a reasonable temperature. If not careful, the bottle will get get way too hot..."},{"rating":"2","title":"good to have but not a must","review":"I got this product as a combo with the Avent Sterilizer. ((Side note: the Sterilizer is a MUST HAVE item!!))It's nice to have a place to warm the bottle, and it does cut down on wasting water (vs the other method of a bowl of warm water). The biggest plus is it's faster to prepare. The problem that I had with the bowl of water method is that I would over heat the water then have to do a cool down process. I thought this product would help with that but it doesn't. You can get the water to almost boiling. You have to time it, but again, it's fast and ready to go in 6-7 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"It may seem expensive but this warmer is absolutely worth it! I B/F most of the time and only heat a couple of bottles a day but its so simple and doesnt take much time. The light goes out when its warm enough and your ready to feed your baby! I absolutely love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little warmer","review":"I like this bottle warmer. It warms up the bottles quickly and that means alot at 3AM with a screaming, hungry baby. I use the Dr. Brown's bottles with it and they fit fine. I haven't had any problems with uneven heating or anything like that. I have even taken the warmer with me when we go to friends houses so I can heat up the bottles quickly. I strongly suggest that you do not put the nipples on the bottles while they are in the warmer. It causes the formula to overflow from the nipple. Found that out the hard way. Other than that, I haven't had any problems or issues with the product. I would suggest this to parents looking for a small warmer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try a different bottle warmer before you buy this one","review":"I bought this warmer because I have the Avent bottles, which I love. I thought that because the bottles were larger than normal, I'd have to buy the Avent warmer...NOT TRUE! I'm not sure about other models talked about in previous reviews, but there is an on/off switch on the back. Though this warmer does heat consistently, I hate using it. It does not have a timer like most warmers, so you have to constantly monitor the bottle and keep checking it to make sure the milk doesn't overheat. I find this difficult when you have a hungry baby on your hands. All the instructions have for warming times is a chart that can be difficult to decipher, at best.TRY OTHER WARMERS BEFORE YOU BUY THIS ONE! (The First Years has a really good one that shuts off automatically when its done) I wish I knew then what I know now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes too long for the price!","review":"Save your money. You can heat a bottle faster under hot running tap water or by heating a bowl of water in the microwave and sitting the bottle in it. This bottle warmer is definitly not a necessary item. It is expensive and it takes too long to heat a bottle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful and fine... but can be improved","review":"I like this a lot when I need to warm baby's bottles (I am not using Avent bottles but it works fine). It heats the milk evenly and to the same temperature as long as you follow the directions.But there should be a timer, or the light should turn off only when this is warm. The directions are way too complex for a mum and a crying baby. Be more simple!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does the job, but doesn't have a power switch!!!!","review":"This warmer works wonderfully for warming bottles. It can hold standard or larger diameter bottles easily by adding or removing the plastic basket. It also has a cord storage area under it (able to wrap the excess cord around and secures itself). But the only problem was that it has no power switch to turn it off and on. I have left in on numerous times when running off to work. I have come home later to find it on, hot and without water (if it was not completely full in the beginning). It's not simple to pull the plug out of the wall either. Sometimes had to wiggle at the plug to get it to come out. Other times could not pull hard enough and had to get daddy to pull it. Did it's job, but for the price it did not do it easily enough for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money!","review":"Save your money and skip this warmer! For the cost of this warmer you would think it would have an on/off switch. I had it for 1 night & at the 3o'clock feeding I forgot to unplug it. It continued to work after that but, what a fire hazard! It also didnt warm our 4oz bottles very well. We had to warm it 2 times. I went with the 1st years night and day warmer and love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the greatest","review":"I used for the first time last weekend. It is a great pan.

Now he is checking his \\"garden\\" daily for new sprouts and tending it all very nicely.We did make sure to plant the seeds close to the periphery of each tube for easier viewing. So far so good.

I actually had to start scanning pages quickly because I couldn't care less about most of the characters or the storyline. UFOs, nothing even remotely scary AT ALL, many characters but only about 3 interesting ones and the rest positively boring. Tamara, this was a bad choice of a previously published work. I recently aquired 'Trickster' and 'Winter Scream' (Chris Curry and Lisa Dean) and I'm hoping they're better than this positively awful book. I'm sure the next *new* novel she writes will be better, but choosing this one among her previously published books to re-publish was a definite mistake. Perhaps she needed to buy some time...."},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE!","review":"I love how no 1 mentioned the smelly dark yellow urine (I drink tons of water so I kno it's the pills) or the fact that they stink like fish & taste horrible.

They cause stomach upset after eating even a large meal. My nails are splitting and cracking again. The pills are huge. I was comparing Maxi to Phytophanere because I liked and was impressed w/Phyto (smaller capsules,great results for hair & nails), but concerned about one of the ingredients. I tried Maxi for 2 months. Maxi does not work for me and the upset stomach is no longer worth awaiting results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke me out HORRIBLY!","review":"I really wish this product worked for me. After reading some of the rave reviews, I was excited to try it out. I took the pills consistently for two weeks and noticed my cheeks and chin were developing angry cystic acne. I hadn't had acne this bad since before Accutane. I finally decided to stop the pills and now my skin is slowly recovering. I do NOT recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"I took this hoping it would stop my hair from thinning. When I read the reviews about how it helped others halt hair loss, I thought I'd give it a try. I also have mild acne breakouts so I figured if it helped clear my skin that would be a bonus. I wanted to finish the entire bottle before writing a review because I wanted to give the product a fair try. I took the product as directed and I noticed no difference in hair growth and I continued to experience hair loss. There were also no benefits to my skin. I really wanted these to work, and I'm glad they worked for so many other people, but they did absolutely nothing for me, and I finished the entire bottle as directed. If you still want to order these, don't get your hopes up. If they work, great. If not, then at least you didn't have high expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"PRICE NOT RIGHT","review":"Costco sells a vitamin for HAIR SKIN & NAILS that includes the same vitamins as this one with larger quantities and it's $13.99 for all 250 capsules. Much much cheaper than this one. Unfortunately, i only found that out after purchasing two 90 capsule bottles from here. I feel I was ripped off!I'm rating two stars because of the price, the content of the pill is not enough and the pill is very large and uncomfortable to swallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now I know what happened","review":"My nails were growing so nicely. Thick, long, strong AND FAST!! Every 4 weeks I HAD to cut them because in 4 weeks time, they'd grown back too long after cutting. For some reason since August (I received these and began taking them at the beginning of August) my finger and toe nails have STOPPED growing and for the life of me, I couldn't figure out why. My hair -- nothing worth mentioning so I won't mention hair.The only thing I've been doing different since August, because it's now the start of December and STILL, my toe and fingernails have halted in growth, was take these vitamins. MSM seems to work great for many but because it does something crazy with my hair, I can't take it. Instead of taking two pills today I am throwing these out b/c I just found out from reading other reviews that these have MSM in them. I will stop for 3 months and see if there's any change with my nail growth and then come back to update."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Sad","review":"This product came highly recommeded by my sons girlfriend.

However, when I went to the doctor for my regular lab blood draw due to my thyroid issue (hypoactive), I was told to immediately cease taking Maxi Hair.

Be careful thyroid patients!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely will stop hair from shedding","review":"My hairdresser recommended Maxi Hair after he noticed my hair was shedding more than normal. This product put an end to that problem. Within about two weeks I noticed less hair in the drain -- more on my head! When a friend called to tell me she had been losing hair and her doctor had said it was a normal part of being in her 40s, I suggested Maxi Hair. She called me about a month later literally crying because the vitamins had worked so well. The downside is that the pills are HUGE and taste terrible. At times, I have been unable to swallow them. Also, do take them with food because they can cause stomach upset."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes my stomach feel a little uncomfortable, but seems to work well","review":"Seems to have improved quality of my hairs, but unfortunately made my stomach feel a little weird after taking the pill.

I bought enough for 3 months to give it a very fair chance. I didn't expect miracles but did expect to see a noticeable improvement, which I have not.After my supply is finished I am going to try something else in the hopes that continued use of the right hair supplement will eventually provide results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product and I recommend","review":"I bought this in november and have used more then half the bottle. I am impressed and will buy again. The first thing ive noticed is there is no hair clogging up my shower drain! My hair doesnt fall out nearly as bad as it did before using this.I can actually count a hair or 2 after using this. Ive noticed major improvement not just in hair loss but condition of hair. Second thing I noticed - The heavy B vitamins in this help my energy as well. I highly recommend.*Up date* Have repeat bought,,,everytime i skip, eventually my hair returns to shedding but when I start them it stops! First treatment Ive had that I have noticed drastic results. I was taking them daily, now (one a day 3 times a week). A hair saver for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"uhm...not so great","review":"I thought I'd try it out since there are such great reviews.

I was taking women's one-a-day tablets for about three months and decided to try something new. I did not notice any hair growth on my head using the Maxi-Hair but I noticed little peach-like hairs on my sideburns. Also I started to break out on my face and I rarely get pimples...I decided to give this a shot based on some good reviews but after my personal experience with this product I decided not to continue using it. I can not afford a hairy face but doesn't mean this won't work for others. Things I noticed while using these tablets: It makes your urine bright yellow, pills are normal size (women's one-a-day size tablets) and the smell is a little strong, like most tablets, but that didn't bother me. I'm now back to using women's one-a-day as it improved my nails and skin."},{"rating":"1","title":"hair pills","review":"This product did not do all it said it would.

After about 2 weeks i noticed my hair was starting to grow out quicker and I was losing less strands (plus it generally felt healthier overall). It didn't do much for my eyelashes or nails, and even if I hadn't of noticed that big of a difference in my hair, i would still take these.

You will DEFINATELY enjoy listening to the tasteful humor in Monty's songs. And by the way, if you think that the Monty Python stuff is bad, be aware that you are my enemy till you change your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun!","review":"The classic combination of satire, ribaldry, and hilarity makes this a favourite CD - especially for dreary afternoons, when it brings me to inevitable laughter. Of course, being a very religious medievalist, I can justify my guilty pleasure by comparing the work to the miracle plays of the Middle Ages... I never cover the naughty bits...The only drawback is that the tunes are guaranteed to stick in one's mind (a problem only if, like myself, one finds oneself singing \\"Every Sperm is Sacred\\" in the narthex of one's church)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brit humour at its best","review":"Brilliant, hilarious, raunchy, and with some of the most clever lyrics ever. Who else, besides the Python troupe could get away with singing songs about penises, sperm, gonorrhea, balls and scrotums? The answer is no-one. At least not in a way that you'd feel comfortable playing it around your elderly relatives. But Monty Python does it in a way and with such tongue-in-cheek humour, that no-one could be offended, except those who have no sense of humour anyway. And, to those folks, I say \\"Get a Life, lighten up, and get this cd. It'll put some fun into your lives.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyed the lyrics","review":"I ordered this CD for the \\"Galaxy Song\\".

That said - I was very disappointed in this video. I was expecting to see Artemis at her best, but she and the other ladies on this video .. well frankly are not very good. As I watched it, the word amateurish popped into my head. If I had been in the audience for this show I think I would have walked out. Very sad, because there are some well known and respected names in the credits, but you woulnd't know it by the dancing.I just don't think the dancing on this video is very good, Artemis has some other videos available where the dancing is much better.

In summary, if you have seen Shakira dance, you have seen more then you will on this video. I have seen several amazing performances in Caroussel and Byblos in LA and none of the dancers in this video managed to impress me. Most dancers use few basic moves so there is little variety to learn from.

Though the beauty of Maya is there are so many ways to go about doing something in Maya, and this book reinforces that, each project will show you how to go about to do similar operations in Maya, but each time will show you a different way to go about it in the software.They best sorce of help for beginning Maya."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book EVER!","review":"The book tries to work from a step-by-step process.

If you knew about his exploits with underage girls, you'd agree.What we have here is an aging minor rock n' roll personality whose career was coming to an end by the early 90's. He merely reinvented himself to take advantage of the rising right-wing tide that also sees other military service avoiders like Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly, and Michael Weiner-Savage as pillars of virtue and wise political sages.Please, people...Get a clue.Those of us who actually did serve in the military see these men for the jokers they truly are.

The hunting community needs to nurture its relationship with non-hunters and show them that we are conservation oriented, safety concious, and willing to consider other points of view. Nugent is a very poor spokesperson for hunters. He is right up there with John Rocker and Chuck Heston. They all do hunters more harm than good with their macho gunslinging and adolescent posturing.

God, Guns, & Rock'N'Roll, Regnery Publishing, 2001, 311 pagesIn God, Guns, & Rock'N'Roll Ted Nugent discusses many subjects, most including hunting and gun ownership in America. In this book Nugent takes you through some of his life and how hunting, music, religion and carrying a gun have helped him throughout his life. This book is an interesting book; you get to see how Ted Nugent views gun control, religion, music, hunting and many other subjects. Whether you agree with Ted Nugent or not this is a very good current affair/biography, and it is easy reading. This book should be read by anyone who is a hunter/ gun owner, musician, and anyone who is interested in current affairs in America. I liked reading this book a lot and I recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guns, Guns and Guns","review":"The book is about 5 percent God, 15 percent Rock n Roll and 80 percent guns.

Hunting is good, guns are good. The themes of this books are repeated to the point that, even if you agree with him, you want him to say something else. He brings up some interesting points, but not enough to stretch into an entire book. This would have made a much better essay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Big disappointment. I'm a huge Ted Head and looked forward to the release of this book. However, all Nugent talks about is blowing away wild life in the back woods of Michigan. I've got nothing against hunting but you'd think he talk a little about his 50 or so years of playing rock music! I think he has like 3 sentences in the whole book where he speaks about recording a song/ album. I truly wonder how many people bought this book only to be let down by his ... hunting stories. Even if Ted focused on politics it would have been more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Ted!","review":"Nugent is great showman and entertaining guest on talk shows.

Discovering that without the other, they're bored, they make up. The plot of the story helps young children who have difficulties understanding how to recover from a fight, and helps them to see that many children argue, not just themselves. The white-framed impressionistic paintings that fill each page portray a drab inner-city neighborhood and cause the focus to remain on the two main characters. Although the text flows below or within the images on most of the pages, while a fight separates Matthew and Tilly, the text sits on a stark, white page, hinting at the loneliness that each feels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strike Out","review":"This is a confusing book. It purports to be a coming-of-age literary memoir about a young man yearning to be a baseball player. However, it's confusing for the following reasons: the more psychological coming-of-age moments are cliched, superficial, and juvenile, offering nothing new, insightful, or fresh to this theme. In addition, it purports to be literary, which is misleading, because the writing is wooden and dull, in many places boring. Lastly, on some level (especially since the bookjacket cover shows the author in a baseball uniform in front of Ebbets Field), it's about being a baseball player--or wanting to be one. But mainly the author is a wannabe, and certainly never played for the Brooklyn Dodgers--so don't let the bookjacket fool you. But even so, I never connected with the author's striving to be a baseball player or a writer. The emotional content felt hollow. In short, this memoir isn't at all what it advertises. It's not worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious Movie!!!","review":"One of my all time favorite movies! I can watch this film time and time again!!

Cameo appearances by a few NBA players including Larry Bird are just about the only things good about the movie. The reason I didn't like this movie is because some of my friends had told me that it was hilarious. I didn't think it was funny at all. All the jokes that Damon Wayans and the rest of the crew told were sickening rather than funny.

Of course it's not meant to be washed like that, and about 50% of the seams inside came apart, and the material on the outside has some damage (think how satin picks).

Armed only with his sword, wit, honor, and testosterone, Jandar (as he is known) blazes a trail of glory across the distant moon.Yes, it really is that overblown, but I mean that in a good way. This open tribute to Edgar Rice Burroughs'sBarsoombooks continues the tradition, but without infringing on characters that readers already know and love. It features all the frustrated romance, chivalric posturings, wild coincidences, that readers expect, right down to the cliff-hanger ending that promises more books in the series.

Not only is their the Rebel alliance to contend with, their are other bounty hunters who have teamed up to take Boba's prize. If you liked \\"the Empire strikes back\\" and the bounty hunters story within it, and you like reading the expanded universe in comic form, this is a great comic.

This book was no different.From reading the book jacket, you would think that this is your average, run of the mill, divorce story. Bitterness, fights, heatrbeak and trauma. But its much more than that. I think this story was oddly uplifting. A dependent woman learns to stand on her own two feet. She suffers a terrible tragedy but learns that she make something of herself. This is her chance to become the type of woman she always admired. There is lots of drama and heartbreak along the way, making this an inticing read. I definitly recommend it anyone, not just fans of Maeve Binchy.

They suspect that he has an accomplice on the outside. In a sense, they are correct. The truth provides a nice twist that would have had more impact if it had not been imbedded in a plot that has so many lapses in logic. Unprofessional behavior makes it difficult to take these cops seriously. They seem to make some pretty big intuitive leaps and there are plot elements that don't connect very well to the main story, although both of these could be the fault of poor subtitling. The final moments of the film are intended to shock, but they require one character to behave in a way that contradicts what we have seen of her before, so it comes off as cheap exploitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"You get what you pay for.

This book was the catalyst into my search of why we are here, what lessons we have to learn in this life, and how we need to be non-judgemental and always give LOVE. Love is the answer, the meaning to our lives. This is a good book and a good account of how we can all learn to communicate with our spiritual guides. We are all searching for answers which are easily accessible if we only ask and then open ourselves up to receive these answers. Let this book lead you onto read many more entralling books on spirituality and life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating account. Is it real? Is it true?","review":"This will bring out the skeptic in most readers. It can be a stretch to believe and will push your buttons if you don't buy into past-life regression, guides, facilitated communication. It is a wonderful account of a young girl's life, and her mother's constant participation/direction in her life (maybe to the extreme?). And raises questions not only about autism but other forms of physical difficulties (stroke victims, spinal injuries) where the body is not in tact, communication is difficult or impossible, but the mind is functioning beautifully. How frustrating to be trapped inside of that body. It is a story of hope and inspiration. I didn't want to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"FOR EVERYONE WHO WANTS TO KNOW, WHY HE IS HERE ON EARTH","review":"I 'found?' this book in a book-store and after having started to read I couldn't stop reading. This story, as another reader stated, true or not, doesn't matter, because the contents and its implications are really important. If everyone would believe and obey and/or consider to include Adri's believes of Love and the reason of our existence here on earth in their daily life, this earth, our future would change. And implicitely this story tells, that many illnesses, treated with love, surely would disappear. I recommand this book to everyone to include into our daily thoughts.

At first, the idea of coloring at my age was a bit funny (to keep it humorous for me, I conjured up in my mind a tall, overgrown middle-aged male graduate student squeezed in a chair, hunched back looking over a desk and coloring with his set of 64 crayons). Anyway, I digress. As a doctoral graduate student taking a Neuroscience course--this book really helped me nail down structures of *way* too many things. But ultimately, it helped me make the grade. If you get the book, make sure to color in it--it really does help (not to mention a great way to relieve some stress from the day). Otherwise, what's the use of buying a book like this--it becomes an ordinary textbook if you don't color in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the text but didn't get to color","review":"The panes of information were an excellent complement to my neuroanatomy instruction. However, anyone in medical school can attest to the fact that time is of the essence. As I look through my book, I notice that I only had time to color in 14 pictures (some weren't complete).

The griddle arrived as described. It's a good size and the soft handles are nice. There was a UPC sticker on the back of the pan that left a very sticky residue when I removed it. I carefully cleaned the area making certain that it was all gone before using the pan. I have a glass stove with a bridge burner... I turned it to a medium heat to make some grilled cheese. The WORST smell starting coming from the pan. I picked it up and there was a silvery melted residue on my stove where the sticker was.... I hurriedly cleaned it off with a paper towel. Luckily my stove is okay but there is some type of coating on the back of the pan that is melting off. I was hoping it was just the sticker residue... but I tried again after thoroughly cleaning the back of the pan again. HORRIBLE SMELL and melting silvery coating again. I give up.

The deck rail was 2'x 8' openings between the main support rails. We attempted to configure it in every manner possible and just could not get it to look any less that tacky. We broke down, took off the net and reconstructed the rail on our whole deck. Not an ideal fix-all like it proclaims.

I needed something so I thought I would try this. There is no way to secure this tightly to the bottom of the spindles on the railing. Because the fabric is so flexible and the rope ties are too my daughter at 13mo old figured out in 2 min that she can just slide the fabric up the spindles.

I have the clear plastic sheeting up now and it is much safer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I was expecting","review":"I bought this item for my stair railing to protect my 1 year old from the wide spaces in between the rails.

I was concerned that our 3 yr old would get interested in sticking her head thru the railing and potentially fall to the tile floor below. This isn't the most attractive or sturdy thing, but it does provide a barrier. It's not the kind of thing that gives parents an excuse to not monitor their children, but it would at least slow the kid down when trying to do something crazy, thereby increasing the chances for the parents to intervene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"We bought this to keep the cat from jumping through the deck railing and escaping into the yard. It works fine. We wound up using zip ties because we didn't have the patience to thread each hole with the string provided. It is as the photo shows -- white-- but you can see through it. I like that you can secure it on the top and on the bottom. Cats are clever but our cat has not tried to claw it or go through it so I can't speak to that factor. He took one look and gave up :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"not for all banisters","review":"We bought this for our banister. Did not work for our needs. You basically get a stack of string to tie it on with. We tied it on and it left gaps everywhere and our daughter could basically slide her hands over the top and Yank it down. Also where the banister meets the wall we got it as close as we could but since it ties on we could only get it about an inch from the wall at the closest. Our daughter easily pushed right past it. We returned it for a refund after just a few days."},{"rating":"2","title":"The wick made all the difference....","review":"I've had the Kero-Heat for over 1 1/2 years and used both clear and red-dyed kerosene as a fuel source. Due to the rising cost of both, the red-dyed version clearly is the most economical but has a tendency to leave a residue in the wick and will reduce its lifespan.However, this in infinitely preferable to an attempt by me to use a quartz tubed heater as an alternative heat source. When I received my electric bill and saw that it tripled ($70 to $230), I unplugged it immediately.The bottom line is that you must use wicks that have a high cotton content (i.e., England) and not the OEM ones that come from Asia that look virtually identical. I tried both and the English ones not only burn better without an odor but are significantly hotter as well.I also used a catalytic disk above the burner to further reduce any odor.Both are available through Miles Stair's Wick Shop online."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Parts ratteling around in carton. took it apart and found tip over parts jammed in front. just poor quality control at the manufacture.I have no time for this.

It is a little bigger than the space alloted, but I find that the rubber non-skid bumps on the bottom of the warmer hold it within the wipes space... and since it is raised above the depot's wipes space it leaves room for any extra wipes that didn't fit inside the warmer. This was a great buy, and I don't know what I would have done without it. Everything is at a hands reach when I am changing my daugher (6 weeks old now) and I literally can hold her with one hand and reach everything with the other because of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Space saver!","review":"This model is such a space saver for my small changing table.

I was able to use it for a short time until the plastic piece that the wipes container sits on broke. They need to use a better plastic. I did have a problem with more than one diaper coming out at a time, like others have, but learned if you pull upward a little usually only one diaper will come out at a time. If the company would use a stronger plastic I think this could be a very useful item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful","review":"Be careful when buying.

If it does, maybe it's good for that.But isn't that the whole point of a changing table? To have shelves and stuff where you can put things?I just use a dresser and a shelf next to it and it works great.

I had to put it on the side and was not pleased to find out that it is not possible to use unless it is hung. More bad news... I purchased the Ultimate Wipes Warmer, which will not fit on top of the depot while it is hanging on the side of the changing table. Perhaps these products work fine with a typical changing table, but keep in mind they do not work with a folding top dresser type."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken & Brittle","review":"I registered for a diaper depot and will not be keeping it if I receive one.

Well, what a big disappointment when the wipes warmer did not fit snugly. We have the Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer, which is shown on the side of the box fitting nicely. Yeah, right.

I'm glad we bought this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get one of these for your Pack 'N Play!","review":"I bought this product to use on my Pack 'N Play. It's definitely a nicer way to keep diapers and wipes organized at my Pack 'N Play changing table. It fits onto the side of the Pack 'N Play nicely. I wish the tub for the wipes box on top was deeper though. The wipes box always tends to want to fall off when I'm taking a wipe out. I also wish it held more diapers and that the diaper slot wasn't so wide, because when I pull out a diaper, about 2 or 3 want to come out at once. But all in all, this has been a nice item to have at my Pack 'N Play for diaper changing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Great But......","review":"So I ordered this organizer so we wouldn't have to keep bending over to get diapers off of the changing table shelf. This is exactly what we wanted and it is sturdy and holds everything that we need it to hold. Unfortunatly we have to return it because it doesn't fit our changing table. We have a white Graco Changing Table from Target so if you have this changing table it will not work with it. Which makes me sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cracked","review":"I ordered this to hang on the end of my Ikea changing table (as a few reviewers have noted, if you have a combination changing table/dresser, this may not work for you). Unfortunately, it arrived and was cracked and crushed at the top. So, I sent it back and requested a replacement. AGAIN, cracked. So I sent that back and asked for a refund. I found the same product (for $14, a little bit more but not terrible) at Babies R Us. I opened two boxes at the store to inspect them and BOTH were cracked or chipped. I don't know if this is because of the type of pastic being used, a defective batch from the factory, or simply bad luck on my part. But, I am going to pass on this product although it seemed like it would have worked well otherwise. Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome for changing table organization","review":"Simple, yet so helpful!

This doesn't fit over the edge of the pack n play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work with every changing table","review":"I bought this because I wanted something at table-level for holding the wipes. When I tried to install it on my changing table, I discovered that the end of my changing table was too thick.

(Mine was 1-1/4\\" thick.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but could use more room.","review":"I bought mine about 4 years ago and I do like it. It has held up well, even with constant use. It holds quite a few diapers and as long as you don't let it get down to only one left, they don't fall out.The place for wipes will hold any size container and does accomodate warmers.I have a standard changing table and it hangs nicely on the side, keeping my little guy from playing with it and keeping it out of the way.My only complaint about it is that the accessory compartments need to be bigger. They can hold the basics, but not much else. (I could only fit a sample size baby powder in it. The bigger size? Forget it.)Would I buy it again? Yes, I would, but it is so well made that I won't have to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"I registered for this item and was very happy when I received it. I am an organized person and I love having different compartments for each thing, and each thing in it's place. This holder is great because it keeps the diapers and wipes right where you need them. It also has extra side pockets for lotions, powders, etc. I found the side pockets were not as big as I would have liked, and ended up purchasing another holder for the other side of the table, with smaller compartments, for things like q-tips and cotton balls, but otherwise, an excellent product. I gave one to my cousin, filled with the appropriate baby potions, and it made a really cute gift for her new daughter, and I will save mine for use with my next child. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because of the size of the side pockets, but all-around, this is a good product. Out of all the baby products I have purchased, (alot) this is one of the top five best, if only for it's convenience.

Because Torts are not that complex, the brevity and structure of those two will probablely better serve you when it comes time for the final.

True, there are some entries that leave you wondering, \\"how will I ever apply this esoteric fact or get asked a question on it?\\" But trust me, it is the highest yield book in all of medical school. Read this, and First Aid, and you will be set for about 70% of all questions on Step 1.

I can only say, like I did with the DVD, the music is mediocre at best to me. Nothing really moved me and after viewing the DVD I had no interest in hearing it again on CD. At least with the DVD watching the band was a distraction from the music. I only watched it once and likely won't again. It wasn't anything in the way they played or the sound quality.

It's rare that I find a movie so unengaging that I want to quit in the middle of watching, but I was seriously tempted with this one. The only interesting part was a dreamy 10 minute sequence close to the end where (SPOILER) the jealous maid tries to poison the lady of the house. That was the only really \\"Hitchcockian\\" thing in the whole movie.I've never been a fan of Ingrid Bergman, finding her overrated in the looks department, but it wasn't until watching this movie that I realized that not only was she not the looker Hollywood hyped her up to be, but the woman couldn't act!

Stoll's main point is that people are spending too much time on computers and on the Internet, and it is a valid point. He says that they should live real life, which is a good suggestion. This would have made a good magazine article.The problem is that the book is full of criticism of every minutia of the computer world. After a while Stoll justs looks petty. For example, he says that when parents encourage their children to use computers, they are telling them not to be interactive. What about the old days, when kids were told to practice the piano? The book is full of criticisms provided without context.I made it to page 150, but couldn't take any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A STOP sign for the digital library and Internet advocates","review":"In a word, this book gives us a second chance to think -to think before it's too late, in regarding to all thedigital hypes.After reading the preface of this book, I alreadystarted thinking everything about Internet, digital library,and all the related stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Presents a different perspective - a worthwhile read.","review":"Cliff evaluates the use of computers in many areas of life by looking at the current state of the artand projecting forward.

If you want to read a tedious list of complaints and opinions about how everything is better in \\"the real world\\" than on a computer, then this is your book. Unfortuneatly, as much as he paints a dark picture of the net, he also paints a naively optimistic picture of the real world. In truth, the real world is not all great, and the networks are not all bad. This is elementary. Lot's of people have joined the digital bandwagon that I sense don't have a clue why.

His powers of prediction, however, leave much to be desired. Warning us against the perils and pitfalls of such evils as internet commerce, Stoll paints a picture of the internet as a dark place doomed to languish in obscurity, because people are obviously much too smart to communicate with others primarily through a computer.Basically, the mere fact that I'm reviewing this book a) online and b) at a site like Amazon prove Stoll's central, secondary, and tertiary theories utterly, utterly wrong.

But many of Stoll's predictions and insights about the internet simply never came to pass. For instance, he claims that \\"few aspects of daily life require computers... they're irrelevant to cooking, driving, visiting, negotiating, eating, hiking, dancing, speaking, and gossiping.\\" Not true. I've gotten countless wonderful recipes online, I wouldn't think of planning a trip without consulting an online map site, and I've learned more about different hiking trails via conservation websites than I would have ever come across in books or magazines. I understand that computers are not an absolute necessity. But I don't know what I would do without quick, easy, and inexpensive access to the information available on the internet these days. And that's saying nothing of e-commerce, which has revolutionized the trade of goods in this country over the last decade or so.

I had first read it back in 1995, and just last week skimmed through it again. True, a lot of the details are outdated and history has (almost comically) outdone even Stoll's most outlandish predictions, but the book should nevertheless be read and digested for its humorous and interesting presentation of a serious viewpoint.

Stoll's world view is valid - there really is a real world out there and it's darn interesting. Certainly, computers are at times frustrating, isolating money holes. But like everything else, the cyberworld is cheapened by hype, commercialization and the over use of the prefix \\"cyber-\\". Most of us are able to figure this out, so must it be regurgitated over and over for 236 pages? Stoll's writing is the book's strongest point, but the serial reminiscences do get taxing, and are more than a bit narcissistic. Stoll's arguments, on the other hand, suffer from a lack of consistency -- he complains that access to networks is too slow, but criticizes e-mail as being too fast for proper savoring as communication.

Communications, knowledge, realtionships all happen better in the real world than they do online. Only those who have been online so long that there brains have turned to mush would argue with this.

I failed.This is reading of the most frustrating kind because I couldn't resist pointing out the flaws in each of Clifford's arguments, but talking back to a book is a little pointless!Hence me writing this review, my first ever.All this book has taught me is to read reviews carefully before buying.

They are all top flight musicians without the silliness of Canadian Brass.I'm so happy they put their best together in one CD album. Every piece is exceptional and the interpretations are classical in style and pleasant to listen to.Since I was I boy I loved to listen to these pieces imagining them played at royal courts of Europe.

Still, that's $25 per disc, and I should say just $25 per disc, because I consider that still a bargain given the the music you'll obtain. Including Purcell, Byrd, Bull, Farnaby and more, the first disc contains sparkling brass renditions of English music that runs from Henry VIII to the early Baroque, with most of it centering on Elizabethan times -- plus a snippet of Gabrieli. The second disc concentrates on the Continent, with selections by Gervaise, Praetorius, Scheidt and others. Every piece is a winner, and though in some cases this is not how the music would have been originally heard, the tunes remain a delight.

I think this would be a great supplement to a General Biology course, but is too detailed for regular use in a high school biology course, with the exception of AP. I think it is a little too detailed for a high school bio class, although it covers everything that I was introduced to in my Bio 110 course.A slight caution--many people may see the title and bright cover thinking this would be a 'fun' way to learn or a great 'fun' gift to someone interested in science. In reality, it's set up like a textbook. It's meant to be a serious aide to someone learning biology. In that sense, it's a great tool, but this isn't like the coloring books we used as kids!

Most, like the ones on Satre, Kierkegaard and Heidegger are excellent (especially since reading those authors primary works is difficult if not impossible). Thats why I am so saddened by this terrible introduction on old Fred. First of all, the art is pretty bad. Second of all, it makes no real attempt to explain what Nietzche said and wrote. Instead it is full of out of context qoutes with little or no analysis and/or explanation. Very poorly done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing compred with Sartre For Beginners","review":"Nietzcsche for Beginners, compared with Sartre for Beginners is highly disjointed, contains distracting grammatical errors, and does not give the beginning reader a solid sense of Nietzche's ideas.

These are interesting books in their biographies, but the idea that a philosopher could be compressed into such a comic book is unthinkable and ridiculous. I suggest you read Young Nietzche and the RJ Hollingdale biography. These are the only two I have read, mind you, but I think they're not bad. Biographies of philosophers are usually more interesting than reading their actual philosophy, but not as important. Also read the Starkie biography of Rimbaud and the only biography of Dostoevsky and the Monk biography of Wittgenstein.

Capital Group has one of the most amazing long-term performances and is one of the most unique organizations in the industry! But this book just stinks. I can barely believe the Charlie Ellis wrote this. It's completely disjointed. There's no structure at all. It's like they just published his notes. He skips across generations within a single paragraph. He contradicts himself. About 150 of the 300 pages is fluff and adds nothing to the story. About 1/3 of EVERY page is footnotes that add nothing. He references chapters within the same chapter. It's just terrible. It's obvious the publisher was just in a hurry to get the book out to make a buck off the mutual fund scandal before the hype died off. How ironic that Capital Group takes a long term approach, launching new funds against the tide, while the people at Wiley (by launching this book before it was ready) have shown themselves to be a bunch of short-sighted money grubbers."},{"rating":"1","title":"For students & admirers only!","review":"I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book - it would be the first time that anything comprehensive has been written on the organization.

Sure; the overriding message is that the organization is vastly successful, and the author praises Capital throughout.

My own fault, I know, but the huge drill bit size and the multiple holes per lock makes this too possible... I got so annoyed I gave up, and quickly and easily installed some \\"regular\\" white plastic locks instead, and will return the magnetic ones.

The only trick with these locks is to remember to keep the magnetic key in the same place all of the time.

In the kitchen, you can store the opener high on the refrigerator, but again, you must retrieve it every time you want to open something.We use these locks on some of the high-risk, low-use cabinets we have.

But installation was a painful process, involving copious use of profanity on my part. Some notable issues:- The microsized instruction sheet is nearly useless.- The screws are way too small. I had to use a #0 Phillips to tighten them: most people probably don't _have_ a screwdriver this small. You can try to use a #1 Phillips, but you'll instantly strip the screws. It's very difficult to get the screws tight.- So, you think, I'll just go to the hardware store and get bigger screws. But no: for anything larger you'd have to enlarge the holes in the lock, and there's just not much margin to drill them out bigger.This would be a fine product if the manufacturer had put a bit more (or any?) thought into installation."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie tops my top 10 list","review":"I was lucky enough to see this movie in the theater when it came out and quick enough to buy the first VHS copy I could get my hands on.

This was one of Soderbergh's earliest and (in my opinion) best directorial efforts. Irons is a perfect Kafka and Theresa Russell does a magnificent job with her sexy anarchist and love-interest role. One of the best characters is definitely Joel Grey's officious little insurance clerk-- the personification of \\"the banality of evil\\".The switch to technicolor midway through the movie is pure genius and a nice touch after the noir feel of the first half.

The conceit is a brilliant one as individualism and hope is crushed in a totalitarium state where conformity is demanded. I hoped for a disturbing ending similar to what Terry Gilliam did to his protoganist at the end of BRAZIL. That ending was truly organic to the storytelling. The ending to KAFKA with Jeremy Irons did not have the chill factor I expected in this film. This is one of Soderbegh's early films and it shows. It needed to be deleriously paranoid and over-the-top. Apart from some startling visuals the film plays it extremely safe within the context of this genre. Soderbegh would go on and direct THE GOOD GERMAN and improve as a director from the soft movie that is KAFKA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong name","review":"This product is sold as a shock on this website.

First four cuts are from a show they played at London's Paris Theatre in 1970 with Carl Palmer on drums. The second four cuts are also from the Paris Theatre in 1971 with Paul Hammond on drums. The tracks that I enjoyed the most are \\"Friday The 13th\\", \\"Shabaloo\\", \\"Tomorrow Night\\" (one of my personal Rooster favorites) and the twelve-minute version of \\"I Can't Take No More\\". The only thing I don't care for on 'Live&Raw' is the repeated introducing of the band prior to nearly every song. Other than that, it's a great title, for a low-fi archive release.

You're going to hear a lot about this enormous new talent. Told in the first person by kick-butt heroine Jessie \\"Robards,\\" who uses her PhD in botany to scour the world for rare orchids for her billionaire boss, this books takes Jessie to the Amazon in search of the Death Orchid--which she's been told will prolong the life of the uncle who raised her. Along the way there's one crisis after another, all told in Moore's refreshing voice. As a female Indiana Jones, Jessie also has one sexy love interest in this exciting book. There's pathos, along with plot twists galore. Can't wait for this author's next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I believe Problems of knowledge is a very biased book, because from the very beginning Williams has the goal of selling you his version of contextualism. His treatment of coherentism, foundationalism, and other epistemological theories is geared only to set up his own views of which he overly generalizes in order to hide many of his own shortcomings. His argument for why contextualism isn't a form of relativism is especially bad. However, it is not as terrible of a book as my first review implied. Chapter five on Aggripan skepticism is very good, and the book gives an excellent overall summation of the history of epistemology. In regards to writing style, I find that the book is very dense and dull, and Williams' sentences are often not very clear. To make matters worse, it is also a very difficult book, and one that I would not suggest to someone not highly interested and trained in philosophy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent introduction to epistemology","review":"As a doctoral candidate in philosophy specializing in epistemology I am familiar with many inductory books in the field. In my opinion, William's \\"Problems of Knowledge\\" is one of the best. The book is especially insightful on the issue of skepticism and argues for a sophisticated contextualism."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CRITICAL Introduction","review":"This is a CRITICAL introduction, meaning that Williams argues for his own views (but he is fair to others). I am familiar with Williams's other work (e.g., Unnatural Doubts) and I thought this might be a good way to fill the gaps in my knowledge of epistemology while at the same time being an interesting take on the issues from a major figure in the field. Not only did Williams deliver on presenting areas with which I am less familiar, but he clarified his version of contextualism and idea of \\"epistemological realism.\\" The book has been valuable for my own thinking in that I now find contextualist responses to skepticism less convincing than I had initially thought (i.e., one need not agree with Williams to get something out of the book). Lastly, while this is an introduction that anyone could read, some background in epistemology is going to help. In fact, those with a background in epistemology will benefit greatly from this critical introduction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent as a second book","review":"I have to agree with most reviewers that this introduction is accessible but demanding. However, I think that it would be best if the reader used this is a second book. A great first book would be Richard Feldman's introduction which discusses a lot of the issues in this book but in a more friendly (and less critical way). That said, this book is really good because the author raises very important questions regarding most schools of thought. While being short, the book is packed with argument after argument and therefore it is not a quick read (at least to me), but it is a very enjoyable one. This book shouldn't be criticized for being biased to a certain philosophy since the author made it clear from the start that he has an opinion and that he was going to build a case for it. Personally, the author wasn't able to make a believer out of me, but that doesn't take away anything from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good basic notebook","review":"With the Celeron processor things are a little pokey with CPU intensive applications, but for the money this is an excellent notebook.

I shall try to find a volume of Mulliner stories to read.After enjoying the Jeeves & Wooster series, however, I was appalled by the canned laughter in Wodehouse Playhouse. I wonder if Wodehouse, who introduces them, objected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sophisticated comedy","review":"I never read any of P.G. Wodehouse's literary works until after I began watching the Wodehouse Playhouse on our local PBS channel in the early 1980's. Yes, it's fair to say that the serials developed for BBC TV strayed somewhat from the original stories, but so what....... The seven stories on this DVD set are well worth your time to view... they are well done, period costume comedies. However, if you are one of those individuals who believe a show like FRIENDS is outrageously funny, then you probably won't enjoy the WODEHOUSE PLAYHOUSE.Highly recommended for anyone studying English literature. View the series on DVD first, then dig up the original stories and read them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure enjoyment","review":"Having read the books and enjoyed them immensely, my husband and myself are very happy to be able to see them on screen and be able to entertain our friends.It is a wellcome diversion to follow something so funny, to be able to laugh, as nowadays there is not very much laughter in the air. The two main actors are excellent, specially \\"Jeeves\\"As I said before..it is pure enjoyment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"from the master of British humor","review":"This series is classic British comedy with an introduction by the old fellow himself.I've read some of the JeevesThe Inimitable Jeeves (The Collector's Wodehouse)stories and this has the same quality of creeping up on your comedy boneand taking it by surprise.The stammerer who can't say he loves his girl and taking the doctor's orderstries to talk to three strangers. When he offers tea to the third stranger aftershe was told a madman was loose, he gets chased over the English countrysideand shot at, but the fear cures him...Similar episodes where the improbable becomes typical Britishmake us laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Farberware skillet","review":"I bought this and some other pans in the set.

The back-light color is not overly bright with the monitor on, but keys are well lit, even in daylighting. This is by no means a gamer's keyboard as it has no bells or whistles other than the led back lighting, but it is what I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good blue lights but finish is not as good as I had expected","review":"I bought this product because I needed a USB keyboard. I really like the blue lights since I like working in the dark but the other components are of poor quality. By that I mean the keys and rest pad, the stuff you 'touch'. They don't feel all that rigid nor do they feel a punch. The rest pad is all plastic no soft cushions or surface finishing.Great looking keyboard but the touching aspect is a bit lacking.Sorry, was expecting too much for $34 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"keys starting to \\"blur\\"","review":"I have been using this keyboard for about 2.5 months, and a number of the most commonly used keys are starting to \\"blur\\". It seems as though something is happening to the grey covering that's allowing more of the blue light to shine through so that the letters appeared blurred.I can't think of anything that I could be doing to cause this: My hands are clean and I don't drop/spill things on the keyboard.I just wrote Saitek and I'm sure that they'll replace the keyboard, but that means my expense in sending it to them, and I have no reason not to think it'll happen again.I note that one of the reviewers of the Eclipse II posted a photo of exactly the same thing happening to him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice keyboard","review":"I bought this keyboard about a month ago, and have had no problems. The glowing effect is neat, if a bit unnecessary. The weight, feel, and so on are fine. The volume control keys don't work in Linux, but that's to be expected, and everything else is just fine. All in all, a good keyboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as it looks","review":"After a few months the paint on the spacebar, c, v, n, m keys wore off leaving me with blue glowing splotches rather than letters on the keys. Also, the backlight really isn't as bright as the pictures make it seem. Some keys click louder than others when you type as well. If you can see past these issues it's a fairly solidly built keyboard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Keyboard","review":"This keyboard is a dream. Keys are not as tall as most keyboards and easy to press and the board can sit completely flat which is good for your wrists and fingers. I am glad that I bought this keyboard, it plugs into an open USB port and and does not use any software to use. The keyboard has four addtional keys that let you, Mute, Turn up, Turn down,(the volume) and adjust the backlight for the keys. the greatest thing about this keyboard in my opinion is the backlight on the keyboard. The keys are lit up from underneath as well not just around the keys as seen in the pictures. I love this keyboard. And it's really quite, it looks really cool to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keyboard Keys Stick","review":"After a few months the some of the keys stopped working. The Saitek Web Site is a joke.

Keys are very quiet and well made also!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, especially for the price","review":"Good heavy keyboard. Keys are a pleasure to type with. Installation easy, just plug in. The lighting looks really good, rated it a 4 because the characters on the keys are not well defined when using the keyboard in a totally dark room, but I just bought it for how it looks anyway.

One thought tho, why do all 4 of my keyboards have the \\"delete\\" button in a different place?"},{"rating":"1","title":"worked for 3 months","review":"Very excited when i first got this keyboard, and it worked good for 3 months. After the 3 months the (h) key started to repeat when i only pressed it once, then 2 keys, then a key or two would stop working and i would have to press them harder.

Although soem reviewers claim the illumination to be too bright, I feel that it's just the right level for me. I was afraid it would light up the room, but it just makes the keys shine without any interference to the monitor.Additionally, the keys are soft, quiet, and extremely responsive. A nice typing experience for someone who types quite a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saitek Eclipse Paint Problem","review":"Pros: Everything I was looking for in a keyboard. It's backlit, which is a fantastic feature in a dark room. The key response is very nice. Not too soft and not too hard.Cons: I use it quit a bit for gaming, with the home keys receiving most of the use. The paint has worn off badly on the A,S,and D keys and is starting to wear on the X key. The problem with this is that if you're not an excellent typist and need to look at the keys in a dark room the characters are gone on these keys and all you see is light shining through.The company said they can't replace the keys, but I had to ship the keyboard back to them and they would look into the problem. Not the answer I was looking for. Had they backpainted the keys instead, you wouldn't be able to wear the paint off the keytops and obliterate the characters.I wouldn't purchase another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"great keyboard","review":"this keyboard is good...you have to get used to it..the board has 2 light brininess levels high and low and it looks great when you stand up and look at it...i wish it would be BRIGHTER its great for night gaming you can see all the keys in the dark i have no problem and if your woundering the little hand rest is plastic not some cushion to nor soft its a great buy for 30$ buy it.."},{"rating":"2","title":"pleased and slightly disappointed","review":"Out of the box I loved this keyboard, the key feel is great, the back lighting (with high/low and off settings) is just the thing I was looking for. One month into use, and not hard use by any means, I can't get settings button to work. I hate to see it remain lit all the time so I unplug the USB, kinda a drag, if I hadn't tossed the box I'd send it back for a replacement...I am hoping for YOUR sake that is an isolated case because it is really a nice keyboard for the price.

After purchasing it, I found an article on the Internet saying that a person called the company to ask about swtich compatibility and they said it's not compatible and they have no plans to make it work. They also could not say why it didn't work. I'm sad that I had to return it.

So its 5 *****'s with a A+ attached, Thanks and Great Job, Saint Paul, MN"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor support","review":"I purchased this keyboard in January, and at first liked it quite a bit. The backlighting is accomplished by painting the keys silver, and leaving the letters bare so it shines through each letter. Unfortunately, within about a month one of the keys (A) had the paint so worn off as to be unreadable. This has since spread to 5 other keys, making it a mess to look at, and making the backlight worthless.Contacted the parent company (Saitek in the UK), who referred me to their US counterpart, Madkatz. I've contacted them three times for either replacement keys or a replacement keyboard, to no avail. They claim everything from \\"we don't have keys\\" to \\"we will send replacements right out\\", and they never do.Do not buy. You will regret the expenditure as soon as the keys begin to wear, and they will not back up their product. Very dissatisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was even better than I expected","review":"Very compact, but still a decent size for typing (even for my husband who has larger hands than I do). The light feature is REALLY handy, and I like that you can completely turn it off if you want. The light is not distracting, and is very easy on the eyes in bright light or in the dark.The keys are very quiet, and have a nice feel to them (not too stiff or too loose).Over all I would say that this is a GREAT keyboard, and I was very pleased with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keyboard","review":"After only one month, the lighting on the keyboard is failing. many keys do not light at all. Lighting is very uneven.One good feature is the sound control keys on the keyboard,but Iwould not buy this keyboard again as I wanted a keyboard to use in the dark. I leave the light on the keyboard turned on all the time. It might be better to turn the light on only whenneeded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Key strokes are perfect not too long and not too short. Though a little louder then say your average run of the mill default keyboard its got a nice sound that lets you know you have hit the key. The build quality is excellent and feels as though i could throw it and it wouldn't break. Though there are only 3 media buttons (sound up/down and mute) thats all any real computer needs. And the back light is perfect. in pitch black conditions its more then bright enough to see every key crystal clear. Even in fully lit conditions the back light is bright enough to make the keys seen. My friend has a G15, which i use all the time, and i prefer this keyboard. Better key feel, smaller more convinient and 1/2 the cost. Its perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Muy buen Teclado , pero sin ñ","review":"Exactamente lo que queria, ilumina de noche y se puede colocar mas tenue la luz... lo unico malo es que es en ingles y la ñ no aparece.

Trouble is, the backlighting shines up through the keys in such a way that it's very hard to see, especially at the lower angle. I'm sure this would be fine if you were a touch typist but since I'm not it's a waste of money for me. If you just want it to look cool, this might be for you. If you really need to see the keys in low light, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Computer Keyboard - lighted","review":"Received an Saitek Eclipse lighted keyboard from my electronic oriented daughter for Christmas. It is great as I am online at night often and it is easy to see the keys.In turn, we gave same product to sister-in-law who saw and appreciated this good keyboard. She also is delighted. Highly recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: Glitches on really fast typing.","review":"If you type really quickly (over 110 wpm) you will find that this keyboard sometimes switches the characters you type around so that the leftmost character is registered first. Example: if I type \\"would have\\" quickly, I often get \\"woudl ahve\\" instead. Note that this is a reproducible glitch and has to do with poor hardware design of the keyboard itself, not with my style of typing--these glitches don't happen on my laptop's keyboard when I use it.This keyboard also does not allow you to press 3 keys simultaneously for some combination of keys (for example, the keys r y u cannot be pressed at the same time. This also affects a few other keys that are used in FPSes, etc.)I would not recommend this keyboard to anyone who is serious about gaming or speed typing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget the good reviews here!!!!!!!!","review":"No matter how this keyboard looks or feels there is just no excuse for the paint coming off the keys.

Apparently there are three different G15's available.I'll keep searching but I think it's hopeless.Beware of which G15 you buy if you are considering one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good keyboard but over time letters wear off","review":"My husband is a \\"hunt and peck\\" typer. One of our computer desks is in our bedroom. My husband always had to have a light on when I was trying to sleep when he was on the computer working, so he could see what he was typing. I bought him this Saitek keyboard for Christmas last year (2007). Our entire family, including children love this keyboard and it is used several hours a day. The only issue I have is, after ten months the paint is wearing off of the frequently used keys. It's not a problem for me, but the \\"hunt and peck\\" typers I live with will eventually have a problem. It's still a good keyboard and I may try to put permanent marker letters on the keys eventually and see how that works. Overall a good product. Even if I have to purchase another one eventually, the light is off when my hubby is typing. I'm happy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Keyboard","review":"The quality of this product is great! The keys are soft but have good tactile feed back and are quiet. The two settings on the blue leds work well; the bright and low settings are quite useable.

Thankfully Saitek/Madcatz offer a 2 year warranty on the product. Tech support was really good, they speak english as a first language.

I did however expect a perfectly functional keyboard that glowed in a really cool way (and I did get precisely that). Aesthetically this keyboard is a joy, and it's 100% functional. Considered from the perspective of nothing more than a keyboard, though, it doesn't offer what similarly-priced products do.If you consider more-than-basic functionality to be your priority, this isn't your best choice. If, on the other hand, your priority is a keyboard that's aesthetically pleasing every time you sit down to use your computer (and that's also reliable as a plain keyboard), this product won't disappoint you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice keyboard","review":"Bought this for new pc I built. Blue backlighting matches pc and monitor beautifully. No complaints. Worked from the start. NIce key feel. Backlight is helpful in low light. Would buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Idea","review":"Since most computer desks these days try to save space by having a slide out keyboard tray, it also seems that the F and number keys remain in the dark. I have always had a problem seeing them in their little dark space and have to either 'trial and error' them or pull the keyboard out to see them. I love gaming in the dark and no matter how well you know a keyboard..sometimes it's nice to look down in the dark and see those keys. Also, the keyboard is wonderful to type on.My only complaint is that I would actually like the bright setting to be a little brighter. There are three settings: High, Low, and off. I find low to be useless and high to be what I would call low. This being one of the few quality keyboards of it's type, I find this one well worth the price. (I saw adds in the UK for a similar 'letter lit' one but have yet to investigate)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short term, it's looking good","review":"I've had the keyboard for 2 weeks now, so I can't comment on durability. As others have said, the keys are very soft to the touch and it is very quiet when typing. The lighting on it is excellent, both for low-light and normal conditions. The keyboard is also very sturdy with heavy grip pads on the bottom.Overall, I would say it's money very well spent for an excellent keyboard. For gamers who are used to low-light conditions and want the best of the best, this keyboard will suit you nicely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This!","review":"This keyboard worked fine for the first two months or so.

A complete rip-off and horrid customer support. Do Not Buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Keyboard","review":"Amazon calls this product a gaming keyboard but I'm not sure why. Nevertheless, this is a solid product that is well worth the price Amazon is charging. It feels good when typing and it looks good all the time. The backlit, laser etched keys are a plus in low-light conditions. I can recommend this product to anyone who wants a good, functional keyboard that stands out in the looks and coolness departments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really for gamers","review":"I'm very sad to report that I had to return this otherwise excellent keyboard, because on certain combination of key strokes it stops detecting subsequent keys strokes.For example if I press up arrow, left arrow and Ins key. They keyboard will ignore Ins key.I had to go back to my old crappy, bulky, $19 dollar, and uncool Microsoft keyboard.The people at Saitek told me they know of this problem and they can't do nothing about it. I just wished I had looked in the Saitek forums before purchasing this item, because a lot of people have posted the same problem.To bad because everything form this keyboard is excellent, aside from the most basic thing, well for a gamer anyways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keys Wear Out Quickly and Often","review":"When the keys started to blur on my Saitek 2 and I had replaced them twice, I thought that I'd go down a notch and get this keyboard. I DO like the idea of a backlit keyboard. However, I've had the same problem with this Saitek: see photo in gallery, and you'll see that the B, C, and U are becoming unreadable. Yes, I used the same photo for both keyboards: the only difference was that the N, G, O, and five others blurred on the other keyboard.Saitek has told me that they are aware of the problem, but when they sent another set of keys for a full board, they wore out in less than a month. Since they do guarantee their product, perhaps it's worth a chance for you. For me, I'm going back to the old tried and true board that I got from Logitech.P.S. the backlighting - at least in blue - doesn't give off enough light to really \\"define\\" the keys. Since I'm not a touch typist, this is even more critical than keys wearing out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go with the PC Gamers Keyboard instead","review":"I previously purchased the PC Gamers Keyboard and thought this would be a nice upgrade.

Perfect for night time gaming or surfing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saitek Eclipse (blue)","review":"Illumination so dim as to be entirely useless, which was the reason I got the keyboard. Otherwise, the keyboard functions fine, but is no better than my stock Dell keyboard, and therefore not worth the price. I took it apart to replace the LEDs with brighter ones, and discovered that there are only FIVE tiny surface-mount LEDS on a strand lighting the entire keyboard. There should be at least twice that number. Decided not to bother and ordered a Firefly Borealis instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smudging keys, hard see keys unless it is dark","review":"My keys are pretty smudged, at the moment, the A,S,D,E,C,V,B,N,L,LEFT SHIFT,and space bar are barely readable. Also unless you are in a very dark room, the keys are easier to read with the LED turned off. As for operations, it works fine, no bad keys, no erratic behavior. This is why it pains me to get a new keyboard, but I can't take it anymore. I will probably keep it as a backup keyboard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I highly recommend this keyboard for all gamers and just computer users in general. It has lasted me quite a while now and it still lights up well. There's only one problem with it, however, but this may just be this particular keyboard. At times (not often, maybe two-three times before), the USB cable would stop working and the keys wouldn't work at all. The power is on because the blue light is on, but I cannot type anything. This is the only issue I see with this product and I'm sure for many others, this problem wouldn't occur often at all.The best part about this keyboard is the silence from typing. These keys are incredibly quiet, which is especially nice since I hate hearing keyboard 'clicking' sounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great keyboard, until it stops working.","review":"I purchased this keyboard for a friend. It stopped working 6 months after he started using it. Completely unresponsive, or spamming a random key (or keys) for no reason. A red one I purchased for myself did the same thing after a year of owning it.This was not a sudden break in either case, the keyboard would occasionally have a fit a few months before it broke where it would exhibit the behaviors listed above. Eventually the behavior becomes permanent. I tried opening up my keyboard to fix it by cleaning the inside, checking for debris or loose parts, etc. Nope, no luck.I love having a backlit keyboard, but I love having a keyboard that doesn't break in less than a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"not great","review":"The coating on the keys is poor and has begun wearing off after only 6 months. Its the \\"gap\\" in the coating that creates the letter shapes. Therefore, some letters will soon be hard to read. N and M already look like blobsAlso: I use the volume controls frequently.. NONE of them are back lit,Also, the position of the light source behind the numeric keys make it very hard to read the punctuation marks that you use with the shift key. For example, when you need #,$,or % I have to shift far forward over the keyboard to see these symbols."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's OK, I guess......","review":"Firstly, it doesn't have long enough rear pegs to make it stand up properly.Secondly, it has this blue glow that actually makes it much more difficult to read the keyboard in the dark(ness). It should have been white light, but that wouldn't have been cool, yes?Thirdly, this \\"cool\\" blue light comes on with every boot. It must be turned off every time. Charge me another buck and give me a switch.The pros that I am able to offer for this product is the fact that the keyboard has soft-touch keys that feel pretty good.I have gome back to my US$9 OEM keyboard and am much happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice keyboard","review":"This is a pretty nice keyboard, very nice lights. Works well, nice that you can adjust the lights, just wish they would have put some hot keys on here. But its a good keyboard nevertheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eclipse Keyboard review","review":"I have had this keyboard for about a month now. For the most part, I like it a lot. I am not a gamer, I just use it as a regular keyboard, which is fine. You dont HAVE to be a gamer to have or use this keyboard. The keys are easy to use. I love the lighting on the keys. It has two settings, as well as turned off. I prefer to be on the computer in the dark and type, and this keyboard is good for that. My only issue with this keyboard is that it is not very angled and I am personally more used to a keyboard where the keys are not so flat. Other than that, so far it is great and I have had no problems"},{"rating":"1","title":"A cool keyboard while it lasted.","review":"I had this keyboard for about a year and I loved it. It is as cool looking as they say.Then about a month ago I had to throw it away. I am a college student and I was working on a research paper when it started typing keys I wasn't touching and then certain keys quit working at all. I had to use an old keyboard that the keys stick until I could get a new one.If you don't have $50 to throw away then I wouldn't recomend this keyboard. I am now using at $15 dell keyboard that is a little less cool looking, but does all the same things this one does at 1/3 the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Keyboard!","review":"I really like this keyboard.

The three settings of High, Low, and Off are perfect for any lighting situation. Now when the lights are off, either cause my wife and kids are sleeping or I'm playing F.E.A.R., there's no fumbling with the wrong keys. I have noticed that I keep the keyboard turned off most of the time. The contrast of black/non-lit characters on the silver keys is perfect for almost any light. But when I need it, man the blue lights are great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saitek keyboard","review":"Very disappointed, while it is lit the bluelight of the keys is darker than the background which is also lighted blue blue.

I purchased this version because was a bargain price. The build quality is ok and the Backlight is amazingly well done, but the Keyboard lack some proper driver to work with my windows Xp. It kept finding New hardware over and over until I downloaded a driver for another Saitek keyboard. Then I had to workaround with the registry to make all the 4 added buttons work properly.

It is only a USB and does not have an adaptor for PS hookup. The keys are silver instead of white hence making the reading of letters very difficult in any light condition with or without the backlighting of the unit itself. The lighting is not uniform throughout the keyboard. The wrist rest comes off all the time. I got so frustrated that after a while I just threw it away and went back to my old keyboard. It is not as quiet as some claim and if there was a zero star rating this thing would have certainly gotten it. I bet anything that nobody who produces this keyboard even uses it! so do NOT waste your money on this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this keyboard","review":"After only a few weeks the letters wear off the keys. There is no litature included with the keyboard. Customer service is practically non existant. Stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor contrast due to reflections","review":"I was not happy with this keyboard for one reason...reflective paint on the keys. If the keyboard was used in a completely dark room, it would work great, but the light from my monitor reflects off of the keys, resulting in a very low contrast between the keys and the illuminated letters on the keys. The tops of the keys should have been painted with a matte, non-reflective black, so that the blue light shining through the letters would be more in contrast. In real life use, the visual ergonomics are very poor.I think this keyboard is a great concept, but it was poorly realized. The light from a monitor reflects off of the keys, creating almost a silver look which is very low contrast to the illumination color.I also purchased a small Zippy Illuminated keyboard which is much easier to read. However, the Zippy is only slightly larger than a laptop keyboard and I wanted a full size, so I ordered the Eclipse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saitek Keyboard","review":"Pros: Excellent action on this keyboard. Very easy to see all of the keys with lights on high, low, or off, depending on room lighting. Cons: Keys for volume, but no other extra function keys. Back legs a short, keyboard sits very flat (I made wooden risers for mine)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been good..","review":"Well I bought this based on: it had a good layout, nice feel, and cool backlight.A few months later I discover that there is a fundamental flaw, however:Eventually, if you do not strike the keys precisely on-center, they have a tendency to \\"get stuck\\" on the mechanism underneath. This is quite frustrating, to be typing along, and suddenly come to a halt because you just bashed your finger on a key that isn't moving down.So, unfortunately, I am on the search for another keyboard already."},{"rating":"1","title":"An O.K. Keyboard with Cheesy Backlighting and no Fn Key","review":"I wanted a keyboard that I could use in low light with both my PC and Mac, and this one is reasonably o.k. Those users who enjoy the backlight of a Mac PowerBook or MacBook Pro will be disappointed by the cheap approach Saitek used to illuminate the keys, though. On the Mac, each key has its own embedded light under the key. On the Saitek light is splashed under the entire keyboard, reducing the contrast and making it much harder to see the keys. But it's better than nothing, and is helpful in low light. It would have also been nice if they had an Fn key, but such is life."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Great Product","review":"The MTM Shooter Accessory Box is well made product, this is my second box.

I hope that Adams' true values are not the ones in this book.The novel has tinges of Gilchrist's contents while trying to aspire to be \\"one of us\\" or a \\"good old gal\\". Adam's 'one of us' is 'oh so not caring' and 'so not right'."},{"rating":"1","title":"A truly dull novel","review":"A boring novel about boring waspy women in San Francisco who have no morals and no concern for anyone else besides themselves. These characters were predictable and dull. I hoped for something memorable to take away from this book, but I was left with nothing. I just hope that these characters are truly fictional and not based on real people. People like these characters are sad examples of humanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your traditional \\"story.\\"","review":"I liked it! Don't worry about a plot! It's all the characters, with whom it is surprisingly easy to get involved.At first, you wonder how you are going to follow so many main character, but Adams' style really brings everything to life. I found this to be a 'real' novel in the sense that that is how life is - everything changes, are we ever satisfied?, and we can't solve other's problems; so have to live our own lives. Entertaining, intelligent, and an interesting, detailed San Fran. setting. I couldn't get into the 80's era that it was supposed to represent though.

It seems as if they just can't keep their hands off each others' guys. In this book, Elizabeth is having a secret romance with Sam Woodruff, a biker. Several books later (in the diary) Jessica starts going out with Sam and Liz and Sam break off their romance. Jessica wasn't seeing Sam when Liz and Sam first went out, but why is Liz so attracted to Jessica-type guys? The same thing happened with Jessica. In Jessica's Secret Diary Vol. 2, Jessica has a secret romance with TODD. Weird.This book is really a good read, but it also shows how much Elizabeth loves Todd. Which is not very much. Either it's because Elizabeth gets bored with him, or else the guy is just to drop-dead gorgeous. But if Elizabeth really loved her boyfriend, she wouldn't get swayed by something as superficial as physical appearence. Yet, this book also shows that Liz is full of surprises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instant Cappuccino in an Instant","review":"This instant cappuccino is terrific when you are in a hurry.

They were great. Each book in the series builds on the one before with a few new challenges. These remind me of the Dick and Jane books when I was a kid. It has helped her build her confidience and she is now trying to sound out things where before she would get too frustrated to even try. They work on some memorization and picture help, which is also part of beginning to read. I highly recommend these books to any child who is having trouble starting to read. They were great for my kindergartner."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Three-Year-Old Can Read!","review":"Of all the books I have purchased for my son, this is has been the most encouraging. I have been teaching my son phonics on my own, and sounding out words on a flashcard was becoming dull. I knew he understood the basic concepts of reading, but I couldn't find anything interesting to him that he could actually read. Bob Books are amazing! The little storybooks are THE perfect first reading books for any child. They feature simple, easy-to-sound-out three letter words with interesting storylines. There are 12 mini-books which progress phonetically as each book has been completed. Included are character finger puppets, which I recommend saving for after the books have been read the first time (so the child can focus). The puppets provide extra motivation. My son adores these books. He read the books the very first time I opened the box! Both mommy and son are thrilled! I strongly urge parents to jumpstart their children's reading with these books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what they need to learn to read","review":"I too cannot say enough about these books.

Straightforward, simple, achievable, and fun to color! I am working my way through the sets with my 5 year old twins and they are doing really well and are proud of themselves instead of struggling and confused.

Their mother attempts to let them lead their own lives but the clashes that are the result are heartbreaking for her. This is a great story of family and faith. Robert Morgan delivers the unique dialogue that breathes life into this tale of a poor mountain family. A delightful surprise is the appearance the main characters from his novel Gap Creek, which brings the feeling of familiarity to the story for those who have had the pleasure of reading that novel.

I wouldn't.I'm giving this series 4 stars based on the plot premise; I won't ever have the chance to actually watch it until the anime companies wise up and release English dubbed versions.

If you're interested in good World War II fiction or just plain good storytelling, you can't go wrong with this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trial By Fire","review":"This is not a great book although it can be used as a great illustration as to \\"you should always write about what you know best.\\" In this case, I find it difficult to believe the author knows a thing of combat, World War II, history in general, making love or story telling. The story line is weak. The dialog is corny and the book is quite poorly researched. Even the \\"cussing\\" is forced and complete gratuitous - I doubt if the author ever listened to a GI talk. The book reads much like a Harlequin, a poorly written one. I would suggest the author stick to his empty Westerns. Jacket and in-book synopsis are quite misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine concept, but...","review":"As a sufferer from Crohn's Disease, I was particularly interested in reading how a doctor would explain it to a child. I was disappointed. No child I know would talk to another using these words. The dialog was stilted, didactic and inappropriate for the age level. It is understandable that a doctor would have trouble talking on a simple level about a disease that is not simple.The idea of making flowers from toilet paper, supposedly due to the numerous and lengthy trips to the bathroom that are often necessary, is a cute hook. However, in reality, many of those trips are too painful to be creative at the same time.In summary, I don't think a child would understand the condition too much better after reading the book. They need easier words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice to have a kid book about Crohn's, but bad quality","review":"It is exciting that there is a children's book about Crohn's. The author is a doctor with Crohn's, so the information in the book is factual and there are great notes preceding and following the story. However, the quality of this book is pretty poor. It is unrealistic. The whole subject of Crohn's get brought up because the mother serves her daughter a different snack than she does her daughter's friend. No child is going to believe that a mother would do that. Also, the way the children talk to each other isn't credible. The pictures are also not very well done, but I guess they get the job done. It is nice that children will have a book available to them about Crohn's but it is poor literature. I was disappointed. Children with Crohn's deserve a well written, well illustrated book, and I am still waiting for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun & Informative","review":"I was so thrilled when what I thought was a book ended up to be a rune set.

It demonstrates the shallowness and self-centeredness of both Henry and Katharine. These small-minded individuals would not have made an impact on the world except for the families they were born into. Reading this book emphasizes why the divine right of kings is not a good thing.

This product has got to be THE worst item I have bought since my baby was born. I followed the directions of installation to the tee, and it didn't last on my hearth a month. My 10-month-old has already pulled it off. Basically, anything that goes on with adhesive tape will be pulled off by the average baby. Lesson learned.

Like many other reviewers I felt the adhesive does a poor job of staying onto a brick fireplace. My 18 month old is constantly pulling off and I have to put back on, so there's no real point for this product. Also there isn't enough cushion provided to cover the edges of my fireplace. I had to buy two boxes, an expensive investment that I'll end up replacing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not strong enough","review":"While I loved how thick and cushioned this product was, the double backing tape was not strong enough to adhere to my brick fireplace and stand up to my daughter pulling on it.

It stuck well to the rough bricks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fuctional ?","review":"Well, if my 10 mth old baby couldn't rip these off the brick hearth, I'd be much more pleased with this product.

Maybe the manufacturer should consider stronger adhesive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its worh the money to protect the childern","review":"It does a good job protecting the edge of the cement hearth.

I felt it was a little pricey for what you get. The cushion doesn't stay on very well. It comes with double sided stick tape to put it on the edge of the fireplace and it comes off very easily. My 8mos old is now crawling and grabbing edges of tables etc. to pull himself up and he pulled it right off the fireplace. It has good cushion to it, but just doesn't stay in place. My sister-in-laws came up off her fireplace just like mine did and she wasn't that impressed with it. If you can find another product, I would try it first.

My (at the time) 11 month old toddler immediately pulled every last piece off (\\"NO\\" is such a hard thing at this age). I tried a heavier duty double-sided tape. Same result. Last week, 15 month old toddler, promptly smacks head on now bumper free fireplace. After an emergency room visit (no stiches, thank God) I decided to anchor guards into place with screws and anchors. Not the proper way these things are supposed to be installed. I am going to buy another set and super glue them to fireplace. Granted it is no one's fault that my son hit his head. But definitely agree that super glue needs to be supplied as standard item with this product. The product is fine but from reading reviews, everyone seems to agree, the anchoring system supplied is inadequate. I know that in the instructions they say a more durable type of tape or fastener may be necessary but at this point it should be considered standard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Busy Baby's Mom","review":"The concept is great, but the product isn't.

Our daughter was just learning to walk when we moved in and as part of our baby-proofing we decided we needed something for the fireplace. This was about the only option BRU had and it was a waste of money. It didn't fit together right and then the adhesive didn't stick to the brick. Plus when it was on our daughter seemed to be drawn to it! It never failed she wanted to go right to it and try to get it up. So we just took it up and she's been fine without anything on it. In fact, she's pretty much left it alone since we took this off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldnt stay stuck, made a huge mess and looked horrable","review":"This is worth it for the safety but Im going to warn that it dose NOT work on rock fire places.

The only difference is width of the bumpers. The Fireplace bumper is a lot wider, but same thickness. The bumpers stick very well and don't fall off. My son likes to stand up and sit down a lot near the brick base of the fireplace and he is constantly bumping hi knees against it. It works great and cushions his knee every time. I give it a 4 instead of 5 stars because it would be nice if there was an option for other colors. Other than that, great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use your imagination!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"We got this & it was a POS. As soon as you get it, you'll see.

My son constantly pulls off the pieces.

I plan to write a letter and complain to the company. Don't waste your money please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Don't Buy It!","review":"I wish this product would work. It doesn't. The pieces are easily pulled off by my twins. I ended up buying a kidco gate to go around the fireplace...I should have used this money to go toward that option in the first place. I really think it is the only thing that would work with most kids (maybe some kids aren't interested in pulling/playing with everything but mine are)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adhesive sticks to everything but the bumpers!","review":"These are very cushiony and I'm sure would protect against injury, but my dog easily pulls them right off.

With a surface as porous as brick, there's simply no way it will work (the box it comes in even shows a ceramic hearth so maybe that's what it's intended for). My husband bought some heavy-traffic carpet adhesive and that has worked pretty well. Our little one can still pull the foam guards off if he wants too, but the carpet adhesive is so sticky that they reapply with no problem. Also, we were disappointed that the pieces don't fit together better. There are obvious seams across the front so it's not the most attractive look. However, they do serve their purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had done more research","review":"I bought this product to protect my son.

Don't waste your money!","review":"Although the foam is dense enough to protect little noggins from sharp hearth corners, the pieces just don't stick! The \\"heavy duty\\" tape is a joke as my 11 month old daughter can easily remove the foam, which defeats its purpose. The paper backing was also extremely difficult to remove from the tape, making the whole process an exercise in frustration. Don't make the same mistake I did.

Rather, he is self-centered, foul-mouthed, inconsiderate, and dislikable. He shows disrespect to others and breaks the law for the sake of no one but himself. Worse than that, the reader has to sit through his long descriptions of what he does or has done to make himself more in touch with his rather phony-sounding \\"Indian identity.\\" But perhaps the worst thing of all, is that this book, while advertised as a story that shines a noble spotlight on the Dakota tribe, does just the opposite, as the tedious and immature narration makes the time-honored traditions of the Indians sound like utter buffoonery.

He really knows how to stitch together all the pieces, which is really the most amazing part. This particular story about Kendall Francois is grizly and horrifying. Rosen weaves a story of good and bad police work as they try to figure out why prositutes are vanishing in a quiet upstate NY town. Highly recommended. One of his best.

And I don't mean just business people--because this book is for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"As someone else mentioned in a review I read before I purchased this product, this dish rack thinks that it is much larger than it actually is. For anyone with limited counter space such as I have, it takes up very little space, yet I have put 3 pots, 2 dishes, a large colander, measuring cups, and a ton of silverware in it and still had room. As someone else noted, it does not handle glasses well (the only reason it did not rate 5 stars), but I have not found this to be a problem. The silverware rack was a bit discolored as another reviewer noted, however, it really is not a big deal. All in all, I would highly recommend this product, IF you do your dishes on a regular basis. If you are the type to let dirty dishes pile up in the sink, get a larger drainer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cup Rack?","review":"Although it fits nicely in the area I had planned and it's trim in appearance, it does seem flimsy. In everyday use I get the distinct impression that a misplaced plate would tip the thing end-over.The big problem I have with it -- although my own fault because it's obvious from the picture -- drinkware doesn't have a place on the drying rack. Glasses and mugs either hang unsteadily over the sides and drain water onto the counter or they take up virtually all the room on the rack. Who washes dishes and silverware, but not drinkware?Again, my own fault, but if you drink beverages like we do at our house, heads up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really small","review":"I had a very large dish drainer and wanted a smaller one made out of stainless steel. This one is called \\"compact\\" and when I got it I knew why. Much too small for even a medium size counter. And kind of \\"tinny\\", the stainless steel is very thin. There is really no room for things other than plates; glasses, cups and bowls won't fit unless they are drained alone.Again, it is very small and functions only as a plate drainer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor craftsmanship","review":"Overall, I was not impressed with this dish rack.

The big problem is that the utensil basket will begin to rust rather quickly and will be unusable within several months. We use the dishwasher for most items, but even with limited use, we've had to stop using this rack because the rust was so bad.So if you only need to use it for a couple months, or if you can somehow keep the utensil basket dry (kind of defeats the purpose), then this is a good item for you. Otherwise, keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"This item is completely useless. Sure you can put some plates in it, but if you want to put a regular drinking glass, coffee cup, or bowl in it, forget it. It is so narrow that you cannot stand a glass in it.

I have used the Eurobath with the Safer Bather from the start with my baby and she doesn't slide anywhere. She is now 8 months old and loves to kick and play in the water. I plan to buy this for my friend when she has her next child. I think every parent needs a safe tub."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"This tub is really nice. The contoured area for the baby is just right, and it seems really safe. My baby hated baths until I bought this tub, and now he is much happier. I like this tub, but I agree with other reviewers that the drain is slow. Also, the hard plastic is unpleasant for the baby, so I also bought the Safer Bather cushion. I realize now, though, that I really didn't need that...a soft washcloth or cloth diaper would be enough. I recommend this tub to anyone who wants to have good control of the bathing situation. I feel much more at ease using this than I did using the sink because I know that my son is not going to slip into the water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tub for big babies!","review":"This tub is a must for bigger babies, I gave birth to a 9 and 3oz baby, he quickly outgrew the Safety 1st foldable tub, which is an okay tub but not for bigger babies, I am truly satisfied with this one.

This tub is FANTASTIC, he fit right in the little landscaped grooves and was very secure. He is 13 mos old now and still sits inside the grooved part of the tub. He is so secure in there that both of my hands are free to wash his hair, splash and play with him. This is a fabulous product,and although it is a bit large, I can't recommend it highly enough!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent bathtub","review":"I bought Primo Eurobath when my baby was 5 months.

My large (20 lbs.) six-month-old son still fits really well in the side that reclines, and he loves to lean back and splash his feet in the water. The tub supports him well enough that I'm able to free up my hands for washing and playing, instead of just trying to support him. He would have outgrown other tubs months ago, but I expect that we'll be able to get several more months of use out of the Eurobath once he's able to sit up well enough to use the other end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't be without it","review":"This is the best tub -- a must have. We were recently on vacation and had to buy a cheap very plain and simple tub and our 4 month old was so unhappy. The Eurobath really allows him to feel secure with the \\"cradle\\" features. It is wonderful the fact that he can splash with his arms and kick with his feet all while he is nestled between the side barriers and the barrier under his bum. Yes-- we still have to watch him continuously but he is not going anywhere. He is simply out of control with all of the splashing he does in the tub. We have had him in it since he was 2 weeks old and he has loved every bath. I can not say enough good things about this tub. It is a big tub, so I guess we just get to grow into it and love every bath that we get to take."},{"rating":"2","title":"My baby was comfy!!!","review":"Just got this item with fingers crossed and glad we did.

There is still approx 1.5 inches on the top for him to grow into (on the infant side for bathing). I would recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tub!","review":"Everyone is right, this is a great tub for your little one. My baby is 5 months old and was outgrowing the infant bathtub that sat on the sink. He fits great into the infant side and he had a blast the first time he was in the tub. It was the first time he could splash around and the first time Dad heard him laugh! So worth it. He doesn't find it so amusing anymore but it's great for me because I can give him a bath alone now instead of having to have another person hold him up in the tub. Yes, the drain is really slow so I do what someone else does and use a large plastic cup to scoop the water out so I can refill with clean water. But, no big deal since we use the cup to rinse his hair anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really functional & you don't have to put in bath tub!","review":"This bath tub is very functional & cost efficient..considering you can use this for a very long time (just DON'T use chemicals to clean it/ USE Organic Cleaners!)

It is a little on the Big side...so if you have a small place, I would invest in something a little smaller...GO TO [...] they have this bath tub & another one that is a little smaller, so you can actually hide it under a cabinet & not keep it out in th open all the time because of how big it is :) Just nail it to the wall (back of door) like I did :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The only tub you'd want or need","review":"We are about to get rid of ours after 3.5 years and 2 kids. It was great from the time they were tiny brand new babies to about six-months-old(which is when both of our kids sat up well enough to move into the regular bathtub). The formed curves and rests are perfect for various ages and even sitting directions. I always loved that there were no parts other than the plug. So simple, smart, and affordable. Oh, and in-between kids it just sat outside on our patio except for when we used it to hold beer and ice for parties. Even after all that it was still in great enough shape for the next baby and, now, to be passed on to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too large for a newborn","review":"After reading oodles of positive reviews I was excited to use this tub for my newborns but they are just now able to fit into it at 3 months (11 lbs). The center divide was much too wide for their little legs to surround(my boy cried because it was crushing his boy parts) and their arms could not fall over the arm rests. As it is, it's so slick, I have to use a hand to hold them in place or they'll slide around and fall out of position. I don't like this tub at all and wish I had bought something smaller. I thought I was being frugal by buying something that would be usable for 2 years. I've used it twice and I'm ready to chuck it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, Love, Love this Tub!","review":"My daughter is 26 months and still loving this tub...and she's not a petite little thing either. She's above average in height and weight (75% for both) and still fits fine on the toddler side. When compared to putting your toddler in a regular tub, this tub will save you water, fill up faster, is safer, and makes it easier to keep the soapy water out of their eyes when rinsing their hair (I turn her around and lean her back on the infant side when I rinse her hair...it's wonderful!) I started using this tub when she was 2 months old. The infant side is a little hard for the infants so I put one of those $4 teddy bear bath cushions in first. All I can say is that I am spoiled now. It's much easier giving her a bath at my house than it is when we travel! I love this tub!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Tub on the Market!","review":"This is a wonderful product - I never give anything 5 stars. It is so easy to bathe the baby by yourself. Since you don't have to hold the baby the whole time, it is easy to leave the little one in there to enjoy him or herself without tiring you out."},{"rating":"2","title":"SIMPLY THE BEST TUB!","review":"Imagine how relaxed you are reclining in the bathtub; now imagine your child feeling the same sense of comfort. My son absolutely loves taking a bath and splashing in his EuroBath tub. We had a bathtub ring for his older sister, but it was so flimsy and unsafe that she couldn't really enjoy playtime in the tub, and I felt I needed another set of hands to help bathe her. I constantly worried that she would tip over in the tub despite holding on to her with both hands.With the EuroTub, my son just lounges back and kicks up a storm, yet he is safely cradled in the tub's unique form. It's so easy to bathe him as I don't have to wrestle with a soapy and slippery baby (no bumped heads here)! Bath time is now a joy, and my son usually emerges from the tub relaxed and ready for bed! Storage isn't a problem as the EuroTub has grooves on the backside where you can hook the tub on a towel bar inside the bath tub. A definite must-have product for your baby!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Room to grow & move","review":"I love this tub! My baby at 3 months was already growing out of his infant tub. I tired other ones that converted into a seat for later but I just didn't feel comfortable with the ones I tired. I saw this one at babies-r-us and read the reviews. It's great. I am able to put it in the bathtub and just fill it up. Which saves water and my baby is getting use to the real bathtub. He loves bath time! He has lots of kicking room and there is a support between his legs and under his arms to keep him in place. When he gets older he sits on the otherside and the support is just between the legs. I do want to add not to get a false since of security on the tub thinking they can't go any where since there are those supports. My little one likes to put his feet on the bottom and lift up his bottom. He thinks it's fun but I can see him popping himself up enough to slide down. SO always stay with your baby!!!

The bath has a place for her bum to rest, which means that she can't kick her legs out straight the way she wants to. Also, when the water is high enough to cover a decent amount of her body, it reaches her ears. Bathtime has gone from the best time of the day to the most dreaded. Do not get this bath if your baby enjoys kicking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"After reading all the reveiw on this, I believed I HAD to have this tub.

I only wish we had bought it sooner! I love the fact that it is non-toxic plastic, made in the USA, and can be used for many months. One side has a cradle seat for younger babies, and the other side has a round piece that keeps older babies who can sit up from slipping and falling. Right now our daughter is using the cradle piece, and loves that she can splash around. When she can sit up, we will put her on the other side.

I don't know if the sitting up portion will be quite as comfortable but the couple times we've had him there he seems to be fine as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, safe tub","review":"This tub is bulky, but great. It's like a real tub, and it does fit into a bath tub. It is highly easy to keep clean. And has two positions. One is a reclining position for a younger infant. In this position I would place a washcloth down before the baby to prevent sliding. The second position is for infants to sit upright. Great device. Is something that could be used for years or passed to family and friends as a hand-me-down. Well worth the price. No mildew issues at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this tub","review":"We love this bath tub though I was concerned about the size. It has turned out to be really great for our twins.

A great tool!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tub!","review":"This tub is huge. Only gripe is that my baby was so little (5.5lbs and 18\\") that I think this tub is still too big for her.

Hopefully this helps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this tub!","review":"This tub is perfect! My baby can take baths in it while I have both hands free to play with him, wash him etc. Bath time is easy and fun when using this tub.Now that he is getting bigger he is going to be using the other end of the tub more, sitting up, which makes me feel good about buying this tub instead of the other, smaller baby tubs. This tub will last a few years, not just through the baby phase. Very happy about this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"We enjoy this tub!","review":"We chose this tub because of the molded infant side and the big toddler side. We started using this tub when our son was three weeks old, and he just seemed so small in the tub. A few weeks later, he flipped out of my husband's hands and landed face down in the tub, so we discontinued use of the tub until he was about 4 months old.Now that he's older, he loves it! While lying in the infant side, he had the freedom to splash around, and I never have had a problem with him rolling over or anything- the sides help keep him from doing that.He's now 7 months old, and we've switched him to the other side of the tub. He loves it, and the middle core keeps him from sliding around too much.The biggest setback with this tub is it is huge. We keep it in the tub of our spare bathroom, and it takes up most of the tub. The drain is also inadequate- it is much easier to just pick it up and dump all the water out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best baby bathtub ever!","review":"This bathtub is awesome. Our son outgrew his first bathtub at 4 months old and we desperately needed something bigger that would hold him until he was able to sit up on his own.

Certainly it would be a pain to store when not in use. Sent it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate this tub!","review":"I was so excited when I got this tub. The reviews were great and I expected a great product. Boy was I wrong. From the time I opened the box I knew I'd hate it. The tub was filthy, not something I would expect from a new product, it had scratches and nicks all over it. After having cleaned it up I tried it out with my daughter. It was too big for her, she slid and I had to prop her up with a towel to make her comfortable. I couldn't believe it, I mean she was eight pounds-four ounces, it's not like she was a small baby. It frustrated me and made her bath time uncomfortable, I can tell she felt it too. I would hate anyone to go out and buy this tub, it's truly not worth the money. What a horrible product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Size Matters...","review":"I bought this bath tub for my baby because it said it could be used for older babies, which is just what I needed, as the home where I live doesn't have a tub or shower, and I didn't want to just sponge bathe my baby when he got older (I want him to enjoy an actual bath).This tub is TOO big.It's too big to fit in a sink.It's too big to fit on a bathroom counter.It's too big to fit on a kitchen counter.It takes up too much room on the floor-- and then lifting it to drain it is too much work.I couldn't use this tub.It is only made for someone with a huge home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think Twice Before Buying This","review":"This tub is HUGE. It is hard and slippery. It hardly fits in the tub because it's so huge. I think it would work for a baby that hardly moves in the tub. Otherwise, it would be too restricting for baby and would frustrate baby. It is too large to store anywhere. This is one baby product I regret purchasing. Total waste of money. I have to wonder also why there are so many 5 star reviews. This is the only product I've seen on Amazon that has so many customer pictures with captions, hmmmmm..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Amazon Packing Job Ever","review":"Tub arrived absolutely filthy, cracked and with many scratches. It looks like it was tipped upside down and kicked around a warehouse floor. Amazon generally packages items very well. This job was atrocious. The tub was put unwrapped, unboxed into a mammoth cardboard Amazon box. By the time it made it to my home, it was rendered totally unusable. I don't know if this tub was trashed before or during shipping but now I've got to deal with returning this beast."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"Even though it is supposed to be designed to grow with your child, this tub is just too big for a newborn and unnecessary for a toddler. There is no mechanism to secure a newborn in the tub. My daughter just slips and slides around. Also, it is just an enormous tub that doesn't store well. You might as well pad an adult tub. I wish I had gotten another tub."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems to be very good but it was useless for us","review":"We always thought a baby needs a big space during the bath to relax. When my nephew;s parents registered, they found this one and got it. It seems to be the biggest one out there and it works for every stage in your child's development.When he was born, his mom decided that he was too small for this tub and decided to use the kitchen sink. We expected he would be able to use it when he grew a bit.At three months he outgrew the sink and they tried the tub. That was the only time it was used. They prefferd to hold the baby with one arm so he could moved however he wanted, without being limited by the tub. It just wasn't comfortable.They have a big, spacious bathtub in their bathroom and, at 5 months, my nephew loves to lay there by himself splashing and \\"swimming\\".But we still hope to use this one when he gets a bit older and can sits well by himself... so we don't need to use that much water :)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still giving great baths a year later...","review":"We LOVE our Euro Bath! We started bathing our son in it when he was just 7 weeks old and couldn't hold his head up. It worked like a charm to keep his head above water and both of our new-parent hands available for fiddling with the shampoo bars. Now that he's a year old he enjoys sitting up in the toddler side of the tub to play, but we still like to shampoo him on the infant side- it helps him tilt his head back and holds him secure so we can cover his eyes with one hand and pour the water with the other. One of the few baby products we bought that truly was worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best tub on the market!","review":"I bought this tub based on many reviews of parents loving this tub over all others they had tried. It has not disappointed. Our son feels very secure on the recline side, you don't have to keep one hand on him to make sure he doesn't slip, the water is deep so he stays warm, and the little shelves keep soap and supplies handy. my little guy (4 1/2 mos) loves to splash his hands and feet. While the tub is big, we just hang it on the wall at the end of the tub and it is out of the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purchased for baby shower gift","review":"the recipient loved it! She had registered for it online and received it so quickly. When she opened it, she said it was exactly as she hoped. Thanks for making gifdt-giving so easy!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product.","review":"My 2 years old son now shares his bath with his 5 months old sister. Both seem to like the bath which is convenient to use, especially for young babies who do not seat without support. Manufacturer seems to be using quality materials. I am positive that this bath will survive a few more years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tub for newborns","review":"I started using this on my 2-week old infant and it was great! The baby was held perfectly in place so I didn't have to keep worrying about the baby flopping all over. Giving baths to your first baby is not easy...and this tub really helps new moms get over the fear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Tub Ever!!!!!!!","review":"We read the previous reviews before purchasing this tub, they were very helpful. This is the best tub ever! We first thought it might be too big, but it's size has not been a problem at all! We have used it since the day we brought our daughter home and she is now 9 months and sitting nicely in the seat area. The reclining feature is perfect and very safe. I can use 2 hands to wash my daughter and not worry about her going under. We put it right into the bathtub to use it, very handy. This tub stores great under our baby's crib! One minor drawback - this tub does not travel well to grandma's house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well for our special needs daughter","review":"We bought this bath tub after a recommendation from another special needs mommy. Our daughter can sit but in the bath tub she likes to slide down all the way. With this tub we have stopped that from happening as it has a stopper between the legs to prevent her from sliding. Our daughter loves bath time and i'm so glad we'll be able to use this for a couple of years before having to buy expensive special needs bath chairs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe the best $25 we've spent","review":"Our son doesn't sit up, so we've only used the tub one way so far. We love that when he is bigger and can sit up, he just goes in a different part of the tub.Even if it didn't have two different ways to use it, the part that holds the baby is worth the money. He doesn't even begin to slip or slide anywhere. He absolutely loves taking a bath, and he looks so happy and comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth EVERY penny!","review":"This tub is amazing! We tried others and they just didn't work - they made bathtime harder! My 18month old will not take a bath in the real tub - I think it is just too big for him. When we went on vacation we tried a blow up tub - he didn't like that either! I have a feeling we'll be using this tub for a while! I will give this tub as a gift to anyone having a baby!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexpensive and functional","review":"This bath is really great. Piece of durable plastic with correct shape. It supports baby very well. Plastic is good for baby skin and doesn't create any irritation. Forget about that bathes with some soft support for baby's back - your baby doesn't need it. Bath is light and doesn't occupy much space.Best bath you can get for 20 (and much more) bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"This tub may not look like much but we love it! My husband was very skeptical when I put it on our baby registry (and so were some of my friends). Now that we have been using it, I am so glad I took the advice of the other reviewers here and on some of the other websites I looked at.... You can bathe the baby with both hands. I just line the tub with a hand towel. There are no slings or sponges to worry about getting mildew. I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it!!","review":"If you are looking for something small and compact this is not for you. If you are looking for where your infant can splash and play safely (never leaving your baby of course) this is perfect. Most infant tubs are purely to wash, they are made so very little of the child is in the water at all, after nine + months of being water this did not seem quite right. Watching my 6 month all kick and play in the water is priceless. I wish I had this for my older child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the safest and the best!!!!","review":"The Eurobath is excellent!! I have to say, it is a little large and difficult to negotiate when travelling, but it is definitely well worth it...it is sturdy, and the baby fits so securely that it makes bathtime more enjoyable for both you and the baby! Since my daughter is very petite, I was actually able to use this almost right up until the manufacturer's suggested age of 2. And the most important thing besides the safety of the product is how sanitary it is...you can empty it and wipe it dry in 2 minutes! The shape and size make it easier for transition into the adult bathrub when baby is ready. I am looking forward to using this again for my next baby, due in 3 1/2 months! It's so sturdy it's in the same condition as when we first used it. Excellent product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Tub","review":"This is the best tub out there. My husband and I tried three other tubs before deciding to spend the money on this tub after reading the reviews on amazon. It's amazing!! It fit our active five month old and let him lay down and kick and splash without sliding down further into the water and making mom and dad nervous. Now he is seven months old sitting up and loves splashing and playing with his toys. It uses less water than filling up the tub but at the same time it is deep enough and you can fill it full enough to submerge your baby into the water comfortably. It is well worth every penny spent. It is a bit bulky to sore but if you just put in it the tub for storage it works fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"A safe, water-saving tub","review":"One end of this tub, designed for infants, was only OK for use with our baby as he tended to slip down into and around the crotch-stopper too much, so we used a smaller tub instead. The other end of the tub, designed for older kids, is great, and will see continued use. The tub is easy to clean, safer than a hard adult tub, and saves water VS filling an adult tub.Two downsides:1) Filling it may be a problem for some people with a bath spout too close to the wall, as ours is, as you need to lift the edge of the tub up to reach it, and then back down when heavy with water.2) Finding space to store it may be a problem in tight spaces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my tub!","review":"I love this tub...and so does my baby. We have been using since the first real bath and I love that it keeps my baby nice and safe and that I can use both my hands to wash her or to splash around with her (she is now 12 weeks). No matter how exited she gets she does not slip and we can all enjoy bath time without worry. Right now we keep it up on the bathroom sink so that mom does not have to bend over the tub; and it fits perfectly on the double vanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"great bath","review":"can't say enough good things about this tub. my son would cry when we would put him in the fisher price rainforest tub and was constantly sliding down. The instant we put him in this tub he is a HAPPY baby and kicks the whole time. He stays in place plus stays warm because hes partially submerged in the water. love it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 5 year old still uses it!","review":"I'm convinced this is the best tub out there for young children. My daughter is small for her age, but she still uses this tub. She hates having water in her face, so the reclining side is perfect for shampooing and rinsing. Then she moves to the other side and sits up for the rest of her bath. It's only now getting a bit snug for her. I would never buy any other tub. It took me four tries to find a good one and this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for small infants but...","review":"I agree with all the positives and negatives. I like that it is made in the USA. I dislike how it is big, but that works for our shower. The flexible plastic drain can be removed to make drainage faster. I do it daily and it has not shown signs of wear. This tub will work better when my LO can sit. Right now I like that I can wash her backside by propping her up on the groin rest. When she's bigger, I will try the other side of the tub. I would suggest a smaller tub for newborns, but they all seem to be made in China."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for us!","review":"Here is what we were working with....My son is 4 months old, he does not yet sit on his own. He loves to splash around and had begun doing this weird stretching thing that would send him slipping dangerously into the water in our Fisher Price Ocean Wonders Tub. I was looking for something in between because he is too small to transition into the big tub. I found the PRI Eurobath and decided to give it a try! I love it and it was exactly what we were looking for. More importantly my son loves it. He still uses the infant side and he loves wiggling around and splashing, the center support provides the right amount of support for him. I would recommend this tub to anyone that is in this transition phase, babies 3 months and up. I have to be honest and I don't think this tub would have worked for our son any earlier."},{"rating":"2","title":"great transition bathtub","review":"Love this new tub for my little one. I tried the bath seat ring, was not pleased. This tub works great and will last a long time, until I'm ready to transition her to the big bathtub."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Use; Easy to Clean","review":"This tub is perfect for use in a bathtub for babies and toddlers.It is a solid plastic piece, so it wipes clean and can be easily bleached.It has a plug in the bottom that even after 6 months use with 2 children it still seals well.The infant side seems to be a bit uncomfy as my baby kept trying to roll out, but it could have been his age at the time (4 months).Now at 10 months(24lbs) he is very happy sitting and playing in the other side.It is also a good size for when my small(26lbs) 4 year old wants to take a bath.I was disappointed that it arrived kind of beaten up. Had we not just moved I would have asked for an exchange. It was almost $40 when I bought it and dented in many places and the box was busted open on arrival. However it does still work despite the damages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice roomy tub.","review":"I don't use the drain feature, so that doesn't bother me (other people have said it's hard to drain.) I love that it's roomy and has a couple different options for seating. I lay my kiddo down to bathe him but allow him to sit up to play. Actually, he can switch himself between the different seating options now (he's 8 months), which worries me a little, that he's that mobile in the tub, but hey, I'm right there watching, so I guess it doesn't matter much, and it entertains him to move around and chase toys around the tub."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE MY EURO TUB!","review":"This tub is the best. I bathe my baby and don't have to worry about him going anywhere. It gives me confidence and comfort to know that he is secure. The ability to wash every area of your baby with ease. There is only one thing I must mention, the tub is big. Although I live in an apartment I'm glad I have my Euro tub."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big and uncomfortable","review":"This was too big for our two month old and he was very uncomfortable. His neck is still unstable so I had to hold his neck the entire time while taking a bath rather than it whacking on the hard plastic. Also the protruding centerpiece is a good place to crush a baby's balls so watch out especially if he's too small to fit in the tub properly! I think this tub would be good for older infants or toddlers but not for our two month old. Hopefully in the future we can use it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not comfortable for baby in neck area","review":"Hi there,I had high hopes for this tub. My baby is growing out of the sink :) And I wanted to have better control of the water temperature in the bathroom tub.Anyway. I thought this tub would have a similar seat position as the Infant Bath Seat by Primo (in which my baby feels great) but it doesn't!!! His neck is all broken with his chin going into his chest. He naturally pushes on the back of his head to not break his neck. That doesn't feel relaxing at all even though he loves being in the water. You can see it on some of the pictures that some people posted. I don't see how it would get more comfortable as he gets older, the shape of the top of the lounge chair is just too rounded/curved... The only way would be when he transitions to the oposite/seated side.I guess we'll continue in the sink for now and splash the kitchen all over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it","review":"My baby loved this bath since the first time we used it. Recommend it to anyone with a newborn."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good for small infants","review":"This tub does not work well for small newborns. My now 10 week old is just over 9 lbs and still can't be bathed in this tub as she slides down and gets all scrunched up in the ample space on the infant side. Even rolling up a towel and placing towards the bottom under her bottom does not work. Also not good that there is no cradle space for baby's head. Important in the first 3 months when they can't hold their own. I end up trying to hold her with one hand and washing with the other which makes me and baby all uncomfortable as soaping and rinsing with one hand is difficult. Also tough to get the back."},{"rating":"1","title":"had a crack, many dents and too many stains.","review":"Looked very bad. Very poor quality plastic. Felt bad to see the sticker \\"Made in USA\\". There was a crack in the product, doesn't look like damaged while shipping. Felt like sellers are using amazon to clear of defective product."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money!","review":"We used this tub twice before it started leaking! water flooded out the plug hole and all over the kitchen counter. We thought maybe the plug wasn't secured so we tried it again next bath time, same thing!It's now going in the trash (try shipping this huge monstrosity back!) where it belongs.Shame, because I really like the concept. My son also slips around in there, and the middle part meant to secure him just makes him uncomfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"gets dirty real easy and quickly!","review":"It does get dirty very easy. after a week of use, you will find that the tub has black streaks on it and it's extrememly difficult to remove them. We've decided to ditch it and buy another brand instead.Also, it is just too huge....too many extra stuff in the tub. After using it, we figured out we just want something simple...just need a tub, no need to have anything inside!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful tub!","review":"There is no better tub than this! I love the fact that it is molded to prevent slipping. Now I can use both hands to wash my daughter without fear of slipping. This tub holds so much more water too. Bath time is now an enjoyable experience rather than something to be dreaded. I HIGHLY recommend this tub!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS TUB!!!!!!!","review":"We have been using this tub since the day we brought our daughter home from the hospital. She is 11 months old and we're still using it daily. It is wonderful! The horn in the center of the tub is perfect for keeping baby from slouching too far into the water. We will be able to use this tub for at least another year or so with no problem! It's a must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"it is a good product","review":"Well, I bought this because it is a bestseller. I am not disappointed after I got it. My 5-month old son seems comfortable in it. I would recommend it to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Tub Ever!!!","review":"After reading all the bad reviews on other tubs, I was excited to finally find one with great ratings. I was hoping it would be as good as it sounded, but it's better! I love this tub! It allows you to have both hands free to bathe your baby and for a first time mom, it was heaven sent! Tip: you can still use this tub with a newborn that hasn't lost his/her umbilical cord yet. Just line the tub with a large towel and place the tub in your big bathtub. Fill YOUR tub with a little water. Use the Eurotub to hold your newborn comfortably while you sponge bathe, using the water in your big tub- it works great! I continue to use a large towel in the tub to keep my 2 month old in place. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON ANY OTHER TUB!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best tub I've used!","review":"This tub is wonderful! I bought that fold-up tub--big waste! Recently bought this tub and what a difference! Works for newborns--and up. This tub holds the baby perfectly for you. You can use both hands to wash baby, instead of worrying about baby slipping all over the place. Worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome tub!!","review":"My first impression of the tub was, \\"Wow, it is sooo big\\". But my friend insisted how great the tub was, so I decided to give it a try for my infant. WE LOVE IT! Our infant is now 18 months and still using it with room to grow.To remedy the tub's size problem: We decided to keep it in our daughter's closet as a clothes basket. It works just fine as that too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Found my signature baby shower gift!","review":"I am the mother of two girls. With my oldest, I tried several different tubs and wasn't happy with any of them. I saw this one and read some of the reviews. I must say it is definetly the best tub out there. My baby is 13 weeks old and she loves to splash around in her tub. The way the tub cradles her while she is in the tub, it is like having an extra set of hands. It is worth the extra shipping charge! I wish I had had this one with my first child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"We absolutely love the EuroBath. We purchased it when our son was six months old, but we could have used it a lot sooner. He loves to be able to splash the water all around him, and I don't have to worry about him turning over as he would in the big tub. He would spend hours in it if we let him. I love that it is useful now when he can't sit up, and we will be able to continue to use it when he is a toddler. It is well worth the price, which is very reasonable. We love it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is all you need!","review":"This is such a great baby bath tub you can use from the day you bring your newborn home up until he/she is 2~ 2 1/2 year-old. Small babies can just lie on their back on the slope side, moms don't have to worry about supporting them (unless they're really small, like under 3 months.) It makes it so easy to rinse their hair without them fussing about water running down their faces. I've been using this for my daughter for the past 21 months, I'm so happy I got this. Don't waste your money for smaller tubs. This is really all you need."},{"rating":"2","title":"The absolute best bath tub ever!","review":"I used this bathtub from the day I brought my son home until he was old enough to climb out of it on his own. When he was really tiny we just put a rolled up waschloth at his groin to prop him up a bit more. But it was so nice that he could be supported but be deeper in the water. He stayed warmer and he was much more relaxed than when we bathed him in the standard baby tub at my parents house. As he got older we were able to let him splash and kick and explore so much more because the back is so supportive. Yes, it is a little large, but it has a drain in the bottom and we just stored it in the regular bathtub when we werent showering.
