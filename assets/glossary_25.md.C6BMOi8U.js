However, the way it works can be very confusing and frustrating for a child. The toy presents a math equation to be solved (e.g. 2+2), then you have to WAIT until the button representing the answer lights up (e.g. 4). The toy will light the numbered buttons randomly one at a time. If you hit the button corresponding to the correct answer prior to the button lighting up, then the toy tells you that you got the answer wrong - it just flashes \\"WRONG\\" \\"WRONG\\"... It's confusing because my child wasn't sure whether he got the answer wrong was because he did the math wrong or because he didn't get the timing right of hitting the button. For simple addition and subtraction, our objective is speed - hit the answer as soon as you figure out the answer. I'm not convinced there's much benefit in waiting for the right button to light up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after using twice and amazon won't help me","review":"When this toy worked, my 6 year old son loved it. I agree with the other reviewers that it would be easier and more fun if the kids didn't have to wait for the correct answer, but once he got the hang of it, my son did not seem to care. However, after using a couple of times it is not working. I thought it was the batteries, changed those but it is just broken. There is nothing obvious to show why (evidence of the kids being too rough with it). I first called Learning Resources and they wouldn't help me because it was bought off of Amazon. [...]Personally,I think thats a little rude. My other option is throwing the toy in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and educational toy!","review":"This is a very educational and engaging toy. It teaches math skills (simple addition to mutiplication/division), and builds reflexes and hand/eye coordination. It plays like \\"Math Whack-A-Mole.\\" It allows you enough time to think about the correct answer. When the light flashes on the correct answer, you \\"hit\\" it and press enter. My only (small) complaint is that sometimes if you don't hit the number WHILE it is lit (a little slow with your reflexes), the toy will indicate that the answer is \\"wrong\\" (it's not that you're WRONG, you just didn't strike the number quickly enough). My 5-year-old is building addition and subtraction skills, and has only been playing with this for one day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"We are working to make math fun for our son (7 years old, 2nd grade), and this only frustrated him.When you know the answer, you have wait for the button with the right answer to light up. For instance, if the answer is \\"2\\" you may have to wait for 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 0 to light up before the 2 lights up. That is very frustrating for a kid who knows the answer and wants to move onto the next question.I'd skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"After trying other math toys where you had a twist knobs to enter an answer, this toy seemed superior in that you could quickly hit the correct answer with the mallet. Because they've tried to make this more \\"fun\\" by only accepting the correct answer when the numbers light up, there is a lot of time sitting there waiting for the numbers, and NOT much time actually drilling math facts. Additionally, I was disappointed because some of the questions are formatted in a more complicated way giving you 7 x ? = 35. This could have been a really terrific speed drill game, but wound up being complicated and frustrating for my kids who are still learning the answers. They can't deal with not only having the correct answer but getting it when it lights up, before the time is out, AND having to hit \\"enter\\" after they put their numbers in. ALSO, this game is very big, measuring 8.5\\" x 15\\". I will say that it seems to be well made. Don't expect it to replace good old fashioned flashcards."},{"rating":"1","title":"WRONG","review":"Great idea, horrid product.Kids have to push or hit the answer when the number is illuminated. But the correct number may never be illuminated. Then your kid gets a \\"WRONG\\". I watched this happen numerous times including twice in a row. Likewise, it may go on so long before the right answer is illuminated that it is boring.The levels progress way to rapidly. In Level 1 addition, it mixes one and two digit answers. So you get 0+1 and then 9+9 in the same grouping. Then when you move up to level 2 addition, it start asking things like what is 78 + ? = 82.Finally, this is a fragile toy even though it is supposed to be struck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discouraging","review":"I bought this thinking it would get my children excited about math but the complete opposite happened. The toy tells them they got the answer wrong repeatedly, even when they get it correct. My children became very discouraged because of this.

Bought for my 8 year old to practice math facts and she does not like it either. You have to wait for the number to light up before you can hit the answer and move on. There is way too much time to sit and wait and wait and then wait more. A kids attention span is just not long enough. This will not improve speed or provide fun.

Lawrence brings us an entry level Subculture, Vol. 01, 1 CD, album that instead of going the house/trance route as most are taking keeps the original transition of trance to techno alive in a way that reminds one of Paul Oakenfold. While Lawrence has a limited choice to mix from the selection is one of the best and resembles Sasha in many ways. At the same time Lawrence is less about creating a masterpiece album and more about thumping bass to a nightclub that wants to rock for an hour or so. While Subculture, Vol. 01 may not be the best bang for your buck when compared to its dual CD rivals once you are done with them it will become clear that this is also an essential.

I am a military spouse who has had to live through year-long deployments twice getting ready to face another one but Patty and I still never clicked. Sorry, but I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Writing & Idea - Unlikeable Characters","review":"The idea of this book was better than its reality. I really enjoyed the author's writing style, so for that alone it gets two stars. However, the lead character, Tommy, is so patently unlikeable and uninteresting, it's hard to fathom his wife waiting idly by for 25 years for him to get out of prison. She is blindly devoted, never really asking the questions most people would, especially about the night in question (and Tommy's history of repetitive burglary). The ending is unrealistic and sugary sweet, so that doesn't really fit after a fairly realistic, depressing rendition of Patty's day to day existence. Overall, I cannot recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"Dull with a capital D! The plot was almost as thin as the character development (or lack thereof)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why am I just now finding him?","review":"I ran across a copy of \\"Speed Queen\\" in my local library and that was it; I was hooked on Stewart O'Nan. As I've said before, I only write reviews if I feel very passionate one way or the other about a book or an author. I LOVE this author. It's just like reading about someone you know or even about yourself. Sometimes the books can seem a little slow, like his latest one, \\"Emily Alone\\", but I don't care, I still can't put them down. I'm on a mission to read all of them and I hope he's on a mission to write more and more and even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"3.5 out of 5: Elegant, Spare, Worthwhile","review":"Patty, who is pregnant with her first child, is woken up one night by a phone call: her husband Tommy is in jail for murder. The story continues as Tommy fights the charges against him. Typical for O'Nan, the story unwinds carefully and patiently, focusing on the small details of Patty's experience throughout the ordeal. O'Nan clearly did his research. The best part of this book is the tender and hyper-realistic depiction of Patty and Tommy's relationship over many years. On the downside, the plot bogs down at times and can seem monotonous. This may be intentional by O'Nan, but the reading experience suffers as a result. The Good Wife is not O'Nan's best but a worthwhile read nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel like I ran a marathon","review":"Endurance is the game for this novel. While I appreciate the concept, and I admire O'Nan's writing style, this would have read much better as a short story. After reading it I felt like I had spent 20+ years in prison. Perhaps that was the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spare novel with little to recommend it","review":"The spare quality of the novel is a good thing.It's simple and straight-forward, focused completely within the mindset of the \\"Good Wife\\".Her single-minded focus on the day her husband will hopefully be paroled is the what drives her every action and thought.The goal becomes the important thing. Holding things together until he returns.This could be seen as a weakness, for both the protaganist of the novel and to the reader of the novel.The reader gets no insight into how any of the other characters thinks or feels except through whatever the \\"Good Wife\\" herself gleans or discovers.It's an interesting read that will allow the reader to think and imagine.But the inherent weakness of focusing only on her limited viewpoint renders this novel an interesting writing exercise that will ultimately give no satisfaction to the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you think","review":"Reading this book is very enlighting. The medical community is coming around to the authors way of thinking. Apple cider vinager is such a staple of life. It has come full circle from the writting of this book to now.

It's a very interesting book, worth reading. However I was very disappointed in this used copy. It was supposed to be in good condition, but it is very yellowed and falling apart. Normally I've been very satisfied when buying used copies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not at all as dry as I thought it would be","review":"I honestly didn't think I'd find this as interesting as I did. As important as licenses are, an annotated listing of them didn't sound like anything I wanted to flop back on the couch with. However, the author has managed to make this both interesting and educational.It covers all the common open source licenses, explaining what each section means, and digging into problems that might come up for the licensor or licensee. Open Source isn't all that it covers: standard shrink-wrap licenses are examined, as is Sun's Community Source License and Microsoft's \\"Shared Source Initiative\\".Finally, the book itself is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivs license. It is interesting that O'Reilly is willing to publish works like this, but I'm glad they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a copy of the licenses with annotations","review":"Most of this book is just a copy of the commonly used licenses with paragraph-by-paragraph annotations. There is very little sense of the big picture here, and while the details are important, they're ultimately just confusing without some notion of where the different licenses are coming from and what they are meant to be about. The comments themselves are good, but that just isn't enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"those were the days...","review":"I got this DVD simply because my wife and I watched it many years ago when we were just married.

Examples of recipes include: \\"A Penne Yearned\\", \\"A Curried Affair\\", \\"All in the Yamily\\", \\"La Rice-a Bon-eata\\", \\"We're Talking Small Potatoes\\", and so forth.

I have entered my chili each of the three years we have had the contest but this year I won first prize (a certificate and a cap) for the chili I cooked from my Crazy Plates Cook Book. The chili got great reviews from judges and attendees. Chilis were judged for aroma, colour, texture, taste and after-taste.Actually I have used the same recipe each year only this year I remembered to put in all the ingredients as stated in the recipe.

They are the living offspring of a 15th generation vampire and a mortal and had some unusual powers. They seemed interesting but there was barely enough information to use them as an NPC so I eagerly ordered this book off amazon when it first popped up back in March. I got it today and well I'm sending it back because it isn't for Vampire the Masquerade at all. It is for Kindred of the East. Apparently, Kindred of the East (which is a seperate game made by the same company) can have offspring with a mortal and are also called Dhampirs and well these are the Dhampirs that this book is about. I searched the book high and low to find something that purtains to V:tM and I didn't find a thing. It says it is a sourcebook for V:tM and KotE but it is for KotE all the way. Just thought I would tell you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but utterly unconvincing","review":"Fischer claims to have deciphered two of the remaining undeciphered ancient scripts. However, while he might have sacrificed a lot in his efforts, the results are not convincing. The Phaestos disk has been the subject of many decipherment attempts. The Phaestos disk homepage alone lists 39 such endeavours. Fischer's methods are more scientific than most of the others, but ultimately not much more persuasive. The glaring flaw in his method is that he does not have enough checks to eliminate bad assumptions. With a text as short as the Phaestos Disk, if you make enough assumptions you can get a legible text in whatever language you want. That is exactly what is presented in Glyphbreaker. Fischer has studied the Easter Island script extensively, and thus brings a wealth of knowledge to his discussion of that script. However, his proposal is certainly not a true decipherment and the jury remains out on its validity."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book, but, sadly, a bit too \\"popular\\"","review":"There is no question that the author is a genius; what else might one reasonably call a person who has broken two previously undeciphered scripts, in unknown languages?This book is a very popularized account of what was done.

The author does bring up a lot of good points about how far computers have come. I do not feel that computers will take over the classroom. They do offer a lot of help for students as well as teachers. They will never be able to offer personalized assistance like a regular classroom teacher will. I would recommend this book to anyone who is highly into computers. I myself am not and did not find the book all that interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"no scholarship","review":"Sounds more like billowy hot air from a Rush Limbaugh type. And I am one who agrees with Stoll's general comments. He could have said it all in a book half the length.A lot of catchy slogans to banter about at a cocktail party. But no real scholarship.How do we learn? Stoll offers scant scientific evidence for his strong opinions. His book sounds like it was put together by surfing the web for a bunch of ideas. A lot of cut & pasting with little support. Not even a list of references or bibliography. All of what Stoll condemns!"},{"rating":"1","title":"High Tech Heretic...Don't waste your time","review":"I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, unless you are completely against using computers in the classroom. I do not agree with most of the idea/concepts he gave towards using computers in the classroom. Computers can be used ineffectively and I agree that a lot of times they are, but that doesn't mean we should just completely get rid of them. They can be an excellent teaching tool if used in the right way. Children can learn so much from computer programs, but this still doesn't mean that you should completely gear your lessons/activities towards computers. Hands-on projects/assignments are always needed. Even though I didn't agree with most of the book, I did have to agree with Stoll when he said that school-age children should not have laptop!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Come join us in the future","review":"Clifford Stroll must be locked in the 1960's still. His anti technology veiws are arcane and very naive. For one to honestly believe that computers are not helpful is beyond my capacity of reason. In the last 10 years computers have done a lot for the educational system. Don't misunderstand, I don't think Bill Gates is the mesiah or that computers are the cure all of America's educational woes, but technology has made things more convienant and the learning process now has more avenues. Now we can have options as educators instead of having to use textbooks and only textbooks. Stroll's veiws in my opinion are way off the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste Your time","review":"You Shouldn't waste your time by reading High Tech Heretic. Stoll talks about how computers and how they are waste of school money and that they are not a good teaching tool. For one he is not a teacher. I would not believe over half the stuff that he wrote. He does not support anything that he says. His grammar through out the whole book is awful! I did however agree with one thing he said. School age kids (k-12) should not have a laptop computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"I feel that the book High Tech Heretic was an okay book. In his book, Stoll does not say that he hates computers, rather they are mis-used. Therefore, he wanted to bring them out of the schools. Computers are used wrongly in many cases, but they do not need to be taken out of the schools. The educators just need to learn how to use the computers properly as a tool.So, I agree to a certain point with this part of the book.The last part of the book however, I did not find as much help. This part talked of the things surrounding computers and that was not in my interest.If you are someone that has to interact with children on a daily basis, then I feel that you should read the first half of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monotonous banter","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Cliff Stoll's book \\"The Cuckoo's Egg\\", but after reading High-Tech Heretic I can't see myself reading another one of his books again. I could have read the first and last paragraphs of this book and came away with the same premise, yet he repitiously restates his general distaste for computers in our educational community. He has some good points but no scientific basis for them. Mr. Stoll points out that a computer can't take the place of a good teacher. Yes, but a good teacher should know how to use a computer as a learning tool. Get off your pulpit Mr. Stoll, computers are a tool. We didn't go back to the abacus because we thought children would be corrupted by a calculator."},{"rating":"2","title":"high tech review for class","review":"The more I read this book, the more that I began to understand what it was about and the more I began to agree with Stoll.Stoll gives many good reasons to question the significance of computers in the classroom. Stoll challenges using computers in public schools because of the high cost, and the low benefits from it. Stoll also talks about technology in general.Stoll talks about what is wrong with computer learning in our society, by questioning every aspect of computing, especially the computer use in public schools.Stoll, however does not hate computers, he just hates how they are misused in schools. Cliffors Stoll is upset about how much money is being wasted on technology, that is used for the wrong reason.I feel that this book is a really interesting book that teaches alot.

It's also one of the funniest and most charming of all the movies Chan and friends have done. The memorable characters are what have defined Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, and Yuen Biao as actors! Somewhat of an obscure movie that didn't get the credit it deserved in the United States, this movie is a must see for anyone even remotely likes Jackie Chan movies. Also look for Project A, Armour of God, Operation Condor (Armour of God 2), Police Story, Supercop (Police Story 3), Rumble in the Bronx, First Strike, Mr. Nice Guy, and Dragons Forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jackie Chan at his finest!","review":"The whole movie is a classic and is a must-have for any Jackie Chan collection or movie collection that is.

The action is top notch as always; however it is the comical chemistry of these three and a great story line that make for a fun flick that will keep you in stitches until the end!The only thing that I thought that could have been better would be to either have an English version or to fix the sub-titles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wheels on Meals","review":"This movie takes a little getting into, but it truly delivers some great actions fight sceens with Jackie Chan and Yuen Biao (his boyhood friend from Chinese Opera School)against some high kicking US champions kick boxing. Sammy Hung also has a part in this movie so the three brothers are together and they all make this movie one to have if you are a Jackie Chan fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"need i mention more than rollerskates and legwarmers","review":"this was a GREAT movie!

The fight scene with Benny Urquidez won awards (deservedly so), its got Chan's favorite and best collaborators in it (Hung and Biao), there's nothing to dislikeExcept, of course, the lack of a strong plot, but who cares about that?

As it turned out, this wasn't so much of a flop as it was a mild disappointment. The fight sequences are few and far between, while the comedy was...well, you know what to expect if you're a fan of this genre. :^) Sammo did a much better job directing Encounters of the Spooky Kind than he did with this movie--> I'd recommend Dragons Forever if you want to see Jackie, Yuen, and Sammo in some good action scenes.

He's on a very small label called Critical Sun Recordings. This cd is for the bedroom, laidback & something to get your lover in the mood. Darrius has a very smooth & sensual approach to songwriting & singing. Because he's on such a small label you'll most likely not hear any of his music unless its on internet radio...maybe like the liquidsoul radio show?

Sure, there's Call to Power and Civilization Three, but this is the only one of the sequels that was made by Sid Meier. This game is extremely complex, and will probably take a few hours to learn. It is easier if you've played Civ II, but it still takes a while. However, once you've learned you'll never stop playing this game. There are so many ways to win, and there are so many options. Ways of taking out enemy cities include conquest, bribes, lowing them into the sea, releasing native lifeforms on them, and planet busters (nukes). The technology tree is also complex, but it's realistic, well thought out, and long. While the graphics aren't great, they are more than sufficent for the game. The only flaw: the AI is a little too easy on the top level. If you like strategy games, or just games, buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary game","review":"This game is probably the best I've ever played, and perhaps the best game I will ever play. It has all of the features you could want in a turn based game.The automation of funtions is incredible. Based on your wishes, you can designate tasks for units to perform, instead of dealing with the monotony of reissuing the same command turn after turn. For example, you can just say tell a unit to \\"build road\\", and it will only build roads... and will do so in places that make sense. Truly amazing AI...Add to that the rich cultures and philosophies of the characters, ability to customize units any way you'd like, great sci-fi, and you're left with a game that is still a force to be contented with 4-5 years after its release.However, because of the wide range of possibilities, the game can be quite complex.If you're not intimidated by having to think, this game is definitely for you. I look forward to a sequel, should they ever develop one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated and disappointing","review":"This book appears to be a copy of numerous different CIS tests, which included outdated technology information and wrong answers.

Many tremendous albums were put out on the Milestone label during the 70s, both with a small group live (Enlightenment, Atlantis, The Greeting; all 4-5 stars easily) or in a studio (Sahara, Focal Point, etc.), and with a big band (Song of the New World).This album adds a string section, which does much to dilute the drive of McCoy's music. It does however, make it sound like a 70s concept album. As much as McCoy Tyner could ever be suited for background listening, this is it. If you think light music is a good thing, then this is a great Tyner album for you. I, however, would rather listen to one of his many thrilling, truly 5-star albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a review for the AP test!","review":"A review manual for the AP test could reasonably be expected to at least mention the *existence* of the five C++ AP classes. This book does not.It could also be expected to do more than mention that there is a College Board case study and then phrase its study as something *optional*. (The case study is the subject of at least one of the four extended response questions, and a good handful of the multiple choice.)In glancing at the book, I was shocked to find that, although it gives a thorough-but-terse overview of theory, it seems to have little actual relation to the exam itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT GOOD for a high school Review Book","review":"Very technical. Overly technical and obscure techniques lead students away from what they are supposed to do for the test. If you want to learn C idioms, go for it.

When they choose to replicate a band's material, not only do the actual covers sound like the original band, but (and this is the important part)the new songs sound like \\"lost\\" songs by that band. The Black Crowes only WISHED they sounded this much like the late 60's version of the Stones. However, I don't want this to sound like it's all covers. Only two of the songs are Stones' covers (there are a couple other covers as well). Buy this CD for the originals, especially if you keep complaining that they (including the Stones!!) don't make them like they used to. Listen to the sample from Drunkhouse and tell me that you don't want to own this CD immediately. I've personally bought 5 copies over the years to give to friends, and everybody has LOVED it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too far fetched","review":"This book would have been great if the author didn't have the killer stalking Jane because she was the reincarnation of Ciara, who is a ancient actress, it was stupid and I got real bored, real quick."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Lips Twisted","review":"This book introduced some new characters into the series. Except for Bartlett, the characters all have the same personality as other characters. If I see \\"his lips twisted\\" or \\"her lips twisted\\" one more time, I will scream. Trevor was good as a love interest for Jane but it was the same as Logan with Sarah. Obviously, the author wrote cheesy romance novels that youcan crank out without changing anything except the locale from novel to novel. The same is happening with this series of books. I was a little bewildered at the reviews claiming pedophilia from Trevor. A seventeen year old woman is at her prime. If a man tells you that he is not attracted to a woman at that age then he is lying or gay. My mother married at 16, her mother at 17.

This is a must buy and a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This was the first book by Iris Johansen that I have read. I bought it due to the enthusiastic reviews on the back cover or on the first pages in the book.I do not know how her other books are, because this book was as bad as they rarely come.One-dimensional characters, repetitive thoughts/actions (just in case somebody had not got it the first or second time), illogical actions (visitor from Scotland Yard shows up at the private home, not at the police station, and our heroes do not even bother to ask for identification, ......)I could not develop any sympathies for the protagonists, and frankly, I do not care if they get murdered or not.I have no idea if the other books by this author are better, but I do not intend to find out.One is more than enough.Annoying, irritating, boring.Sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy Men and Annoying Women","review":"I am getting ready to move to our new house and needed a new book to read. Well for some reason this one did not get packed so I grabbed it. What a waste of time. First of all Jane has to be one of the most annoying characters I have come across in a long time. I was actually cheering for Aldo to kill her just so she would shut up. Then Trevor (an adult male) having a crush on Jane (a 17 year old girl) was just creepy. I do not care if he was there to try and help no preverted man who is lusting after my high school daughter is coming into our lives.The plot was pathetic and after all the building up to catch Aldo the writer ends the climax in like two paragraphs.DO NOT WASTE YOU TIME !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What has happened to Eve Duncan?","review":"Where did Iris Johansen put Eve Duncan after so many successful years?I have read all but two of Johansen's books. I am an admirer of her character Eve Duncan. She developed Eve over the years to be a very strong character.Blind Alley is a very disappointing piece of work. It's almost as if Johansen decided to make Eve weak in order to make Jane strong. And who is Mark Trevor and why do we need yet another 'rascal' male lead to make the female lead more 'credible'? Poor dialogue. Hardly credible plot line. Strange supporting cast. Bad choice.Whoever advised Johansen to proceed with this work is looking for new money, not old fans.Too bad.Not a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the worst book I've ever read, but close","review":"I just finished this book today, and I wish I had read some of the reviews before I ever picked it up.

Every thing is repetitive in it. I did not like one single character. When the author tries to make these characters strong she just made them annoying. I WISH I would have read the other reviews before I wasted money on this trash. Like another reviewer said -Aldo should have killed them all after the first couple of chapters and put us all out of our misery. As for the child molester Trevor ----that was just sick. A grown man lusting after a 17 year old. What was this author thinking???????"},{"rating":"1","title":"It would be hard to imagine a worse novel than this","review":"Where to begin? The plot is preposterous. But other reviewers have covered the storyline vagaries, and repeating them is distasteful. The characters are phony. The dialogue is wooden. There is no atmosphere, no distinct sense of place. Cliches abound, and when you think the writer couldn't top the last one--she does. In short, this book is not even worth discussion. It should simply be dismissed. Why didn't the editors and publishers do exactly that?This was my first book by Ms. Johansen. It will also be my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"really bad","review":"I was so bored with this book. It just went on and on and on...I love Iris Johansen and have read all of her other books.

Perhaps because this was my first Iris Johansen book, I wasn't comparing it to her earlier works. It was well read and kept me looking forward to getting in my car each morning and evening! I am glad I didn't read the negative reviews since they may have colored my opinion. Frankly, I enjoyed the characters and look forward to more books with Eve, Joe, Jane and Mark Trevor. If you enjoy forensic mysteries, give this book a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a farce","review":"This story went nowhere fast. Very unbelievable on so many levels.

That was not this book.At first, I thought it was just me. Unlike others, I found it easy to get into the book. But I found it too new age for me. Between Eve talking to her dead daughter to the creepy Aldo to Jane's connection with the murdered Cira, I decided I didn't need to read the whole novel and checked to make sure Jane and Trevor survived.Maybe this wasn't Iris Johansen's best book. But I'm not going to be trying any of her others, based on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixed","review":"I'm not really going to give a summary because there are already plenty up. As another reviewer already said, the ideas are far fetched and the story is very believable. So why did I give it such a high rating despite the fact the it isn't very well written. I don't really know. Despite the fact that it has pretty much everything going against it, I can't help but love it. I can't explain it and I hadn't read any of the author's other books before reading this, so that isn't clouding my judgement. There is just something about this book that still manages to draw the reader in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Horrible is the only way I can describe this book.

The plot was so farfetched and unbelievable that I could not buy into the premise.

I am normally glued to them until I finish. I read Fatal Tide in 1 1/2 days. I normally enjoy the Eve Duncan series. I just couldn't seem to get into this book. I didn't enjoy it as much. I almost felt it was too far fetched.I look forward to anything else that the author will be putting out. I was just disappointed in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"this one should get no stars","review":"I found the globe-trotting serial killer plot in this book as farfetched as it gets. I know this is fiction, but come on. How does stuff like this get published? Also, I'm glad I wasn't the only reader uncomfortable with the romantic involvement of a middle-aged man and a teenage girl. Eww. Finally, I agree with the reviewer who wrote that Johansen writes the same book over and over again, casting them with criminals so over the top that they become cartoonish, and police officers so bad at their jobs that they couldn't even catch a cold. This will be my last Johansen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This book was nothing but a let down with antiquated verbage and cliched characters. I am nineteen and mature for my age, and believe me, I didn't use words like \\"lordy\\" and \\"darn\\" when I was seventeen. The manner in which Jane speaks and acts is a far cry from reality, even for a supposedly mature and intelligent girl. She sounded more like my 72 year old grandmother than a 17 year old girl. Johansen's portrayal of Jane is quite sloppy and formulaic. The timeline doesn't even add up either. If she applied early decision, she would not receive her response back from Harvard in the early fall, she would get it over winter break. It doesn't add up. And I repeat: this is such a cliche... pick a more interesting and less typical college.This book was horrible and sloppily written with simplistic and uninspiring prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"How disappointing","review":"As all avid mystery readers know, we've come to adopt those characters we find in our favorite books, into our hearts and homes. What a wonderful story teller Ms. Johansen is, and I enjoy her enormously. I do have a few questions and comments, though.Has Eve Duncan always been as whiney and shallow as this book depicts her to be? We all come to expect certain behavior and dialogue between characters, but if I wanted to hear this much whining, I'd call my mother and listen to her whine about not being able to go to Miami this year.Sorry, this book bored me to tears, and if it had been a movie, I never would have gone back from the snack shop.And for all those mothers with 17 year old daughters, I think we'd all agree to chip in and buy a DNA sample from Jane to add to our daughter's lunches. How wonderful she is!! Especially when she pretty much announces that she wishes to have an affair with a 30+ con man."},{"rating":"1","title":"First and Last Time?","review":"This is the first Iris Johansen thriller I have read and unfortunately it will probably be my last. The characters are so predictable in their responses to each other that I knew what they would say before they said it. I listened to it as a book on tape which probably made that worse. But Jane, the focus of the book, is simply unbelievable. Aldo and his \\"obsession\\" strain credibility. The best part was the information about life in ancient Herculaneum and the volcanic eruption."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much left unanswered","review":"I am usually quite an avid fan, but this book left too many holes. What brought on Jane's dreams? Did Trevor have the same dreams? what ever became of the \\"real\\" person the dreams were about? Is Jane phycsic now? Whose face was the last one that Eve sculpted (if that's a real word)? It almost seems like she is setting it up so you will have to purchase the next book just to get the answers to this one. And did the dreams somehow imply that Jane and Trevor are meant to be together?And yes, I am sick of Eve holding it against Joe that he lied to her years ago. He was trying to help ease her pain, she knows it, she has stayed with him all this time, get over it already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time On This","review":"What a disappointment! The characters were so empty and shallow. Ms. Johansen did not take the time to develop them and give them substance. I continued to read, hoping it would get better. What I found was an anticlimactic ending which left me kicking myself for having wasted any time reading. Do yourself a favor, save your time and money and skip over this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay...","review":"After reading a couple of Iris Johansen's books, I thought that this book would be entertaining and a fun read. My main complaint with this book was the lack of character development/relationship between Jane and Cira. Where was the connection? Just because someone has a close resemblance does not make them the same. I felt like Ms. Johansen began with a neat plot twist but let it get lost between the pages. I would suggest taking less time weaving a frayed \\"fantastic plot\\" and more time with actual character and story development."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This is another author writing a book supposedly about one character when it is really about another. Patricia Cornwell did it when she lost interest in Kay Scarpetta and now this author is doing it with her Eve Duncan character. If you wish to write about a new character than PLEASE don't disguise it behind a character that readers have known. I will NOT buy another book about Jane. She is too young, too immature. I bought this book happy to be reading about Eve Duncan, NOT 17 year old Jane. And the new book promises to be all about Jane and Trevor. I don't care to hear about this couple. Shes too young for him, and it made me feel creepy to hear about the sexual tension between a 17 year old and 30+ year old. Don't waste your money on this if you are looking for Eve Duncan, She's not here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exploring Jane McGuire","review":"Just had to comment on how I love how the author branches out and sort of lets each character have center stage in their own book. This was Jane McGuire's (adopted daughter) of Eve Duncan's turn. The book was sort of different from what I was used to , a bit of the supernatural. Can't wait for Countdown coming in April 2005, will definitely want to read more about Jane and also will continue to read the next Eve Duncan , Joe Quinn book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Farfetched","review":"The beginning of the book is a thriller, I can accept that, but when a 17 years old kid made a plan to find the person who want to kill her and everybody accept her as the bait is really farfetched. Everything they do to trap the killer is pathetic. The trip to Italy and changing the newspapers in the web is hilarious. The end, when everybody stays alive except the killer is just a way to end this fairy tale in the most pathetic way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"I had read some of Iris Johansen's other novels and found them interesting. This one was extremely disappointing. The plot is extremely far-fetched and stretches credulity to the breaking point. But most disappointing is the stilted dialogue which just doesn't ring real. The one saving grace was the interesting historical information about Pompeii/Herculaneum.When I finished reading this novel, I wondered: How does a book like this on to the bestseller lists? Are we all sheep?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"I was glad to see it wasn't just me who had problems with this book. I have read all of Iris Johansen's books and have loved them. Picking up one of her books always was a guarantee that you would spend several action packed enjoyable hours. This one, however, I could not get in to. I tried several times, but ended up flipping to the end chapter and then putting the book in the \\"to give away\\" pile.

Campbell, Lo and McKinlay (The Econometrics of Financial Markets) proovides in one chapter more information that this book.

Every cut sounds fresh, not warmed over, and there is a nice variety of styles, so the band never wears out its welcome. A special highlight is the cut \\"Little Brother (Make a Way),\\" which is one of those cuts you will want to play over and over again because it just sounds so real and refreshing. Although I've not been overly impressed with most of the stuff I have heard from the Telarc Blues label, I must say they have really nailed it with this release, and I will look forward to future releases from Kenny Neal.

My favorite parts were the guest vocalists. And Linda Ronstadt, who has already proven herself in the classical world, blends in effortlessly with her voice.

Fun, and even educational!","review":"In his bookLove's Executioner: & Other Tales of Psychotherapy (Perennial Classics), Yalom puts his own reputation on the line in order to give us, the reader, an inside look into therapy from the therapist's point of view. As a studying psychotherapist I found his book both fascinating and useful. Yalom shows how even the most seasoned therapist has reactions to his clients, and how to take these reactions and use them in therapy.Not interested in the science? The stories are witty, thrilling and entertaining. You couldn't make this stuff up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterfully told account of the tension between therapist and patient","review":"In the tales that Dr. Yalom relates in this book, he shares the accounts of his patients' problems, however, and more profoundly he shares a great deal of himself and how he responds to these problems. The image that emerges is that of a therapist who is not always right, nor always agreeable, but always human. His defects are made endearing by the fact that he is aware of them and struggles with them. He is a first rate storyteller and the glimpse he allows us into the therapeutic relation is quite worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yalom is brilliant","review":"In a short time I have become a Yalom fan. After reading two of his books, I must say that Dr. Yalom, is smart, entertaining, and great in his way of writing. It is very interesting for me to hear from a Psychotherapist what they feel while listening to us patients. Dr. Yalom's writings have definately helped me see the Therapy session from my Therapist's stand point, and has helped me understand why Therapist's work the way they do. After reading Dr. Yaloms books I have gone into therapy more perpared for the journey and at times I have made my Therapist do a double take on my knowledge of the theraputic process. Yalom is one reason why I have chosen to go back to school and pursue a career in Psychotherapy. I would recommend all of Dr. Yalom's books to all readers, especially patients who want to have an inside view of what their Therapist's might encounter in the therapy session."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read...","review":"Great book to look into the thought processes of Yalom with different clients he had over the years.

It was recommended to me by my psychotherapy supervisor, at my request to read something a little more digestible than our textbook on said subject. I began reading and was immediately immersed in a magical, mysterious field of psychoanalysis that had been previously hidden from me! As promised, I not only learned, but enjoyed the learning, and hardly realized that I did learn throughout the journey that was this novel of short stories. I literally could not put the book down, and so apparently thought the others who read this book from my public library; the book itself has been read so many times that it has literally fallen apart into three separate sections. I am now a better therapist, and a happier person for having read this book- Thank you, Dr. Yalom!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stories","review":"I had to read this book for a graduate course I was taking. I read it in one day instead of chapter by chapter because the stories were so interesting. I found Yalom a bit much to stomach at times, but the clients themselves were very interesting and his writing style is engaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta Love Yalom","review":"This book is a fascinating and honest look at psychotherapy from the therapist's perspective. His detailed summaries of his work with various clients makes it feel as though you are experiencing the process in his mind. Whether right or wrong, effective or not, he gives his opinions and the outcomes of his work throughout each case (including his personal growth). His accounts are truly intriguing, humorous, touching, and genuine. Yalom even includes some taboo and politically incorrect, but entirely human, things he experiences throughout the sessions, adding much credibility. Love's Executioner is well written, easy to read, incredibly entertaining, and informative... so go read it. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A real inside look - experiential experience!","review":"This was read in little over a day, and that is with personal vision problems! Dr. Yalom writes in a manner that lets the reader be an essential voyer into the sessions. At times I could not put the book down until I found out what happened in the next session. The clients were being seen around the same time and some of the stories intertwine in Yalom's life. I was encouraged because at times my response would mirror his confirming for me that I working towards the work I am meant to pursue. It is a little like CSI for the psychotherapist!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to the world of therapy....","review":"This is a fascinating book, opening the intricacies of psychotherapy for all to see. Yalom can seem like an egotistical jerk, and then like an insightful, caring man.

I say 'scary' as almost every encounter with a female patient is about how this married therapist fantasizes about her! The analyses of the other patients is also kind of strange - one patient regrets not having children and has a dream where he meets a daughter he never had. Dr Yalom interprets this as the patient meeting his \\"female side\\" and wanting to be in greater touch with it (!?). I'm no therapist but I would have thought the more obvious interpretation was that it was related to his regret about not having children.......the only reason I can see in buying this book is that the cover price is small compared to even one of Dr Yaloms therapy sessions - and reading the book may put you off ever bothering wasting your money on consulting this therapist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as bad as it could have been......","review":"I had to get this book from a class. I'm working on getting my Masters in Counseling. I thought that some of the stories were interesting. The book starts with it's \\"good stuff.\\" The middle was ok. The last couple stories were dull. If you have to read this enjoy finding the themes that thread through all the stories. If you're looking for something to lull you into sleep read the last two stories in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most moving, surprising book I have ever read.","review":"This is an eye-opener for anyone who has ever been in therapy. Yalom is brutally honest about his own prejudices and emotions experienced as a doctor conducting a course of therapy. He also demonstrates that human beings are capable of greater insight and self-examination than many of us have ever imagined."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine End to Symphonic Cycle","review":"Alwyn's 4th Symphony completes his cycle of symphonies. His 5th Symphony is not part of this cycle, but stands alone. Alwyn is able to smoothly go from tranquil to energetic passages. He constantly builds from soft melodies to dynamic brass fanfares. There is much use of themes from the first three symphonies in this one, and they can be recognized if you have heard the other symphonies. This symphony ends triumphantly, bringing a sense of hope, at the end of a journey. The Sinfonietta is a 3 movement gem for string orchestra. The music moves smoothly and contains several beautiful melodies. I cannot comment on the quality of the recording, because I have heard no other recordings of this music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fathering like the Eternal Father","review":"A woman's relationship with her father permeates how she expects to be treated by a man. Just like a woman brings this type of baggage (or positivity) into a relationship, so does a father bring the positives or negatives of his relationship with his father into the marriage. It also colors how we see the heavenly Father. When we realize that, we'll be halfway there. The other half you'll gain through reading this book is that there are several areas where our families need us to strive as hard as we do at work when we are in the home arena. Discipline, love and attention, spiritual equipping, play and several other topics are addressed in quick chapters that can be digested in one sitting. If you would like to improve your relationship with your wife and kids before it is too late, you need to check this book out. Be intentional about taking care of your family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Undaunted perfection","review":"I cannot in any way imagine that this story will ever be told better than version. Besides Ambrose's usual two pillars of strength (knowledge and storytelling), I think this might be his best work because it also encompases his pure excitement and love of the America dream and the western myth. He so powerfully pulls together the adventures of the Corps with the building of a nation over the next 100 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puts you right there with the Corps of Discovery.","review":"Warning! Reading this book could make you a lifelong Lewis and Clark fan. It happened to me. Since reading this book shortly after it was published I have been inspired to more thoroughly study the history of this expedition and even to trace its paths. Today, as I am writing this, is the 200th anniversary of the expedition's crossing of the continental divide. For years I had planned to be on Lemhi Pass on this date to commemorate the event. But, as often occurs, events conspired against me, and instead I am home writing this review. A few weeks ago, however, I did get the opportunity to travel the Lolo Trail where I visited several Lewis and Clark sites (including the trail itself). It was a great trip. Anyway, my life has changed for the better because of this book. The story is presented in a way that is very readable yet with enough detail to really convey the experiences of these courageous men."},{"rating":"2","title":"Agree With Author","review":"I agree with author Norman Thomas Remick (\\"West Point:..Thomas Jefferson\\") who said that Stephen Ambrose was the best, ever, at informing the public by making history interesting. \\"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson...\\" is a great example of what this wonderful author and historian gave to America.

No one comes alive in this book in spite of all the quotes and research. Additionally, Abrose's grammer is awful. Reading this book may be more exhausting and frustrating than the expedition was!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfinished and Unsatisfying","review":"This book has an unpleasant surprise ending, which I am giving as a spoiler hoping it will save someone else some money. I knew the outline of the story and knew of Lewis' tragic early death. But after that, the book just ends. Hello? What about Clark? He lived a long time after. What of the other men on the expedition? What of York, the slave? What of Sacagawea? The book leaves so many loose ends that it is maddening. A shame since the rest of the book is an excellent read. Maybe Ambrose's family will issue a revision that gives the complete history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"The voyage of Lewis & Clark is no doubt fascinating. But this book is little more than a rehash of Lewis's notebooks by an adoring fan. We hear over and over how brilliant Lewis was, while the actual events demonstrate that repeatedly it was only the good will of the Indians he ran into that prevented him and his quite large expedition from being slaughtered. The book does not add much to our understanding of the time, the period or the man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired and plodding.","review":"Stephen Ambrose writes mechanically at best and is in need of a good editor. Mr Ambrose has an unabashed \\"crush\\" on Meriwether Lewis, much to the detriment of Wm Clark and Sacagawea. After the captains-2 hit the trail, I had a hard time forcing myself to plod along with their not-so-merry band. Paddled a boat, ate some meat, traded with Indians, ad nauseam for 1800 miles. And then we retraced our steps! It took me six months for read this leaden tome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Undaunted Courage Review","review":"This book was the first novel I read where history was accurately portrait in a compelling, engaging storyline. While some introductory parts where slow to read, I felt as though I was actually on the exploration when Stephen Ambrose took the reader through the harsh winters, indian negotiations, and the real experience of exploring the unknown. The book was thoroughly enjoyable and inspired me to seek out more challenges and face the unknowing with more vigor than ever before. Great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Look on An Old Story","review":"Every schoolchild knows of the Lewis and Clark expedition. Few of them know that it almost died in obscurity. Jefferson wanted Lewis to write a comprehensive report on the expedition but Lewis never wrote it. He had a nervous breakdown because of some personal problems or was overwhelmed by the amount of information collected or he had a historic case of writer's block. Until someone in the basement in the Smithsonian found the expedition's notebooks and catalogs of new species no one gave Lewis and Clark the credit they deserve. As Stephen Ambrose points out, countless species of animals were renamed based on first discovery by the expedition. This is but one of the tid-bits that Ambrose uncovers and explains in Undaunted Courage. I give the book 4 stars instead of 5 because it is not one his best books only the best I've read on Lewis and Clark.If this review was helpful, please say so."},{"rating":"1","title":"A long long long long book","review":"I had always been interested in Lewis and Clark but this book was just too much. This book had no real catch. I assume that it was pretty much accurate but there was nothing in it that made me want to turn the page. I had to physicaly force myself to get through it. In other words don't read this book unless you either are Lewis and Clark. ( I think that even they would fall asleep during this book) or your life depends on getting through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ambrose is not credible","review":"Sad to say a person that has excited many people about history, me included, was not credible. Anything he has written has to be questioned. The man build his career off lying about his relationship with Dwight Eisenhower. He plagiarized who knows how many times. He isn't exactly known for getting it straight. Too bad that people continue to read his works and believe they are getting the facts. The publishers should at least point out that Stephen Ambrose was a fraud. I'm a bit upset because I wasted my time reading his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great print book; disappointing audiobook","review":"Reading the fine print on the bottom of the box, I see this is technically a Books on Tape recording, so Simon & Schuster is off the hook. I can overlook Cotter Smith's somewhat flat reading of the text; after all, you can only add so much drama to a non-fiction book. But if you're going to read a book that focuses at least partly on Thomas Jefferson, is it too much to ask that they pronounce his own home correctly??!!!! Is it too much to have a director or producer say, \\"Hey Cotter, could you back up for a minute? It's 'mon-tuh-CHELL-oh,' not 'mon-tuh-SELL-oh.'Quite frankly, this is at least an average recording overall. But the fact that one of the most basic components of Jefferson's life, something we're all taught as children, can be mispronounced and then make its way on to a finished recording ruins this production from the very beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written--but by whom?!?","review":"This work is said to be plagarism--see Scandals and Scoundrels: Seven Cases That Shook the Academyby Ron Robin"},{"rating":"1","title":"undaunted courage","review":"Most unpleasant book.

Any single poor decision -- in navigation, indian relations or daily survival -- could have changed history forever.Ambrose has concluded that Jefferson's decision to commission Meriwether Lewis for the \\"Voyage of Discovery\\" was perhaps the single most important point in American history -- the right man at the right time!Review by Mark Norrell (Pocatello, Idaho"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read.","review":"Although a little slow at first with setting up the context and origins of the expedition, once it gets going, it's hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"History as it is meant to be told","review":"One of the most spectacular books by Ambrose, who has a catalog of masterful works. You really get into the story, and tag along through all of the trials and tribulations of the men and women who participated in this awesome journey. It's all there. Politics. Hardship. Courage. Persistence. Doubt. Tragedy.This had to have been one of the most important missions in American history. Charting a path from east to west meant no more long voyages around South America.

He loves it, and I will read it next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated","review":"I feel like maybe I missed something, given all the hype that surrounded this book. But I found that it didn't seem to add much to the subject matter: it seemed like a rather weak summary of the explorers journals. I keep feeling like I would have been better reading the primary source material or a different survey of that material. I like Ambrose's other works and am a avid history reader, but this one really feel short. The subject matter may simply not as suited to Ambrose's style. Someone like Robert Kaplan (Balkan Ghosts), Rebecca West (Black Lamb and Grey Falcon) or William Dalrymple (From the Holy Mountain) would have done a much better job of weaving in what Lewis and Clark were seeing and experiencing within the context of their times and pulled in additional material to illuminate the subject matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio book to be avoided","review":"Most times I read a book, but there are certain projects I do that allow me to have an audio version playing. A man named Barett Whitener is alleged to be reading this book, however, there are hints that a lot of it is computer generated. I couldn't stand listening to this being read for ten minutes. I cannot imagine having to listen to the drone go on and on for hours. This is very disappointing, as Stephen E. Ambrose is an amazing writer with interesting material. To have his work reduced to this is an insult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best History Book I've Ever Read!","review":"Undaunted Courage is, without a doubt, the mostinteresting history book that I've ever read.There is one chapter in particular that readsas if it were a novel.

I suppose the work getting throught the book is a metaphor for the incredible journey that is reorded therein. I found the book most readable and enjoyable when it placed the exploration in the context of its day and the broader history of the country. The day to day adventures and tribulations of the corps at times became a bit tedious. Nevertheless, for anyone intersted in the early history of the Republic, this is an important and worthwhile read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for all students of history","review":"Stephen Ambrose has brought to light one of the most under-taught subject in our school system. This book places you with the members of the Corps of Discovery in such away that you can even picture each sight, each sound, and each emotion felt by those courageous men.

Stephan Ambrose has cleared that up for us, elucidating the language of Lewis & Clark while adding his own well-pointed narrations. For the first time I was able to easily read and enjoy the accounts of this most important event in American history. This book is bound to be a classic on the bookshelves of the lovers of history. It's another masterpiece by one of American's best writers of the subject. G.

I have enjoyed the read and consider it a very good introduction to the subject and the material available. For those who want to do more, the Moulton edition of the Journals is essential. Also worthwhile is Bernard DeVoto, \\"The Journals of Lewis and Clark\\". The Ambrose book works for book discussion groups as there is plenty to keep the conversation rolling as our group discovered."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"This is a very enlighting book. It is educational, but is like reading a novel. You will discover a lot about an important time in the history of the United States and what a visionary and genius we had in our thrid president,Thomas Jefferson. This book started me on a quest for more knowledge about Mr. Jefferson that has not ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written, but forgot about Clark","review":"Ambrose shows his literary expertise as he chronicles the most famous exploring duo in American history. Using journals and other first person witness accounts, the reader is treated to a detailed description of Lewis and Clark's expedition to the pacific. While the research was extensive, Ambrose does relegate Clark to a minor role as he concentrates more on Lewis and Jefferson which would undoubtedly upset Lewis who consistently emphasized the equality of the two captains. The reader should not be surprised, as the title emphasizes this point about the thesis. Despite this pro-Lewis bias, Undaunted Courage is a great resource for information on the Corps of Discovery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summarizes Lewis and Clark too much in some instances","review":"If you read The Journals of Lewis and Clark by Merriwether Lewis and Bernard DeVoto you will see that many difficult grinding days are missing in this book. You don't get to read about the many hair-raising details of getting around or through numerous harrowing rapids, flash floods etc. Mr. Ambrose summarizes the daily (frequently dangerous) grind to keep the story flowing, paint an fascinating picture of Lewis's character/personality and to leave space for putting the expedition in an interesting historical context -- but summaries often tend to understate the magnitude of the actually difficulties they actually faced day-in and day-out. If I had not first read Lewis's/DeVoto's direct-from-the-horse's-mouth account, I would have given this book five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding book, good read, factual error","review":"For the most part, I enjoyed the book. Mr. Ambrose writes with an immediacy that brings the period of time to life and personalizes the participants including Jefferson. I was disappointed, however, when, on page 302, he placed the settlement of The Dalles in Washington instead of Oregon where it belongs. This concerned me because I felt there might be other errors that may also have gotten into the book undetected."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent account of Lewis & Clark journey","review":"This is an excellent acount of the transcontinental journeyof Lewis and Clark in 1803-1806, by prize-winning historianStephen Ambrose.

Stepen E. Ambrose has written a well documented piece. You find yourself in the boat with Lewis and Clark as they traverse the Ohio, Mississippi, and Missouri Rivers. You feel the excitement that Meriwether Lewis brought to the mission.

Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many editorials woven w/ facts","review":"I am having a hard time reading this book.. I become stressed. The author editorializes WAY too much. He also tends to analyze facts with a late 20th century perspective, rather than within the context of the time events occurred. Also, he should stay away from political analysis -- he is very weak in these areas (e.g.: Jefferson and Burr). May be a reflection of over-reliance on Merriweather/expedition-focused source documents. Or... Is it possible that the author is so enamoured with his subject that he lost a bit of the biographer/historian's [necessary] objectivity?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read for US History Buffs","review":"For US history buffs, this book is really a must read. I'm sure there are many more scholarly and precise works on the Lewis and Clark expedition from 1803-1806, but this one has to be one of the most accessible for the general reader. The author did a great job with a complex historical event and summarizing it into a compelling narrative. I naturally found the portion describing the actual expedition to be the most interesting. The events leading up to the expedition and the aftermath were a little more slow going. The maps and sketches were helpful to understanding the expedition, but I would have enjoyed even more to include pictures or sketches of some of the animals and plants Lewis documented during the trip. Overall it was a great book and made me appreciate just how significant the expedition was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"For anyone unfamiliar with Lewis and Clark, or that time period of American history, sigh in relief! This book is not only a great read, but orients you to the trip Lewis and Clark made overland out to the Pacific Ocean. High readability; however, pay attention to the title: this is a book about Merriweather Lewis' expedition west. Anyone looking for much on Sacajawea or York will have to look elsewhere, which is fine with me. Lewis deserves his own book. The author loves his subject---with that it is easy to stay with the story. Its not a heavy read at all. If you are even a bit curious and don't want to get in too deep, this book is perfect for you! It was for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"History, Geography, Leadership, Science--It's all here!","review":"I literally devoured Ambrose's tale of the Lewis and Clark expedition.

Obviously extensive, well researched, and with a good flow - this book is worth reading.

Was he muredered, Ambroses' guesses leave something to be desired.All in all this is a good book which should be read by any aspiring student of history.Joseph Dworak"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've ever read","review":"The first fifty pages or so starts with the obligatory background info which makes for fairly slow reading. However, once the expedition starts I could not put the book down. Ambrose does a masterful job of highlighting his own work with quotes from the actual journals of Lewis and Clark. His personal familiarity with the terrain and his obvious fascination with the subject matter makes me want to retrace the footsteps of the Corp of Discovery myself! This book is a masterpiece of understatement.

I started it thinking I was going to learn some history and get a good adventure story at the same time. Instead, I got really bogged down about half way through the book in all the minute details of Lewis and Clark's trip-- first they walked here, then they walked there, then one tripped, then the other yawned, etc. After a while it was all the same, and I didn't much care what happened to them. It was all I could do to finish this book. The most interesting parts were the first few chapters, where the reasons for the journey and the climate of the times were discussed.

Every young man with an adventurous spirit should read this book.As someone mentioned, the first third or so is a bit of a slow read, laying out the formative years of Lewis and the extensive trip prep. Once they hit the river it's hard to put down. What makes the book transform into an experience that comes alive is the array of anecdotal insights culled from a massive research effort. You begin to appreciate how many times the whole trip could have gone south and they would have never been heard from again. Also, if you're a camper you'll laugh at the Murphy's Law nature of the journey.If you like this book, I found another Ambrose book even more interesting - the awkwardly named \\"Nothing Like It in the World\\" about building the transcontinental railroad. It's nice to read this one first though because of the natural chronological progression of the two narratives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Undaunted Courage by Stephen E.

From the tedium of planning to Sacajawea's proper place in the expedition's success, Ambrose takes material culled from Lewis and Clark's journals and his own experience on the trail and crafts a fascinating story of these two men and their adventure across the wilderness. Even Lewis's deterioration and eventual suicide is dealt with clearly and with as much accuracy and compassion as history allows. A phenomenal undertaking and one that will be hard to improve upon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Triumphant and Tragic","review":"Were it not for fascinating books of American history, like this one, episodes of our illustrious, and tragic, past might be easily forgotten. That the Lewis and Clark expedition is an interesting story is an understatement, but what sets this book apart from other interesting books of history is that Ambrose does not allow the reader to shelter himself/herself from the hard personal questions about leadership and personal tragedy. I found myself reflecting on my own style of leadership, and my own personal failures and triumphs. A novel of exploration could not have been better written nor conceived."},{"rating":"2","title":"the long journey","review":"the book is a testament to a journey that took over two years to complete. the author uses the sights,sounds and feelings of the men themselves. it is incredible to think that a voyage like this was undertaken nearly two hundred years ago and completed. the loss of only one life reaffirms the leadership qualities of both lewis and clark. i wish there were more details on the return journey which moves along rather quickly. the book takes you along on a fantastic expedition and after everything he and his men went through, ends tragically with the untimely death of lewis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Undaunted Courage","review":"The book makes you feel as though you are with the Corps of Discovery, every step of the way.

Like all of the other tales set in this world it is full of prehistoric creatures of the various periods and peopled by the most anachronistic cast of characters ever assembled. There are pirates, Vikings, cavemen, and intelligent apes as well as some wonderful made up races such as the evolved reptilian race that enjoy feasting on human flesh. Tarzan, of course, finds himself at home in the jungles of this world, and the supporting characters are heroic and delightful to become acquainted with.

I also like Paul Berkes's voice on \\"More & More\\" and the emotion of \\"Burn Me Up/Set Me Free\\".

I bought the \\"Brief\\" series because it is reputedly produced by the creators of the Master of Sleuth himself.However, I see no similarity in the two heroes of the DVD legalistic genre.I was deeply disappointed by the Yuppie-life-styled attorney figure presented in \\"Brief\\".

I have listened to it a few times in the years I have owned it and haven't been impressed with it. It doesn't grab you like Fate's \\"Melissa\\" or \\"Don't Break The Oath\\" which I have listened to numerous times. Maybe the lyrics are good. I really don't know.

The Trees Have Eyes & Black Devil are unmistakably characteristic of Diamond, and are my own personal favorites from this CD. With respect the enormous amount of talent involved in the creation of this latest work, it seems more like a Mercyful Fate album. Don't Break the Oath to 9 deal more with the devil, evil, and Hell, while Diamond's storylines i.e. Spider's Lulaby and Voodoo are tuned along the lines of horror and insanity (although, many don't see the distinction). Four stars simply because I liked the albums mentioned in comparison better than House, but it's worth the money, and like most KD/MF, it's an acquired taste (even with each new release)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This ain't yer daddy's music!","review":"Loved it!

Probaly because Ozzy never learned how to sing. If you want a video where an old man runs around yelling the f word and flicking the camera off this is for you, otherwise watch out!

It shows 2 second clips of actual \\"live\\" band footage intermixxed with camera shots bouncing all over the place. A real concert video is just that, a live video of a band on stage playing their songs. Thank GOD I bought a cheap VHS version. I never even watched the whole thing. If you want to see a real show check out Iron Maiden's Rock In Rio or Primal Fear's The History Of Fear. This crap wouldn't be worth watching if it was sent to you for free!!!! I can't imagine Ozzy ever saw this and approved its release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Video Collection","review":"I wouldn't call this a live concert, but rather a collection of individual videos using multiple live performances. Rarely did what you saw on screen match what was being heard. Don't buy this expecting to see a good live show.

I have a VHS of the \\"After Hours show\\", excellent video but only mono sound, so I would LOVE a professional 5.1 or 6.1 release of it.

This concert video portrays Ozzy at his dumbest. Ozzy is the real life Homer Simpson, but annoying instead of funny. Ozzy's voice is shrill, flat, off key and bad. The only reason it doesn't sound too ear bursting on the video is because Sharon insisted that Ozzy re-record and do voice overs in the studio.I agree with the other guy who stated that Ozzy is not to be given the credit for starting metal. Ronnie James Dio was playing in bands, recording, and in the music industry way before Ozzy was. Ronnie James Dio is an actual composer and musician...Zack Wyld is a good guitarist but he is no where near as great as Randy Rhodes or Jake E lee. This video portrays Zack flaunting his long girly hair and hamming up the concert..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"I'll keep this short and sweet....I bought this DVD expecting to see a legend at work in a LIVE concert. This DVD was nothing more than a 110 minute music video. I am above all else a big guitar fan and there were NO good close ups of Zakk's guitar solos. The few times you did get a glimpse of him playing, it was totally out of sync with the music! Absolutely the worst editing I've ever seen.

Save your money people!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I put this DVD in the player, got about half way through the first song (No More Tears), got frustrated and ejected it. First of all, the camera work looks like it's being handled by a ferret on crank. That kind of camera work irritates me to no end. I just want to watch the band play. I don't need a simulated \\"Clocwork Orange\\" re-education experience. Then I noticed that, every time the camera angle changed, Ozzy and the band were wearing different clothes, or Ozzy's hair was different or his lips didn't match the sound. Guess what - the video isn't even real. It's apparently a bunch of different concert footage superimposed on the audio from one show. What a rip-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I am a huge Ozzy fan and an even bigger Randy Rhoads fan and I really don't want to say something bad about an Ozzy product. However, on this one I must. First off, don't buy this expecting it to be a real concert. The footage is spliced together and if you watch what Zakk is playing, often times it is clearly not the same song. There is too much audience in this dvd and I truly don't believe that the T 'n' A footage throughout was appropriate. Expected in a Poison dvd but not in an Ozzy dvd. Also, the video shown during Flying High Again, which consisted mostly of crude audience footage, was downright disrespectful to Randy Rhoads.

He presents techniques in two veins. Some involve scaring the dog into doing the right thing by throwing things at him/her or by making a loud noise.

I bought this \\"extra coarse\\" version to go along with several others sizes that I've purchased over the years. I now have enough different sizes that I can relegate my large box grater to \\"the closet of forgotten kitchen gadgets.\\" If you've been frustrated with difficult to clean box graters, or their tendency to bend and break, I'd suggest that you give one of these Microplane graters a try.

Sorry, there are none! Any honest musical appraisal reveals this is an uninspired, pedestrian and very dated effort. I cannot believe anyone could massage songs for 10 years and arrive at this!Chris Squire is a fine bass player and a much under-rated and under-recorded vocalist, it is such a pity that this \`drink coaster' so much devalues his small recording output.\`A Fish Out of Water' shines like a beacon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There's just no excuse for this","review":"I will not listen to this record a second time. It was hard enough getting through it once. I am a longtime fan of Chris and classic Yes, and considering that both Chris and Billy were in such fine form on the recent Ladder tour, I cannot begin to fathom how two guys so talented could produce this drivel. La-la pop at it's least compelling. C'mon, guys, you can do better, and your fans deserve a little substance for their ( ). Let's hope the momentum from The Ladder (Excellent!) is not dissipated by this disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conspiracy (to make money)? Open Your Ears!","review":"What a dud! Open Your Eyes, the Yes labelled Squire/Sherwood collaboration was bad; this is much much worse. There's not a single track on this CD worth listening to more than once. The only vaguely listenable tracks are already available on other Yes albums and even then their inclusion was questionable. Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fish out of time","review":"If you were expecting FOOW II - think again! This one's got guitar on it - great gobs of it. In fact, it sounds like mid-eighties corporate rock. To be fair, that's probably when much of it was conceived since this has been on the shelf for years. On the plus side, its got Chris' distinctive vocals on a few of the tracks. Steve Stevens puts in some tasty guitar on one energetic track (at time sounding like Howe and Holdsworth). Overall though, it doesn't come close to FOOW. That trio format was in many ways quite audacious but this suffers from Billy Sherwood's dated and insipid musical view. Is there much bass on it? No more than standard rock fayre. Gone are the triumphant bass pirouettes of 'Hold out your hand'. Chris, if you're going to abandon one of the most distinctive bass styles in music and leech of a youngster, pick a credible one next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bunch Of Demos","review":"Almost half of the songs on this album are already released by Yes or World Trade, in better versions, since this sounds like demos. Still, these are the best songs here. The rest of the songs are demo-versions of leftovers from Yes' AOR-era. The album is lacking in melody, arrangement, production, enthusiasm. No excitement, no surprices. Just a bunch of mid-tempo AOR-songs of the most boring kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another pop conspiracy... Chris: what a shame","review":"I cannot understand how, having enough money and independence to make good prog music, Master Squire makes this commercial stuff. His first solo album, fish out of water, is a beautiful non commercial masterpiece; this conspiracy cd is only worth for brian adams fans/back street boy's fans.\\u0005, not for your loyal yes's fans. Chris: if you ever read this: learn about King crimson's Robert Fripp's musical integrity: he has never sold out like Yes in Open your eyes or this Conspiracy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Conspiracy ! we want more!","review":"Conspiracy is not a Chris Squire Solo effort so is not the much awaited Fish Out of the Water II. Conspiracy is a new outlet for Chris Squire and Billy Sherwood to explore music outside of the YES format. The CD is very good, not over produced and that is VERY good thing. The Songs are from different eras but all timeless, as good music usually is. I am very exicted about this new outlet, and I wish we can hear more in the coming years. That is the beauty of the YES family, it expands over many types of music and that is what keeps me interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Yes themselves","review":"Chris Squire and Billy Sherwood are such more a complimentary team now than what is left of the Yes machine. All these songs hold wieght and the playing by all the musicians is great. I saw these guy's play in Maui and what a band! Alan is burning as always, Steve Porcaro adds a sweet touch and Jimmy Haun's solo is very lyrical (sounding like Alex Lifeson meets Jeff Beck) Alan is burning as always. A feast for the ears!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Production, Solid Pop","review":"This is not Yes. If you're thinking that this album is going to be as Yes-ish as FISH OUT OF WATER, then avoid it. It's not even close.It's a pop album, and it's pretty darn good. It doesn't pretend to be profound, or celestial, or even epic. It just rocks.Billy Squire really shines as producer. If you listen to this album after listening to Yes' OPEN YOUR EYES, you'll think you have the same album in your machine!There are some \\"bonus\\" tracks not listed on the sleeve, which are songs that Yes \\"covered\\" on OPEN YOUR EYES.A solid outting, though it sometimes sounds rather same-y. It will probably be Chris Squire's last solo effort, judging by how long it too him to follow up on FISH OUT OF WATER."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Favorites","review":"I was hesitant to get this cd when I first read some of the reviews. But since I have a great respect and admiration for Chris Squire's work with YES and on Fish Out of Water I decided to give it a try. In the past few months since I bought it, it has become far and away one of my favorite albums. Musically solid, great guitar and bass from both guys. One of the others who reviewed this album above said he cringed at two men singing the lyrics on this album. I LOVE the lyrics and I think it's great to hear a man (or men) sing them. Men have feelings too ya know! (So I've heard anyway) At any rate, I think it's a wonderful piece of work and Sherwood and Squire have every right to be proud of it. Chris' voice is powerful, wonderful range and clarity. Sherwood also sports a great voice, though muddied terribly on his solo work \\"The Big Peace\\". I'm thrilled I bought this CD and wouldn't give it up for the world. Worth more than the asking price to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"quite outdated","review":"OK intro for technical readers, but there is a lot here that is completely out of date since the book was written in 1997.

The premise is providing sexual scenarios to the reader to give to their husbands. For instance, husband and wife are in the car going some where, the wife is to tell the husband to imagine she's the babysitter and then pull off somewhere to recreated this fantasy. Older man driving teen girl home, while his wife and children are left behind, then things get sexual.First off, not many men have that imagination, second how many wives are going to allow their husband a fantasy about having sex with a teen babysitter.This book might fly if you're 13, otherwise save your and spend it on a movie at Blockbuster or a nice bottle of wine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tracy at his Best","review":"Without a doubt, this is Spencer Tracy's finest performance; and since most of his contemporaries in Hollywood regarded him as the best actor in town it's a pretty high standard. (Clark Gable said it embarassed him to work with Tracy in \\"Boom Town\\", his fellow actor was so good). King Vidor's film is based on a portion of Kenneth Robert's historical novel and doesn't soft-pedal for a moment the mutual hatred that existed between whites and reds during the French and Indian War. The movie is about a raid into Canada by a troop of American guerillas led by Tracy, and the fantastic hazards they faced coming and going, with a blood-curdling battle sandwiched in between. That battle action is the most realistic 18th-century warfare I've ever seen captured on film and a highlight of director Vidor's career. Robert Young and Walter Brennan provide stalwart support, but it is Tracy's performance that overawes everything else as the forceful but flawed leader in search of the impossible."},{"rating":"2","title":"great adventure flick","review":"One of the great adventure films of all time, made in glorious 1940 technicolour. Breathtaking scenes of boats being dragged up hills and the wiping out of an entire Indian village. Spencer Tracy is excellent as rogers, whose mission it is to destroy a tribe of Red Indians called the abenakis, who are a murderous bunch who raid the villages of white settlers and murder their women and babies. After the admirable effectiveness with which the rangers accomplish their task, they must get to Fort wentworth to safety and avoid the French in doing so. This leads to an agonizing march in which many of our heroes perish; they are driven almost mad with hunger. The score and photography are excellent and walter brennan is great. A great Hollywood slice of American history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"But I can't understand why this is on the same list of banned movies as with Disney's Song of the South. Maybe it deplicted the Native Americans more true than our history books schooled us???"},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Classic","review":"Spencer Tracy will forever be remembered for his great skill as an actor. If you have never seen this movie, you should watch it at your earliest opportunity. Robert Young and of course Walter Brennan always add to any story line. This is not a typical cowboys and indians movie. Call it the advanture of a lifetime. Northwest Passage will be remembered and watched always."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed!","review":"I had ordered a VHS movie of Northwest Passage. I was excited when it finally arrived.

It arrived in a crushed box, NOT in original packaging, and without an original receipt. A photocopy of a 'lifetime guarantee' was tossed inside the box and the loader was sliding around along with some crumpled paper. The wheels are plastic, the decals are crooked and wrinkled, and I do not feel this at all lives up to the TONKA reputation. I am terribly disappointed and will NEVER buy this type of toy on line again as it is NOT at all what I expected.

However the locking mechanism that holds the bucket from tipping down is made of plastic, and just doesn't work. If you load the bucket anymore than a quarter to a half full of sand, it is too heavy and the bucket just tips forward. If the sand is at all wet ... forget about it.

Besides that most of the beats are a step down (\\"Radio\\" would be a major example of this). Basically, it does have some decent songs but they are a step down from the average Jurassic 5 song. On the other hand, \\"Canto De Ossanha\\" is a pretty good instrumental. Other than that though this CD feels like a big letdown from the previous CD's which were so great."},{"rating":"1","title":"No New Tricks","review":"I am a huge a Jurassic 5 fan, in fact they are probably the single biggest influence of why I started to like hip hop. On this album nothing catches your attention. The use the same formula that they have used in the past, but the execution of the songs sometimes seems forced. A lot of that has to do with Cut Chemist not being there. Nu-Mark is a good producer, but when he steps aside to let others produce the music you can tell the difference. \\"Back 4 you\\" and \\"Red Hot\\" are really the only two good songs on the album. There are a couple of other decent tracks but nothing that is going to get stuck in your head. Also the song with Dave Matthews Band is AWFUL, but J5 wanted to try something new, and I think that is an interesting artistic decision, it just does not work very well between these two styles. This is by far the worst J5 album, if you want classic J5 pick up Quality Control, or their EP, each of these are defining hip hop."},{"rating":"2","title":"J5 back in it","review":"I've been down with Jurassic since the EP and was a bit dissapointed with their last album, Power In Numbers. it was not bad but not what I expected.

Now, however, 2 years later, this album has really grown on me and contains the same strength, positive message and beat. I think it was ahead of its time two years ago, but now I listen to it all the time. Certain tracks like, \\"Get it Together\\" \\"Turn It Out\\" and \\"End Up Like This\\" really qualify these guys (the whole album) as true artists. They have a real 'slice of life' or experience based lyrical base which is strong. Not only that, but they speak from a positive perspective which so many musicians seem to have difficulties with. No whining! It ought to be a qualifier for beat-music. That would get rid of a lot of the crap rap that exists out there.Candy for my ear, I hear you now and I hear you later!I really miss these guys.

We enjoy playing it together but even for me as an adult, it's a bit of a challenge to land the flies into the frog's mouth. For him it's next to impossible. Maybe the toy is good for developing hand/eye coordination, but for a little one it's a bit frustrating to never get a fly in. He likes it anyway, so I'm giving it 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Toy","review":"This is a fun toy.

While many of the questions in entertainment aren't quite current, they are all topics that anyone over the age of 12 will have a chance of knowing.

This game is a blast, and it lets everyone put all their useless knowledge to work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the old ones, but still great.","review":"This is a very fun game. It can be played by many people and is a lot of fun. Still, it dose have a few problems. The questions are not as eductional as they use to be. They took out Liturature, and put in many more entertanment questions. Another problem is that you will need to update you set, because some of the questions are time based; such as: \\"Who was the last president to...\\" Also, with the entertanment world changing so much, the T.V and movie questions become outdated. All in all, I would recomend buying this game. It's great for large groups of people, and will really make you think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Easy to Be Entertaining","review":"I wish they would make a Trivial Pursuit for teenagers, and one for adults. I really like the format and the idea behind the game. As a teenager, I really enjoyed the questions, but with this edition I find that the questions are way too easy. The attraction of a trivia game is being able to impress your friends with what you know or be wowed by what they know. If the questions are so easy it is just not competitive. Some of the questions even contained lame hints to the answer! I tried to salvage my ... investment by buying the Know-It-All cards, but I was disappointed with those, too. I am not a PhD, there should be at least a few questions in a trivia game that do not insult me with their obviousness. You Don't Know Jack has much better questions, and is a lot more fun overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"The same old game, but easier for younger players","review":"I'm not really a toy enthusiast, but I do like Trivial Persuit. This is basically an updated version of the Trivial Persuit Genious 3 edition. Most of the questions seem to be from the past couple years, so you younger players will benefit from this version rather than the Genious 3 edition, which is extremely tough if you can't remember TV shows from the 1950s. The board has also been updated with pictures of more recent people. Overall it's the same old game that has spawned battles amongst teenagers and adults for years. Younger geniouses should buy this version, however you older players might benefit from the genious 3 edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Lee Marvin Movie....but....","review":"....Lee Marvin at his finest....but there are so many holes in this plot it looks like swiss cheese!

Point Blank is Lee Marvin's best movie, the best character for him, and has his best tag line. I'll leave that for you to find. (It has to with seat belts.) The movie is aptly named. The plot is steam-roller direct, but the director uses some arty time-lapse devices that either distract by conflicting with the directness of the character and the plot, or enhance by providing depth and interest, I can't decide. But they do jarr a little and seem dated. I suppose I do like the uniqueness they add. It's a really good Lee Marvin movie, and Angie Dickinson to boot.

And what makes the film 'noirer' than most is the fact that our anti-hero is unsuccessful and duped even in his dreams! Now that's noir! If possible, wait to see this in widescreen.

Who would of thought that this was the same director that would go on to direct 1972's \\"Deliverance\\".As for Lee Marvin's peformance? It is clearly his worst. All the acting is bad and the entire cast is wasted on this mess. The dialog by Lee Marvin's wife in an early scene is rambling, excessive, exhausting and laughable. A scene that Mel Brooks would have been proud of and embarassed by it at the same time. The final and nicest thing I can say about this mess is stay away from it.

It is also the type of theology that Mel Gibson follows - a very literal telling of events. There is a more intelligent way to teach Chritianity to pre-schoolers.

Why people feel the need to compare it to Jellyfish is beyond me. I have not experienced The Tories' first release (Wonderful Life, which I am told it is considerably better), but this album seems quite increadibly bland when contrasted to the magnificent Spilt Milk. So - Jellyfish lovers beware: this may not be the album you've been craving! If you are a fan of good pop generally, then Upside of Down is no dud. The guitars are rich and the vocal harmonies are impressive, but in no way are they as complex, intelligent or quite as beautiful as anything from the Sturmer/Manning catalogue.

When you know the secret the town is hiding and why Tracy has come to visit (which I remembered), the movie loses much of it's punch. And that score! It's great but it overpowers the small plot of the film and doesn't fit at all. There's a tremendous cast, but none of them has enough of a role to get their teeth into except maybe Ernest Borgnine.The plot is slim, and the behavior of the townspeople doesn't seem right. Maybe they updated the script from 1870 to 1945 or something. It's just not right.And those few scenes I remembered? They're still there and they're still good!

Just Spencer lumbering around the town, speaking some lines hear some lines there, hinting at this or that but nothing that we couldnt guess or nothing that brings us to a suprise twist on what we thought we had figured out.

Being ever diligent I tried to pick the book up and read it two more times but for the first time ever I put the book down and never picked it up again. Why you ask???? The characters are unlikeable. The author tries to hard at everything, so much so you can't enjoy anything. The plot has nothing to offer but cliche."},{"rating":"1","title":"PASS on this... you'll be glad you did","review":"Buying this book is like buying a generic tampon: the next day you wonder what in the heck were you thinking. In 40 years of reading this is the only book I've never finished. After 50 pages I threw my hands up in the air. By 200 pages I dropped this in the lake and said good riddens to so much bad baggage.

Having been to Alaska, it's truly a sight of beauty that may make you believe in a higher power to create something this amazing.It's hard to add something original after so many reviews other than I'm glad that I sat down and read this book, and go to see Alaska through the eyes of someone there over 120 years ago.For the Kindle version, there's no Table of Contents, so you can't skip around between chapters. Other than that, it's a free book, and worth downloading if you're interested in Alaska, glaciers, or Muir himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Muir's glacier voyages","review":"No doubt about it, John Muir was one of America's greatest citizens. He founded the Sierra Club and was instrumental in starting the ecological movement in the United States. In this book Muir recounts three journeys to Southeast Alaska that he took in the late 1800's. He writes better about glaciers than any writer who ever lived. There are flaws: Muir's attitudes about native peoples are simple-minded and ignorant, and his prose is sometimes dry and dull. Also, one cannot help but call Muir's credibility into question when he writes than he and his dog Stickeen walked fifteen miles across a crevasse-riddled glacier in three hours and then had nothing for dinner but a moldy cracker. But these are important records from a man who truly loved the natural world, and it's essential reading material for anyone traveling to Southeast Alaska or anyone wishing to learn more about glaciers."},{"rating":"1","title":"My first & last purchase from amazon","review":"the FLOPPY DISK ADAPTER does not work using windows xp.

Or, at least it had the potential to be. I really wanted to like it. But I couldn't get into the way the story was told through the artifacts catalogued from the leprosarium. It gave the story a disjointed feel and left me feeling disconnected from the characters. As it's told, it's not a bad story, but it could have been so much more powerful had more time been spent on character development.This story was really interesting, but not moving.

The second half of the movie, which completely abandons its historical source and follows some completely made up story where Zhao Zilong fights a fictional female general. The story jumps around from year to years and lacks any real emotional impact.

The water resistance is now gone so it is in the shop again. It failed me in a mild rain.The GPS is always slow to aquire a signal strong enough to mark a point or navigate by.

Navigating the various functions can be tricky and GPS, Compass and Altitude functions will need to calibrated regularly in order to be usably accurate. Also note that the GPS function quickly drains the rechargeable battery so for long outings you will need to use this function sparingly. Another factoid: although the watch is water proof to >50m (not sure exactly) the manual warns of pressing ANY button while the watch is submerged at any depth as this could short out the electronics. I returned this watch and decided to go with a hand held GPS device that has the same functions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless..","review":"Uniqueness of this watch was the GPS feature. However, I have yet to acquire a sufficient satellite signals to use any of the functions of this watch that require GPS feature. I paid a lot of money for these features and am now only using it as a time piece. Even as an ordinary watch, I have to recharge every couple of weeks to use it. I have written to Suunto and asked to trade it in for X10 but they refused. My argument to them was that if the watch does not work as advertised, they should not market them as such. Some of us rely on these technologies with our lives..literally. Their response was that their upgraded model X10 should work better in acquiring the signals. No reasonable remedy. Maybe they produce other products that are good but based on their company policies, I will never purchase another Suunto product again but will be a living negative advertisement of their products.

However, if you're going to buy a book to learn statistics or probability, I would suggest a more recent book. They may not be as brief and concise as this, but newer books would be more up to date. One interesting thing about the Gnedenko/Khinchin book is their examples and problems, which involve things such as the production of artillery shells, or hitting targets with cannons. It is a very welcome change from the traditional, but obvious examples that use decks of cards or dice. Also, it says things about the audience for whom this book was originally meant, and the relevant topics of the time of the cold war.

This movie tackles these issues head on in a riveting and dramatic fashion. The script was well-written, flowed seamlessly, and there was never a dull moment. The chemistry between the Cruise, Nicholson, Moore, Pollack, Bacon, Sutherland and company lifted this movie to an even higher level. And although the court scenes are a bit unbelievable, you don't even think about it while watching the movie. A Few Good Men is definitely a must see, and in my opinion, should be slated as one of the great classics of the 1990s. And just think, this rave review of a movie about sailors and Marines is being written by someone in the Army!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Film","review":"This is a film that was definitely well thought out.

This movie could have been good but it trades intelligence for Hollywood predictability.Did anybody buy that scene where Jack Nicholson bursts out that he gave the order?This movie even actually has the audacity to cast Jack Nicholson in a movie with Kevin Pollack, (The gretest Nicholson impressionist I have ever seen.), and then allow Tom Cruise to do the movie's only Nicholson impersonation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good Comedy","review":"I thought this was a great movie.It is the perfect blend of comedy, acton, & suspence.I highly recomend this movie.

Not everyone will like this movie but as for myself personally it shall forever be one of my favorites in my collection because like I stated before the actors, the script, the camera visuals, and last the director not being afraid to do a movie that became one of the best movies ever drama wise in film history and still to this day stands tall among other Military Drama movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't handle the truth!!","review":"One of the more famous movie lines ever and it comes from a great movie. It is a courtroom drama that keeps you on the edge of your seat. It focuses on marines who are accused of murder but Tom Cruise's character takes up the case (not necessarily by choice) and argues that they were just acting on orders that they could not disobey. This is one of Jack Nicholson's best roles and he is believable in that role. I have seen this so many times and I do not get bored of it at all.This is an amazing movie and I highly recommend it. The acting is fantastic and it never once gets boring or slow."},{"rating":"1","title":"high school play","review":"This was originally a play. It looks like it was written for a high school production. I mean, the final \\"confession\\" is based on such a flimsy strategy, it's RIDICULOUS! Tom Cruise sucks, as usual. I mean, acting 101 tells you that when you're trying to look strong and forceful in a scene: DON'T BLINK. And there Tom Cruise is, blinking like a stoplight in the final showdown courtroom scene, when he's supposed to appear forceful. (To anyone who doubts me, rent LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, and study Peter O'Toole's strong unblinking performance). The technicians on this film give the film a nice look, and it's they who are worth praising...and some of the actors. I can handle that truth. Can you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A courtroom drama with no causal evidence, (...)","review":"This is one of the most overrated movies of all time. I can't see any appeal about a movie where the villain admits he did it, because there really is no evidence or build up. He just says, \\"I did it,\\" and the movie ends. This cast may have fireworks, but the material is pure fizzle.Rob Reiner and Aaron Sorkin seem to be making a jab against those who hold truth to be on their side. But this movie doesn't really argue against anything substantive and the performances and delivery is pure stereotype.This is one of the last courtroom dramas, a genre which flourished in the 80s.

Tom Cruise as the main character (ick). Demi Moore is horrible (big shock). Nicholson was okay, but, then again, he ALWAYS gets the agressive and/or crazy guy. If he actually played different roles, I would not be so critical and consider his performance outstanding, but I'm starting to think that's what he's like in real life. Didn't like how it turned out, because Nicholson's character was RIGHT about people dying.Excellent performances? My butt. Great screenplay? Right. Only watch this movie if you think Tom Cruise or Demi Moore is hot, if you really REALLY like Nicholson, or have a thing for military stories that have very little truth to them and could never happen in real life. I was forced into watching this for a psych class, and I regret watching it.Can I handle the truth?

I have never liked his acting, and never even considered him a \\"decent\\" actor until I watched this movie. He is so convincing as the \\"Top Lawyer\\" of the Navy that you can't question his talent. OK, maybe that was a little facetious, but I really think this was his best film. He held his own in the tense courtroom battle with (my least favorite actor) Jack Nicholson. Obviously I do not like Jack as an actor, but this was quite possibly his most convincing role. The court room \\"debate\\" between the two is incredible. I have watched the movie many times, and it still gives me chills... Kevin Pollack is, as always funny, and Demi has big breasts, so the film would sell. But Tom really showed his true colors in this film, and made me actually respect him as an actor! I may actually respect his talent from now on..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scenery-chewing 101","review":"The more I see of Tom Cruise, the more I realize he's one of the weakest actors getting top-quality roles these days, and every movie he's been in since The Firm (and most all of them before that-- there can never be an excuse for Top Gun, unless it's Hot Shots) would have been inestimably better with anyone but Tom Cruise in the starring role. Case in point: A Few Good Men, with a bunch of excellent performances counterpointed with Cruise and Jack Nicholson engaged in scenery-chewing contests throughout the movie. That aside, everyone else in this film from Cuba Gooding Jr. and Demi Moore to the woefully-underrated James Marshall worked miracles with a kludgy script and uninteresting direction work from Rob Reiner, who should stick to the mindless comedies we expect from him."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Few Good Men","review":"There was no notation on the listing of the movie prior to me purchasing the video that it would not work on this side of the country.

Unfortunately, the movie is useless to us and to send it back is too much of a hassel to deal with. In all of the years that we have purchased any movies through Amazon, this has been the only time that we have experience this problem.

I recently saw the stage play. So I wanted to re-watch.First the soundtrack has to be the WORST soundtrack of all time. This was a stupid soundtrack that provided breaks for commercials.Second, the actors clearly know nothing of the military. But the fault does not end with them. I think the screenplay sucked in its very nature. Where I thought Sorkin did a good job, after time, the movie is at best campy portrayal of the men in uniform. As someone who served on a wall waiting for an enemy in (West) Germany, I am offended by the movie. I am glad for the Demi Moore line of giving thanks to those who protect freedoms.I think the actors did the best with what they were given.Third, the movie is flat. Once you know crescendo line, the movie falls. The script just has luck involved.Not really a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"You are entitled to your opinion, even when you are wrong.","review":"Those are the words of my 8th grade history teacher and they fit this movie. This movie would have been rivetting if Marines were all skinheaded morons and all officers were arrogant and vicious.Sadly for Sorkin (whose hatred of reality is apparent every time he picks up a pen) and Reiner (I agree with Archie, he is a meathead) Marines aren't like that. For someone who has served, this movie was just sad. I didn't find enough legitimate reality in this movie to make me angry. I just sat and sighed. Except, of course, for the colonel, with whom I heartily agreed at pretty much every turn.I won't bother with descriptions of things that I saw or \\"how it really is\\". This movie is psychological drama for psych majors and bleary-eyed pacifist ninnies.

Great story from the orginal play by Aaron Sorkin. The film makes no pretense from the start, and keeps you rivited through out. I think it was one of Tom Cruise's best performances along with Jack Nicholson's who was nominated as best supporting actor. It was also a pleasure to see a lot of then unknown actors receiving cameo roles in pleasing on screen performances, such as Noah Wiley, Cuba Gooding, and Arthur Senzy. Solid movie all around!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote the ending?","review":"This movie is pretty good until the end. The cast is excellent and Cruise and Nicholson bring a lot of charisma to the movie. But the idea that Jack Nicholson would admit that he ordered the code red is so far-fetched and absurd, this effectively destroys the movie. What the #$%$^$% were the screenwriters thinking? I'm shocked that no one in the writer's room spoke up (or maybe they did to no avail). The idea is that Cruise is such an outstanding lawyer that he gets Nicholson to essentially melt down. Puh-leeze. Surely, they could've come up with something more creative here."},{"rating":"2","title":"you gotta ask me nicely","review":"A few Good Men and a woman, that's right you have Jack Nicholson, Tom Cruise, Kevin bacon & Pollak,Kiefer Sutherland,Cuba and Demi Moore,a brilliant cast WOW!Jack is riveting,Tom shines the acting is outstanding,phonomenal you don't want to miss one second of this one.

The visit of undercover journalist Macaulay Connor (James Stewart) with secret admirer and photographer Elizabeth Imbrie (Ruth Hussey) wreck further havoc on matrimony preparations. While \\"Liz\\" tries to win Macaulay's heart he begins to fall for Tracy. As the wedding approaches it is not certain just who will walk down the aisle with Tracy.

I had to leave the room on that one. This film is nowhere near the lightheartedness of \\"Bringing Up Baby.\\" Yuck, yuck, yuck! Get drunk, argue, have an affair.

I normally get bored with black and white movies because I grew up in a world of color, but this movie is full of color. Katherine Hepburn is wonderful as Tracy a bride to be, but to which man in her life? This is one of the funniest movies of all time. My favorite part is the very first scene with Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn on the porch of the house. It is hilarious. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"PAGING W. C. FIELDS","review":"Of all the famous \\"oldies\\", this one holds up least well in my opinion. Evidently a real classic in pre World War 2, one would bet that 95% of today's viewers couldn't withstand the two hours of viewing time. Still seen occasionally on P.B.S., the movie simply has no action; only gab and an amusing off the cuff one-liner at times. Stewart won his only Oscar here, but it's obviously Grant who's the male lead,rescuing Stewart on at least one occasion from his usual bumbling. Multi Oscar winner Hepburn is reputed to have \\"jump started\\" her career here, but this reviewer fails to see it, prefering \\"The African Queen\\" a decade later, if at all. Again,we go back to an old theme, wondering why Jean Arthur, Claude Rains, or Grant never bagged a single Oscar amongst them.Meanwhile, the picture must have once meant something; it was re-made as \\"High Society\\" in the 1950's. But, Tom Hanks' \\"Philadephia\\", unthinkable in 1940, will now carry the cinematic banner for this city,perhaps forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a classic!","review":"The Philadelphia Story is pure garbage. People and critics have always raved about this movie so I decided to watch it and see for myself, to my utter disbelief this film is nonsense. The plot is childish and goes nowhere and the non-stop talking drove me insane 30 minutes in. Jeez Katharine Hepburn never shuts her big fat mouth, talk, talk, talk! James Stewart is pretty good but he didn't deserve the Oscar. This film is for whiny, spoiled upper-middle class nutcases! I hate it sorry but I can't pretend this is cinema art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not All It's Cracked Up to Be","review":"That's my main impression of \\"The Philadelphia Story\\", the movie that inspired \\"High Society\\", about a headstrong young heiress and her planned second marriage being complicated by a new suitor and an old ex-husband. I'd heard about this for years, and only ever seen that opening shot of Katharine Hepburn breaking Cary Grant's golf club. Gotta admit, it's a great shot--but it's the only good scene in the whole movie! Wow, did that ever surprise me. I thought Cary was doing a very bad job, almost like the \\"Wink Cary\\" I described in my review of \\"That Touch of Mink\\", serious autopilot. Slow-moving movie about a lot of people who think they're clever."},{"rating":"2","title":"My She Was Yar","review":"Originally a broadway play, this film is one of my favorites. Hepburn, Grant, and Stewart are powerful triumvirate in this romantic comedy. Hepburn plays the emotionally stunted socialite while Grant is effortless in his portrayal of the easy going playboy and it's topped off with Stewart as the witty, sarcastic writer. The plot and the actors work in tandem to make this one of the most memorable films in my collection. If you want a feel-good movie then look no further than this one. There are a few bumps along the way, but what film would be complete with them?"},{"rating":"2","title":"My, she was yar...","review":"They make few movies of the level of quality as \\"The Philadelphia Story.\\" This movie is just full of life, good and bad. Cary Grant, James Stewart and Katharine Hepburn are a trifecta of astounding talent, and they blend together with ease and style. Like real people, everyone has their faults and their strengths. Everyone is right and wrong at the same time, in their own way.The dialog is so amazing, you want to quote it at every opportunity, although your life probably doesn't provide the opportunity to drop these kinds of quotes. The \\"High Society\\" at play, and the lowbrow crashers making their nickels and dimes all the while allowing their pretensions to art...this is great drama.The DVD is not particularly exciting, and is a surprising let down for such an amazing film, however a film this great doesn't need extras. The main course is filling enough.Definitely something you will watch over and over again. One of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Leading Lady","review":"This movie is all about Kathern Hepburn. She carries the movie from beginning to end with her endearing charm and wit. She is so much fun to watch and never disappoints. You can see why she was such a big star. Of course the movie wouldn't be what it was without its leading men. Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart play opposite her with such ease, charm, and sex appeal and the result is a highly entertaining film that is fun to watch all the way through.

Simply every performance is flawless and every character has such a charisma! Of course we are talking about 3 actors who are virtually unparrelled in the art of charisma - Cary Grant, Katherine Hepburn, and Jimmy Stewart. The first time I saw this film I was blown away by the fast-paced dialogue that is so witty and sarcastic that it rivals anything writers have even attempted today. The thing I liked most about the film was that the romance between Hepburn and Stewart seemed totally real, the look that Stewart gives Hepburn when they're in the library she's telling him about his book is simply genious! Undeniably one of the greatest movies to ever grace the screen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets better with repeated viewing","review":"I watch this and enjoy it more now watching the interaction between Stewart and Grant. THe dialogue is brilliant - some lines rival Shakespeare, Hepburn is at her best, the jokes are fast and furious like \\"Hellzapoppin,\\" the supporting cast is superb, as are the clothes and decorating. Some gems \\"There are rules\\" - Stewart the gentleman, Hepburn's interaction with Stewart and his girlfriend, How tender everyone is with each other, the Quaker librarian, the scandal with the father and how they handle it.. the double meanings to almost every phrase. You get more each time you watch it - clearly the actors relished working with each other.

I doubt this is deliberate. It looks to this reader that the publishers have cut out a lot of what made this book make any sense.

I'm not going to read through yet another rape, yet another child eating, yet another set of torment/torture, yet another scene of how rotten Stephen Baxter thinks mankind (and all it's various ancestral lines) is. Also, I'm tired of reading through all that stuff without any progress in the plot. Basically, I'm 74% of the way through the book, and nothing's happened to 1) re-unite the main man with the main woman, or 2) tell us who, why, or how the moon is flying through the multiverse picking up and dumping off hominids.

However it was such that I did not even bother to finish the book. Not only did the jumpiness of what existed of the plot make it difficult to read, many parts of it were just ugly - with what seemed to be no purpose.Some books may have unpleasant components in the reading, that serve a purpose to support the plot, as in The Sparrow and Children of God, where ideas served a purpose. I could not find a purpose here.Ok, so life on the red moon may be ugly... however I would have preferred to have had a foundation or reason for reading that ugliness.With over 1000 books in my collection this is not one I would recommend.John"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass...","review":"I loved many of Baxter's other books.

If she wrote on cereal boxes, I would read those as well. Angels Fall, while good, is a little slower to start than others of Roberts' books. The author takes a good bit of time to develop her characters and to make the fear credible. But that sometimes gets in the way of the pace of the story. By the time this book was over, the suspense had picked up, as had the pace. And the ending was certainly satisfying. Angels Fall is worth persevering through the slow beginning. Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back on her game","review":"A lot of writer's seem to hit a point, after they've written a number of books where they're plots become formulaic, predictable and boring. Nora Roberts (in my opinion) is one of the best at avoiding this, though the occasional book shows signs of it.Angels Fall had more of a fresh feel to it, with an on-the-edge heroine and a bit of a maverick for the male lead. The characters were nicely fleshed out and you're sympathetic enough that this becomes a can't-put-it-down book.

The man is always handsome in a rugged sort of way, the woman is always beautiful, but maybe a bit thin.

I liked how he believed in Reece when nobody else did, when everyone thought she was crazy and I liked even more how he handled her, how he treated her, how he talked to her with that subtle, cocky way of his that kept her on even keel. What I didn't care for, and what I've noticed in other Roberts books with small town settings, was that nobody can seem to speak in complete sentences. What is up with that?

I could tell instantly there was going to be so many bright colors in the objects and surroundings of the storyline. Nora Roberts always seems to detail her stories with tons of rivetting color. The beginning of the book almost reminded me of the other nature-tastic book she wrote, Rivers End.The plot is poor I found as I continued reading. The fear and mystery is poor. The romance is debateable. The only thing that seems real are the feelings of paranoia the main character deals with, and the wanting to escape. She wants to get away. Keep moving and get away from the past.I think the novel could have been better had Nora added some elements of deeper relationships instead of moving the plot around so much. It seemed confusing, and eventually uninteresting. Sadly, I will be getting rid of this one. It is not worth holding onto for my keeper shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read!","review":"A new found favorite author for me. I absolutely loved this book, and Black Hills (which I read just after), and I am looking forward to downloading my next Nora Roberts novel!Her stories are interesting and intreguing, keeping you turning the pages with anticipation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book, but not up to \\"Nora's\\" standards","review":"I Liked the book. As always with Nora Roberts it was a good read. However, I found myself thinking that she's written much better. The storyline seemed familiar and a little slow. My main complaint is the abrupt ending. Very abrupt. The entire book was \\"concluded\\" in a page and a half and seemed like someone just said.. \\"okay, we've reached our page/word limit.. the book ends NOW!!.. I remain an avid Roberts fan, this book didn't change that, I guess I expected more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am very disappointed in this book. There is no soul in the characters, plot and location. It was flat. I expected something better from Nora Roberts than this boring, flat storyline. In fact, I would give this book 1/2 star it was so boring. The next time, I will not be racing out to buy a new Nora Roberts hard cover book. This book is as flat and boring as Blue Smoke was. Save your money and wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost in Wyoming","review":"If your going to write about a location you need to do more than look at a map or hit the tourist spots. ANGEL FALLS adds a valley to the Tetons (they could probably use the room) but just misses on capturing the feeling of the place although she is right about the beauty of the mountains and the power of the sky. Her locals are just a bit generic and not as developed as in earlier books. And we never, never, NEVER say U of W.Nitpicking aside it is her usual good work but just misses being top of the line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't tell anyone I read a romance Novel","review":"This is another book recommended by a female co-worker. She thought of this book for me because it is set in Wyoming near Jackson and she knows one of my brothers lives there. It was a long book, but read quicker than I thought it would. I liked how the author gives great detail about one or two items, but doesn't cover everything in that same detail. Having been to this part of Wyoming, I loved the setting and the small town factors. Good character development and very suspenseful. Love scenes were at the right level for me. This was my first Nora Roberts book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who thought this would make a good movie?","review":"I never saw the movie but I did have the misfortune to read this book. It was a Christmas present so I felt obliged to finish it. I've read romance novels for years, this is the only Nora Roberts book that I have hated. The main characters are annoying and their interest in each other is unbelievable. There is was no excitement between them and by the end of the book I was hoping the killer would whack Reece to put her out of her misery. Usually Nora's secondary characters are interesting enough to want to keep reading...but not this time, except maybe the killer. However, even after the killer's motive is revealed it is so lame the book was still boring. Don't even waste your money on a used copy. Try a Judith McNaught book if you want a good romance. Now I know why they are putting author blogs with their books, so you will get distracted and not read the reviews of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"a real snoozer","review":"The first Nora Roberts novel I read was Northern Lights, and I was pleasantly surprised by the strong sense of locale, interesting and believable characters, and a well-crafted and exciting plot. Angels Fall sounded like it would follow in the same genre, but it is more a gushy romance novel than a thriller. This time the hick town location is cliched and dull, as are the characters (especially the heroine). I started this book on a ten-hour plane trip, and put it down after a couple hours. A month later I'm still only half way through it; in the last ten chapters not much has happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"1st 5 star","review":"\\"Angels Fall\\" was my first Fiction read by Nora Roberts. I would call it captivating; I couldn't put it down. I was able to watch the movie as well and felt that it was a great performance all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great story from Roberts.","review":"I'm enjoying this book. The character is so close to me with her fears, anxiety and panic attacks after a devistating experience Running away from her problems leads her to a small town where she goes to work as a cook and meets a novelist who helps her and falls in love with her. Witnessing a murder brings the two of them together while she tries to prove she really did see a man kill a woman while hiking up a mountain trail. It's a exciting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quintessential Roberts","review":"Nora Roberts delivers another entertaining novel of romantic suspense. Reece Gilmore is traveling across the country trying to escape her past trauma and maybe build a new life. When her car breaks down in Angel's Fist, Wyoming she decides to stay for a while. Soon, she becomes the only witness to a murder. With local resident and writer of mystery novels, Brody, she tries to solve the case. The murderer makes it more difficult by taking advantage of her past trauma, trying to make her think she's crazy. Suspicion is cast on several local residents, and the murderer must be one of them.This is definitely a summer book. The plot isn't too complicated, the characters are likable and it's a quick read. Roberts isn't a literary genius, but she's not writing dreck, either. I particularly enjoyed the setting of rural Wyoming. It seemed an idyllic place to settle down and build a life, with stunning landscapes and townspeople you feel like you're already friends with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat","review":"I couldn't get past page 60. This book could've been suspenseful. It should've begun on the day that her happy culinary career was shattered by an armed robbery. For additional drama we could have been with the heroine when she decides to chuck her past life and take off across country in her old car. Instead the book begins when she has been drifting around for quite some time and her car breaks down at Angels Fist. We are shown how paranoid and jittery she is- which is more irritating than anything. The dramatic events that made her this way are related in an offhand background narrative. The story is too flat without hooks to pull in the reader. This is the first Nora Roberts book I've read and it may be the last. I like more suspense in my suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good book","review":"I really enjoyed reading Angels Fall. It kept me guessing till the very end. I would recommend this book to friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry","review":"bram stoker is most famous for dracula. not hard to believe. some of the stories here have even a dull plot. but mostly the problem is that stoker dwells at completely irrelevant things, like melodramatic dialogues going on and on, the building of friendship, etc. he could have done better, he is a good enough writer. but he has a melodramatic string, which destroys. the judge's house is the only story really worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It for Cold Coffee","review":"This coffee maker only makes decent \\"To Go\\" coffee. For home use, its not practical. You might as well get a regular coffee maker and pour what you want into a travel mug. The coffee is never quite hot enough and makes bland coffee. I've tried it with several types of coffee grind and still same blandness. It might be due to the amount of coffee grind you put into the machine since its only for brewing 1-2 servings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smelly Coffee!!","review":"I bought this unit as a Christmas present and have been using it since 12-30-2005. Followed the manufacturer's recommend. on first time cleaning/etc. First cup of brewed coffee tasted and smelled like plastic ;-( Cleaned unit again with white vinegar and smell lessened a bit. Coninued to use unit with hopes that smell would go away completely but just the other day it came back worse! Wrote Hamilton Beach to see what they can do for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shouldn't be this hard to brew coffee!","review":"I bought this coffee maker for my newly retired father, thinking he could enjoy his morning coffee all morning. He's an expert with all things electronic, so when he told me he was having problems with the coffee coming out all over the counter, I knew I'd be returning this item. I did a ton of research, trying to find a thermal coffee maker that works properly...this one got the best ratings. My father tried to use this machine for at least a week, and no matter what he did, the coffee went all over the counter. He's a smart guy, so \\"operator error\\" wasn't the problem.Suggestion: Make it easy on yourself, buy a Black & Decker coffee maker with a regular pot, and buy a nice thermal carafe to pour it in when it's done brewing. It's an extra step, but much less complicated. Hope this helps someone."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE taste!!!","review":"We were so excited to get this coffee maker. The whole concept with the to go mugs thrilled us. We got home, cleaned it out and started brewing and WHOA! Talk about horrible...it tasted bitter, rancid, undrinkable. We thought maybe it was the coffee so we bought more..twice we bought more and the same bad taste.Finally went online to see tons of people had the same problem. Something with the rubber tubing inside. When you open up the compartment where you put the water and smell down inside it you can smell the bad taste that is brewed into your coffee.Needless to say it went back to the store. So disapointed...it really was what we wanted but it didn't work out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good coffee maker","review":"I just received this a few weeks back and am very pleased. The coffee maker is well rated in Consumer Reports and is a reasonable price. The carafe is excellent - I made a pot of coffe one day, had a cup and then forgot about the rest of the pot - 24 hours later, the leftover coffee was still warm. My only complaint is that the carafe is for 8 cups, so if two of us are having coffee at the same time, I sometimes have to make two pots. Still, I would rather have to make two pots of coffee than have coffee sit on a burner for hours at a time. Also, the travel mugs are cool, you can brew the coffee directly into one or two - but they're not sealable and must be kept upright while travelling. But, on the whole, I really like this coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Good .... and that's about it.","review":"1. Coffee does not stay hot for very long ... 2 hours tops ...stays warm for a while!2. Glass lined Thermal Carafe .... exploded after 1 month.3.

Have to look into the reservior from above (wife is too short ... always miss measures!).ONLY positive .... makes good tasting coffee ... but how hard is that!That's about enough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it!","review":"Great coffee maker. The coffee is VERY hot, hotter than other coffee makers I have had. I don't find that I need to fill the carafe with hot water first as the instructions recommend. After the first pot the plastic/rubber taste others have noted dissappeared and now the coffee tastes great. My only issue is the design of the to go cups is not the best. The wide lip at the top is a bit unusual and a bit difficult to drink from but not overly difficult. All in all I really like the coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely junk after 10 months & bad customer service to boot!","review":"We received this \\"lemon\\" of a coffee maker as a Christmas gift last year. It leaks all over the place, the lines clog up very easily and, after 10 months, the timer unit has filled with condensation so that the automatic funtion does not work at all. When I called their customer service, they wouldn't honor the warranty because we don't have a receipt (it was a Christmas Gift!) even though they can tell from the manufacture date that it went into the stores as Christmas merchandise. Their response is that we drive it to their service center an hour away or we can send it to them to be looked at-which will take at least 6-8 weeks. What horrible customer service and a coffee maker of this price point should certainly last more than ten months!Bottom line: this product is junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous Product","review":"I've had two Hamilton Beach products. The first was Brew Master, which we wanted because the coffee is dispensed through a coffee carafe at the top of the machine. However, the carafe is plastic with seams and after 4 months began to leak all over the counter. Hamilton Beach replaced the carafe, but the new one leaked again after 4 months. We then demanded a Stay or Go Thermal Coffeemaker. I had it for two or three weeks and then as I was washing it out with hot water and a bottle sponge, the glass vacuum liner blew up with a bang! Glass shards scattered all over the sink and kitchen floor. I was lucky not to have gotten shards in my eyes. Please look out for this one! I'm only buying stainless steel carafes from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible taste","review":"After following the manufacturer's directions for cleaning as well as using a generic cleaning solution, the coffee STILL has a plastic rubbery taste.

I suspect I may have fastened the carafe's top on too tightly - or maybe didn't place it quite perfectly dead-center.making coffee with this device is a highly involved process - if you fail to perform your assigned tasks adequately - you will be punished.other times something seems to jam and the coffee never makes it out of the filter.the included mugs are difficult to drink from - it takes practice not too spill all over yourself.as others have mentioned - the coffee doesn't taste right to me. it seems kind of burnt - but I suspect this is the same plastic / rubber flavor others have reported.its back to the store - if I can find my receipt that is..."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good buy","review":"I bought this coffee maker for the thermal carafe and the two mugs. I didn't do enough reading about it, and I now regret that. I have washed the mugs several times, SOAKED them in vinegar, and they STILL taste horrible! The coffee does taste fine to me in any other mugs I own(I filter all my water so I didn't use their filter).I was a bit skeptical when I went to brew a single cup of coffee, and I put the mug under the filter basket. First, I thought the coffee would certainly come out of the filter basket and miss the mug entirely. It did not however, but that is when I realized that you cannot remove the carafe while the coffee is brewing to pour a cup, there is not stopper and it will keep on dripping out of the machine onto your counter.Do yourself a favor and pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The designer of the pot itself - needs to be fired.","review":"I can't believe this would pass R&D.; If I could give it a 0 star rating - I would.EVERY time you pour a cup of coffee, (no matter how hard you try) coffee drips down the front of the pot and all over what ever you are pouring over.You seriously have to pour your coffee over the sink everytime you pour a cup.Horrible, horrible design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk not worth buying","review":"I'll make this brief...first time washing the travel mugs, the cups separated into two pieces. The Carafe as others ave mentioned drips, which is so bad you have to pour over the sink to catch the mess. Now after a month of use, the display is failing. Life is too short to put up with an annoying machine like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"What, no pause and serve?","review":"Pros: The coffee comes out hot and keeps the coffee hot for a few hours.Cons: Unfortunately, I have alot of these.- The travel mug lids are very poorly designed- They're just plain awkward for drinking out of and could very likely end up on my clothes.- The inside of the pot shattered one morning - It's a thermos type carafe with glass. I don't really know why it happened but the coffee had been sitting for about 15 minutes after brewing and it just exploded inside. The internal container is not encased so the coffee came right through all over the kitchen counter before I made it out to see what exploded in the kitchen.- The bigger problem is that there is no pause and serve. When I bought it I didn't check that it had the feature because I can't even imagine that a coffee maker would be made without PAUSE AND SERVE. I wanted to return upon purchase but because it had good reviews (I think in consumer reports) I decided to give it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cumbersome","review":"Caraffe is big and unweildy.

Really liked the way it looked on the counter, but good looks don't carry the coffee drinking experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: carafe is very temperature sensitive!!","review":"My husband and I bought this coffee maker because we had recently broken 4 glass coffee carafes while washing them--by accidentally banging them into the faucet or the side of the sink. So when we saw the stainless steel carafe we thought we were set--this would be the last coffee maker we would have to buy. Little did we know that inside the stainless steel outer layer of the carafe is a very thin glass container (it looks like metal when you look inside the carafe--but trust me--it is glass). Since the glass liner of the carafe is very thin it is also very sensitive to heat changes, so when we rinsed it out after brewing coffee (I guess the water was too cool and the pot was too hot) the inside of the carafe exploded. At least the coffee maker came with 2 mugs that it can brew into, so it is not totally useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK!","review":"This makes the worst tasting coffee I've ever had. As mentioned in another review, the coffee tastes like burnt rubber - and funny enough, if you look inside the reservoir, you will see that the intake hose is made out of pink raw rubber! The inside of the resevoir smells very strongly of raw rubber as well. And that is the taste that goes into the coffee - YUCK!!!! We are returning ours today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hamilton Beach Thermal Carafe coffee tastes bad","review":"I recently purchased a Hamilton Beach Thermal Carafe coffee maker. The coffee has a chemical aftertaste-it tastes like new plastic. In addition, the coffee is very weak- as it brews, it pours through the filter at one speed (rapid). I have seen other models make stronger coffee with a setting- made by the user - to control the rate of water flow through the filter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good coffee, but poor durability","review":"My boyfriend gave this to me as a birthday gift just over 2 years ago - October, 2003. I liked the simplicity, I liked the coffee (the initial plastic smell dissipated quickly), I liked the carafe. I don't use it heavily - just once a day (at most), and I only make a 3-\\"cup\\" pot. Nevertheless, two weeks ago I started noticing a strong bubbling noise during the brew cycle, and my pots were coming up short. It appears the pump is no longer working well, probably due to a broken seal somewhere. But the result is that much of the water ends up boiling away, so my 3-\\"cup\\" pot is now only 2-\\"cups\\".Considering that this wasn't exactly an inexpensive product, I would've expected more than 2 years of use. Its predecessor-but-one (a misbegotten grind-n-brew experiment notwithstanding) lasted me 10 years. Not acceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design and clumsy","review":"I was excited to purchase this since the concept seemed great. But when I actually tried using it, I noticed that the heating element didn't shut off when the water was gone, and even after running through a couple of cycles to clean it out good, my coffee still tasted like plastic. It's hard to see the markings in the water reservoir when you are filling it, and I found the carafe lid to be clumsy. The last few ounces in the pot were very difficult to pour. I did like that the carafe was glass-lined, but alas, by the time the coffee got to the pot, it already tasted like plastic.Also, it was annoying that to start brewing you always have to depress the brew button twice (where once puts you into automatic brew mode)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hamilton Beach Stay or Go Coffee Maker with Thermal Carafe and Two Travel Mugs","review":"Would not advise purchase of this product.

I did send Coffee Maker just before Labor Day Holiday, have not been contacted or received serviced/replacement yet. Although Hamilton Beach assured me a Coffee Maker that brewed \\"HOT\\" Coffee would be mailed back within 24 to 36 hours, I have not yet received a serviced/replacement Coffee Maker.

But this machine has drawbacks that has made it more of a disappointment than a boon to us:1) The clock isn't backlit.2) The carafe doesn't hold very much coffee. The carafe's bulk is misleading.3) The darn thing drips for several minutes after it has stopped percolating.4) Pouring coffee out of it is a challenge, especially if you're getting near the bottom of the carafe.5) The coffee doesn't stay warm for long, even with the extra-bulky carafe.It is not worth the money we spent. Looks good on the counter, though.It's inevitable that we have to sop up coffee from somewhere every time we use it. Frankly, I want to drink it, not have it end up in a kitchen rag.Recommendation: Buy a Mr. Coffee and a good Thermos carafe (we got ours at a thrift shop for a quarter; it keeps coffee hot for 24 hours!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice Coffee Maker","review":"We use the travel mugs every morning as we head to work.

Third, the coffee never tastes good. It always has a bitter quality to it. The water runs in too fast I think. I called Hamilton Beach because all it did was steam one month after I bought it. They sent me a chemical to run through it; said it was probably clogged. This BTW was even after I ran the vinegar treatment through it 3 times in the first month.

This gives you a great look when lifting, makes me look a lot more muscular which gives me the drive to keep going.The only reason it got 4/5 Stars and not 5 is because when washed it is extremely prone to fuzz balls and static charge, you almost have to pry the T-shirt apart from itself.

But, even worse are the straps! the lower strap cannot be removed and since it's in the lap area gets FILTHY. there is virtually no way to clean it. the upper straps can be removed if you have a ton of time and patience. Overall, not a great design for something that gets used so often in such a messy context!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it & so does Molly","review":"We have had this chair for almost three years now and I still love it. The CLOTH seat washes great. I love that you can take the tray on and off with one hand. The only thing I don't like is the straps. Kinda hard to get the pad on and off for cleaning. But my daughter LOVES this chair. We are going to buy another one for our son because Molly doesn't want to give it up just yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"impossible to keep clean","review":"This highchair has great features BUT it has a fluffy cloth seat! The seat has become an absolute nightmare to clean with all the crevices and has to be put in the washer almost every day. Give your baby one piece of toast and it disgusting! It isn't supposed to go in the dryer so you can't use the highchair whilte it is airdrying. Very poor design. If the chair pad was different I probably would recommend it.Another consideration is Baby Trend is not customer friendly. I looked on their website for a vinyl chairpad and found none. I call the 800 number and they say I have to go on the website to print out a form and email them in order to order it. Over 2 weeks and still haven't received it.I also agreed the tray is too high."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tray too high","review":"I registered for this because of the great reviews both here and in the baby bargains book, but my daughter barely cleared the tray while sitting in the seat- so I had to use an inexpensive booster seat. She is now one, and still, the tray is very high for her and she is constantly needing a boost up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filthy Dirty Mess","review":"Based on so many positive reviews, we purchased this chair. While there are some positives, I found that it was very difficult to keep clean. The pad -- which can't be put in the dryer) never dried out over night after washing. I ended up taking the pad off -- huge mistake! While it was easier to clean up the vinyl, food would get caught under the vinyl pad, sticking to the adhesive. Also, the pad slid and changed positions, never to return to the correct place. There are plenty of crevices for food to get stuck in. The straps were disgusting. My chair ended up smelling mildewy. Save yourself the trouble -- buy a molded plastic high chair (who needs to recline the baby in a high chair after eating anyway?)for the first few months, then move on to a booster chair. Life is much much nicer with the booster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pros and Cons","review":"We registered for this chair because it seemed to have great features. We like the looks, the removable tray insert, the wheels and the reclining seat.However, there are a couple of big negatives. The tray comes up too high. Also, the way the seat is designed, it allows and even encourages slouching! It also does not bring my son close enough to the tray. I would not recommend this seat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't ignore the bad reviews!","review":"I read the reviews for this high chair and thought the positive comments far outweighed the negative ones, so I bought it. Big mistake! For me the cons far outweigh the pros of this chair. My biggest annoyance, now that my daughter is feeding herself, is that the chair cover is hard to clean. After several washings the cover looks very faded. If you have a messy eater then this chair isn't for you.Pros-tray easy to remove-folds up easily-reversible chair cover-reclines and height adjustCons-cover hard to keep clean-tray doesn't fit in dishwasher-tray too high- doesn't work with our table (high chair has to be adjusted so low that my daughter's eyes are level with the table)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jp's mom in Jacksonville, Fl","review":"I am a new mom. Everything on the market seems overwhelming and the best information you can get is from reviews. Sometimes it gets confusing because the product has extreme reviews from good to bad. I would recommend this highchair because it has proven to be durable. I washed the cover on gentle cycle, placed it flat to dry and was pleased with the results. A bonus feature of this chair is the many reclining features and the ease of use. It's portable with a nice fabric design and priced right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Chair","review":"We have this chair in another pattern but we love it! We started putting our son in it when he was about 3 mos. old - I tilted the seat all the way back and could roll him from room to room with me. Even now, at 10 mos., when he's not feeling great, I put him in the chair and recline it so he can relax while I clean up. It was very easy to put together and I love that it folds up out of the way. Now that our son is eating cereal, etc., we just roll it right up to the table so he can join the family dinner. There are a lot of cracks and crevasses that stuff gets stuck in but it cleans up easily enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't buy this again","review":"I agree with alot of the reviews- the seat bunches up after one wash (and hung dry). It's so frustrating. The stitching has also started coming undone after maybe 5 washes. I emailed the company who said they would send me a replacement \\"this time\\" (like it was my fault it's bunching up). When I asked about how to prevent this, the customer service rep said to not put it in the washing machine. My daughter can cover the seat with baby food in one sitting. I bought it specifically so I could put it in the washing machine. I am very disappointed in this highchair. I would definitely NOT recommend this chair for anybody who wants to wash the cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Design","review":"This high chair is easy to clean (no nooks & crannies for food to hide in) and it stores better than any other high chair we have seen. It is designed to fold up in such a way that it will stand on it's own when folded up and is narrow enough to tuck into a good storage spot, like a closet, without taking up much room. The various positions for siting up/reclining are excellent for infants up. We have been placing our baby in it since she was three weeks old to include her at the dinner table if she was awake during meal time.The seat belts at first seemed tedious to me, the shoulder belts fasten into the lap belt seperately and I wondered why so many parts to connect, until I realized it was so you can eliminate the shoulder belts for an older baby/toddler who can sit up just fine on their own. Knowing this, that makes sense and actually is a good feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best chair out there","review":"I cannot say enough about this chair, it is very easy to use and is reasonably priced. I thought that $90 was steep, but then I heard about the experiences my friends were having with the cheaper high chairs and it was well worth the money. So, to my fellow tight-wads out there, save yourself the hassle and spend the money on this chair, you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Below Average","review":"I agree with all the comments about the chair tilting, lack of customer service and the chair pad wadding up. Our chair leans to one side but we can't figure out how to fix it (assuming it's fixable). Also, I have tried to order a replacement cushion through Babytrend. Their website shows most of the seat covers as out of stock except 2, one vinyl and one cloth. When I tried to buy the only cloth one, nothing would add to my cart. So, I called them and was told that they were out of stock and I could try back in a month or two! Huh???? How is any reputable business out of stock for that long? And what am I supposed to do until then? All in all, this chair is not worth it -- I'll buy a new chair and tell everyone I know about my experience. There are too many other goods ones out there to choose from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great comfy highchair but not practicle for messy baby","review":"After reading all the reviews, I immediately put this highchair on my baby registry. It looks great, has all the wonderful features everyone says and is very comfortable. The tray and the cloth padding are easy to wash BUT not the seatbelt. The safety bar that goes between the legs can't be removed easily. When my baby got older, she got messier and there was always food stuck on the belts or in the creases. When she was 15 months old, we bought a plastic one for under $18. I wash that all the time. I will get another plastic one for my second baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Safety Issue","review":"The manufacture's site states that the tray can be removed so that the chair can be pushed up to a dining room table. My wife and I tried this configuration this evening. Within 5 minutes, my seven month old daughter had managed to get her arm wedged in the two inch gap between the plastic arms where the tray attaches to the chair and the legs of the chair. Had she jerked or twisted the wrong way, we would have been in the emergency room this evening.My wife spent over 40 minutes on the phone with manufacture describing the problem and requesting a warning be offered about using the high chair without the tray. The response was to roll up towels and place them in the gap. It seemed that this was a rehearsed response and the manufacture indeed knows about the problem. Where is the warning?"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT HIGH CHAIR","review":"MY BABY GIRL IS DUE SOON, SO I WENT TO THE BABIES R US LOOKING FOR A HIGH CHAIR TO PUT ON MY REGISTRY.

Even though our kids are tall for their age - very tall - they sat so low that the tray was up to their armpits. It's easy to clean and store, and quite sturdy, but useless given the fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Graco Contempo","review":"I'm disappointed in this chair because I think Baby Trend usually makes good products. While it is easy to use, it seems geared toward bigger kids. My 10-month old always falls to the side of the chair and the tray is too high on her chest (she's average height and has been sitting up for months).I have been able to get food stains out of the fabric by washing the entire cover on Delicate cycle and then air-drying. However, the cushion on the bottom has bunched up inside the fabric and I have not been able to flatten it out.My nephew has a Graco Contempo, which my daughter has used, and I like it much better because she sits up higher and the tray comes right to her at the appropriate height. When my daughter is done with this chair, I think I'll sell it in a garage sale and get a Graco for the next kid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think twice about this one!","review":"I got this as a shower gift, and also loved all its features. But after owning it for almost a year now and many many washes the padding fell apart, and the batting fell out. Baby Trend was not all that plesent to deal with, and after waiting almost 6 weeks for a replacement pad i was very upset to recieve it with the seams torn and the batting again coming out.All Baby Trend offered to do was to again replace the pad...but this should be recalled before someones child chokes on it loose materials."},{"rating":"1","title":"hate this chair!","review":"I cannot stand this highchair!

I went with another one after using this one for 6 months!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Customer Service Experience","review":"For the most part my wife and I are pleased with our high chair. The big exception has to do with the reclining option. Our chair has always had a problem with locking into a place. This presents a safety hazard if you think the chair is locked in the upright position and is not fully locked into place. My son, through normal movement, was able to jar the chair loose from the upright position and subsequently found himself in the fully reclined position. My wife tried to communicate with \\"Jeff\\" on numerous occasions with increasing frustration...\\"Jeff's\\" final communication was condescending and rude.I am glad to see others feeling our pain...even with the same customer service individual. Jeff's horrible customer service has motivated us to do whatever we can to spread the word. Hopefully, company reps will see their customer service person is hurting sales.

Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Imaginative and Stimulative Ideas","review":"The book has wonderful photography but the main beauty lies in the application of ideas. It invokes the imaginative side of cookery. After reading it, I am urged to explore cookery beyond culturally accepted norms. I feel that the whole basis is totally about the combination of western and eastern styles of cooking to produce a unique food that goes beyond traditional boundaries.

A plastic shower curtain would do as good a job. It's made in Vietnam, but I don't blame them, just an observation. It is just too expensive for something that a plastic curtain could do for 1/3 the price. Also it doesn't look like it will last very long.

While war hovers on the margins of the novel, no one is left unaffected by its horror. After a sometimes painfully slow setup of domestic life in the seaside town of Monkshaven in the first third of the book, the sense of doom grows increasingly palpable. Sylvia, the novel's heroine, is isolated by her supposedly protective domestic sphere, but Gaskell shatters the delicate domestic circle that surrounds her. While Sylvia is left to bear emotional scars, becoming an impassive, hardened woman, Charley Kinraid, her true love, returns from war a ghost, haunting the margins of Monkshaven to hide his terrible physical scars. The full realization of the blight on Sylvia's life comes when the novel spirals down to its inevitable conclusion, where even reconciliation and understanding brings a powerful sense of loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged.

I expected a little bit of an attack on the modern interpretation of christianity, but this book is much more neutral. It exposes many of the contradictions between many of the books of the bible as nothing more than natural variations on the same theme, in the same way that any folklore changes but retains its meaning. The most difficult argument posited is that oral folklore remains folklore when written. The idea is adequately argued, and the majority of the book goes on to give examples in the form of accounts of identical stories told in different ways throughout the bible.

If your trunk (or SUV rear area) has carpet, this will velcro into place, but it works fine without doing that. After around 5 or 6 years, the elastic that holds the collapsible bar in place got a bit loose, from using it so much, but 15 minutes with a needle and thread, to take up some slack in the elastic bands, fixed that.

I hate to say I have a favorite amongst all these but I would have to say that his latest release \\"Journey Inwards\\" just might be it for now. This cd combines smooth jazz with groovin beats which just sets a relaxing mood. This cd is the ultimate \\"chillin\\" cd. Favorite tracks include CD1 tracks 2 and 5 and CD2 tracks 1, 4, 5, and 6. If you are a fan of LTJ or enjoy smooth jazz then Journey Inwards is for you. Don't get me wrong, LTJ still does his DnB thing but the Jazz influences are much more evident then in his previous work.

Intricate and very well thought throughout. I've got everything i can get from him and he still hasn't let me down! I love the song \\"viewpoint\\" because it sounds so different with a violin, but it sound like it was meant to be. \\"Inner guidance\\", \\"Journey inwards\\", \\"our world\\" and \\"close to the source\\" are songs meant to be heard.

Not that the end result is not one of the finest recordings ever made, but a little consistancy of vision would have helped. Disc one is very mellow, very jazzy, with as much fusion flavor as drum'n'bass. Disc two is much more ambient and smooth. The production levels are pretty consistant, although I did find the transitions of some of the loops not quite up to snuff on some tracks. As long as LTJ Bukem remains on a more jazzier groove, the individual songs are fine; when he strays too far from fusion, and launches straight into his more ambient variety of D-n-B, the results, while initialy engaging, becomme a little tedious after the first three minutes.

It has some mention and coverage of non US/Brit/German engines (i.e. Russian), which is not something you see too much of else where.

Purchase you next kettle without the water level or any other penetration into the main body of the kettle. I have a stainless steel stove kettle that is 22 years old and still works without leaking. Unfortunately it takes some time to reach a boil(a major advantage of electric kettles). I am sure that an electric kettle could be made that does not leak.To Kettle Designers and Manufacturers: Read this review and create your kettle around real world conditions, be quality driven not price driven. Why have I owned several kettles, all of which have failed. Take pride in your products....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks after 1 year","review":"After reading the negative reviews, I should be happy that my kettle still works at least. Had it for over 1 year. Developed a slow leak. Choose another brand or model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous","review":"I used this at work (in the winter only maybe once or twice a day) for about 3-4 years and when it worked, it was good. But many times the contacts in the base that connect to the kettle to heat the water had to be pried up with a paper clip (while unplugged of course) as they were down too far for the kettle to make contact. Now today it stopped working again so I adjusted the contacts again and it wouldn't work... I finally decided to open the base (also, while unplugged)to see what was going on and found that one of the wires was completely broken and another one was corroded, there was a bit of melted plastic around the wires as well.This is dangerous and should not be used. There was absolutely no evidence that there was a problem with corrosion or split wires in the base until I took it apart, which most people won't do, so they will either think it just stopped working or it may start a fire or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for a while -- then leaks like a sieve","review":"This kettle seemed like a good deal and worked well at first. Heck, it still heats water like a champ. The problem is that it leaks like crazy and does it into the electric element underneath. I figure that can't be good! It is definitely messy. It seemed so solid too. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS KETTLE: no replacement parts if you fry the bottom part","review":"Bottom part got fried by my oven vent. I called the company and they have no replacement parts whatsoever for the kettle. So I have the expensive top part and they will not send me, even for some money, the bottom part. It's nothing but a $40 piece of landfill now! I CONSIDER NO REPLACEMENT PARTS TO BE REALLY REALLY BAD SERVICE AND A DISSERVICE TO OUR ENVIRONMENT.

Then for some reason it stopped working, so they shipped us a new one for a \\"mere\\" $20 to cover their shipping. Really, $20?? Then, that one lasted about one year before it stopped working in a very dangerous way. It would always trip the circuit breaker when it was turned on, so I'm guessing the thing overloads any circuit (no matter the breaker voltage--we tried several), and they wouldn't at that point honor our request for a replacement.

However, I've noticed that the water I boil in this kettle has a strange flavor. It tastes slightly sweet and it's strong enough to add noticeable flavor to the tea I drink. I'm certain that the water I use is not responsible for the flavor. I've put up with it for a while, but I'm getting concerned that whatever is causing this off-flavor may be toxic (not to mention that it affects the taste of whatever I use it for), so I'll be replacing the kettle shortly."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 of 4 have broken!","review":"I have purchased 4 of these kettles in the past 2 years. 3 have broken.

When it worked, it was great. But after a month, it started working intermittently, and now 2 months later, it won't work at all. Oh, and for $10, I can get a replacement kettle from Hamilton Beach. Ummm, no thanks guys. I'll put that $10 toward a more reputable brand when I buy a new one. Thanks for nothing, HB. Hope you guys choke on the $35 I spent on this.

I have now moved to a DeLonghi, and I'm surprised to find it also leaks. My first DeLonghi lasted five years and was still going strong but looked a little corroded, so I got a new one. I'm sorry I threw the old one out, because it looks like the new ones with the water level guages have seal problems and leak. If anyone knows of one that doesn't have this problem, I would sure like to know. This appliance is a necessity in our house. A whistling stove top tea kettle doesn't work for hearing-impaired people and we depend on the auto shut off feature for safety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Cuisinart instead","review":"I bought this as a replacement for a Cuisinart electric kettle because it was half the price, which was a serious mistake. It takes far longer to boil than the Cuisinart, and once it boils it just keeps boiling for several minutes, while the Cuisinart turns off right away. Skip this one notwithstanding the apparent bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Leaker","review":"I've owned three of these - two replaced on warranty. The warranty is a bit costly, but mostly I find it a pain to have to replace this thing every year or so because it leaks.

I am surprised to read so many bad reviews! That is a shame... We bought ours for under $28, and I guess if it lasts another year we won't be too dissipointed. I love the design, and being full stainless steel is important to us. I like that I can wrap the cord around the bottom to shorten the length. My biggest pet-peeve is the little black plastic marks it leaves on my counter, but they clean up easy...The next one we would buy would have to be insulated, but I will look for one with a similar design."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's perfect!","review":"What a great product.

I am a little disappointed that the grommets on the belt are already falling off, but perhaps that is because I had to cinch them down so tight. They kept us comfortable on our late spring ride through southern Idaho and Oregon. We are looking forward to getting lots of good use out of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sizing is inacurate","review":"Good quality and construction but the sizing is incorrect. You have to have chicken legs for these to fit. After not paying attention to the size chart on the mfg web site I ordered the wrong size. Normally you should order one size larger than your normal clothes, after all this is another layer you are putting on. The company is very easy to work with on size exchanges and offers a fast turn around. But even after exchanging for a pair 4 sizes larger than my normal clothes size they still do not fit. I like my normal clothes to fit loose so a couple sizes larger should be hanging off me but in order to get into these chaps i'm going to need some butter and forget about sitting down or bending my knees... then again if i can't get on my bike, i don't have to worry about protection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"Durable, comfortable and true to size;though waist a little high for me.I liked the product and bought a second for my wife."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE them!","review":"*Note: bought for and reviewed by my son*I love these chaps; they're very comfortable.

I am more careful now to make sure the lining is away from the zipper when I put them on now. They seem to cut down on the wind and cold when I am riding.

The plastic hose connector collar split, blowing the hose off the sprinkler before I could even get it to the grass. I was even using the quick connector that came with the sprinkler.

The adjustments weren't fine enough for me either.And it's not obvious how to adjust it. You raise and lower the red track, and the track *behind* the nozzle determines how far the water shoots in the opposite direction. The higher the track - the shorter the stream. Really *not* intuitive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea with a serious flaw","review":"I had high hopes for this sprinkler based on the reviews here, and it seemed great at first. The sprinkler is well designed, and the adjustable pattern really works well to fit any shaped yard. Unfortunately, the sprinkler has a serious flaw. Grass that is close to the sprinkler gets a much heavier amount of water than the grass on the perimeter. Using this sprinkler for several weeks in the hot summer left me with a circle of lush green lawn surrounded by brown and burned grass. I wouldn't recommend this sprinkler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Love this sprinkler - the customizing possiblities are perfect for us. We started over with our backyard (tore down garage, ripped out trees, built a deck and fence). We have three pine trees in a row, so we can't plant grass underneath (needles). This left us with a \\"C\\" shaped yard that needed steady watering since we planted seed for the new yard. On top of that, our outdoor water pressure is only strong enough for one sprinkler at a time - can't use a chain of sprinklers. This is the only thing that worked. We aren't watering the deck/house/neighbor's yard anymore. I love it. It took about 30 minutes to establish the pattern and I don't move it so the timer just goes off 3/day and the yard is basically maintenance free. The new grass looks great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very fine adjustable sprinkler","review":"I bought this item based on the existing reviews here. So far, it is performing excellently. It is indeed very easy to adjust the circle pattern to fit one's yard shape. For me, I have a very large yard: the water pressure allows me to use only one sprinkler at a time and I had to move my original sprinkler about 3-4 times over a week in order to keep the lawn watered. This one does the same job over the course of a couple of evenings, so it is definitely a work horse. The sprinkler base is stable and the sprinkler head so far has worked perfectly. I had a lot of problems with previous sprinklers falling apart within a month or less. This is a fine sprinkler for any gardener, durable and reliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great performance but..............","review":"This sprinkler does all that it states it is supposed to do.

The spoon was no longer free and I have a pizza cutter for a pan that I don't have. I am billed over $25 for spoon I would not have ordered separately and a pizza cutter that I don't really need.

Quick & Easy Flying Origami is quite contrary to the title. The instructions are difficult to follow so there is nothing quick and easy about the book. To make any of the airplanes in the book fly, Mr. Nakamura needs to have a few lessons in engineering and avionics because many of the models in the book do not fly. I spent a lot of money on this and it is impossible to use. If you are interested in paper airplanes, I suggest designing your own. Yours will probably be easier to make and will to-say-the-least, fly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This is a great collection of original paper airplanes some of these are classic designs but some of them you will not find anywhere else. There is not much text to guide you through the models but the diagrams are very clear so anybody should be able to make all of these models.I notice that in another review this only recieved 2 stars the reason for this must be that they have never seen a paper airplane book before as this book uses standard origami symbols.Fantasic I can't recomend this enough.*****"},{"rating":"1","title":"Smaller but weaker","review":"We've had a model KX-TG2216FV for years and loved it, but I thought a smaller unit would be easier for the living room so tried this one. Plus, the blinking antenna to indicate voice mail sounded like a nice feature.That feature, however, isn't turned on by default. Neither are several others. Unlike other phones, cameras, MP3 players, and many other devices, you'll probably want to actually use the manual and consider each setting, as the menu defaults are in some instances odd.The sound quality is initially what you would (and we did) expect from a Panasonic, but the battery drain is poor and the volume drops off in long calls (within ten minutes). And while we've had no problems with DSL, as reported by another reviewer, we do agree with the concerns raised about keypad lighting.On balance, I'd recommend the KX-TG2216FV instead. This one isn't that much smaller, and the weaker features make it a weaker choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Recption","review":"The phone has many features but experiences a variety of distortion within close range, additional disnance is even more difficult.

They are five star books. I checked out this Kindle edition from the Public Library. It contains so many typos, grammatical errors, and incorrect words, that reading it was definitely less enjoyable than reading the hprinted book. For example, one sentence said that a dragonrider \\"mourned\\" his dragon when it should have said he \\"mounted\\" his dragon.

Some people who reviwed it objected to how some character's roles were dimished. This is true, but absolutely neccesary in order to keep the plot pool from stagnating. F'nor's role was enlarged for us to get a closer look at him. He was not very deep in Dragonflight, but only because we didn't know him. I hope to see more about N'ton; he is my favorite besides Moreta. I don't see how anyone can say that McCaffrey doesn't write good female roles. THE two most famous dragonriders of all time are female; Moreta and Torene. Lessa saved Pern through her intellect and ingenuity; how can she be accused of being a bitch? I eagerly await the coming of more dragonrider books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book- but Kindle Ed. has too many errors","review":"The multitude of typos in the Kindle edition is extremely annoying.

Four stars for Dragonquest, negative stars for whomever botched the Kindle edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"A More Detailed and Focused View of Pern","review":"While most complain that Dragonquest is McCaffrey's attempt to diminish Lessa's role, they do not realize that the Dragonriders series does not focus on Lessa, but the world of Pern. It is simply bringing to light characters that were only minor in Dragonflight.This book is more detailed than Dragonflight and has fewer inconsistencies as the model of Pern is finalized. Character development is advanced, also. Lessa and F'lar tended to be one-dimensional in Dragonflight but here they are not the focused characters and F'nor, Flar's half brother, and some others are brought forward. Particularly engaging is the focus on Kylara and Brekke and the expansion into the South. Although not recommended before Dragonflight, it is a much more concrete and interesting novel. The storyline is improved and continued with The White Dragon and onward."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great overall view of Pern and its inhabitants","review":"The plot kept me reading all day long, because of so many conflicts and concerns warring between all folks, including the dragonriders. I felt as if I was a part of the whole story, seeing what affect all people of Pern, how history is linked, and how the discovery of unfound things that will lead to further exploration of the Red Star. I was happy to see Lessa and F'lar again, but they became smaller parts in the whole tapestry of conflicts and events. Some things that happened in the book touched me, like the deaths of 2 dragon queens. It was like a glimpse into a world without high technology and the high expectations from the dragonriders. Without conflict except for Thread, there is not much to know about the Pernese. F'lar did a great job of holding all people and lands together working towards a goal of Thread-free existence or at least know more about Thread's source."},{"rating":"2","title":"surround yourself with artist that are better than you,","review":"hello' this is billy marquis....hope everone enjoys the blues and beyond,,had a great time recording at deltasound in west memphis ark,with one i consider the best danny jones.The cd is selling better everyday ,and i consider myself blessed.The reason i think it gets 5 stars is not because of me, believe me I know better.reason is jim michie on keyboards, steve hault on bass,robert marquis on drums, danny jones and ollie warren at deltasound in w. memphis ark.. also thanks to all the smoke filled bar rooms in the miss. delta'''''''''billy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Billy!

It's not that it was a bad storyline; in fact, towards the end it was really quite engrossing. But to start off with it was very convoluted and slow. There was a lot of mythology and history, which would have been interesting if you weren't also trying to keep track of the plot at the same time. And it's considered a juvenile book!

Card's editors just don't demand enough from him. Enchantment feels unfinished and unedited, overly long with surprises popping out of nowhere. Characters are not up to Card's standards.

Somehow he managed to find parallels between our world and the things that could only have been conjured up using magic so many centuries ago. Also I thought it was clever to twist in a fairy tale with a modern love story to make it appealing to many generations, old to young.I had the fortune of having read some childrens' Russian fairy tales when I was younger and now I wish to go back and read them again. It might help to read a book of Russian fairy tales, before or after you read this, and it will amaze you further. Specifically, read Ivan and the Firebird, the Frog Princess, and Katerina Katerina."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well-rounded and self-contained story","review":"This book jumped into my hands, as all of Card's work does. And while I have to say that this was not my favorite of his works, I found Enchantment to be a very fulfilling read.Once again, the author has done his homework. The description of the Smetski family's emigration was quite authentic, and therefore all the more enjoyable. And the story itself does draw from much in Russian folk tradition, although Card wisely refrains from trying to incorporate all Russian fairy tales into one story. I enjoyed the careful consideration of time travel issues, a theme more fully developed in Pastwatch, as well as the exploration of pre-Christian women's rights (as contrasted with Ruthie's 20th century women's lib). I would have liked to have seen greater character development, but with all of the characters in this story that would have been a Herculean task.All in all, I heartily recommend this book, to Card fans or anyone interested in the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abridged Audio Version is crappy, Original Book is great","review":"The book is one of my favorites by Orson Scott Card. the book itself I give 5 stars, but the abridged audio version is horrible. The abridging was done with so little skill that its impossible to listen to the story without having first read the book. Do not buy the Abridged Audio Vesions unless you have already read the book. Even then, you will be disappointed, but at least you will be able to enjoy the story.The abridger chose to cut some portions of the story out, but later left the dialogue referring to those missing portions in. It is extrememly confusing, and you always feel like you missed something, because you did.I have listened to other abridged audio books by OSC like Stone Tables and Ender's Shadow. Those were wonderful books, so it is possible to have a good abridged audio book.

Do you A) like sophisticated, at least somewhat intellectually stimulating fantasy literature or do you B) like silly, sappy harlequin romances with a dash of uninventive fantasy? If you answered B) this book is for you. As for myself, I found myself cringing through what I read (3/4 of it) before I finally gave up in disgust and just skimmed the rest. It started off good, but there was just too much cheesy romance to appreciate the fantasy.*however* I will say this. I think a younger audience would probably like it. I know that if I were considerably younger (12 or so), I probably would have really liked it.... though, come to think of it, I've read a lot of YA material and rarely is it this cheesy...

The characters are so real that you can truly empathize with them, even minor charaters like Sergei and the priest he worked for.

I did find out the ending..no surpise how it worked out. This book had no good characters, even the \\"good ones\\" were annoying.

Mr. Card's a fine writer, but this book's just not all that good. It's a fairy tale, true, but the Good characters are SO good and the Bad characters are SO bad that there is virtually no tension in this story. Will Good triumph over Evil? DUH. Will Fathers be wise and sons obedient (so they can become wise fathers)? DITTO. Will there be the usual OSC lectures on Christian morality and family values along the way? You betcha. Card's characters have never inhabited a morally complex universe where doubt plagues people to the end of their days and the outcomes of stories--like those in life--are unforeseeable. For me, I fell off the Orson Scott Card bandwagon when he sold the Book of Mormon to Tor as a five-part science fiction series, his Homecoming \\"epic\\". I thought I'd give him another chance with this book. Silly me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to the standards Card has had in the past","review":"Having read many of Card's books I was very disappointed with the quality of this new offering. It seems that over the years he has become more enamored with the carnal side of writing. What could once be considered a small part of the text has now become so pervasive as to dilute any story or plot line he is trying to tell. It seems that Mr. Card is drifting to the side of the sensational and abandoning the real art of story-telling. I was so disappointed with this book that I couldn't finish... a first for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to get through","review":"All types of holes in the plot and in the characters. I found myself skipping through huge sections of the book. Human dynamics a bit unrealistic as are the relationships. I had high hope, but this was a disappointment.

Combat depictions were very contrived."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Yankee, no king Arthur... it's a bit different","review":"This book's basic idea is fairly similar to the one in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. However that's where the similarities end, this is placed in Ukraine (8th or 9th century) and deals with fairy tales origins. As far as I can tell it's making sense, known history wise, i.e. the world it describes is a mix of fairy tales and known history.Compared to other books by Orson Scott Card this one is about the same quality - there adventure has pace, story is interesting. Not sure if I would believe it was written by Ukrainian but there are no glaring mistakes, there are Ukrainian words mixed in where needed etc.FYI: this review is based on first third of the book, that's where I am at right now, will post updates if my opinion changes..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite enjoyable","review":"If you are a Scott-Card fan as I am, then you.know what to expect from his writing style.

Ender's Game was wonderful. Alvin Maker is one of my favorites. I've read almost everything Card wrote and until the last two books, I didn't think he could write something I wouldn't like. Enchantment was cheesy and I didn't finish it. The book I read just before this one, Magic Street, was also a rehash of other tales. It was like he ran out of his own ideas and had to use someone else's. But he took the magic out of other worlds and tried to put it into this one and for me, it just didn't work. I might have to re-read something else he wrote just to remember why I liked his writing so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Orson Card...","review":"...then you'll like this one.

I'm a huge Orson Scott Card fan and this one is just as good as the others I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchantment is nothing short of extraordinary!","review":"Enchantment is the best thing Card has put out since Ender's Game. It is much more accessible than some of his science fiction (which I also love). What a wonderful way to retell a fairy tale. Card has a way of pulling the reader inside the story-the characters become as real as any person you have ever known. Anyone who loves the story of Sleeping Beauty will love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchantment: Enchanting","review":"Once again, Orson Scott Card has done a masterful job of making fantastical situations seem realistic -- even the relationship between the malevolent witch, Baba Yaga, and her kidnapped Bear-god husband. This is a well written story of clashing cultures, modern and ancient, as well as clashing spiritualities: Christian, Jewish, Pagan. The novel is respectful of them all. It's also a romance with a happy ending that bridges both worlds. And contrary to what one reviewer wrote, Bruce Cockburn (whose lyrics are quoted in the novel) IS cool!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very humorous characters; witty ways of expressions","review":"Very humorous characters and ways of constructing sentences. At times the story got dull, but the witty ways of thinking kept me through. I never though sci-fi could be so exciting. Now I see why Orson Scott Card is so beloved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"One of the best books I had read in a long time. I was craving something different than what I normally read and this was certainly it. Very romantic!! I'm a librarian and I will recommend it to everyone who wants to read something different!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent Fantasy","review":"This is intelligent fantasy at it's best.

For a book written in this decade there was hardly anything sexy. Frankly, I would've liked more! There are two kinds of everything: good and bad, and this book was simply great. The story was original, suspenseful, the characters well-developed and likeable, and every sentence phrased so beautifully that the content almost didn't matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creativity!","review":"This book is creativity at its finest. Orson Scott Card continues to do what I have grown to love. He can create a world from seemingly nothing. I have never read anything bad from him."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting premise but ends up flat and ordinary","review":"I listened to Enchantment by Orson Scott Card (of Ender's Game fame - still one of my favourite books) on audiobook, because I had some long trips coming up. It wasn't a book I had been wanting to read (random pick from the library), but it filled the time quite easily, and I found out that I like to listen to audiobooks while running - yay for multitasking!Enchantment had a promising premise - a modern retelling of the Sleeping Beauty saga. However, it quickly becomes an ordinary but well researched, structured, and paced story about magic and witches in an otherwise muggle world.I will never forget the deep forest with its leaf-filled chasm in the Ukraine where our runner scholar hero, Ivan, finds his 9th century princess Katerina. For that gorgeous magical place alone, I'm grateful. Otherwise, the characters were flat and often stereotypical, and the story not as inventive as I had hoped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Britax Marathon Shines Through All Others!","review":"The Britax Marathon is wonderful.

The Marathon allows any child to remain in this seat up to 49\\" in length and or 65 lbs. Thats equivelent to a five your old.Not so happy with the color selection that Britax offers for a boy. (...)They also offered many other prints at the same price for substantially less than most other companies online.The seat arrived shortly thereafter and was nicely boxed. I did have difficulty finding the instructions that were tucked underneathe the front seat fabric which I thought was a strange place to put them.

She promised me that my skin would clear up in about 2 weeks. It did! I've been using this cleanser for 10 years now, and it's the best I've ever used. I have very sensitive, fair skin, and tends toward the oily side. I'll never switch to another skin care line. It may seem expensive, but one 16 oz bottle lasts me for over a year, and you don't need more than a pea size amount, so I believe it's cheaper than most drug store products.

This is a product I have been using for about 5 or more years and stick with a good thing. Even though Dermalogica is expensive, I feel it is a value to purchase the bigger size as it lasts so long.

With all the face washes available out there, you'd think it'd be fairly easy to pick one up that is no-frills and doesn't hurt your skin but it's been a lot harder for me than it should be.

The whole organization of the book was clunky, and the passages felt rushed and flippant. I wish more time had been spent on content and really exploring family relationships in terms of the Chinese zodiac. The topic is compelling but unfortunately it wasn't treated here in a way that gives the reader any real insight.

Now try to hum \\"The Hitter\\". Need I say more? Now you may say that the title track has a memorable tune, but the thing you may not realize is that Sprinsgteen, in an astonishing display of unoriginality, is has used the same melody in \\"Dead Man Walking\\" and \\"Blood Brothers\\".

The dozen numbers - clocking 50:55 - covers a variety of poignant and timeless issues; lust masquerading for love (Reno), life during wartime (Devils & Dust) and an anonymous death during a quest for freedom (Matamoros Banks).The Dual Disc provides the listener with the \\"regular\\" album and a DVD with 5.1 surround sound, music videos and commentary by Springsteen.

Thirty years in and he is getting better and better and fresher and fresher.

I enjoyed the acoustic parts of the concert and the RIsing cd very much. But this one excapes me and doesn't touch what I love about his lyricism, use of instrumentation, and ability to put simple concepts into complex settings, or complex feelings into simple yet elegant lyrics...on Devils he puts highly personal and obscure messages into obscure settings.

And the music...all I can do is shake my head and feel sorry for a great artist that has overstayed his welcome among the musical elite. I have loved Bruce's music and genius my whole life which makes it really hard to see him tarnish such a great career with such a woeful attempt at singing and songwriting.

I love Bruce but he really needs a band to enhance his music. I want to love this CD, Ive given it a few listens and it just doesnt click or keep my attention. The E Street band is becoming more and more important cuz this crap doesnt fly. Nebraska and Joad are 2 coasters.

I've had my preferances, of course, but the fact that this CD DOES NOT PLAY on my PC, stereo, or boombox is nothing short of infuriating!As a blue-collar Springsteen devotee, I'm so upset that I need to listen to D&D; on my television.Having listened a dozen times, the songs are decent but nothing like the rawness of Nebraska or the simplicity of Tom Joad. (BTW: I liked both records because I thought they represented new directions...)HOWEVER!The fact that we get TWO songs with RETREAD LYRICS!!! And at least another couple with similar melodies doesn't seem worth the price of hearing Bruce's falsetto.Additionally, those expecting better lyrics here will disappointed.It is -- and I've been buying this guy's records for thirty years and never thought I'd say this-- nothing short of A DISASTER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More short stories from the Boss","review":"At first listen, this album would seem to pick up where The Ghost of Tom Joad ended. Yet, this album is superior to Joad in many ways. The music is surprisingly complex. The stories are more viceral. The lyrics range from haunting to inspirational. Springsteen continues to evolve and do what he wants to do. Don't buy this album if you are expecting The Rising part two. In much the same way Tunnel of Love was a departure from Born in the USA, this album heads down a very different highway from the post 9-11 road of The Rising. If you love good stories though, this album is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Dust than Devil","review":"I can't say I have ever been a huge Springsteen fan. His big BIG albums I have tended to stay away from, though even they contained some really nice underrated songs (\\"Downbound Train\\").For all his E Street over-the-top songs, I always gravitated to the more stripped down, bare bones songs the band did (\\"Point Blank\\", \\"The River\\"). The more he stripped away the band, the more I enjoyed his music - most of 'Tunnel of Love' and half of 'The Rising'.'Nebraska' was a watershed moment for him, in my opinion. Great songs. No band. Low budget. One of those albums you really listen to - that can't just be background music. American storytelling, if you will. But 'Devils & Dust' is no 'Nebraska'. It has some good qualities to it - but nothing that captured my attention or grabbed me where I had to go back for a second listen.Perhaps it will grow on me over time. It is certainly not an easy listen. Time will tell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Devils and Dust by Bruce Springsteen","review":"Springsteen's most subtle writing to date. A remarkable effort by him.

I'm not being saracastic, I just would like to know if there is some new gadget that is supposed to replace common CD players and common ipods because there has to be SOME WAY to play this CD. I really would like to hear it because I like the Boss, but I think I will wait until a year or two when they re-release it on a better quality CD. They usually do that in situations like this.

His dry spell was over almost two decades old. Finally he hit his old stride with The Rising, which brought his old fans back to their feet, remembering how incredibly good Bruce could be and he confirmed this during the subsequent concert tours. It seemed that Bruce became inspired by our Country after the heroics of 9/11 and the Rising brought his inspirations to life. He found a country that was ready to wrap its arms around him after 9/11 and the fact that some of the songs in The Rising reminded us of \\"the old Bruce\\" helped pave the way to the realization that... Bruce was back!!! Now he kills his momentum, ditches the E-Street band and follows up his personal rising with this yawner. Bringing us back to the ho-hum days of 1985-2001. For whatever reason I expected more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Springsteen should stick with what he knows","review":"There was a time when good ol' Bruce wrote about America. There was a time when he wrote about love. He seemed to know of both, but he obviously knows nothing about war. It is as if Bush was writing a song about songwriting.

Left to their own, they would just like to pound all the ice cubes out as fast as possible, but since it takes a minute or so for an adult to setup, it's not really fun for anyone. There's never any surprise or challenge as to which cube will cause the bear to fall, so it basically feels like a complicated plastic tic-tac-toe game. On our set, the plastic is poorly finished, so the bear doesn't stand/skate in the slot he's meant to. Perhaps it's better to wait till they are old enough for Operation or Kurplunk.

It's a real pain to put all the little ice blocks in the frame and honestly the last row of blocks is too difficult for the kids. Then, all the kids do is take turns hammering out cubes until the bear falls. My kids seem of pretty average intelligence and this game provided almost no challenge to them or even learning as far as I could tell. They both knew exactly when the bear would fall and that's really only fun once or twice. I think we played it about four times in the past year.

Right? Wrong. Drew sleepwalks through this movie in a trance (hopefully not chemically induced), there's absolutely no chemistry between her and Bana (how could there be chemistry between two rocks?), and the tone of this movie and its actors is so low-key that it quickly descends into a monotone drone. With its relative dearth of music and surprisingly fuzzy film quality, I would have thought that I was watching a low-budget Bulgarian movie from the 1980s, were it not for the familiar faces and American details. It's not a disaster, but it's not very good either.

I could only say somethign about a father son thing, but really I was reaching for straws for making such an awful selection.The movie says it was released in 2007 but they are using old phones and the poker craze was about two years ago and it all seemed odd.

But, based on my experience, I can say that it works best if used sparingly and if it is taken on an empty stomach.Once I started taking it while I ate and doing it every day, I stopped feeling any effects.

He was out there that night and made all the right decisions. He loaded along side of the Fitz, watched her clear the harbour, listened to her radio broadcasts and knew they were going to get into trouble. In my estimation he also has the real reason she sank. I have read and reread this book at least 6 times and belive it is the best read ever on the subject. If you want to know why the Fitz sank, get this book. As for Captain Paquette, my hat is off to him. On this night in particular, it wasn't him who had the ego problem. He brought the Sykes into safe harbour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything but","review":"I was disappointed that the reader has to wade through many chapters that had little to do with the Edmund Fitzgerald. Instead the book had great detail on Capt. Paquette's experiences and other ships on the Great Lakes. There are many other books which expound on the Fitzgerald much better. In addition the type style/size is difficult and eye straining to read. The book Gales of November is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!","review":"We purchased this clock expressly for our motor home travels.

We have tested the clock at home and found it does not return to the correct time. In fact, it is at least 20 minutes fast each time we plug it in after an extended time without power.

If you try to please everyone..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful collection from Ms. Krall","review":"It took me a while to warm up to Diana Krall but once I did I was hooked. Her Live in Paris CD and DVD were awesome and I now own her entire collection. As a big fan I expected to like this new work but I liked it even more than I anticipated. Her previous work has all been in a combo setting with Piano, Bass, Drums and Guitar, on this disc she sings and plays with a full band, the Hamilton-Clayton Jazz Orchestra and the result is fabulous. Her voice, phrasing and style come through in a new and very enjoyable way with the big band behind her. I hope she chooses to reprise this format soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to understand what happened ...","review":"Like others, I thought that this CD was a big come-down from her earlier work, specifically, the live in Paris recordings. However, without putting too fine a point on it, my impression when listening to it a second time (of a total of two), was that my lack of enthusiasm might have been driven more by the selections, with the exception of the title song, or the instrumenation / recording (had to concentrate to hear her piano work) than from Diana, herself.She's a great! talent, get her Live in Paris DVD to be wowed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"phoning it in","review":"I'm a jazz fan. I like Diana Krall - the jazz pianist who can sing. I have a few of her earlier cds (\\"Stepping Out\\", \\"All For You\\") when she was playing the piano more. I sort of \\"checked out\\" of her later 'big hits' and then most definitely got back in synch with her \\"The Girl In The Other Room\\" project - somewhat of a collaboration with her husband (and one of my personal favorites) Elvis Costello. So when \\"This Moment On\\" came out, I was looking forward to more of the personal feel of \\"The Girl...\\" - but no. Not even close. It sounds like Diana was just fulfilling her contractual requirements with her record company on this one. Feels like she just phoned it in."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's Back","review":"Not that she ever went away. I loved \\"Girl In the Other Room\\" and her Christmas album. But this is a return to the more traditional Krall many have come to know and love. The album is top notch. When you put together a band and production team like this one, you really can't go wrong. Its a must purchase for the Jazz fan, or for that matter, any music fan at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is This Her Best Effort Yet?","review":"This is one of Krall's few albums where most of the material is not familiar to me yet it stands out as her best album yet. Instead of the trio she used in her earlier sessions, she is again backed by a massive orchestra which can fill your listening area with such wonderful music. Some high points on this album such as 'Isn't It A lovely Day', 'Day In And Day Out' and 'Come Dance With Me'. Carressing voice and big bands are a winner every time. Keep it up Diana!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Krall","review":"This album gives us what we have come to expect from Diana Krall.

Diana seems to lack the sparkle she had as Trio and Live in Paris. The band revs up, but she doesn't come along. She is bending her notes like a bad carnival ride at most every turn. Her range is compressed. All in all, a very dissapointing CD with few thrills and a lot of mediocrity. My earlier reviews had compared DK with Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughn. I see now those comparisions were grossly premature and I wish to apologize to these late greats. I truely hope Diana finds her form again, but it all seems down hill from after Live in Paris.

By choosing predominantly 'happy' songs, Krall treads dangerous ground by eschewing her forte - usually slow-paced dirges, sung in a husky monotone. By juicing up the ante, she could bear responsibility for a backlash. But her fan base need not worry. While she's discovered reasons to be joyful these past few years [e.g. marriage to Elvis Costello, pregnancy] Krall couldn't sound more blasé; while her piano skills remain plucky and skillful, her gloomy phrasing continues to mope until her droopy delivery cures your aching insomnia.

The two bands are of very different styles, Spineshank's music being filled with more techno like beats and sounds while Silent Civilian is straight up metalcore with screamed vocals and most songs having a melodic chorus.Although the songs get kinda repetitive (thus the 4 stars) everything else they have done is awesome. I see their next album being one of the greats in this genre. Although some people might not like their very political message in most of their songs.

The original sequel to \\"Curse of Frankenstein\\" is a beautifully mounted, directed and acted minor masterpiece of the horror film. Jimmy Sangster's thoughtful and restrained screenplay illustrates the reason why he was Hammer's best screenwriter, rivalled only by Terence Fisher's masterful direction. Good old Peter Cushing is back, as a slightly more mellow, humane Baron Frankenstein. Cushing is a joy to watch and listen to as he smoothly maneuvers his way through and insinuates himself into the politics and society of an elegant Swiss burg in the 1860's. The only thing missing is a James Bernard score!

Her embodiment of the role allows her unworldly, captivating presence to anchor the storyline; one does not even need to know how she was damaged to intuit it.The other main character here is Binoche's dead brother; the origin of the sibling's destructive relationship is displayed through the character of Binoche's mother, Leslie Caron, who gives a brilliant performance appearing addled and unaware, yet anything but...she is the original damaged goods in this filmThere are so many layers driving the finality.

It piques the curiousity by the time it climaxes. But even after everything starts tumbling down, there's always that feeling of bad eighties cheese in it (actually it's from 1992).

Jeremy Irons basically thinks that banging his face against Juliette Binoche's and slobbering all over her constitutes great passion. It's comical and I found it hard to take the rest of the movie seriously due to the awful sex. And that big picture at the end--you're right--why the heck did he have that blown up and put across his whole wall? I just had to laugh. Having said all that, Juliette Binoche and Miranda Richardson do turn in wonderful performances (as always). I am a big fan of Juliette Binoche so she can't do much wrong with me (except let Jeremy Irons slobber all over her--I hope she never makes that mistake again). I would say avoid this film, because it's so serious about itself that it comes out comical and over the top."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely realistic","review":"Extremely well acted, great movie. Damage is both compelling and disturbing in its realism and psychological content. The intimate scenes between Irons' and Binoche's characters are some of the few that I can actually watch without laughing--the scenes are very mature and believable, as opposed to movies that seem to pander to a goofy teenage audience. The obsessive attraction is also very believable. The first time I watched this film a couple years ago, I too felt somewhat as some critics do--that there was no reason for the obsession between the two. However, having actually been there (unfortunately), I now appreciate even more the seemingly \\"inexplicable\\" nature of obsessions. There is often no \\"one\\" reason. Just many subtle nuances and coincidental timing that happen in real life--and that Malle has portrayed in this film as beautifully and disturbingly realistic as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Disappointment from Irons and Malle","review":"After hearing about this film for many years, I finally saw it this evening. It was a major disappointment, from the lack of subtlety (did Malle tell Irons and Binoche to look at one another on first glance as if they were starving island-dwellers who have stumbled upon a buffet supper?), to the energetic but clumsily-choreographed sex scenes, to the constant little \\"uh-ohs\\" that permeated the film (does Irons' secretary suspect? does the hotel clerk? does his son?), to poor Miranda Richardson's utterly gratuitous topless scene... The dialogue rarely rang true, characters would conveniently be given the space to suddenly go off on a \\"revealing\\" monologue, and the background music was yet another New Age-y, echo-chambered piece of froth.

Rafferty's bitchy New Yorker review reminds me why I hate New York pretentiousness amongst critics who watch and grieve from their self-appointed piss-elegant armchairs, and why Amazon would give him the space to relieve himself here is beyond me.DAMAGE is a slow film, and, indeed, the cold sterility of its upper class characters plays better in a big theater than on DVD. It remains engaging due to the solid performances, and the troubling theme of 'special love' being quite so dangerous as to seduce even restrained humans into doing the most reprehensible and irresponsible things to each other.Pray you don't meet your Anna.

Where to begin? Another \\"French Lieutenant's Woman\\"/obsessed guy performance by Jeremy Irons, Juliette Binoche as an antiques dealer who dresses exclusively in leather and can leave work whenever she wants for the truly ridiculous sex scenes (I particularly like it when Irons rhythmically bangs Binoche's head against the floor--that's a sure fire way to get a woman going!). You know you're in trouble when Irons rips Binoche's exquisite silk shirt and that causes you more angst than anything else in the film. And the ending is just ridiculous (where did he get that photo?) Miranda Richardson overcomes all to give a far better performance than this silly movie deserves. All in all a guilty pleasure, but I would pay big money to see what Mike or Joel and the bots could do with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"cyclonic passions rage","review":"'Damage' is one of those strange films, like a train out of control, doom looms over all involved. The film is riveting, but the viewer is always at a distance finding it hard to identify with the emotions of the protagonists. Iron's is utterly contemptble even though he is to an extent being manipulated by his feelings of desire. Contrary to some unfavourable reviews Binoche captures the role in her customary unorthodox way. She is dresseed in black and looks almost androgenous, her strong accent and unsettling presence remind one of the 'foreign' capacity of her character and the desruction she causes but which is out of her control. The cemistry between Irons and Binoche is dynamite but in an utterly distructive way as played out in the violent and disturbing sex scenes. All in all 'Damage' is a good film, it is however not one of those films which one will always fondly remember, but be ware you'll never forget it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Obsession Out of Control!","review":"A stable, humdrum life is suddenly turned upside down without warning!

With an all-star cast directed by Louis Malle, how bad could it be? Pretty terrible. Perhaps it's not possible to visually portray the dark urges explored so vividly in the novel. Not to disparage the performances, but I didn't understand who the characters were in relation to themselves, much less to one another.

The twists were not forced like in other books. They eased into the plot and kept me surprised the whole way thru. And I loved every minute of it.

But now I can't wait to get my hands on other books by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional And Exciting **NOT a spoiler review**","review":"This is the first Coben book I've read, and if it's any indication of his previous books I will definitely be investing more of my time reading them all. I was really impressed by his style of writing. He is very short and descript with everything, and it lets the story move at an excellent pace. He leaves more to the imaginiation than other writers (like King). Usually it takes me a while to sink into a novel, but I was into the story after the first page. A very involving story, and very difficult to put down. If only it were longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tell Everyone It's Not That Good","review":"What!!!! Five stars from almost everyone....this book is just o.k., not great, not riveting, tho the ending was a surprise. Easy summer read. Why did I stick with it...who knows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I did not give this book 5 stars simply because I had read Hoben's \\"Gone for Good\\" first. On the other hand, I found myself unable to stop turning the pages even when I knew I should.I do have some misgivings about the final plot twist regarding Beck's past, but I can overlook that considering what a overall great read this was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, captivating, and excellent","review":"Coben's writing is beyond anything that I have read in a long time. He has a way with words that makes you become part of the story or feel like you are the character. The plot twists and turns and you try you damnedest to figure this book out before the end. Wonderful, amazing. His gives his characters the right amount of emotion as well as sarcasm and all that jazz. Read this one and you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely Engaging","review":"From experience I've found that its rare to find a suspense or mystery novel that packs as large an emotional punch as it does thrills. Tell No One is one of the few exceptions to this rule. Coben has accomplished two things with Tell No One: he's created a good, solid, strong mystery and he's written a story with likable, well constructed characters with emotions that we can all identify with to a certain degree. Despite the top-notch characterization, the action of the story never falters. As promised, there are plenty of twists and turns to keep the reader guessing. While it's a relatively easy read, the story is clearly well thought out and engaging. A fantastic, fun read. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!","review":"This was an INCREDIBLE Book! The supense in it was great!!I had a hard time putting it down. I Highly recomend getting it. Although, I got mine at the Local Public Library for free (aren't Librarys great!?!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read Thriller!","review":"I believed that this book was a very good one to read. It was very detailed and would always leave you wondering. It is very suspenseful making you want to read till that last word in the book. This book will leave you on the edge of your seat, not being able to wait to read what will happen next, since it is so suspenseful and gives a lot of mystery. It has a lot of problems that you could relate to your own life and implies to never give up on what you believe in."},{"rating":"1","title":"started dramatically","review":"Started out well aand sunk into banality midway through. Was so disappointed I couldn't even finish it. No surprises here predictable and like so many other in this genre. What's all the hype about? $12.60 unwisely spent. Back to my authors of many years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your eysight","review":"The story has an interesting beginning which draws the reader in, but itbecomes overly contrived and the characters are hardly more than cardboard.I like a story with some attachment to reality, but ths isn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Favorites!","review":"This book made its way into my book club. It was a suggested movie to watch, but I decided to read the book first. Amazing. I couldn't put it down. I read it within a day or two. It kept me at the edge of my seat the whole time. I understood the book the whole way through and didn't have to go back and reread anything to fully understand. I love this book. I saw the movie, which is in French. I liked it, but would have never really understood the storyline if I hadn't read the book. Great author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TELL NO ONE ABOUT THIS BOOK","review":"Having read and loved all of this authors \\"Myron Boloitar\\" series (some more than others) I was extremely disappointed in his latest attemt into the mainstream thriller genre. Characters were not developed or likable. If you can stand to wait until the last 80 pages for things to pick up, this book may be for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with Myron Bolitar!","review":"I'm an open-minded chap, but this novel just doesn't cut it (and it's a real decline from just about any of Coben's Myron Bolitar novels). Its premise is thin, the plot is predictable and Coben's attempts to build suspense and throw in twists at the end fall far short.Stick with Myron Bolitar!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tell No One","review":"The book was listed as GOOD. Actually the pages were yellow and the spine was broken. Very surprising because I have ordered GOOD books and this is way below the average of past GOOD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"I am not a book reviewer but feel compelled to add a note or two about what I consider one of the worse written books I have ever read. Now, I have been a big fan of Halan Coben and have read most, if not all, of his prior novels. Therefore, I was very anxious to read this novel. But disappointed I was! What happened? Has Coben stooped to having college students write the novels for him? If this novel left out a single sophomoric clique, I would like to know what it is. Suffice to say, don't waste you money or time on this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This was another great read by Harlan Cohen. Not disappointing in the least. Twists and turns in the plot. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very ingenuous and superficial plot...","review":"I bought this book out of curiosity, since Coben is a bestseller and I like crime fiction. But this book was a disappointment. I won't spoil it for you, but the plot is very superficial and ingenuous. The protagonist lost his wife years ago and, suddenly, starts receiving misterious messages that may cast some light into her death. The idea looks interesting, but the result is not. My impression is that the autor started to wtite from the ending, and made up a story just to fill the pages. And the ending itself, supposedly conceived to amaze, in fact dos not add up with the protagonist's personality, as it is build throughout the book. If you are not experienced in crime fiction, you may find it entertaining. If you like more mature writing, try somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Convoluted and disappointing","review":"Tell No One by Harlan Coben is about a man that believes his wife may still be alive 8 years after being supposedly murdered by a serial killer. This is the first novel by Mr. Coben and I was really impressed for most of the book. However, I felt there were too many twists to the story, and the narrative was too mixed up to tie all the events together. Even after finishing the book, I'm confused as to what exactly happened and why. The book alternates between first and third person, with the first person holding back information until the end. It just felt weird to me. On the plus side, it was an engaging story that kept me reading, but I felt like I needed to take notes for a test at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good holiday reading","review":"This book is good holiday reading, but is not as sophisticated as I had expected. Enjoyable but not 'Big Literature'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite","review":"This is one of my favorite books! I love Coben's twists. Even when you think everything is resolved in this book, he will throw another twist in there. I highly recommend this one for people who love a good mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"I told everyone","review":"I ordered this book 2 months ago and let it sit. I was in a reading slump. When I decided to pick it up finally!! I could not put it down the book is a fast paced page turner. I could almost visualize each of the characters with his brief description. What can I say looking for more books from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Fast....","review":"Wow, I finished it in one day, I just couldn't put it down. A great, quick, summer read. It's what reading for fun is all about. I recommend it for a fast paced escape. A real page turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"never buy any book by Mr. Coban","review":"I put a huge endurance to finally finsh it. never buy any book by Mr. Coban"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Summer Read!","review":"\\"Tell No One\\" is my first Harlan Coben book. It truly is a fun and interest-grabbing pageturner. You'll want to read it straight through from start to finish to see how it all works out. I recommend this for light summer reading at the beach or while traveling but don't be surprised if you put off sight-seeing to complete the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Five stars? Four Stars? Three Stars? No way!","review":"Great premise...a good read but only up to a point, about half-way through. Then, Mr.Coben spoiled it with his politically correct speech, cardboard characters and predictable plot twists.It's a pity!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what is all the fuss about?","review":"This book is certainly an easy read and a page-turner, and yes, it has a neat little twist at the end. But I didn't believe in a single one of the characters; they were nothing but cardboard cut-outs. Of course, the hero (and all of his friends) are extremely clever, and the police are all extremely stupid (and malicious). The story regarding the disappearance of the wife is laughable in its implausability. I really wanted to like this book, but just can't give it a good rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page turner!","review":"I'm not a speed-reader but the pages were flying by. I couldn't put it down. \\"What a tangled web we weave\\" is an understatement in describing this plot twisting, page-turner. WOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not many words, It's too good!","review":"This book is simply the best I read in years in this genre, and I read a lot of mysteries. It took me one and a half day to read it, and I had to work as well! It's THE pageturner par excellence, what can I say more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put me off reading another Coben","review":"This was my first, and last, Coben novel. It was recommended by someone who's read every book the guy's written, and shares a love of a few authors I really enjoy. Mr Coben will not be one of them.The writing is the most juvenile I've ever read by a popular writer. Those who call the plot contrite are being overly generous. I had to actually FORCE myself to finish it. Never again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"Made it to the end of the book but wished I hadn't bothered. Not worth reading. The writing wasn't very good, the story kept wandering about and wasn't very believable and neither were the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tell No One","review":"Very intense book, I had no idea who really killed Brandon Scope until the last chapter, I was really shocked."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"This one doesn't have the humor of Coben's buddy novels, but it's a good, fast, suspense story. I enjoyed it as much as his others.It reminded me of a good James Patterson book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"Really enjoyed this one. I read it on holiday and didn't want to put it down. I won't go over the plot, as others have already done that, but it is a very good thriller and well worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish his other books were a little different","review":"I liked this book a lot. It's pretty exciting to read and doesn't kill you with suspense and drag it out like some other 'thrillers'. Anyway I liked this book enough that I am interested in reading more of this author's books but it seems that they are pretty much all the same - someone is supposedly dead and an event happens that provides possibility of that someone still being alive. Definitely worth the read, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip This and Go To The Next Myron Bolitar","review":"Coben is way out of his league here in his attempt to concoct a serious thriller. The plot makes no sense with numerous inconsistencies, and the characters are equally implausible. His Myron Bolitar novels are also implausible, but light and funny, with comic book characters so over the top I laugh out loud. This is a different and much more difficult genre for him altogether, and I couldn't wait for this experiment to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tell Everyone","review":"This book was a very interesting and action-packed book. It kept me guessing and reading until the book was done. Harlan Coben really knows how to write a book. He speaks well to the reader and keeps everything simple, easy, and to the point. He hides nothing from the reader and this is something that I for one really appreciated because some authors will make things hard to understand and use fruity language. The language he uses is very modern and language that is used in the real world. He also includes real situations that make it easier to relate to the story. This is a great thriller and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What You Don't Know Can Hurt You-Unsolved Mystery","review":"Dr. David Beck is a pediatrician who is still grievibg the loss of his wife Elizabeth, 8 years ago. Elizabeth was supposedly murdered when was kidnapped all that time ago. All this time later as David still searches for clues as to what really happened-appears a message on his computer, It is a warning which reads \\"Tell No One.\\" Tell no one what though? This writer keeps giving warnings to David, and the next thing he sees is Elizabeth's picture waving at him looking as though she is still alive and well-and maybe she is. But in the process, David is getting framed for strings of murders, as someone is against him, and wants revenge. And this person will stop at nothing to get David, And not only that, but he just knows that Elizabeth is still alive after receiving clues to meet her at a resort.I thought the book had too many twists and turns at once, and in places was disjointed as well. However, it kept me interested until the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Fun & Entertaining","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Easy enough to read on an airplane, but not complete fluff. Just good old fun! Lots of suspense and twists. I highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"I have never read a Harlan Coben book before and just happened to pick this up. It was SO good I couldn't put it down and I read it in one day. I'm anxious to read some more of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordinary People","review":"After several people told me this was great fun, I plunked down my [money] and looked forward to a fast paced, thrill ride. Unfortunately, it reads more like a how -to -write- a -mystery -and -hope- the -movie -people -buy -it -book. I finished it but only to see just how dull it could be...I wasn't disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Will Tell No One To Buy This Book!","review":"A little half-way thru the book, I kept wondering \\"where is the story to this book?' I very rarely put a book in the \\"trade\\" pile without reading it, but this one went there quickly. I don't care about any of the characters, I don't care what really happened to anyone in the book.

So many twists and turns it was totally unbelievable. I know its fiction but give me a break........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to shrug off this story","review":"The book starts out with a catchy premise but rapidly goes downhill (or is it nowhere?). The characters are cardboard (or styrofoam) and the plot just too outlandish. Honestly, it reads like it was written by a ninth-grader with a great imagination but little knowledge of the writing craft. I can't believe this book was a bestseller or that so many people recommended this author to me. I'm certainly not tempted to try any of his other works."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAP, dime store novel","review":"This is the most stupid, unbelievable, shot full of holes BS I've ever read. I can't even bring myself to write areview it's that worthless. The characters are all extremists (the baddest of the bad and good goodiest). They areunbelievably lame. I've read most all of Coben's Myron Bolitar novels and thought they were pretty good. Theydid start to get old tho. But this Tell No One stinks. It's cheap. Sorry, like I said it's not even worth a review. SoI guess I'll just place my star vote and shutup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting plot twists","review":"The first time I started reading this book, I put it aside due to its violence. If you're used to graphic violence in books, it won't bother you at all, but if most of your experience with thrillers comes from Agatha Christie instead of Stephen King, it might bother you.After a week or so, though, I came back to the book, because I absolutely had to see how it ended. The plot twists were, in hindsight, not very original, but while you're following them, they do indeed keep you on your toes. The suspense finally got to me -- I had to figure out who was sending David these e-mails.The deletion of the two hit-men would make this book a much more pleasant read, and detract from the plot and suspense very little."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly complex","review":"This book was a masterwork of plot twists and snappy dialogue. Sadly, the lesbian couple added nothing to the story except depravity. So I have to ask, \\"Why are they there?\\" Political correctness rears its vile head yet again."},{"rating":"1","title":"It wasn't what I thought!","review":"I was very disappointed in the writing style of the author. The plot of the mystery was fairly interesting, yet the style of writing distracted me from it. I thought the writing was juvenile and phrasing of dialogue very conversational. I had read a few excellent reviews about it. I also notice the reviews from the Amazon readers- so maybe it is just my taste!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If this book were a car, it would be red and turbocharged.","review":"This is a burner of a book. It can and wants to be read in one sitting. My advice: \\"Don't start the first page after 9.00 pm.\\"The plot twists and turns like a cork screw. Surprises follow surprises. Unlike most \\"can't put it down\\" books, Tell No One successfully uses misdirection. Just when you think you know what will happen, your fooled again.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really a fun ride!","review":"I listened to this marvelous book on tape and truly enjoyed it. This is only the 2nd book I've read by Coben...he was suggested by another woman in the doctor's office. (Ask someone who they're reading and you're liable to find some great authors!) Everyone else has given an overview of the story in their reviews and I'd have to agree with all of them...it's the tale of true loss and grief and a really twisted mystery that carries you urgently to the last page. There are several great mystery authors out there, Vince Flynn whose books are the scenario for the popular 24 series, Jonathan Kellerman, Stephen White, James Patterson, Robin Cook, Susan Isaacs, Linda Howard,Stephen King, and countless others, but now I've added to my list of favorites, Harlan Coben!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Arghhh!","review":"Four stars for this book is something of a compromise. For 99.9 percent of the book, I probably would have been inclined to give it five stars. After the last page and a half, I am almost inclined to drop the rating to three stars. I won't give anything away, but I will say this: After writing a very, very good book, Mr. Coben wraps it up by being too cute by half. He capped a hum-dinger of a story with an unsatisfying (and unnecessary) twist at the end. That unfortunate slip aside, this book is well conceived, well written, and a great read. (Good enough, in fact, that I'm in the process of reading another of Coben's books.) Check it out...if you can overlook an overwritten ending, you'll have a great time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tell Everyone It's Not That Good","review":"What!!! Five stars from almost everyone....I feel quite alone in my opinion but that's o.k. This book is just so-so, not great, not riveting, though the book improved toward the end. An easy summer read if you don't have to concentrate too hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible writer","review":"I couldn't finish the book. The writing, I am not talking about the story yet, is what you might expect from a High School freshman. It is clumsy, predictable, and has little imagination. The writer also tries to save himself by having quirky charcters yet ruins it by giving them traits from a typical sitcom. The story is not much better although the idea could taken off with a interesting writer. Here is one writer who tries to follow all the formulas for writing a mystery but without any of the talent that makes a story a good ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tell No One (audio CD)","review":"Looked forward to listening to another great Harlan Coben audio book while commuting, but it wouldn't play on my Mac so I couldn't download it to my Ipod. Seems to play ok on a CD player, but they are pretty cumbersome on public transportation. If I can't listen to it on my Ipod, then its not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Will Tell No One to Buy This Book!","review":"A little half-way thru the book, I kept wondering \\"where is the story?'

Never buy a book by an author you do not know where the onlyblurb on the book is from other authors.2. Never buy a book where the blurb from the \\"author-reviewers\\"includes cliches like \\"gut wrenching suspense\\".3. Never buy a \\"Scooby Doo\\" novel. That is one with so fewcharacters that either (a) the bad guy is obvious or (b) yourealise they all could have done it and you are just waiting forthe author to pick the guilty party.4. \\"Scooby Doo\\" never had ( cliche alert ) a \\"slam bang surpriseending\\" - and neither does this book, despite what one of theearnest \\"author-reviewers\\" says.This book is incredibly poor.

I'm reading his \\"Spin Back\\" now and it's holding my interest. I'm not into sports at all, but find that his Myron Bolitar stories are fairly interesting and can be quite amusing in spite of the sports aspect.

I cant identify with Back, the hero of the book- I think that Coben neglacted is caracters. He need to give them more depth, more personality. Despite this I love the caracter of Wa, a very strong men that practice his hands all day and have amazing power in his hands.I read other review and some review mention that the twists in the end is too much. Its not believable- too much complicated. for summary- I very like this book and now I start another book of Coben-one false move.

It certainly was a page turner.The story is told from the point of view of Beck - a pediatrician whose beloved wife was murdered eight years before. Or was she? Recent events have led him - and the FBI, and the original people who paid for the killing - to question the official story.It is also the story of love - friendship love, companionship love, parental love, and spousal love.I really enjoyed this book. There is a bit of worldview attributed to the doc that you can tell is that of the author (how he looks at his patients, and their parents, is often a topic in the book). The casual back-story of his sister and her partner, and their trials as a couple, are told almost off-hand, and aren't of huge impact to the plot, but are, nonetheless, necessary to the story. They give you a fuller picture of the supporting cast than you usually get in the summer suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harlen Coben's \\"Tell No One\\"","review":"This book is a wonderful example of a mystery/suspense book, as well as a snaking plot of surprises and twists. The underlying love between the two main characters is what makes the book connect, as the reader you root for the characters and the idea of everything working out and coming together. Harlen Coben has become a master of the creation of outlandish and unforgettable tales, as well as the ability to weave in the human elements that everyone connects to! I loved this book and would recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"definite pageturner","review":"This book caught my eye in the library's new section. I noticed a blurb by Dennis Lehane on the back cover so i took it home. I was not dissapointed. I had to stay up till 2:30 am to finish it, there was no way I was sleeping till I was through. I will definitly be checking out his other work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Humdinger of a Book!","review":"Harlan Coben is a favourite author of mine already. His earlier novels have consistently been clever, witty and generally engrossing stories. But none have showcased Coben's talent for fabricating a brilliant story to the degree of this book. Truly, it is his most intelligently-constructed novel to date. Complex, exciting, and absorbing - I read it in one sitting - till 7 in the morning on a WEEKNIGHT!This book has firmly cemented my interest in this author and I eagerly look forward any new works... I think I may even re-read some of the old ones!Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and Quick","review":"Usually I read history and biographies but every once in a while I like to read a mystery or thriller. Something that I can read quickly and not have to invest too much of myself in. This book fits that qualification well. The main characters were well thought out and very interesting. They have more dimensions that most books of this genre usually endow their characters with. The story is very fast paced and carefully plotted. A young doctors loses his wife and while not adjusting well, has come to accept the fact that she is gone. The without warning, he receives e-mail messages which leads him to believe she is still alive. This sets off an interesting search. Other characters, such as the lesbian lover of the husband's sister and the friends who try to help him in his quest, are also very well captured.I would recommend this book highly to anyone looking for a bit of a diversion.

I think the problem overall with his books is he has a tendency to use the same plot devices and writing ticks and tricks in many of his books, which means that there's a definite case of diminishing returns. But, as a one-off, if you like well plotted thrillers with credible characters and plenty of suspense, \\"Tell No One\\" is a great read. (P.S. The 2006 French film adaptation \\"Ne le Dis à Personne\\" is well worth a look too)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read This Book!!!","review":"This is argueably the best book of the genre that I have ever read.

Years later, Dr. Beck begins to receive emails from a person who knows things only his wife could. Is she dead or is she alive? That's as much as I can tell you.\\"Tell No One\\" is a great mystery and it has many layers. Frightening bad guys, kind of good bad guys such as Tyrese and likeable characters such as Dr. Beck and Shauna. Some of it is in first person and some in third person and its done in a way that isn't at all distracting. Once you open this up, you won't be able to figure out what comes next.

I kept with him throughout his awful seasrch for his \\"dead\\" wife...all the while getting thrown by awesome twists and turns.. There are surprises until the very last page! Couldn't put it down! I can't wait to try some of his other books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"4 1/2 stars for great suspense!","review":"David Beck's wife was killed eight years ago and he never really recovered, never moved on. All of the sudden on their wedding anniversary, eight years after her death, new clues begin to surface and Beck receives some mysterious emails. Is she still alive? Did David Beck kill his own wife and cover it up? Who knows the truth about that night? Now everyone gets involved: the police, the FBI, David Beck, his father in law, a local millionaire with hired hitmen, a downtown drug dealer and more. Everyone seems to have something to hide and everyone tries to uncover exactly what happened the night of her death. This book will keep you guessing until the very end. Superb suspense from Coben!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why switch narrators???","review":"I was wowed up until chapter 5, very Hitchcockian. BUT!! Suddenly he switches narrators, from 1st to third, then every other chapter the narrator switches back and forth, even within the chapters themselves. Most annoying. Harlan is clearly a good writer but this book would have been so much better if it were all in the third person or he wrote a slightly different story with the 1st person point of view."},{"rating":"1","title":"A thriller is a mystery","review":"Amazon reviewer says Tell No One is the thriller tht will break Harlan Coben out of the mystery genre. This statement is wrong on so many counts that's it hard to count them (usually when a reviewer maks a comment like that I just stop reading the review, since it shows that the reviewer has no understanding of what he or she is writing about. Thrillers are mysteries and it's the mystery plot in Tell No One tht keeps the reader going. We want to find out who killed the Scope boy and why Dave's wife is in hiding. The problem with the book is that the first person narrator (noting that other parts are third person) keeps back one piece of information until the final pages, leaving the reader conned rather than surprised. Plus since Coben does this at the very end, you don't have time to say, \\"Wait a minute, how did the killer manage to get away with it? That's how a five star book turns into a one star review. As for review, I'd give in minus 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"Too tricky for its own good, this story never grabs hold of your emotion or wills you to suspend your disbelief.

It seems like Tyler is more determined to be anti-herb than anything else, shunning even herbs that have been shown to be safe in numerous studies and years of use.

M.J. Spickett asks the questiond that most people have ignored; can the soul spilt in two. With a colourful cast of characters M.J. uniquely bends the concepts of reincarnation, magic and family together in a boy's quest for wholeness.The characters are believeable and not over shadowed by magic and special effects as so many other modern day fantasies are.

Book came in good condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"a comforting tale for kids who dream big","review":"I loved Scuffy the Tugboat as a kid, and like Scuffy I wanted to do big things. I did do big things and I want my kids to do big things too. That's why I bought this book to read to them, though it was hard to find. There's something comforting to a child's mind to know that Scuffy is right: that there are bigger things out there than his bathtub. He goes out and sees the big world and the worst that happens to him is that he is scared. But his safe bathtub is still there to come home to. And even though we adults know that Scuffy will always be a toy and will never do big things, kids know that one day they will grow up and may be ready to see the big world and do big things. But until they grow up, their safe little bathtub will always be there to come home to. That's not how we adults logically see the book, but it is a story for children, and they don't draw conclusions based on a life of experience as we do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still loved by children today","review":"A number of reviews of Scuffy refer to readers remembering it from their childhood. I can report that the book still resonates with children today. My five-year old loves it. When we read it two nights ago for the first time in months, he asked me to read it again. Then he asked for it again last night. So Scuffy, I'm happy to say, is still going strong with kids in the 21st Century! (We just bought the Scuffy 33 1/3 RPM record from an E-Bay seller - can't wait to hear it). I agree Scuffy would make a great kids movie, but they'd have to use the original illustrations or a very good imitation to make it work right for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"After the astounding Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 from Burning Spear, I expected that this would be just as great.

Elaine Bass isn't medically qualified but when Gerald was moved to comment that his daughter was 'just like him' she knew that she had to get to the bottom of the causes of his mental illness if only for her daughter's sake. Her attempts to get Gerald to talk about his problem and the details he reluctantly provided give an amazing insight into how frightening the symptoms must be. I've read superficial descriptions about people with OCD constantly washing their hands, remaking beds, but this book goes far deeper and provides some insight into how the sufferer feels and what drives them. If a friend or relative suffers from OCD this book should be essential reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Autism","review":"I read a review of this book in the Telegraph and was under the impression the book was about autism. As my husband is autistic I thought I would gain a new insight into this illness. Unfortunately the book describes post-war Britain, which in itself is very depressing, as well as the author's marriage to a man who is criminally insane. I did not find any references to autism (as I know it) in the book, except perhaps the fact that he lives in himself and is unable communicate. The violent physical attacks on the author I can not associate with autism. Also the ending is a bit strange, in as far as her daughter stays in contact and has a good relationship with him. Her sadness at his death is bewildering. All in all I can say I would not recommend this book to anyone looking for help in dealing with autism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lens for the money","review":"I bought this lens for my son's wrestling tournaments and was not disappointed. Even indoors without a flash it was fast enough for great shots when they weren't moving too fast.

At the 150 to 200mm range there is a noticeable difference between IS turned on and Off.pared with the canon 50mm f 1.4 i think i have all the glass i'll need for a while. now its just a matter of learning how to use it well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Lens","review":"Lens is great.

Since that time I've taken over 8000 photos & for the most part they're all great (some blurry due to operator error!)! I recently purchased a new camera, but am keeping my old camera as a back up so decided to put the old lens with the old camera & I'm purchasing a new one for my new camera. These lens are tough...mine gets banged around quite a bit...but they still take awesome photos. In dust, mud, humidity & extreme heat they do an awesome job. I can take close up shots (have done some portrait shots) or shots at a distance...they all look great! This lens is a great lens for a 'beginner' photographer like myself!

Yes I probably should wait a little longer before writing a review...so I may do an update later.But so far, I am absolutely in love!I am a professional photographer in Virginia and have been slowly building up my camera equipment. I am also a minimalist so I don't always believe you have to have the fanciest camera to get those amazing shots. All you need is a sturdy body and a good lens.This lens was exactly what I wanted. I needed something to go from wide to zoom without me having to change lenses. When I'm doing a wedding I don't always have time to do that.(So far) The photos I've taken are crisp and bright. I've barely had to do any editing with contrast or color or anything. I'm really thrilled with the quality.The motor is a little loud. I do agree with that. The focus is a tiny bit slow... but honestly those things aren't that big of a deal for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light Weight, Versatile, but Uneven Zoom Operation","review":"At 14 oz. this lens is very light and I liked the operation except that there was a noticable increase in force needed to zoom from about 85mm to 135mm. The barrel turned easily from 18mm to 85mm and 135 to 200mm. It also zoomed back smoothly.The lens offers a good bang for the buck, but I found the binding of the zoom mechanism distracting. I called Sigma and they offered to take it in and examine the lense, but said that some lenses will bind through some of the travel of the cam. Their customer service was easy to contact and helpful.If price is a issue, this is a good choice. Otherwise, go for the Canon70-200 F2.8L IS USM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware","review":"I was so eager to get a multi range lens(sort of a everyday carry around)that would keep me from constantly changing lens between shots, but I quickly found out that this lens was not for me. The shots were very soft focused and often presented some vignetting and dark spots. Also the lens seemed to have a hard time finding it's focus. I just was not happy and did not want to be stuck with this lens. I simply did not think it was a good investment, so after three weeks, I decided to contact the seller for a refund. The seller was not at all happy about refunding my money. He sent me a \\"not so pleasant\\" email which I thought was totally unnecessary. I had to get Amazon involved to get my money back and of course I paid the cost of the return shipping.

It was recomended to me by a friend and I'm glad I took his advice and bought it. It has a great range that will suit your needs. Although it is not the fastest lens, with enough light (or flash), it does the trick.Pros:- Great all around lens.- The focal range is what makes it my most used lens.- The weight is okay but it can get tiring around the neck. One way to alleviate that is if you carry a backpack with all your gear, attach your camera strap to the backpack (top art). This will relieve the pressure from your neck and the backpack will counter-weight the lens/camera.- Price is right for what you get.Cons:- The focus is a little slow.- Sometimes the the autofocus is not too accurate but if your doing still shots, just use manual focus.Overall, I was happy with the lens. This is a great starting lens for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ideal lens","review":"This Sigma lens, which I have had since November 2008 has been great from the very beginning. I paid around $370 for the lens, compared to over $600 for the equivalent Canon lens. Even though price was a consideration when buying this lens, I first looked up different lens reviews in magazine and at internet sites. Most of the reviews concluded that the Sigma lens was, for the most part, equivalent, or even better than the Canon lens. I photograph portraits and weddings all year long and I have always been very satisfied with the sharpness and the color hues in this lens. Many people believe that a brand name lens (Canon, Nikon) is always better and more rugged than an independent brand. Judging from my experience with this brand, SIGMA lenses (I have three Sigmas) have always been of top quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want sharpness, this isn't what you are looking for","review":"I bought this lens from Amazon last month and sold it this month. The reason ... its not sharp enough.Focal length is great. The lens is well built. The price is quite reasonable as well. The piece that I got didn't have any focusing issues either. But I was expecting it to be very sharp.It is sharp enough if you store your images online and view it zoomed out at 25%. But if you are looking to print your images, you might have to run them through Photoshop a bit to fix the softness.I would recommend it for a casual photographer who wants to carry just one lens while roaming around. I have taken out one star for its lack of sharpness.Don't expect miracles out of OS either."},{"rating":"1","title":"OS jitters very bad","review":"I purchased this as a lower cost alternative to the Sigma 18-250 for use on my Canon Xsi. Construction quality and optics seemed to be fine. The optical stabilization was something else completely. At anywhere past 1/2 zoom to full zoom, the OS caused the image in the viewfinder to jump very noticeably. I was using the lens for a lot of sports photography, so the zoom was very important. The jitters of the image at mid to high zoom were so bad I could not use the lens. Maybe I just got a defective lens asI had not seen any reviews noting this kind of issue previously. I have returned it and am rethinking whether to try the 18-250 as I had originally planned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great walk around lens","review":"Great walk around lens. With this lens I am able to shoot at a shutter speed of 1/25 of a second and get sharp pictures most of the time. My only complain is that I did get error message from my camera (Canon XTi) like the other guys several times due to poor contact between lens and the camera body. I cleaned the contacts with eraser and alcohol two times.Latter, I simply rotate the lens against the body without taking it out.It's been working fine ever since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sigma 18-200 OS","review":"Got this as a travel lens for Disney. Wanted 1 lens solution and this will fit the bill perfectly. Used the Tokina 12-24 with Canon 28-135 IS last trip, and while I got good shots, 24mm was too short on the Tokina and 28 not wide enough on the canon. Had to change lenses too often. Other than when I want really wide landscapes, I should be able to use this 90% of the time. I will still supplement with my Tokina for wide angle + small p&s; when I don't want to use the DSLR.So far, I'm really pleased with the sharpness of the Sigma and the range is great. Compares well to my sharp 28-135 in image quality. Images are sharp, although don't have as much \\"pop\\" but that can be fixed in post. Overall, I'd recommend for it's versatility and generally good image quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had too much motion blur with OS on","review":"With the OS off, got nice sharp, no motion blur shots; with OS on, I got soft focus and always got motion blur.

I'm not fool enough to believe the claims of a \\"waterless bath,\\" but I was suckered in with the notion of reducing dander and shedding. Not so. Even as a simple brush, this product falls short, as the rubbery bristles have too much flex to get through long or tangled fur.

There's an exquisite simplicity to the music, and superb musicianship; the only intruments are Ms. Williams on a 12-string guitar, and John Grimaudo on a 6-string. Though her voice might not be \\"perfect\\", it is remarkably expressive, with a unique and slightly nasal tone, and an elastic range. I find her sound much more satisfying then a lot of what I hear that is currently popular.The songs are a delight, from the familiar, like the traditional \\"Motherless Children\\", to the rarer gems like Memphis Minnie's \\"Me and My Chauffeur\\".Ms. Williams did the terrific cover photo, the remastering is excellent, and the total time is 44:20This is an easy, peaceful CD, like an old time classic that takes you back to less complicated times, it is a comfort and a treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great compilation of blues standards","review":"Anyone with an ear for blues will appreciate this record.

Her version of \\"Satisfied Mind\\" is enough to make you pick up the Bible and head for the nearest church."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure, distilled Lucinda.","review":"This is a truly excellent album. An early Williams album, it was recorded for Folkways Records, who specialized in folk, jazz and the blues. The clean, simple guitar accompanyment accentuates Lucinda's voice and the songs she sings. She has chosen a collection of songs that includes blues, country and traditional and performs them all well. The blues covers are especially good.This is a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"bruce","review":"the cd will not play or load on my computer and whom ever thought that was the best of need a trip to the wood shed and beaten two an inch of ther lifes"},{"rating":"2","title":"Customer Care","review":"This is my first time and I am amaze about your services.I appreciate it and hope you will keep it up even improve it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly organized, few good real world examples.","review":"I have no idea why my professor chose this book.

Definitely not a recommended book to support an introductory course to communications."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disorganized and confusing to someone new to this field","review":"This book is written in a manner that assumes prior experiance in this field. The communications teacher who teaches out of this text has a hard time relating subject matter to the format of the book. Almost none of the formula's are worked out and related to subject material. A paragraph of text on one page will talk about a diagram on another page,a formula on yet another page and refer to a future subject, not yet discussed but brought up. The text also talks in constant acronyms and field jargan,making it difficult to get through a paragraph without cross-referencing.I only rate this book 1 star because zero wasn't an option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks Mr. Scoops!","review":"Taboo subjects aren't cutting it in comedy any more. They're slowly being eroded away by overuse and mere shock value. What truly shocks us any more? While Patton Oswalt deals with a number of taboos, he does it with an incomparable imagination and a faculty of language. This is what comedy needs in order to evolve.I bought this CD, returned it because it skipped like crazy, replaced it with a new one and it skips like crazy. That's why I'll only give it 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless and boring","review":"Once again, the same old juvenile humor. BORING!

Yet the reviews on here mostly claim it was hilarious????Ok, I've come to the conclusion, the only people writing positive reviews on Amazon MUST be the people trying to sell the junk.I've seen this guy on some tv shows, and on comedy central, and he's a somewhat funny guy, but it is painful to listen to this CD. You can feel the awkwardness of the crowd, not knowing if or when to laugh. And it continues throughout the entire CD. There don't seem to be any jokes on the CD at all. It is all disconnected negative rants from a bitter angry human being.Don't believe me? Then go ahead and waste your money on this horrible piece of junk, and see for yourself.Like my review title says, Do NOT read the positive reviews. Just read the negative ones, and decide how credible they seem. Then make your decision to buy or not buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as funny the first, fifth or twentieth time","review":"I'm a huge fan of Patton's stand-up and have seen him perform live many times, so few of these routines were new to me. (The porn spam bit was one I hadn't heard before.) But what separates good comedy from great comedy is its repeatability, and that's what makes this CD a must-buy. I still laugh and laugh at classic Oswalt bits like \\"80's Metal,\\" \\"Steak\\" and \\"Your Moment of Irony.\\" And \\"Robert Evans\\" slays me every single time. If you're new to Oswalt's stand-up, buy this CD and enjoy what you've been missing; if you're a long-time fan, you'll be glad for the opportunity to be able to listen to Patton without a two-drink minimum."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST","review":"Most masterful turn of phrase in the comedy world.Hilarious, dark, wonderfully bizarre.If you don't find this funny, turn yourself in and get a new you.

However, I am a fan of Ng See Yuen and Corey Yuen's fight chereography action films which is why I have rated this DVD number 4.

After losing miserably to his rival, Trevor in that particular martial arts tournament he decides to carry on his sensei's dream to become a Shaolin Monk and to seek further assistance from the monestary.

The story is set in a party where the guests wear modern suits and dresses and drink prosecco... In the middle of it, an elevator brings Jochanaan, who is dressed like a beggar. Embarrassing, to say the least. When the staging is so bad, it is pointless to discuss the music. A CD would have been much better.People say that modern stagings are important to bring new audiences to the opera... I think that such a garbage can scare people off. Modern stagings should be creative, not just make fun of the opera."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok but the 2004 performance was better","review":"Mattila is showing her age and anyone who raves about this performance must not have heard many performances or recordings. It's ok but leaves something to be desired - aside from a decent staging.

I will use this soft store collapsible product for traveling with our dog, but not for everyday use because I like the other product better for everyday use.

Seals exceptionally well, is fully air tight, and stores easily. Need two hands to open it - one on the lid and one on the bag rim; I have a weak hand and I struggle to open it. It collapses well as it is emptied, so the food doesn't go stale. Filled with 30 lbs of a dense dog food (Solid Gold), and bag was filled ~2/3 to 3/4 full."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Purchase -Gets The Job Done!","review":"The Soft Store Collapsible Food Storage Container is just what I was looking for. It is well constructed and easy to operate. It only takes a damp sponge to wipe it down and keep clean. There is a strong handle for lifting and the top is phenomenal. It twists on/off with ease (and I have a little carpal tunnel) and makes a tight seal. The best part is the way the bag collapses down to the amount of food in the container, restricting air getting in to make the food go stale. I am completely pleased with this product, it takes up limited space, and does as advertised. Worth the price, for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small book about a big city","review":"I've never been to NY. But I'd like to. So I thought I had found something special. And I was right. For someone from a far country like me this book can be interesting. It contains about 50 black & white photos by various authors (e.g. Todd Webb, Sid Kaplan, Mary Ellen Mark) along with short commentaries. The photos concentrate more on sociological occurrences and events of city's history than on its architecture. One could only wish bigger format of the book and more photos in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heist is a waste of time and money","review":"My husband and I hadn't been to a movie in ages and decided this movie looked interesting. Wrong. The twists were confusing and the plot and the charactors were poorly written. We left in the middle of the movie. We thought the scene where the pilots were abducted was in poor taste after what happened Sept. 11. Gene Hackman looked too old to be playing a con man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Severely lacking","review":"The Heist has a slow moving storyline that keeps the audience wondering when it's going to end. The characters for the most part are poorly developed and lack the cohesion necessary for a good film. The one aspect of this movie that could have pulled it out was the twists and turns when trying to figure out where the gold is, but unfortunately it's not quite enough to hold things together. Wait for the T.V. premier for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the David Mamet devotee only","review":"I had forgotten that this was a Mamet work until the stilted dialogue and theatrical staging reminded me of other films by him. The viewer can see everyone acting. Hackman is better than his material here. Implausible triple crosses."},{"rating":"1","title":"just not good","review":"this movie sucks. ending is predictable. the line about being as quiet as an ant pissing on cotton was ALMOST good. Reservoir Dogs--now there's a heist film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good At All","review":"This movie was not good at all. It was completly boring.I went into the theater thinking i would love it because i really like Gene Hackman, and Danny Devito, but the cast did not help.It was so boring, that i fell asleep, and i have never fallen asleep during a movie ever in my life.I cant remember one second during that movie, that I was being entertained.If you want to be entertained, go rent Memento.Dont waste your time with this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Turn After Another","review":"A very good movie with many big names that presented one twist after another. By the end of it, you know another twist os coming, you just don't know where from. You can sense it and you have ideas but you don't know for sure. It only gets 4 stars since you can sense the twists, not totally unexpected. But still very good.It is a movie about a heist (obviously) and bad guys and badder guys, no good guys here. Double crossing and triple crossing and double crossing again. Other reviews have layed out the names and plot so I have narrowed my review to a very general view. But this movie should be watched, it is very entertaining. Lots of violence and swearing but no bed scenes. Not as good as the movie Heat, about the same type of \\"crew\\" but still very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a good wine, Gene Hackman gets better with age","review":"This story was terrific! I won't say it was the best I've ever seen - how many times do you see that in a review? Gene Hackman and Danny DeVito were great as were the other supporting actors. A very realistic crime story with Hackman as the cagey old master of the art of big time robberies, and DeVito, in his best role to date, as the middle man or \\"fence\\". The movie went by way too fast - I wanted more. If you enjoy Gene Hackman's typical style, you're going to love this movie. I bought the DVD and I ain't selling this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Another Heist Movie","review":"\\"Heist\\" is, well, an heist movie like so many others. This one goes completely by the book and is uninspired at all levels. Gene Hackman gives a standart, average performance as the burglar who starts having problems with his mates. This is a \\"who fools who?\\" picture, it has some required though predictable twists at the end and the character motivations remain unclear. In fact, the characters themselves remain unclear, since they don\`t speak all that much and the dialogue is poor. Acclaimed director David Mamet glues scene after scene with little creativity, so most of them turn to be boring and lifeless. This just seems like a weak episode of some late-night cable b-tv series. Dull, unsurprising and shallow, one to avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated junk","review":"I couldn't get into the movie really, I kept getting distracted by the boom. After a while it became ridiculous. I saw the movie in the theater so maybe this problem was fixed on the DVD. In one scene, you can see it for at least 15-20 seconds. I thought it should have been credited as a character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreck","review":"Rebecca Pidgeon? Involved with a project like this disgusting movie? Her father used to teach at MIT. I feel sorry for his disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Average","review":"this film reminded of alot of other movies from the 90's onward.Heavy on Language to override a thin plot&any reasoning why things are blowing up&seeming overacted&scripted.Gene Hackman is a Great Actor but aside from Delroy Lindo(a Very Underrated Actor I might add)the rest of the acting are just standing there knowing this film is finished&figured out right after the Airport take over.very average at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suspicious lack of extra features","review":"The most laughable scene entails Hackman 'expertly' allaying the fears of a cop in a routine roadside check by over-acting to such an extent that he would have created less suspicion simply dressed as Osama Bin Laden.Throughout the picture I was distracted by a guy who looked just like the singer Midge Ure during his 'Ultravox' period. Appropriately enough, as this means nothing to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gene Hackman is so awesome!","review":"This is just another typical \\"Heist\\" film. but Hackman really shines in it. He brought my review up with his acting! He is just such a great actor.Plus, it's a Mamet project, and I am weary of his films. I've been disappointed in the past. \\"spanish prisoner\\" was just so awful! i remember hating that movie. Mamet has hit and misses, and heist is more of a hit. certainly one of the better films of 2001.There were some great lines in the film and the acting was decent. The ending was a surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Heist","review":"I chose this rating because I have been looking for this movie for a while. I couldn't remember how it ended and I finally found the video and got to see the movie. If you like some suspence, rent or buy The Heist. Gene Hackman does a good job. Mom would enjoy this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"I was really looking forward to this movie - how could I resist a movie with Danny DeVito, Gene Hackman AND Delroy Lindo! Granted, I had been burned by Mamet before (I thought The Spanish Prisoner was obvious and unoriginal), but with his gift for dialouge, and some of the best actors in the business, how could it fail? Well, a battleship with all of the plot holes in this film would sink instantly! The characters are poorly developed, and do things that make no sense at all. The scene on the pier in Boston was so implausible it was laughable, and the ending made no sense whatsoever. If you want to see a good movie of this type, see Mamet's House of Games, but avoid Heist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I'm told (and some of the reviews below would seem to confirm it) that David Mamet is highly rated as a scriptwriter. Strange, as the dialogue throughout this terrible movie is some of the worst I can remember. These are the most flacid 'tough guy' scenes to come out of the supposed home of this stuff in a long time, and humourous it is not. The acting is ordinary, the plot convoluted and cliched, and Mamet's much-vaunted 'style', in this film at any rate, adds up to a long string of shots that reminded me, eerily, of The A-team and Knight-rider..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry David - Its one of the worst....","review":"Without going into an unnecessarily verbose explanation, this is quite simply one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. The plot is twisted to the point of silliness, the dialogue is stilted and unrealistic and the casting is questionable (people kept laughing at Danny De Vito's character - and he wasn't being funny!). The action packed shootem-up climax at the harbour had the whole cinema laughing it was so ridiculous and the ending brought applause for the fact we could all go home. Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"The real HEIST was when they got my 5.25 for the matinee","review":"Maybe I expected too much from this movie when I saw the list of stars (who I thought did a good job overall - I really liked Pinky), but I thought this movie just drug on and on and wouldn't stop. The story was just not that interesting or innovative. There's millions of movies out just like it with some old experienced thief - blah blah blah. I think they could have made this movie about half as long. It probably would have been better, and my knees wouldn't have gotten stiff.I'd say if you have to see it, wait for it on video (if you have spare change). Or even better, cable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"Gene Hackman + Danny DeVito + Delroy Lindo - What more could you ask for?? I guess a bit more - Very limited action - too many plots and changes which were not needed - talked about the reason Hackman was doing one more score but never really used it as part of the plot - ending was not even close to being a surprise - should have ended with the boat cruise and never stopped at the dock. All attempts at using DeVito's comedy style just did not fit the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"David Mamet's worst film","review":"I'm a huge David Mamet fan, but this film is unwatchable. Mostly because of Gene Hackman's god awful performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pants","review":"It is always disappointing to see good actors in poor films, you would think by now Gene Hackman could be more selective of his scripts.The Heist has a mandatory 'twist' every 10 minutes most of which have no bearing on the film and are rarely clever, they just end up making the writer look silly. The final twist is a joke, I found myslef laughing out loud at this film and having to remind myself that it is intended to be a straight crime thriller not a comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely shallow","review":"the fact that critics such as Ebert and the NY Times guy gave this positive reviews goes to show how irrelevent critics are. They see this film is by David Mamet and are so shallow themselves that they see an amaturish script and talk themselves into believing it is minimalistic. This film was so boring, predictable and just plain uninteresting that I would have loved to see it in the theatre just to see people's faces when they left and realized they paid to see this garbage. Oh and that final scene where Rockwell and Pidgeon confront Hackman and take his truck......think about it, how did he know they would be coming at that exact moment and if so, why did he not just leave before them instead of assuming they would take the \\"gold\\" and still let him live...just many hole sin a script that is embarassing to all involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie [was bad]","review":"This is a good movie if you like slow movies. The action does not really get intense and enjoyable until almost the end. The beginning is boring and not entertaining.My best advice - Rent it before you buy it and if you like it buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"Hackman, Lindo, DeVito, Mamet, what more could you ask for? Well, maybe a film that wasn't deadly boring, entirely unbelievable, and enough to convince me that Mamet's \\"great language\\" really is forced, stilted, phony, and painful to listen to, at least here. I loved Glegarry, and some other of Mamet's stuff, but this is embarassing. I don't mind one or two unbelievable moments in a film like this, I mean it is the movies after all, but you can suspend your belief less while watching pro-wrestling than this sorry mess, so much is entirely beyond belief. No clothes on this emperor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Profoundly Bad Movie","review":"This is one of the worst movies released in the last decade. Ridiculous dialogue, horrible screenplay, atrocious acting by all. This is the lamest double triple double cross plots ever written. I was shocked at how bad this movie is. Do not rent let alone buy this movie because you will be very disappointed. So sad too because Danny DeVito and Gene Hackman are two of my favorites. After watching this mess I will have to hesitate prior to committing my time to their future work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"If you think, like me, that David Mamet is a brilliant writer, you're bound to be disappointed by Heist. This is a decidedly minor work in the screenwriter/director's career. It has some good lines (\\"Everyone needs money. That's why they call it money\\") and a fine cast, but it seems contrived and even fake. Mamet can certainly do better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good film","review":"The nice thing abou tthis film is that I wasn't sure about the ending. There were so many cons within cons taht I'm not entirely sure that her leaving with the younger turk seemingly betraying Gene Hackman wasn't just another twist on their ultimate plan.That shows a great movie. And of course everyone here are terrific actors. Some movies are simply good exercise for everyone's skills and not huge, mega blockbusters or overwhelming success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twist","review":"Yes This is another David Mamet movie. If your ask for his moviesyou need to expect dialogue. The Dialogue is very profound. The aiport scene tends to drag along. It is an interesting thriller and crime movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was robbed!","review":"I expected a Mamet film with Gene Hackman to be at least entertaining, but NO! Lots of strained dialogue, bad casting in several roles, and an overly complex plot that lost my interest halfway through resulted in a waste of money. Maybe on pay-per-view but not worth a DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Noir by way of off-broadway","review":"Congragulations to david mamet for combining the elements of classic noir, stage drama and crowd pleasing adventure in Heist.Heist has a multi-layered story with a fantastic performance by Gene Hackman as the center-piece. Equally impressive are sam Rockwell,in a typical Rockwell type role, and Ricky Jay, one of the most under rated actors on the modern screen.What starts out as a one last big job before retirement turns into a twisting and turning funhouse of murder and mayhem.This is what I expected to see when I rented The Score last year.Mamet has a great ear for stinging dialogue and that is evident throughout this film. While not as intense as House of Games or as thought provoking as Homicide, Heist is still solid intelligent entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"just okay","review":"Hackman's acting is just not good. I know Hackman fans will hate me for this, but I don't like it at all. The plot is alright and the other actors are good, but I don't recommend it as a movie to run out and see. The method of the robbery itself was good, and original, but that's all there was besides the sexy Rebecca Pidgeon, I thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superfluous Plot","review":"The movie starts off interesting. The story developes with satisfying complexity and mystery.However, as it gets towards the end, there are too many \\"gatcha\\"s and \\"surprise!\\"s and \\"not so easy\\"s and \\"fooled you!\\"s that it gets too unrealistic, it wasn't even cool anymore. The characters didn't convey enough emotions to make it convincing either. We ended up walking out of theater saying, \\"Yeah, right.\\"Too bad because like I said, the first half of the movie was pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart & Gritty Comedy of Errors.","review":"I enjoyed this film immensely. Not your standard let's plan a job, get some fast money, who has the money flick that's so overdone these days. Hackman and Lindo put in great performances in the fashion that made them famous. You have to watch this film, it's not all about action, how the characters interact is more of what the movie is about. Great Movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been so much better","review":"With the cast this movie had I was expecting much more. The acting isn't bad, it's the story that I didn't like.

They are sturdy, not flimsy, and the tummy controls really work without being at all uncomfortable. In fact, these jeans are much more comfortable than the elastic-on-the-sides jeans I used to wear, because they don't bind at the waist, or pinch there when I sit down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking dissonance for want of what??","review":"A strange concept - to release an album of previously released material that is 'based on' live shows. Although their cloak of mystery and craft seems apparent, the songs suffer from relative mediocrity. Most versions are better in other incarnations, but you can get the single version of \\"Eardrum Buzz\\" here, which is mandatory. \\"In Vivo\\" should have been a hit single worldwide and \\"Illuminated\\" is years ahead of its time. The version of \\"Over Theirs\\" is quite inferior to the one on \\"The Ideal Copy\\" (in fact, I think I'll have to play that one now) and overall this album is a showcase of their knack for reworking the same song into other realms (which has been done better on ep's and live bonus cuts) but not very convincing. A bland attempt at being palatable for an audience that turned a deaf ear. I'll stick with the ambitious stuff, thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This CD is great even if you are not a Wire fan.

Out of all the adult swim shows I have seen (robot chicken, aqua teen, metalocalypse, boondocks) this one was undeniably boring and uninteresting.

Birdman: Obscure but funny","review":"One night about a year ago I turned on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim and encountered Harvey Birdman Attorney at Law. Not only was it energetic and entertaining but has actually comedy written into it, go figure. But the best part is it takes old Hanna Barbara characters and used them in the episodes. For example in Volume one we encounter Harvey representing Dr. Quest. Race Bannon has taken the boys because he feels like he is more their father then Dr. Quest. The boys,Johnnie and Haji, portray characters with irony and attitude. Other episode include Fred Flinstone, Scooby Doo, and characters you haven't seen in thirty years. I like Harvey's boss the most. I have no idea who he is but he is off the wall funny.If you are between 35 and 65, love cartoons, like courtroom hi-jinx, then you've got to get Harvey Birdman.

Then the outer top contact whiskers are too long, had to cut them off by 1/8\\" each. Then the retains clip is paper thin, this indicator lever stud clip became a nightmare, I ended up drilling / tapping out the stud to metric .05 and used a threaded set screw, which is commonly found in many junk electronics.

This addition of thier first album has been remixed for stereo and in most cases sounds poor. Roger's voice on a couple of tracks sounds muffled. The albums classic title track was remixed so much that it bares little resemblance to the version we all know and love (which can be found on the bonus disc). I have been a Who fan for the past 23 years and can recognise some subtle differences in some of the past remasters, but even a Who novice could tell in one listen that there's something wrong with this edition. The only bonus to this CD is some unreleased material and the the wonderful liner notes.

On this recording, that as well as several other songs are well done - God Save the People, All For the Best, Beautiful City, and On the Willows are very well represented. However, many other tracks are just dull; there is no feeling at all in Bless the Lord My Soul, Alas For You, or We Beseech Thee; they are totally flat.

I grew up in Michigan and have fished some of the same places mentioned in the book. He shares some very fasinating childhood tales. I couldn't put it down until I had read it from cover to cover. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine read...","review":"Jerry weaves a number of tales from his boyhood through life with fine dexterity and aptitude towards the human experience. The short story of Christmas and the death of his friends father was especially touching. You won't be diappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A happy discovery","review":"I bought this 2-CD set after my entirely fortuitous \\"discovery\\" of the works of Avison, and I'm happy to say that it now ranks among my favorites. As one who enjoys 18th-century classical music (and Bach in particular), I would not hesitate to recommend this Naxos recording to someone looking to augment his or her collection with the works of an excellent but lesser-known composer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Nice","review":"I enjoy finding as much (Atlantic Records) studio talk as I can, then use it to form my own opinion of people. Ahmet was business minded, and fair, but if someone changed something without his approval, he'd scold. This was true of a [unknown] black female, for removing a bar, during Bobby's studio session \\"Queen Of The Hop\\".Was nice to see Tom Dowd, who I admire. Overall, the documentary was enjoyable! Was funny to find Led Zeppelin locked Ahmet out of the studio, maybe so their first hit wasn't Whole Lotta Splish Splash! Still not sure why black oriented music began to die during the late '60's, wish there was more about this in this film, causing Atlantic [and others] to contract more and more white artists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre, at best","review":"Two hours on Atlantic Records, and literally not one word about some of the most important music in American history: the Atlantic recordings of Ornette Coleman, Charles Mingus or John Coltrane. While the pop stuff's great, these, along with Ray Charles (who is well represented here), are the very things that make Atlantic different from every other label."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it","review":"I'm a professional horn player and teacher. This is a good tool for beginning brass players, certainly a better option than holding the mouthpiece separately and buzzing on it. It doesn't quite provide amazing or fast results, but what can? For my youngest struggling student it seemed tp make things harder, probably because it just works / feels different than playing into the horn. I didn't find it as helpful for myself (professional level) for the same reason, though I know other advanced players who like them, and an intermediate student of mine seems to do really well with it. To be fair, I'm not a big proponent of mouthpiece buzzing anyway, and if you are (eg if you warm up that way every day, or whatever) you'll probably like this quite a bit.In short, it's worth trying out. Even if you don't love it and use it a lot, it will teach you something new about your playing which is always useful. It's a nice tool to have around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth looking into","review":"Essentially, there is no reason to buy this. Use your mouthpiece. Really! This is a ridiculous item and a solid waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great collection of live yardbirds classics","review":"this is a great collection of classic yardbirds. on some of the songs, the guitars are somewhat muddy, but other than that, it's a timeless piece of rock history. too much monkey buisness is mindblowing, jeffs guitarwork is great. On little games, i think that there was too much reverb as opposed to the studio version. regardless, this is a great collection of live recordings. i don't know if this would be a good first yardbirds cd, but it's deffinately essential."},{"rating":"1","title":"only for the hardcore","review":"I thought this album had potential.... unfortunately, I should have listened to the online cuts b4 ordering it. The sound quality is \\"early sixties transistor radio\\" and is full of those anoying discjockey overdubs and \\"interviews\\" we all love and cherish. Reminds me of the \\"early years\\" scenes from \\"this Is Spinal Tap\\" video, especially \\"I ain't got you\\" which sounds verbatim like \\"Gimme sum Money\\"...Not recommended... buy something recorded in a decent sound studio"},{"rating":"2","title":"ahead of their time","review":"These 26 mono tracks were recorded live, for BBC broadcasts, between 1965 and 1968. The first 20 have a guy named Jeff Beck playing electric guitar; the other 6 are a fella named Jimmy Page. Some of the material is the familiar, blues-based Yardbirds fare, but there are some surprising covers as well (Chuck Berry's \\"Too Much Monkey Business,\\" The McCoys' \\"Hang On Sloopy\\"). Beck and Page are both already demonstrating their ability to coax some \\"unique\\" tones out of that guitar.There is 75:12 of material here; the brief dialogue, interviews, etc., between some of the songs are entertaining. The recording quality is a little on the \\"muddy\\" side, but very tolerable for the most part.Yardbirds / Jeff Beck / Jimmy Page devotees should enjoy this disk, as should anyone who is interested in british blues-rock from the mid-60s."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, no, no...","review":"This is difficult, because I am reviewing as a parent and not a child and my review is mostly based on the Amazon price, not entirely on the movie. My 7 year old daughter watched this, and thought it was fine - as far as I can tell she liked it. The one star rating is for the $2.99 price for a 23 minute \\"movie.\\" I think the entire thing was shot in a day - at one location - and just low, low production quality. Again, for kids it's fine, but I think it should be priced appropriately for what it is.If it was $.99 or less, then my rating might be 3 stars. My daughter would probably give it 4 stars - after all... the Olsen twins are pretty cute little girls, even if their acting at that time is not the best, still cute to watch for little kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finish Was Haphazard","review":"For all the touting of craftsmanship, it was really quite a sloppily painted piece. Very disappointing given the high price and high expectation. I returned it, but purchased it again when Amazon dropped the price to $15. At that price, my expectation is lower and I'm quite happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm returning it","review":"With shipping, I paid almost $100 for the white provencal salt and pepper mills. I purchased them directly from Vic Firth website. I'm totally disgusted with the product. The blue trim on the salt mill is smudged. And the wood on the pepper mill is not totally smooth under the paint. For this kind of money, you would expect sheer perfection. Given the sloppy appearance of these items, I have no confidence that they will last. I think Vic Firth should go back to making wooden drum sticks. I'm going to return these items and buy some high end Peugeot mills."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the better books in a not very good series","review":"This is actually one of the better books in this series, which is not very good. This book had a bit of a darker feel to it, and thus felt more like Star Wars than the other books in the series. However, this book may have been somewhat entertaining, but that can not take away the fact that the writing is cheesy, the characters undeveloped and not like themselves, most especially Luke, and the intire plot is somewhat silly. Kids too young or to lazy to read Young Jedi Knights, or Heir to the Empire, but would still like to see the Star Wars story continued would probably like this series. Fans older than twelve would probably get more enjoyment out of just about anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought that this book was interesting.","review":"These series of books got my intrest in that they don't have to do with anything about the movie, like there is no Zorba the Hutt in thye movie, yet there is one in the book. I recomend this book to kids ages from 9-21. This is an exciting series of books. If there are readers that like short chapter books and like the Star Wars movies, you should read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for those still in grade school","review":"I couldn't get into it, but my 8 year old son did. These were illustrated and interesting, as they were written Pre-Zahn Thrawn trilogy. If you want star wars for young kids that are readable and have pictures, check out the darkhorse comics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended!","review":"This novel begins with a woman helping her elderly neighbor move into a retirement home. The elderly lady keeps giving her heirlooms to the woman, knowing the woman is a collector of antiques and an armchair historian. One of the things she passes along is her grandmother's diary -- a journal kept when the grandmother, Mattie, travelled West with her husband to set up a homestead in the Colorado Territory. The rest of the novel is the diary itself -- a marvelous story that made me think constantly of the \\"Little House\\" books. I really enjoyed this novel a lot and look forward to reading Dallas's other books. Highly recommended to anyone who misses the Ingalls or loves stories about strong women pioneers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book!","review":"What a hard and frightening time Mattie had! How did those women survive? This is a very good, very believable story. Hard to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't fool me for a minute","review":"While the \\"Diary of Mattie Spenser\\" paints a true-sounding, not-very-pretty picture of frontier life, it fairly shouts \\"This is historical fiction\\". I never fully believed in the characters; except for Mattie they're not really brought to life. I agree with the reviewer who felt the author had a list of characters and plot devices that she \\"ticked off\\" to a not-very-surprising conclusion. But I must admit I've been spoiled. I read the magical, lyrical, clever and delightful \\"These is My Words\\" first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light and enjoyable","review":"This book is not deep, but of course it doesn't have to be to make enjoyable reading. I thought it was a bit too modern in sensibilities to be believable, but it's easy to forgive Ms. Dallas for that since she created a heroine in Mattie who is so easy to like. Everyone in our reading circle gave \\"Mattie\\" thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"An endearing look at frontier life from a woman's viewpoint","review":"While I would not consider this book a classic work of fiction, it was so entertaining and wonderful that I did not put it down until I was done. (Reading while I was cooking dinner.) Sandra Dallas has an ability to express the inner thoughts and feelings of women in such a way that they become your friends. You begin to care about them and it's almost as if you're having a conversation with a friend. That's the feeling I got when I read both this book and The Persian Pickle Club. They are both wonderful reads and give you a real sense of the different times and places in which the books are set."},{"rating":"2","title":"To the author: Hey, nice job! I really enjoyed your book.","review":"I picked up this book on a whim, always interested to read a Diary-type format as they read quickly and yet you feel \\"sneaky\\" and intrusive somehow reading what you would normally view as personal text. Mattie Spenser was really a rebel in her own day, questioning why women had to constantly submit to every whim and demand of a man. The book is interesting throughout - yet as a woman living in the 90's - I sure woulda changed the ending! Thank God women have come as far as they have. Great read Sandra Dallas.....keep 'em coming."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Diary of Mattie Spenser","review":"I enjoyed this book , but would not consider it a \\"great read\\". I found the content to be very interesting, but I generally do not enjoy the Diary format, and I ws a bit bored with Mattie's style. In addition, I felt as if the adventures and misadventures of Mattie Spenser were too numerous to be believable. I think that the major obstacle, besides the hard work of settling a new land, and the dangers of doing that, would have been unbelievable boredom and loneliness . I just finished Willa Cather's My Antonia, which is a classic written in 1918, dealing with the same subject, and the difference in styles is very dramatic. Cather writes literature. Dallas writes a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like peeking into an actual personal jounal...","review":"I have now read three of Sandra Dallas' four books and have loved all three. This book is about a young woman who heads west to Colorado, married to a man she hardly knows. I kept forgetting at times that it was not a true story. The book details the hard life on the Colorado plains, her husband's wandering eye and heart and her heartbreaks and triumphs. This is NOT a romance novel but more like a history of one pioneer woman, her friends and her life. After reading Ms. Dallas' first two books, I e-mailed the author to tell her how much I have enjoyed her novels and she actually answered the e-mail back herself! I was really surprised at that. She is currently working on another book to be out sometime next spring and I am anxiously awaiting its publication. This is just a good solid read, hard to put down..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A special story I crawled inside...","review":"I read 40 to 50 books a year. My sister loaned this title to me. It sat among my load of \\"to read\\" books for weeks. When I picked it up, I could barely put it down. It's a strong story of pioneers, of the fortitude of women, of the endurance of friendship. I really enjoyed the journal format of writing. Cannot wait to read Ms. Dallas' other books. This story will stay with me for a long time. Not for a minute would I want her to tell me less about life on the prairie. And the marriage ups and downs are true to modern relationships. A GOOD READ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing & Infuriating","review":"This is terrific story told from the perspective of a young pioneer bride settling in Colorado territory. I call this amazing since it IS amazing that people could survive and thrive under such hardships, harsh weather, Indian attacks, and above all the isolation. It is infuriating because not only does Mattie have to overcome the elements... her worst enemies are her 'friends'. It is no secret that humans are and have been throughout history, bigoted, racist, & misogynistic. Mattie deals with these issues, and rises above...A terrific story. 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really \\"historical\\" fiction","review":"I had high expectations for this book, and the author, but both fell short in the end. I did somewhat enjoy the story of Mattie & Luke Spenser, but was disappointed in the continual references to sex. While they were veiled in language of the day, the fact still remains that nary a chapter passes without a reference to sex, which is a sad commentary on literature in our times. I mean, really. Is it necessary to pepper every single book with sexual references? Can't a story stand on it's own merit?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Formula for Success","review":"Sandra Dallas tells good tales. The Diary of Mattie Spenser has intriguing turns. New Mercies has southern charm. Unfortunately, Dallas succumbs to decorating her books with the bric-a-brac of pseudo research--without integrating it into the tale. It glows like Mattie's silver spoons in a sod house. Dallas demonstrates no mastery of letting her characters speak --choosing rather to sprinkle the dialog with newspaper headlines and abrubt colloquialisms. One does not have to include every historical figure, building, or event in a book. Dallas has the talent to write well; it is unfortunate that she chooses formulas which no doubt drive and satisfy publishers but do not create good writing. A warning to readers--positive reviews can indicate that others have abandoned a book because it was not worth reading. Before you waste money on Dallas books, sample her writing from the local library."},{"rating":"2","title":"A glimpse into the hardships of prairie life","review":"An interesting way to learn of the difficulties pioneers had in settling the Colorado Territory. Mattie is an admirable character who meets the challenges of prairie life and marital disappointment with courage and integrity.

Your $20 is better spent on something that works as it should."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"As the other reviewer experienced, the reception was awful.

We got this gift as a Christmas present, my daughter (and I) loved the concept- but from the moment we opened it, it would not work. I called the company who said there was nothing they could do unless we had the receipt. They were not friendly and certainly not helpful. Since we got it as a gift from out of town relatives, we are out of luck. What a waste of plastic. This is the last Little Tikes product I will buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be, should be... but it isn't","review":"This toy could have been great fun, but it's not at all. As with the others here, I know this toy is a waste of money and time. I've had great luck with all other Little Tikes toys, too bad they really dropped the ball on this one. I think the company should offer to buy back ALL of the sets they sold, but I don't imagine that will ever happen. I certainly wish I had wasted money on this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs MUCH improvement!","review":"My daughters received this toy as a Christmas present. The concept is certainly wonderful; we were all very excited to use the phones. We wound up very disappointed. The first set we had didn't work. One phone's receiver was dead. We exchanged them at Toys-r-us without a problem. We should have gotten our money back! The next set worked, just not very well. Only a few of the buttons actually push, which was a disappointment for the kids. The phones have a dial that clicks each one on and controls the volume. The girls NEVER remember to click them off. There are adapter ports, but the girls wanted to move from room to room as they played. The reception is very poor. The box says they are receptive up to 300 feet, but the girls had trouble understanding each other when they were in neighboring rooms. We love the idea, hate the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY DOESN'T WORK","review":"Not that I am typing anything new, but what a disappointment. My daughter cried for an hour because I couldn't get this cool idea of a toy to work. Too bad 4 year olds actually want to play with their toys rather than pretend they really work. Thumbs down to Little Tikes, they failed miserably on this one. Save your money, don't buy this....or spend more and buy your kids, grandkids...whatever some cool walkie-talkies so they can actually talk to each other and play. Brand new, this toy does not work AT ALL."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOW DID THIS GET ONTO THE SHELVES!","review":"I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this for my son's 3rd birthday Dec. 31. He cried and cried when I told him it had to go back because it was broken. Flat out - the toy does not work. The other phone does not ring when you call it - your phone rings, you cannot hear the other person talking - when it works at all (which is rarely) it sounds like the worst drive-through speaker you've ever encountered. I've been waiting for months for this toy to come out, and I honestly don't see how it made it onto the shelves because it's not like it doesn't work great, it doesn't work AT ALL. Big disappointment, and I will definitely think twice before getting another little tykes brand. We were disappointed last year with their phone with answering machine too. I'd actually give it a zero star rating if that was a choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to all of us!","review":"As others have stated, I have had the same problems. Save you money and look for something better. I usually try to test the toys out before giving it to my kids so as to avoid the disapointment. I also returned two sets of phones and will be looking elsewhere for a better set. It would be a great toy if it worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good in the box","review":"This is a dad review. What a Christmas bomb this was! Our boys (2 & 5) love telephones and my wife and I thought what a great gift idea. Wrong. Where do I begin? First, who at Little Tykes designed the hand pieces? Did they actually think to measure the head size of a three year old child? The mouth piece ends up on the cheek of most children, blocking the already pathetic reception these toys have. My wife and I tried them at 10 feet (putting our mouth up to the transmitter) with only occassional static bursts for voice. This is with brand new eveready alkaline batteries in. They immediately went to the shelf and I will try to send back for a refund. Save your money and use two cans and a string, it will work better."},{"rating":"1","title":"be warned!","review":"I bought this toy for my 2 and 4 year old for Christmas and they were very disappointed that it didn't work at all.

We opened it on Christmas morning and I immediately put some batteries in. What a disappointment!First thing I noticed is that 6 of the 10 buttons are glued in place. I expected each button to make a beep, but nothing.Second thing we discovered is how poorly the walkie talkie function works. It took us several tries and it seems to work sometimes, but not others. Even with the volume maxed it is very difficult to hear the other person and the ringer only sounds in the handset.Third it is poorly constructed. We boxed it back up and are returning it this week. Luckily grandma got him another phone toy that works much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Theu're baa-aack!","review":"I just want to confirm, this product is back on shelves and, apparently, has not received any improvement.

When you push one of the three buttons that actually works, your own phone rings.

This was so suprising, with the great track record Little Tikes has...I love most of their products.

I think Little Tikes knew they had a lemon and removed it as soon as possible -- or as soon at the holiday rush ended & they had made their money. It is horrible!! As other reviewers have stated, the sound quality is terrible. Little Tikes should be ashamed of themselves for putting such a poor quality item on store shelves. This toy is junk. I wouldn't even pay 50 cents for it at a yard sale.Follow up/review addendum: As unhappy as I was with this product, I do have to say that Kids Station came thru in terms of customer service. A manager called me back, and kindly offered me a full refund for the product, and sent me a new set of phones! I still give the product itself 1 star, but I have to give Kids Station 5 stars for demonstrating the true meaning of customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT LITTLE TIKES","review":"Great idea but...The battery connection for these are wrong so the batteries dont fit correctly which means the phone doesnt work right.

The fun of hearing his pretend conversations is worth at least $10 to me! LOL. I am glad however, that I got this on a buy one get one free promotion with another Little Tikes toy that we like. I do agree, this is far below typical Little Tikes quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible execution of a great idea","review":"It's a proximity device that is composed of a base unit and a fob to attach to the pet's collar. The base unit is purported to emit an ultrasonic sound when a pet wearing the fob gets within 10 feet. It has a switch that toggles to \\"cat\\" or \\"dog.\\"My experience:1. Its proximity sensor is sporadic at best.2. The base unit's reception is hindered by doors and fluorescent lights. Its range is not adjustable.3. The ultrasonic sound is perceptible throughout the house, and despite the \\"cat/dog\\" switch, is ALWAYS heard by dogs. Not nice at all.4. The fobs require nickel-sized computer-type batteries that require bi-weekly replacement to the tune of 4 smackers per.5. The technical support is paltry. In fact, they ditched two of my four calls!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT YOUR AVERAGE \\"STONER\\" FILM!","review":"One of the perks of having Direct TV is getting to view first run movies in my home for free! 'Humboldt County' is a very good film, portraying pot smokers, not as cartoonish morons who can't finish a sentence or thought, but smart people who choice the \\"herb\\" over booze.The story centers around a young medical student who has had his whole life planned out for him by his domineering father who is not really there for him. Insightful and touching this film refrains from the usual stoner gags and plays more like a character study about \\"pot farmers\\" and a young man's growing pains. Brad Douif, Jeremy Strong and young Madison Davenport give deep performances in this excellent little film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Production","review":"When you encounter problems right at the start of a movie it does not bode well for the remaining parts. Specifically the sound quality and articulation by actors varied so much that it was difficult to understand important dialogue. Add to that, that the producing studio, in taking short cuts to save money, did not offer subtitles.The characters are well developed to the point of looking as if clipped from stereotypic people stickers. For example, after 8 years of education a medical student can't pass a simple oral exam then in solace meets a singer in a bar and after a brief obligatory unseen sex scene they take it trip to a pot growing commune. He meets the stereotypic intelligentsia professional dropouts spending time smoking and looking at trees and water while avoiding obligatory law enforcement disruptions to their growing activities. In summation, there is nothing new or creative in the substance and presentation of issues in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thoughful Perusal of the Pot Situation","review":"In a beautiful redwood setting, two pot farming approaches are shown: farmed for self-use, and for self-use and profit.

I missed a lot the first time and wasn't too sure about it. I then saw it on the big screen and couldn't believe the difference. The scenery alone makes it. The acting is superb as is the directing. It's not a stoner movie or a movie about pot. It's a (dark) story about people in that environment.

He argues that the percentage of homosexuals in the Catholic priesthood is higher than that in the general population. He's probably right. So what? The same is also probably true of the Protestant and Jewish clergy (both married and unmarried). The same is probably true of men in the helping professions generally: social workers, teachers, nurses, clergy.But the author leaps from this truism into an assault on everything Catholic: vestments, incense, Mary, the teaching on chastity, papal authority. The hysteria only dies out at the end when the author takes on Focuault, an author he clearly doesn't understand. Focuault was a philosopher. This book is a bumper sticker written in red ink.Yes, it's hard to be dispassionate on sexual issues. But the sophisticated teaching of the Catholic Church on sexual questions deserves better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fornication Lobby","review":"Athough the author has scholarly credentials, this is not a scholarly work. It is an exercise in rage---rage that the Church still proclaims the value of chastity in the midst of the bourgeoisie's ongoing sexual revolution.The author sees signs of homosexuality everywhere in Catholicism. Incense, Marian devotions, vestments---they all show occult signs of homosexuality. The signs, of course, are so occult that most us can't see it. I never realized what an erotic thirll chasubles secretly are.The poor author can't quite figure out where his rant will go---although he's certain that John Paul II is the enemy. On the one hand, he yells about the alleged predominance of homosexuals in the clergy and in the seminaries. But that sounds too homophobic. So he then rants that the Church isn't homosexual enough. It's too straight, too pro-family, too traditional.Poor scholarship, another sad screed from the anti-Catholic Catholic."},{"rating":"1","title":"The body of thought presented in this book is not new...","review":"only the rhetorical dressing is spruced up a bit.

After researching we discovered that many of the FoodSavers have 2 plastic T-Connectors in the bottom of the unit. We opened our unit and discovered that one of the plastic T-Connectors that tie the hoses together was broken. After a quick look it was determined that a 1/4\\" T-Connector for a drip irrigation system would do nicely to repair the unit. After a quick run out to Lowes I picked up a pack of 10 T-Connectors for less than $1.50. Popped one in the unit and it worked like a charm. So those of you out there having issues with the Jar Sealers not sealing correctly may want to open your sealer (Usually 8 Screws) to see if your unit suffers from the same symptom! Well worth the investment! We have since sealed 100+ jars with no failures. Hope this helps the rest of you having issues out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Save on bags","review":"This came on time, and it works ok I have the large mouth sealer jar sealer as well.

Over all this is a great idea and works well. And it SAVES so much money not having to buy bags for everything.

I seal loose tea, coffee, grains, flours, baking ingredients like raisins, nuts and chocolate chips. I keep yeast in a sealed jar for bread baking.

You put the first lid on the normal way ... and then put the second lid on upside down (so the two lids don't end up stuck together afterwards) before placing the jar sealer attachment over them and running the machine.

I liked the conceit of having the main male character (Quentin) \\"discover\\" the book as it's being written by his wife (Isabell). It highlighted the differences the author suggests between the male and female conceptions of history. I thought the structure sort of broke down at the end as real events took over and the central dialogue was left behind. I assumed that we, the readers, would satisfyingly uncover the truth at the same time as Quentin, but he never got to read the last pages.

Even though it was originally published in 1999,most of the content is still true today. It explains most of the good design principles that are still true like DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), decoupling, don't live with broken windows, Law of Demeter and many others. Also professional tips for your career if you truly want to be come a craftsman like learn at least one new language every year to get fresh ideas which I agree with.It also comes with a small quick reference guide of good principles to keep handy without having to learn the book. I highly recommend the book for anyone that truly is interested in becoming better at his/her craft much like tips 1 in the quick reference: Care about your craft - why spend your life developing software unless you care about doing it well?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thinking about Programming","review":"Some reviewers love the book; some hate it, but I think it wonderfully accomplishes its goal of getting us to really *think* about programming.

I highly recommend the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing but the truth","review":"Excellent book. Although having 8 years of software development experience under my belt, I still found this book enlightening. I knew almost half of what the authors said - but they said it so well that it seemed more convincing coming from them. While reading this book I knew the real meaning of \\"you took the words right out of my mouth\\".The book did have some new things that I had not known or thought about before. This is a must have book for Software Professionals. It is full of wisdom.

What's more, this book tells you how to be a better human.The Pragmatic Programmer explains, step by step, how to master the craft of programming. It describes tricks, techniques, but more importantly *attitudes* that most people learn the hard way over several decades- if at all. What's more, it lays it all out in a neat, approachable, and immediately applicable way that is independent of specific technologies and languages.I've been looking for many years for a book like this to give students. Now I've got it. It'll go on my shelf next to \\"The Mythical Man Month\\" and will probably be popular and applicable for just as long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book","review":"I first picked up this book 11 years ago.

It hits important points in two pages. It's like a cliff a notes to good programming practices. You will need deeper resources to implement the recomendations in this book but it is full of very good practices. I recomend it for any programmer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice book but too shallow","review":"The Pragmatic Programmer is a book that describes a no non-sense approach to programming. The book covers a lot of ground, from work philosophy, to coding practices to testing to project management. The book offers good advice. The style is engaging. However I am still very disappointed by the book. Why? I found that most topics are better dealt with in other books and chapters are often too short to really do justice to the topics. For example, work philosophy is better handled in 'Please Don't Just Do What I Tell You, Do What Needs to Be Done', coding and testing are much better handled in 'Code Complete', patterns by the gang of four.The Pragmatic Programmer is a nice book for starting programmers or for a fun read. But the return on investment is very low for a professional programmer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly overrated","review":"This book includes a lot of obvious advice (like keep your designs simple --- the KISS principle), and is lacking in any profound insights about how to make it so. The material on Design by Contract elevates a marginally useful idea to a major breakthrough, which it is not. One wonders whether the authors have much field experience writing large systems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Attention seeking book ....","review":"You can put this book into the category of books like - 'Teach yourself programming in 21 days', '20 recipes to success'.

But before buying, I checked it out on Google Books. This one is certainly not for the programmers but for the people who claim to be programmer. If you are a programmer, you don't do finger pointing when you or someone else discovers a bug in your program. You just get down to work with debugger. And in fact you learn a lot while debugging. So if you are a serious programmer (not just by some designation at your work), you don't need it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deja Vu - \\"The Art of Computer Programming\\"","review":"The foreword gives the entire meaning of the book away, \\"Software is a craft that is best performed by a practitioner [artist]\\".

And what about the artist lovingly crafting the software that controls the car/plane?Essentially, the book is a collection of \\"lessons learned\\" from the authors' perspective.

However, if you dare call yourself a software engineer, woe betide you..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent source of programming tips","review":"The authors offer solid advice on practical matters in software development. This book makes a good addition to the bookshelf on best practices.In the form of essays, the authors cover what tools should a strong software engineers posses, and how one should use them to their full potential. They also discuss programming constructs to solve traditional programming challenges- error handling, code reuse, debugging, etc. They also offer their thoughts on how to apply concepts, such as de-duplication, not only on the code level, but also overall in the development process, such as documentation management.The book is a well synthesized form of their experience and manages to stay involved and dynamic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phlegmatically Speaking . . .","review":"I have gifted this book to two aspirant programmers. One inhaled the contents and found several nuggets of truth that were worth the reading. It's written in short blocks of text for the commuting reader, and the flow is up to the reader.

I haven't complted the book yet, but I see myself doing many things that the author asks engineers to avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Help Toward More Professionalism and Job Satisfaction","review":"This book is an excellent distillation of practical experience and advice covering all phases of software development. While it's written mainly for the software developer, project managers will get valuable insight from the book on effective software development practice. The strength of this book is that it draws heavily from the authors' experience. Rather that promote a methodology, it promotes attitudes, values, tools and proven practices that will help anyone become a better software developer and make the job of software development more creative and stimulating. It's especially good for new software developers as it contains many lessons that experienced developers only learn the hard way. The book is well organized in easily digestible segments, with a very good cross reference system that makes it handy for repeated use. The appendix presents many valuable resources that professional programmers will want to explore."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wealth of Wisdom","review":"Some of the items in this book are common sense, and yet I still found myself thinking about things in a new way after reading this book. The authors make the information very approachable and enjoyable to read. With item titles such as The Cat Ate My Software and Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs, they use humor to get across good practices in the work place. The items touch on all aspects of the development life cycle as well as some general workplace issues such as communication and maintaining your skills. What really makes the advice valuable, though, is that it is not pie in the sky theory, but rather practicle guidelines that are can be used day in and day out. Whatever type of programming you do, this book will help you do it better."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a rare kind of book...","review":"I'm an entry level software developer and I have to say that this may be one of the most important books in my career. I've been \\"playing around\\" with software development since my mid-teens and now it's my full-time job. I bought this book this afternoon and I haven't wanted to put it down - it's written in an easy to read, sensible manner. It isn't boring - which is really hard to do with any technical book. If all my development/technical books were only 1/2 as good as this one at keeping your attention - I would be a much more informed individual."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mile wide and an inch deep","review":"As an experienced software developer, I was looking for a book that I could recommend to more junior members of my team to help them improve their skills. This book wasn't it. Although this book has a lot of very good advice in it, it's mostly a mile wide and an inch deep. For a junior developer not already familiar with these ideas, there isn't enough meat here for them to gain any real appreciation or understanding of the material.In contrast, take Code Complete. It's *only* a book about code construction, a small portion of what Pragmatic Programmer tries to cover. And yet, Code Complete weighs in at nearly 900 pages, versus Pragmatic's 300 or so. The difference is detail. Code Complete really digs into each topic, explaining it completely and giving examples. It's a bigger read to be sure, but when you're done, you have truly learned something. When you finish Pragmatic Programmer, you're left wanting another book that actually explains everything you just read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Habits of Highly Successful Programmers Revealed","review":"\\"This book will help you become a better programmer.\\" So states the very first sentence of the book's preface. Loaded with entertaining anecdotes, real-life examples, stimulating challenges, and exercises (with answers), programmers of all levels will find that The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master does indeed deliver on its rather bold opening statement. Managers will also find great value in the chapters dealing with project issues. The book aims for the \\"soul\\" without bogging down in syntactic details, so it is accessible to programmers of C++, Java, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Tcl, etc., alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"pragmatic perspective","review":"This book is a great balanced perspective of how to appropriately approach software design and development. While it doesn't really focus in on any particular language, it's a great approach to becoming a better programmer over all. I'd highly recommend it for those who want to become masters at the art of software design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guide for today's programmers","review":"An outstanding book, discussing every aspect of programming that has impact on the final product. Skilled programmers have an underlying basis for most everything they do, and rarely does a book summarize this reasoned approach. While I didn't agree with every idea (using a single editor for code, documents, etc.) and some ideas could have been better flushed out (the discussion on blackboards and a workflow rules engine), the book is invaluable. Two other pluses - the ancedotes are great, and the humor is actually humorous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Advice for Journeyman Programmers","review":"This book is great for those who are new to professional software development such as recent college graduates or those who have moved from other disciplines into programming. From suggestions on how to take pride in one's work to how to improve one's understanding of the art and science of programming, this book can open the doors to mastery of software development. I would recommend this book to recent college graduates, programmers who only know one programming language, and programmers who know only one development platform or operating system."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice to have such books in the IT intustry","review":"This book was definitely written by people wholike what they do and like doing it really good.If you are such a person who happens to have anythingwith making of software then I'd sicerely suggestyou to read it.For me ,the book serves as a reminder of things thathas been hidden under the dust of the daily life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for every programmer","review":"This book, as its subtitle states, is for all programmers \\"from journeyman to master\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Graduation book","review":"In my opinion this book is NOT a book for young children even though the illustrations may appear so.I just purchased this book for my soon-to-be graduating from high school daughter.While I haven't been able to read the book all the way through without getting teary-eyed, I can tell this is THE perfect book for her.Like the train, she has had some stops, mountain tops & dark tunnels along the way.I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC - A MUST IN YOUR CHILDS COLLECTION","review":"This book was a gift to my son from his preschool teacher this June.

Even when a recipe hasn't sounded that great, like Hot Slaw Soup (a cabbage-based soup, of course), when complete, it ends up being quite yummy. I cannot say enough about how much I look forward to my next new soup from this book. Fantastic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An abomination","review":"Sorry to disagree with the other reviewers, but this is the worst cookbook I have ever bought. I am a skilled and experienced vegetarian cook, and recipes in this book are perversely, malignantly vile.

Redemption can come in the smallest of packages. I was moved by the book.

Even my under $10 cordless has the headset jack feature. In addition to this lack of what I would consider a standard feature, the reception quality is terrible. There is a constant degree of static on all calls I have made. I have tried all the adjustments, consulting the manual and nothing changes it. After replacing the phone with another model, I have absolutely no static on the line, so it is obviously this phone. Both handsets.I will be returning this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Audio Quality","review":"Conceptually this phone system seems good, with some clever electronics, but the execution leaves much to be desired. The worst feature is the dreadful microphone used in these handsets, which adds a fuzzy distortion to everything. Since both handsets sound identical on a third phone one can only surmise the quality problem with the microphone is on all of these phones. Immediately noticeable in all calls, this is particularly embarrassing in conference call settings when other participants will ask you to call back in with a different phone. If you have a home office you would do well to avoid this phone. I also want to confirm the lack of a headset jack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't hear","review":"I cannot hear anyone on this phone, even with the \\"voice enhancer\\" feature.

They turned out to be 30 or so words like \\"pheasant\\" on thin cardboard strips. Not well made and how many people encounter \\"pheasants\\" in their Haiku writing experiences. Haiku dollars would be better spent on an anthology from master poets and let them be your guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, simple showerhead...with a pause control.","review":"This showerhead is just what I needed. Because of my disability, it is nescessary to shower using a transfer bench and I was wasting a lot of precious water! This is only a SHOWERHEAD and does not include a hose, but it hooked right up to my existing hose. It has a fixed spray pattern, but feels just right. On pause, it allows only a small trickle of water to flow. It is of very good quality (Delta brand) and construction and I've already dropped it onto the tub floor quite a few times with no damage to it! If you need a good showerhead with a pause control, I highly suggest this one. So buy it and save that precious (and costly) water!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"water saver","review":"I needed to find a solution for reducing our water bill. Watering out lawn and showering seem to be one of our biggest water usages. This shower head allows you to set the water temperature to your liking and pause it while shaving, conditioning, etc. The button is simple to push on or off - arthritis friendly. The spray setting is fixed (no other selection). It is standard - full shower medium to hard spray. We like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job, no hassle","review":"I wanted a replacement shower head that was not overly expressive, if you know what I mean. Other products I can get from local Walmart was either packed with a hose or to extravagant-looking. Although I think $13 is not so much of a \\"bargain\\" price (hence one star off), this shower head is simple and easy to use. I simply screwed it onto the hose I had and it was done. Water pressure of the spray is modest. I wouldn't ask much more for a replacement stuff.

Writing as an experienced, well-researched \\"big brother,\\" Newport avoids being didactic while imparting advice he clearly believes in.The advice is, quite simply, great. From the attitude to the study techniques, Newport covers a good majority of what a college student needs to accomplish in order to win as per his interpretation. For any freshman or sophomore looking to become one of those all-around stars on campus -- for anyone ambitious -- I highly recommend this book.Some of the advice is, at first, overwhelming. However, it is all very, very true and tested. As Cal would say about any assignment, let it simmer in the background of your mind for a while.

Now, I'm desperately devouring every publication on the topic out there to get the kind of grades that will get grad schools' attention.For someone who is really tired of the grind, or really tired of being a slacker, this is the book to point you in the right direction to turn it all around.Good Luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BEFORE you purchase this as a gift, you should know...","review":"This is a \\"gift\\" sort of book and I bought this as a graduation gift for a friend's child. I decided not to give the book after all because there were pieces of advice in it that I simply didn't want to be responsible for giving. I wouldn't tell my own child (or anyone else's child) not to read everything the professor assigns, and that is what this book advises. It also advises students to read a newspaper every day, and make your bed. While this is good general life advice, I'm not sure its all that important for college. I was looking for a book that tells students what I wish I had known before I went to college- like how to tell who the good professors are, what classes to stay away from- you know, stuff you'd rather not learn the hard way.

I think I finished the book in about 2 hours, though, I have gone back and reread some sections to refresh my memory. Many of the sections, if one may call them that, are common sense like exercising regularly and not studying in your dorm. Other sections advice you to write for the college's newspaper and start your own club. These difficult assignments may seem useless, but they are merely a method to keep you engaged in matters beside coursework and also develop life-long skills (ex. writing and leadership).

I skipped over it, as I read the entire book.Other than that, the book gives good general advice. The examples that are seen in the book description are pretty much how it goes.

They don't seem to want to guarantee their product. I took apart one of my old ones to try to fix and the problem seems to be with the switch inside.

After a few months of use, the button became loose and would usually get stuck in the depressed position, causing the receiver to ring continuously. We had our button outside the door on a screen porch, and I believe it was dirt getting in the crack around the button that caused it to stick. Before it died completely, a new 9V battery would last only a couple weeks before needing replacement, I assume because it was in a constant transmitting state.Make the button a little more durable for large dirty paws (my dog tends to hit the button repeatedly as he sees me and eagerly awaits the door opening) and I would buy this product again in a heartbeat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lentek pet paw","review":"The Lentek Pet Paw, part of the Pet Chime system by Lentek, is a great idea that is badly engineered. Years ago, our dog was successfully trained to use the Pet Paw, despite the fact the only way to get it to work is to step on one little part of it, and even that often doesn't work. The Pet Paw often becomes dysfunctional when wet or frozen, because water can seep in around the edges of the part the dog has to step on. It must be kept in a plastic freezer bag to remain workable. The battery is hard to change because it is wedged in so tightly, and whenever there is a problem (which is often) the first thing we have to check is that battery. We have had to replace the Pet Paw many times. This product needs to be redesigned to be less cute and more functional. Stepping on ANY part of it should easily trigger the remote chime, and the top surface should be in a single piece that doesn't have cracks that water can enter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comments From a Non History Buff--Incredible Read!!","review":"The Boundless Frontier is an extraordinary compendium of people and events in American history from its pre-European origins to the end of America's Civil War.

After all, I'd never heard of it before, and I find that, usually, if I haven't heard of a movie then that means there wasn't much to hear about. This one didn't follow that rule.This flick is a wonderful diversion, with a little action, a little drama, and a lot of comedy. James Woods proves the adage, \\"you can't con a con-man\\". His fast talking abrasive style is well suited to this role. Louis Gosset Jr. does very well as the underdog. And, although it's small, Oliver Platt has one of my favorite roles in the film.This isn't a change-your-life, make-your-eyes-pop-out, second-coming-of-Christ kind of movie, but it is most assuredly a good movie to own and be able to enjoy on a rainy day."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Way","review":"With more than two thirds of this movie in the ring as part of a bet whereas rundown 'Honeyboy' whats-his-name has to knock out 10 of Diggs County's best fighters, you'll need to have a great appreciation of say, the WWF to enjoy this film.

Sure, it's cheap with some of it's moves. And, truly, it's vulgar in its attempts to manipulate the audience (what happens to the first of the two brothers is obscene story-telling).But, wow, if there is any part of you that cheered at Rocky, that pulled for Butch and Sandance, had fun getting stung by the Sting, and if you'll let yourself get swept away by the story and the actors, you'll stand up and cheer at the end.You just might not respect yourself in the morning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertainmewnt","review":"The plot is 'slightly off the wall,' however three brilliant actors: James Woods, Lou Gossett and Bruce Dern make this movie a serious, collector's treasure.

It balances comedy and drama very well, so the few serious/dramatic parts really hit home without taking away from how funny the rest of the movie. And the ending is great.

Oliver Platt does an outstanding job in the opening bar scene, where the mammoth con begins, and is very humourous througout. And Gossett plays his usual calm common man tough guy that has made him a staple in cinema for years.The ending is breathtaking!Cinemaphiles will love how the story is told.

Anyway, a few days ago it began making a double clicking noise when I turned it on. Yesterday it just clicked and was dead. After 3 dozen times or so, it finally came on but today when I went to turn it on, the set was completely dead.

Walked more through the tunnel system and walked even more through its tunnel system. Then exited the tunnels and arrived at an abandoned hotel, met a couple dead people, climb ladder in elevator shaft, climb even more.

I miss stormy but I understand that she is no longer with us. I think a lot of it was the very apparent absence of the rest of the cast. I love the Chief, Ozzie and even Elvis.

Koontz is a great writer but in this sequal he was (IMO) looking to capitalize on the success of the first and dumped this one on the fans. His first book kept me captured and I couldn't wait to finish it.. this one was predictable and made me NOT want to finish it. The lack of any real hook for the readers, the lack of any investment (on Koontz part) in the secondary characters just proves that his heart was not in this book.Don't buy this book ...unless you can pick it up at a garage sale for 50 cents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom's review","review":"Good book, nice to read about Odd again but the end kind of leaves you hanging.

I consider it one of Koontz's better efforts, but Forever Odd is no Odd Thomas. It's a tedious, sometimes painful read.The biggest let down in Forever Odd is the cartoon-like villain. She's annoying, not the least bit interesting, and more pathetic than she is menacing.The plot itself is thin. Koontz stretches things out, giving us more detail than we need about the tunnel system beneath Pico Mondo and loading his sentences with as many adverbs and adjectives as he can. Odd himself was endearing in the first novel but in Forever Odd his musings get too preachy for my taste. The life affirming ending was meant to be poignant but I found it sappy.And was Koontz serious when he killed his villain by random cougar attack? A cougar? Really Dean? That's the best you could come up with?Sometimes Koontz hits, sometimes he misses. Forever Odd is a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved Odd's debut but this is a poor follow-up","review":"ODD THOMAS was such a great character/book that I rank it with John Irving's A PRAYER FOR OWEN MEANY and Koontz's own WATCHERS.But this follow-up is HEAVILY PADDED and really not very interesting or compelling. Pages and chapters are filled with Odd on his journey, climbing down into sewers, up and down elevators, etc.It reminded me of Koontz's MIDNIGHT when the entire novel was a chase. Odd Thomas is a wonderful character and I think the book in which he made his debut may become a classic because it had so much going for it and a true \\"whallop!\\" of an ending.This follow-up is a pale immitation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad and pathetic attempt by a once great author","review":"Ever since Dean Koontz jumped on the religious kook train, his writing has sadly, gone downhill. No longer do his books attempt to thrill and amaze the reader but instead are obvious and blatant attempts to hammer his particular view of the world and his religious convictions home. He has stopped writing mystery and started writing proselytizing propoganda. Gone are the thrills that shone in Lightning, Watchers, etc. I used to enjoy his books but I find I can't abide his preaching. This was the absolute last book of his I will ever bother to try suffering through."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"I normally like a Dean Koontz book for a literary roll in the hay.

Regardless, I enjoyed it and look forward to the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and Satisfying","review":"Okay, it wasn't as good as the previous 'Odd' novel, but never the less it was quality writing. It doesn't move at a rollercoaster pace, but the authors skill with words and ability to involve the reader keeps Koontz in the game.The novel did have a tendency to be a bit wordy, and it was a fairly quick read, but overall it was a very satisfying story. I do look forward to his next novel in this series.Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"The first half ropes you in...the second half is boring to the point that I had to skim through it.

However, this was an excellent character placed into an ok book. I didn't read the first one, this happened to be at the airport. The beginning was excellent but fell flat on it's face. The ending was too abrupt also. I was expecting to see some more action, but we went from sewer to cafe in a page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Koontz....what happened?","review":"I have been reading Dean Koontz for many years now. I believe I've been through his entire library...and read some of his books multiple times. Odd Thomas is one of my favorite Koontz stories. Forever Odd seemed to me to be a lost chapter, or maybe a quick attempt to keep the character alive in his readers minds. I read the book in a day and didn't want for more. This book should have been offered in paperback as it hit the stands as it didn't seem worth the coverprice. I love Odd Thomas but this installment was dissapointing at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comic Book Koontz","review":"Not one of my favorites. No character depth.

Very impressed and at that, it was my first purchase through amazon. very happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Agree With Terry Mesnard","review":"Dean Koontz is my favorite author. I'll buy every book he ever writes. I loved Odd Thomas, and it may be my favorite Koontz book to date.But for most of the reasons outlined in Terry Mesnard's review, there is none of the magic in this sequel.But I will say this: Koontz at 20% is like most other authors at 80%. I would read his shopping lists. I've preordered the next in the Odd Thomas series, \\"Brother Thomas.\\" I am hoping for a return of the magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Odd... And Proud of It!","review":"I thought that over all this was a decent book. I enjoyed Odd's narration just as much as in the first novel. I thought that the book however was somewhat weighed down by the story. It was believable, but what happened to all the ghostly aspects of the first one. I found myself comparing this more to Velocity (The only other Koontz book I've read so far besides Odd Thomas) Than to the previous novel. Even though it isn't as good as the first book, I would still recommend this novel, just because Odd is such a great character. *Little Spoiler* The real highpoint of this book was for me the reflection that Odd has at the end on the real horrors of the world, how we have really messed up our opportunity here. Its broken and can't be fixed.But again, read this book if you enjoyed the first one, its still good by any standards. It just isn't as brilliant as the first one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Odd Fan","review":"Datura was definately a Koontz villan. Evil, intelligent and formidable. A lot of readers don't like how Koontz gets so descriptive. I'm one who really appreciates the fact that he can bring you into the action with his details and keep you on the edge of your seat. Great read and a nice second adventure for Odd Thomas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forever Odd","review":"Dean Koontz always leaves you waiting for his next book and Forever Odd is no exception! If you like Koontz, you'll like Dee Sullivan, too. So, along with ordering FOREVER ODD, you gotta read DEADLY BEHAVIOR by Dee Sullivan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good plot.","review":"This book is not nearly as good as Odd Thomas or any of Koontz's other books. I am a big Dean Koontz fan and was disappointed with this book. It was very slow moving and did not have much of a plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing. Not a Koontz Classic","review":"Remember when Koontz stories were great? You couldn't put them down. You couldn't imagine how anyone would survive or what would explain the supernatural power of whatever entity the good guys were battling. Cherish the memories. FOREVER ODD is nothing like that.Odd Thomas lacks the suspense and supernatural mystery of classic Koontz stories. We still have a few brutal murders, insane villains, horror-movie nightmare scenes and one very introspective hero. (Even Odd Thomas is less interesting here than in his first novel.) There are a few good spots but FOREVER ODD is not nearly as good as the early Dean Koontz books. It's too bad because I enjoyed Pico Mundo, the ghost of Elvis, Odd and the rest of the cast in Odd Thomas. If any of them make it into a third novel, let's hope it's one with more deserving plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something that for once didn't live up to the hype. (Sadly!)","review":"I am disappointed in this book. The situations in which Odd always feels he needs to do it alone have grown tiresome. The main evil character was not as formidable as many of Dean Koontz characters in the past and I just found her to be a bland form of a villian. The book just didn't have a substancial plot line from which I am used to seeing as well. I waited quite a while to read this book and read it in two days, not because I couldn't put it down, but because it was a quick, easy read. I would recomend it if you like Odd Thomas the character, then you will enjoy the book, but don't expect anything of substance to happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as strong, but that's not bad.","review":"Though this book wasn't as fulfilling as the first odd, this still has its merits.While at times, the story is a bit rushed, it does so I believe in an attempt to refrain from adding filler that would leave an impression that the story couldn't stand on its ownIn the end, we have a cohesive tale that serves to distract without ever being preachy, which can easily happen when the subject matter circles the after life, and maintains a positive outlook. I look forward to reading the next adventure for Odd."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great supernatural novel","review":"I generally don't give out five star reviews, but this book deserves it.

The few pages that contained dialogue and interaction between characters were mostly stilted and uninteresting and added little to the story line. If the test for the story was logic and reasonableness, this one comes in way short of the mark. There was little of Dean Koontz's humor, adventure, storytelling, or anything else that makes most of his books \\"can hardly put it down\\" adventures. I've read over a dozen of his books and this one is on the bottom of the list of my favorites.Luckily I purchased this book through my Kindle account, so I can simply delete it. I have done that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short story sized adventure padded out with ramble","review":"Forever Odd starts with promise - Odd's friend disappears after a brutal murder, Mr Thomas gets tazered by a snake-eyed man, and conspiracy to take advantage of Odd's odd powers is revealed.Unfortunately the story slumps due to lack of plot. If someone took one of those 'how to write books' and plotted out the key events I can't image there being more than 4. Now I don't mind my novels straighforwards and even don't mind short. But I do mind plotless wonders than %50 of the material is the main character mincing around thinking about things.That coupled with a couple of unexplained duex ex machina type events towards the conclusion (or I admit possibly by the end of the book my attention wavered due to disinterest) leaves Forever Odd low down on my star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Read","review":"I really enjoy a good series. I enjoy a good main character even more. This has both. The second installment of Dean Koontz's Odd Thomas series was, for me, an enjoyable read. Still grieving from his loss in book one he finds himself again in the role of Hero to a young boy in grave danger. Odd's PMS (not the one you're thinking) usually gives him the upper hand but this time it just might be his undoing. Ghosts, bad guys, one REALLY bad woman, a bomb and more keep the storyline turning and keeping you guessing. I would definitely recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened???","review":"I'm not sure what happened to Dean Koontz' point of view in this novel.

The \\"mushroomy\\" guy in the first book made my skin crawl; too bad I couldn't even get a shiver out of this book. Bad, bad, bad.

But that is not the author's fault and the book is flawless."},{"rating":"1","title":"A LET-DOWN","review":"I read Dean Koontz' novels voraciously. I'm sorry to say this was a big let down for me. \\"Odd Thomas\\" was a wonder to behold, this is a failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs To Be Edited","review":"Odd Thomas's encounters with the dead are the best part of this novel. The rest of the story drags.Odd Thomas's friend is kidnapped by by an evil woman whose price is that Odd Thomas shows her dead people. This villian talks alot about strange things which the reader learns what they mean at the end of the story.There is a chase that goes on forever. The chase part needs editing.I listened to the audio and the narrator was very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forever Odd it shall remain.","review":"After being disappointed by the first book, I thought the second one would shine some hope.However, I ended up meeting the same results with the last book.This time I read it completely through though. It was painful.If you didn't like the first book, I would not invest in this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not as good as Odd Thomas","review":"I couldn't wait to read more about Oddy, but I felt a little let down. I'm not that disappointed though as I'm ready to read the next book. Maybe my expectations were too high."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still like the series","review":"As I have mentioned in my review of the first Odd Thomas Book, odd is the prefect description. After reading the first book where the main plot was to stop a mass murder I was interested as to how this would top that. Well, sadly at first it seemed to fall short of Odd Thomas. I thought that in this book Odd is only searching for one person and I was expecting so much more. Well as I passed the mid point of the book wondering how much longer this could drag out, I received a twist to the story that boosted my interest again. I will not reveal the twist for fear of a possible spoiler, but it was enough that I kept going intently wondering instead of how much longer this would drag out, but what is next. Not one of my absolute favorite books but I did enjoy it more than I thought I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Man, that was a hard slog","review":"I was given this book as a gift and managed to work my way through it because and only because it was the only thing in the house I had not read. It was a real page turner, as in \\"Hurry up and turn the page in the hope that it gets better.\\"I read another book in the series (Brother Odd) which was given to me later and found it much more enjoyable, though honestly I almost didn't even crack the cover based on expectations arising from reading Forever Odd.Forever Odd is in my opinion a forever waste of time. Two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Good As The First, But Good None The Less","review":"When I first tried to read this novel a year ago, I thought, \\"What a disappointment\\". I was expecting the same page turning excitement, the same wonderful characters that we grew to love, the same...Odd as the original. But, instead, it just seemed like there was something missing. I put it down half way through. I couldn't take it anymore.I picked it back up recently and started over with a fresh, open mind. It wasn't long before the story grabbed me and I found myself in Odd's psychic magnetism again.I gave it 2 stars because I had already rated it last year and I could not change it. If I could, I would up it to 4 stars. I suppose if I had not read the first book right before this one when I first tried it, I may have at least finished this one to see what happened the first time.This is sort of like when they ruin a good movie with a lousy sequel. I look forward to reading \\"Brother Odd\\", his next adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Sabretooth","review":"This follow-up wasn't quite as good as the previous (Odd Thomas), but deserves a place near the top of my list of favorite Koontz.The imagery was very vivid, though Odd's mental landscape still seems kinda juvenile.The antagonist seemed almost a charicature, but no less creepy.That's about all I can say without giving up any plot points that may spoil the book.Susan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forever Odd","review":"I really love the Odd Thomas books and can't wait for Koontz to write another one. I read all three of them in a matter of a couple weeks.

Get Odd Thomas first so you are familiar with the character. Whatever Dean writes is more than worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Better than first book","review":"I couldn't finish the first book in the series. It was too dark and depressing, not enough action. I loved the love angle but knew that they weren't going to make it, so it was a real downer when I got to the end. This one was a quick, fast read. I read it on an hour and 1/2 bus ride. My seat mate was reading over my shoulder when I got to the end. I liked the brotherhood bond between Danny and Odd. I also really liked how he spoke to the ghosts. A great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get to the point already ...","review":"Loved Odd Thomas, so I couldn't wait for this. One word: BORING. Koontz mentions how his villainess drones on and on and on ... so does he. Lots of words; little reason for them. Nothing happens over and over again. The last few chapters had me groaning to get through them."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"The first ODD book was good. This one, not good. The writing was sloppy. I felt that most of the book was a description of the old hotel and of the underground tunnels. I hope the next book is a good one.Mr. Koontz... not so good on this one. But I still like you :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZ","review":"This book was boaring I got halfway through and had to get rid of it It moves very slow i had to force my way through the part I actually read and then gave up but i have not given up on Koontz his Frankenstein Series is far better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Expectations","review":"The trouble with writing a sequel to such an explosive, compelling and well received book such as Odd Thomas, is that it needs to equal its predecessor. I can't say I was exactly blown away by Forever Odd, but it just didn't seem to be in the same league as Odd Thomas. I did find myself skipping the Ramblings of Odd, and thought the demise of Daktura was kind of corny. However, the book did hold my interest and it still at times had the same quirky humor I enjoyed in the First. Odd's friend Danny has Brittle Bones and is kidnapped by phone freak, Daktura. From information gleamed from Danny, she is curious and keen to meet with Odd and encounter the uniqueness of his gift. I sympathised with Odd after his rollercoaster adventure and near death experience, especially as he realises he is still no closer to being with his lost love, Stormy. Perhaps more supernatural intervention may have made this a better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTING SEQUEL..............!!","review":"After discovering the lovable psychic boy Odd in Koontz's prequel, Odd Thomas, I was ecstatic to find that there was a sequel on the horizon. My excitement was shortlived. Not long into this book I realized that my reunion with Odd would hold none of the excitement and originality as encountered it its predecessor. Quite literally, 50% of this novel describes Odd's journey to find/save his childhood friend. 50% of nothing but descriptions of scenery, underground topography, and casino ruins. When the action finally begins, readers are still left wondering,\\"Huh?\\" One simply cannot deny this author's command of the English language, but it could be suggested that he revels in it...resulting in long, belabored thoughts and sentences by Odd that seem ridiculously inappropriate in times of crisis.Clearly, there will be another tale in this series. One can only hope that this author is more kind to both Odd and his readers in the next installment.DYB"},{"rating":"1","title":"Short story disguised as a novel","review":"Awful. I am a koontz fan, and I liked Odd Thomas. However, this book is 10 page short story disguised as a novel. This is a case of a talented author churning out crap to make a buck."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bible - Odd Version","review":"Another funny, quirky Koontz type adventure with our favorite Elvis seeing character, Odd Thomas, who, whilst saving a crippled boy from a mad would-be voodoo princess and her two zombies, ponders the meaning of life as postulated by a jolly fat detective-writer / cook and nails it! His reason for why things are as bad as they are (e.g. Voodoo princesses and zombies murdering a crippled boy's father) are pretty much what I hear in Church and believe. Can't wait till Odd, in the monestary where he went, figures out also what the answer is - stay tuned. Another good read for fans of the New Koontz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ballet Inspired, but not a Ballet Primer","review":"Many of the reviews for ballet inspired workouts include complaints about lack of ballet. This video includes not only short choreographed cardio routines, but also a longer choreographed section at the end. The video flows nicely through targeted area work to full body routines. I could feel my abs burning half way through the ab section, but Jessica gently reassures you that you should be feeling a burn and that it is ok to slow down or take a break as needed. While I am no ballerina, I still harbor fantasies of playing one 'on tv' so I really enjoy the ballet moves sprinkled throughout. Even if you are not ready to do the choreographed routine at the end, the first 50 minutes give you a great workout. This has easily become my favorite workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good idea's","review":"This is a book that i will keep but i do not believe i'll ever put it to much use.It has very good picture's,and some very,very nice cakes.I was hoping it would show alot of royal icing flower's,it only show's 7.The 7 that it does show the picture's are very small & there isnt much detail on how to make them.I was also hoping for several royal icing figure's.Not much of those either,just 3.They also use royal icing to completely ice the cake in,yuck! Royal icing dries rock hard & does not taste very well,even with extract added.It does have some nice templates in the back that you could use for anything.It has Alphabet templates,in 2 different styles,a sleigh,sailboat, and some scrolls.If your looking for a book on making some really cute figure's for cakes,then look up Roland Winbeckler's book's.If its more detail on flower's & all kinds of decoating,then nothing beats a Wilton catalog & thier video's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mellowing","review":"I both read and write novels. If I enjoy a writer's style, I will read three chapters, regardless, but SEDUCING SYBILLA drew me on, entertaining but with no sense of urgency. Madeleine Conway has a marvelous vocabulary and uses it boldly. The only improvement I might suggest is breaking chapters at plot turns rather than allowing a reader to drift. I saved the last 30 pages to read as I soaked tonight, then inadvertently flipped the book into the bath. After a blow dry, the pages fanned fatter, but the content held true. I look forward to Conway's next effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"99 Luftballons?","review":"This really is a good CD overall, and a good addition to the average '80s collection.

Huh?!?! How can anyone who enjoys Pryor's humor not consider this funny? Granted, RICHARD PRYOR LIVE and LIVE ON THE SUNSET STRIP our the two better installments of this succession of three great shows (RICHARD PRYOR LIVE is an absolute classic) but this is nonetheless still great comedy. The only downer of this whole set is the often annoying audience. Pryor answers back to the hecklers with sharp humor but the interuptions are certainly annoying.Still, this is yet another great example of the most honest funnyman of our time.If, however, you have not seen any of his stand-up, by all means, look to RICHARD PRYOR LIVE first, then get ON THE SUNSET STRIP. But if those two classics tickle your funnybone, I can't imagine why you wouldn't find much to enjoy here.Not as good as the others, but 1 star?

Heavy duty scissors like will cut what other regular cutters can't. The busiest time this tool sees is Christmas with all the kids presents. Opening up some of the boxes, twist ties, straps, plastic clips is no match for this. It sure beats using a knife or regular scissors to get their toy out.As for a home job use. I've used this to cute thin metal, heavier duty plastics and the other likes. I just used this today to measure and cut some thicker weather stripping for our front door as winter is near. I was quite surprised there was no other reviews on this so I decided I would write one up.SUMMARY: 5 stars! For the price, this is an excellent, handy cutters. It's a Stanley, I don't know if I would recommend it for a daily use as your job or trade, but for the home tool box and occasional odd job at home, I think it will last my lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"tight shoe","review":"this shoe is not bad at all! kind of tighter than most shoes and not a very wide grip/sole. takes a while to get used to the feeling they are almost like slippers. very light and comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shoes!","review":"These shoes are both stylish and comfortable.

This past week, it started leaking through the electrical connection due to a crack in the reservoir. It is in the trash can at the moment.

The actual product is about 16\\" long and only reaches the mid back if it is set at the neck level. There is no picture of the front so it is unclear how they intended you to wear this unit. If the straps are placed across the chest, it rides up too high. The straps are very short and therefore extremely uncomfortable to wear, I guess because they need to pull the unit tightly against the back in order to receive any benefit at all from the massagers. Some additional adjustment to the straps could make this a much better product."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a awesone cd","review":"this is a awesome cd because its a old old cd by the legendary dj dennis alcapone on legendary riddims and on the legendary label studio 1"},{"rating":"2","title":"My father in laws favorite book and he is a book worm","review":"I have purchased several for my father in law whom is an avid reader and he has given them away as presents so it must be a good book.

He feels time with them is wasted and he put his foot down from the very start of their relationship that he would not visit them. So, that is putting family first???

Doctor Phil writes too much of nonesense before he even tell you the step to correct the problems. But even when he shows the step to correct the problem, it's nothing interesting to learn neither.

One would think that any strategy for teaching ethnic studies should be objective, but this is not the case. His writing is infused with bitterness carried from his personal experiences, and rather than discuss tolerance and appreciation, he preaches reverse-racism.

This phone is propped up by a stand in the back so that it is angled about 45 degrees when on a flat surface. If you wall-mount it, it attaches in back rather than on the bottom, so the entire product sticks out from the wall about 7\\" and is angled up at the ceiling. Since my wall-mount is at eye-level, I cannot look at the phone unless I stand on my toes. The phone looks attractive if sitting on a flat surface, but not jutting out from the wall. I am sending this right back without unpacking the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"answered the call...","review":"The phone itself is smaller than I expected: if you're used to 1990's phone sizes you'll be surprised. For those who haven't been living under a rock though the phone holds few surprises. The nicest result of buying this unit was sweeping the old answering machine, cordless phone, cradle, and caller ID unit off the small, crowded telephone table with one sweep. Whew! Love the all-in-one! And at a very reasonable price. No complaints after 4 weeks, and we can be fussy about details. Advertised rebate ($10) never materialized.

I disagree. I ordered it because of the exotic early setting but I liked it even better as it went on. Description is important to me in a book and I thought that the writer actually lavished more of it on the European section, probably because this is an autobiographical novel and she remembers more clearly what she saw when she was older. I'll never forget the part about the wetlands of Holland because she made me see it so clearly.

I sent them a note telling them that \\"My Body is a Cage\\" is a stolen song, which it is, and they replied in a defensive manner that conveyed I should mind my own business. Based on the fact \\"Funeral\\" only had one inspiring song (and that it was the first track, making it obviously the only song they had initial confidence in), and based on the fact this album shows even less inspiration, it's safe to say the critics who write positively about these guys are as hip-wannabe as U2 is for opening their shows with a lousy track from \\"Funeral\\". It's too easy to jump the \\"hip\\" Arcade Fire bandwagon, and it's too complicated to start a bandwagon for smart, original indie bands such as Low, Nada Surf, and Secret Machines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-indulging garbage.","review":"If you liked the uniqueness and energy present and welcome in their first CD \\"Funeral\\", then you are in for a surprise.

I love bands that use cool instruments like Dead Can Dance, Loreena McKennitt (both pretty ambient) and Neutral Milk Hotel (more modern, ecclectic). This band seems like they just throw in a bunch of instruments to try and be unique and hip. I agree with the reviewers that think this is a droning rip off of much better bands. I can see the references to Joy Division, maybe Echo and the Bunnymen in the inflection/strain of the singers voice.

I'm so very sorry that I hurt your little indie feelings and wish to extend this: THIS ALBUM SUCKS A__! Not only is boring upon first listen, it actually gets worse the more I hear it. If there is anything good on this album, they must have left it in the studio. Thanks very much, but I'll stick with Metric, The Dears, The Stars, Tokyo Police Club, etc. when it comes to Canadian content.

All I can say is that I was pretty disappointed the first 10 times through. Not even by comparion to Funeral because that is just an unrealistic expectation, but just for the music on it's own it seemed like a step backward. But now that I have really absorbed it I realize how upbeat and driving it is.It just takes some time- there are a few songs they could easily lose- especially Black Waves, anytime I hear her sing I want to stab myself in the ears- her voice is off key , forced, and grating to me- but otherwise give this some time- it will hit you- and live I think all of these songs will be taken to new levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funeral's successor","review":"The deluxe edition of Neon Bible is cool. It comes in a little box with two flip books, a separate slip for the CD, and of course, the liner notes (CD booklet).Concerning Neon Bible itself: I think Win Butler said it best himself: Neon Bible is best listened to at night by the ocean. It's very very different from Funeral, their debut album. I'd say the only similarity Bible has with it's predecessor is that you still rock out, even with this new sound. When you listen to it, don't think \\"What happened to the sound of Funeral?\\" Different album, different sound.My favorite tracks from the album are \\"Ocean of Noise\\" (the words, the last few minutes - superb), \\"Intervention\\" (spine-tingling), \\"No Cars Go.\\"\\"Keep The Cars Running\\" is a good song too. I just wish it was longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"They should've stayed introspective","review":"I love <love>Funeral. Let's put it this way: If Funeral were a woman, I would marry it.I hate <hate> Neon Bible. Let's put it this way: If I married Funeral and it devolved into Neon Bible, I would spend every night at the strip club by the airport, and would cheat on it with The Dears'Gang of Losersor LCD Soundsystem'sSound of Silver.All glibness aside <too late>, Funeral is one of my three favorite albums of all time. It was a perfect mixing of both sorrow and joy. that seems to be a combination that works for them. But this album comes off as petulant and angry, which is really shocking when compared to the tone of Funeral.This album makes me sad more than it makes me feel anything else. Not because the music stirs my emotions; but because it's sad to see a band so good do something so bitter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meatloaf Jr.","review":"I don't get all the hoopla about AF if this album is representative. Maybe it's that every generation needs a Meatloaf to carry us away from our suburban frustrations?

And yes, it isn't as good as that album, either. However, with Neon Bible the Arcade Fire show that they have one of the most original sounds out there, have not blown their load creatively and prove that they can move beyond what worked before and create something totally new and exciting. After all, isn't that what great artists do? Neon Bible is a lot more focused than their previous album - darker, more baroque and more politically charged. With a larger budget, you can see the results - pipe organs and full orchestras add to their rich, textured sound. The standout song on the album is Intervention, and it encapsulates the album - rousing and operatic, soaring and inspired, layered and rich without ever overdoing it. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good","review":"I had never even heard of Arcade fire, I was far more into Led Zeppelin and the Beatles. Somehow I stumbled upon this album.

The music is bland, hipster music. I enjoyed Funeral and even the (now) award winning 'The Suburbs', but this one really feels tired no matter how you look at it.

Neither the compositions, arrangements, nor production measures near in quality to, \\"Funeral,\\" but even judging it in its own right, sans comparison, it is a rather vapid album. Most of the songs have the same aped-Springsteen vocal rhythms and a mush of instrument sounds pervades with little textural variation throughout.I enjoy the songs, \\"Black Mirror,\\" (which excited my anticipation for this cd) and, \\"The Well and The Lighthouse,\\" but otherwise couldn't keep my finger off the skip-track button.I'll be perusing the Dover Thrifts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomore Slump","review":"I agree with the previous review that \\"No Cars Go\\", \\"Intervention\\", and MAYBE \\"Keep the Car Running\\" are the best songs on the album, but that is not saying much.

Listening to Butler whine \\"Blaaack Mirrooor\\" and \\"I don't wanna do _____ no more\\" for 3 songs is not inspirational in the least. Where are the danceable, 50's diner style rhythms of \\"Funeral\\"? Why are the intricate string arrangements barely audible? The straight, endless 4/4 beats of this recording and buried strings are unacceptable, no matter how much they \\"planned it.\\"The more I listen to this album, the more I realize how good the Arcade Fire's first album was.

I've listened to Neon Bible three times through and have come up with the following: Their music is transcendent. What that means I don't know but check out groups like The Smiths, Neutral Milk Hotel and Radiohead and you'll understand. There's passion galore rising above the rough mix. The vocals are rousing (from both husband,Win Butler and wife,Regine Chassagne) and the music is innovative and ELECTRIC! Butler's lyrics are poignant and relevant in these terrifying times. If you like avant garde music (Folk, Indie, Punk etc) pick up Neon Bible and their brilliant debut, Funeral.

Like many others, I find it to be less boldly ignorant (boldly ignorant being a compliment) and less vibrant -- but I also see it as advanced and accessible. The songs are more haunting, intelligently crafted, and have progressed in certain ways that gives the comfort that Arcade Fire will be able to continue making great music and evolving their style to remain relevant.

Funeral is one of my favorites, and I am positive that Arcade Fire will never make a better one. So it shouldn't be surprising that Neon Bible isn't as good, but it's an excellent record. The main difference between the two albums, at least on the first couple listens, is the band's melodies. The songs on Funeral are just perfect, and the songs on Neon Bible don't have the same kind of permanence. They are, however, damn good. This is one of the best records of 2007 so far. Highlights include \\"No Cars Go\\" (which was also on their pre-Funeral debut EP), \\"Intervention,\\" and \\"Keep the Car Running.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Funeral 2.0...Great on its own merits","review":"This album is in no way Funeral pt. 2. It sounds completely different, which means these guys and gals are as talented (actually more) than we thought all along. This album reminds me of a lot of things, as you see in these varied reviews, but the great thing is that you can't exactly place it. And it only reminds me of things I love.Wonderfully crafted and detailed, it takes multiple listens, as did Funeral, for this album to get under your skin.

Most of them were a letdown (isn't that always the case?), so I wasn't really expecting much from Neon Bible.This CD is one of the finest CDs of 2007 in my opinion. It's darker than Funeral (which is saying something), but also more beautiful. It's kind of a strange clash of genres, but what would you expect from Arcade Fire?The recording quality is great. It sounds 80s synthpop to my ears for the most part (there's obviously been a resurgence of some 80s sounds, so nothing surprising there). But, there are some obvious church hymnal themes thrown in there as well.Anyway, this is one of the best CDs I have heard in a while, and it (in my opinion) surpasses Funeral.

The Bible for Dummies book is a very fun, easy to read, and easy way to comprehend the entire book of the Bible. It does contain some humor which makes it more fun for me. It also contains some theories which I usually hate about Bible study or reference books but it does give the reader the option to agree or disagree with certain theories instead of stating it as an opininated fact.

I was excited when I found this one, however it didn't even rotate at all. I followed the directions but nothing happened. I left it overnight, changed the setting, anything and it never made a noise. I sent it back and went and bought one at Pet Smart that works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for bunnies too!","review":"We got this for our bunnies to feed them when we are gone. We've used this probably a dozen time, and every time I'm afraid it will malfunction so I have people come down to check on the bunnies but it always works! I did draw an arrow on it so i could figure out what way it turns - thus if I only want to fill up 1/2 the containers. It would be nice if it was made with the arrow - but a Sharpie works just as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"Just arrived and does not work. Was very difficult to get together correctly after putting in battery and then it would only forward occasionally. I am off to the pet store to buy one and I will be returning this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for clever cats","review":"I bought two of these for my two cats. One cat figured out how to get her paw under the lid and open it. At first I thought that she managed to pry it open when it was rotating, but just to try again, after 6 months not using, I filled one section and put it down. Within 3 minutes, the cat got the lid off and the other cat moved in to eat. So, if you have a clever, curious cat, this won't work for you. Great if you have lazy cat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Other Reviewers are correct","review":"I purchased the product even with all the negative reviews. First of all to refill the feeder requires really taking the feeder apart...very cumbersome. However having said this the green light was on. I turned it on at the time I wanted it to rotate, 7 am every 24 hours. I had to wait until the next day, well it never rotated. Also the lid is very easy to move. I have a Bengal cat, even if the feeder had worked I know he would have easily been able to move it. I needed the feeder as we are going away. However I returned it. I will look for other options. Unfortunately there really are no other automatic feeders with any consistent good reviews. Save your time and effort, this product is not worth the trouble"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great product... if it works","review":"I've been using one of these for my cat for four years with great results, so when I adopted a second cat recently, I ordered another. The motor sounded like it was dying and the speed of the turn would vary randomly. After a day of use I noticed that it wasn't turning at all unless I gave it a shake. I promptly returned it and the replacement had the same issue only worse. This one wouldn't stop at one turn. I got a refund and will buy at a store so I can make sure it works first. My first one has held up great and never had an issue with it, so I'm hoping this is an isolated issue of quality control."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE design flaws.","review":"The plastic lid easily falls off, leaving the button to advance the tray open for your cats paw to smack. The cat also figured out how to move the tray, getting all 6 days of food in about 10 minutes. I am returning this. For the price, totally not even a little worth it if you cat has even average intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"The instructions were not very clear but I finally figured out how to remove the cover to load it. The design is ok but the feeder started malfunctioning after only 3 times used. It began continually running and wouldn't stop. This probably explains why the battery was almost run down after the second time I used it. I would be willing to try another one if Amazon will replace it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ease and function","review":"My two cats are like goldfish; they will eat themselves to death. I tried to use an automatic feeder in the past, but it was quickly demolished by one of my cats. The Lentek feeders I bought have been exactly what I wanted. There's no winding the timer and my cats are showing signs of slowing down on their overeating since they know there's more coming in six hours (the setting we use). The feeders are durable, efficient, and reliable. Perfect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for dry food but not wet food","review":"I always appreciate when folks write reviews because then you really know what you are getting. If you are looking for a feeding dish for you pet who eats wet food stop here....hire a pet sitter. I have an older cat which requires feeding twice a day. I work longer hours but they aren't long enough to warrant a pet sitter daily. The first time i tried this item the containers thawed out by the end of the day. I did try it on a weekend when i was home to make sure the food did not go bad by sitting out in the open for hours without being chilled. The second time I froze the later half of the days food so by the time it got around to feeding time again 12 hours after putting out the food it was just the right tempature. Good luck if you have a cat like mine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use","review":"I have only used this a couple of times, but it has worked just fine. It's a little inconvenient that you can't set an actual time, but that's not such a big deal. I bought it for weekend trips out of town and I think it should work just fine for that. I wouldn't recommend canned food because there is no way it will stay cold for more than 24 hours--it's just small ice packs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even think you can change this battery","review":"Worked great (although loud) until we tried to change the battery. Compartment never lined up after that (tried for an hour) rendering it useless. Poor design. Wish I never bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying Contraption","review":"The worst thing about this feeder: You have no idea how much food is left. There needs to be clear panels to see through the compartments to know how much food is left.Also, the ice pack compartment seems poorly designed. I had no use for it, but it's not well insulated so I imagine the ice packs being melted much too soon to be of any real use.Another negative is the slow, weak motor that spins the top and reveals the next feeding compartment. It's slow and noisy. Pets are hungry and impatient. My cat would sometimes put his front paws on the cover in anticipation. Eventually, this led to motor burnouts.I've since bought the Petmate Le Bistro which will feed my cat for a month+ without worry/care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful item do not buy","review":"THis item is of very poor quality. It's broken already and I have to return it.The automatic function is bad, it doesn't work. I do not recommend this. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"cat broke into it on the third day","review":"The design is very flawed. The bottom and top do not close completely, and so it is very easy for both human and cat to push the top over to the next food section. If the item were made of sturdier plastic or was more tightly fitted (with perhaps a screwed on top or something) then this feeder would be great. Alas, the ice packs are very thin, and it would have been better had they been electrically chilled instead of relying on ice packs (plus I feel a little nervous about mixing water with electricity, even if it is battery-powered). Also, it was difficult to install the battery - it would have been easier had you been able to pull the link out a little bit so you could snap the V-9 on with both hands and then stick it back in, instead of trying to snap them on at the same time hoping you're not breaking something inside the machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can fix the lineup","review":"I bought two of these for my two cats, one lined up perfectly, the other was off and my cat could stick her paw in and pull out the food. I couldn't find any troubleshooting guide on how to correct and nothing online. I finally unscrewed the bottom of the center piece and you just have to move the gray ring around until it lines up. I used a sharpie to show where it should be based on where the lid was lined up and now my cat can't get in. So far it has worked great!Update.... it didn't take long for one of my cats to figure out how to open. I think it is good if you have a cat that does not care about food too much, but if all they think about is food, they will figure it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient, but","review":"Great idea, but could take design one step higher. If you have a large dog, sections may not be big enough. Compartments can only hold 1 cup of dry food. My dalmation weighs 50lbs, and the sections work for us because she eats 3/4 cup during day, and 1 cup for overnight. My dog eats 3 times a day due to a high acid stomach. If her stomach is empty to long, she vomits byle and 6 hrs between meals is cutting it close. Nice not to have to rush home to feed her. Timer is only 6, 12, 24 hour intervals, nothing in between otherwise I would rate it 5 stars. It would be nice if you could program it for any hour of the day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pet Dish","review":"The dish works great.

However, I have only had to change out the battery after 7 months using Duracell.I love to travel and this gadget makes it so more manageable to do so.

The top is hard to get off and on to add food to it. I thought maybe we were meant to advance the trays one at a time, but the instructions specifically say to lift the top to fill. Plus, if you don't fill all the trays when you put the top back on you have to make sure that the right trays are filled to expose the slots you want to. Plastic cover of on and off switch is cheaply made and falls right off. Why did they even bother? Finally this unit bears a striking resemblance to a roomba. As such my cat was afraid of it.

I left them on during the day to see if they would advance, but they never did. I thought it was the batteries, so I went to buy new ones, however this did not help. In fact switching them on and off back random results of suddenly advancing then immediately returning back to the original position. And other random movements. Needless to say I could not use them and our poor cats had to do with buckets of dry food scattered randomly throughout the house. Naturally I returned them for a refund on my return.

Finally they just stop working. I replaced the battery, and it didn't help. If it had been only one acting up, I would have tried exchanging it, but both? Twice the frustration, twice the disappointment.If it worked properly, this product would be a godsend - I have a weird rotating work shift, and I really needed this so I could feed my cats regularly and get uninterrupted sleep too.

The dish is very basic (i.e. you have to fill the dish at the time you want it to open and set the switch to open on either a 6, 12, or 24 hour schedule and that's it). An option to fill it and set the time to open later might be nice, but for the money this serves the purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken in 3 months.","review":"This product works fine for 3 months and then the mechanism that rotates the dishes stopped working. It seemed liked a poor connection to the battery, but the 3 month warranty had already passed. So I was out of luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"You gets what you paid for.","review":"I read all the reviews on this and ordered it because of the low price. It started acting up and not working properly within 2 weeks. My cat loved the double feedings but that was not the point. I ended up purchasing a PetSafe 5 Meal Feeder for twice the price at the local PetCo and it works great. It's programmable and has not had one problem in the 3 weeks that I have been using it. Now I have to return the Lentek."},{"rating":"1","title":"not like last one","review":"Have had the Lentek dish for years and motor finally gave out. New one acts sporadically , not good to leave pets for weekend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lentek 6 day cat feeder","review":"I would not recommend this product to any pet owner. I had the feeder for one week before it broke the first time. When I recieved a new one that one lasted three weeks. The battery died once a week and 9v batteries are not that cheap. By the end of the third week with the second feeder it stopped operating completly. My cat got her paw pinched in the feeder when she tried to stop it because it just kept turning. It is a great idea for if you are going away or just to have your pet on a feeding schedule but I would suggest trying a different feeder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"This feeder is a good product and much better than the feeders that I have tried in other brands. The motor is quiet and the construction is durable. It is a little bit of a challenge to get the lid open the first few times you try but after that it is easy. However our cat sitter has never learned how to master the thing and leaves the lid off and feeds by filling one tray at a time when we are away. I would recommend this feeder to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly developed.","review":"They could have done a way better job of constructing this. The timer starts the 6, 12, 24 hours the moment you turn it on so if you need it to go off at 5am you need to get up at 5am and set it otherwise it will go off whenever you first put it together and turned it on. They should have added a clock to fix that. You feel like you're going to break it putting it back together because it doesn't easily fit and click into place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps a lot!","review":"This feeder (we have 2) has been great for our two cats. We only use dry food, so I can't comment on the cooling packs. Yes one slot is always exposed so unless you are feeding and filling at the same time it is only 5 meals in advance, but it lets us take short trips away from home and not worry about getting a pet-sitter. It also keeps the cats from waking us up at night for food/entertainment. One downside is it seems to be going through batteries quickly, but the ones I used weren't fresh, so it probably isn't an issue. Great product, thanks a lot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"It was cracked when I received it and it would not stop going around when I put the batteries in .

The battery doesn't last very long.I was about to throw out the whole unit and remembered that I hadn't left a review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money. It's worthless!","review":"I bought this cat feeder to use when I was going to be gone overnight. It was easy to program and looked like it was going to do the job.

After 48 hours of loading the battery and filling the dishes, the thing has not move at all. The light is on and blinking and it was set to run every 12 hours. My pets can smell the treats inside and one wanted to start trying to force it open.

It worked just fine and I have no hesitation in leavingmy cat unattended for four or five days. Only one thing perplexed me in the setup to use the feeder, and that wasthe ON light I thought was not working.

The top secures tightly to the base. Timer is accurate and works as stated. The only thing lacking on this for me is and 8 hour timing option. 6 hours is too short between feedings, 12 too long. Other than that, the bowl works well for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Auto feeder for a good night's sleep!","review":"I bought this for the kitty who has been waking me up at 3:00am begging for a snack. Worked great until last week, when kitty decided to start waking me up at 2:58am to tell me the feeder is about to rotate!Seriously, this product has worked very well. The ice keeps the food cool for about 6 hours only. By 12 hours everything was room temperature, so I've started freezing the food to make it last up to 12 hours for the days I work late.The only down side is that since I'm not using all 6 compartments, it's a little difficult to get the top lined up, reassembled to the bottom tray, and rotated to the right compartment, but once you get the hang of it, not too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overly simplistic for the price.","review":"It's a nice product and simple to use but... The timer isn't that great. I think it would be better to have a digital timer. As it stands, the only options are 6, 12, or 24hrs so you have to activate the timer at the time you want it to start. So if you want it to go off at 6:00am for the next 6 days, then wake up at 6am and select 24hrs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing (as usual)","review":"Why is it so ridiculously difficult to make automatic pet feeders that are reliable? I have a light timer that comes on at almost exactly the same moment every day. My alarm clock goes off at the same time every day. My COFFEE MAKER can brew coffee at the same time every day. And yet, there doesn't seem to be a way to make an automatic cat feeder that functions reliably every day. I have two cats who need food regulation. If I had two feeders that went off generally within a couple of minutes of one another, that would be great. Unfortunately with these, one wasn't even OPENING reliably, then when I returned it for a new one, the other stopped opening at reliable times. Just randomly. WTF."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but could be better","review":"Purchased this product for feeding cats on W/E as we gor to our house in VT each W/E. Instructions were very vague and obviously not written by someone who has a grasp of the english language. Because of vague instructions, this feeder did not feed my animals but starved them for 2 days. Well constructed, comes with ice packs and need a 9 volt battery. Has an on and off switch which is nice and you can electronically advance to a new feeding station. However, unless can deal with the vague instructions and have the timne to play with it, I would not buy this prodcut again if I want to feel secure that my cats were fed on a daily basis.I also found that the 6-12-24 hour settings are not convenient, and a clock setting that you can set (AM/PM)times would insure consistent feeding times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't bother!","review":"My cats had it open with a couple of hours!

Maybe if you have a cat this would work well but defiantly not for dogs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to like this","review":"I wanted to get an automatic cat feeder so that my cat wouldn't wake me up at 5 am, and also so that she could eat more regularly scheduled meals and lose weight. I really liked the idea of this since you get to pick the portion size, and I didn't have any problems with her trying to get to the next meal early. The problem I had was that the timer on this thing is totally off. Sometimes it worked fine, and other times it wouldn't feed her until hours after it was supposed to. Sometimes I wasn't home when it was scheduled to feed her, so I had no idea that she hadn't been fed until I heard it turning hours later. I couldn't count on this to work properly, so I returned it and switched to the Crown Majestic. It was a little more expensive, but far more reliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"has not been helpful","review":"First off I feel like it was not an honest ad, I feel like it should say 5 day feeder, because the first tray is open so he starts with one empty. It said that it could hold 2-3 cups of food per container, but I cannot even get one cup of dog food in each one. On top of that it has been really hard to use. When I turned it on (batteries not included) nothing happened so I assumed that it was set and 24 hours later it would rotate, instead it rotated 6 hours later, and then did 24 hours after that. I am assuming that it was tuned on and then turned off and maintained the original start time. It was very confusing. My dog sitter ended up not using it. I wish it had a way to say \\"24 hours from now\\" but it's doing its own thing. I don't recommend this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compartment movement is unreliable....My cat would have starved!","review":"Glad I tried this out for a week before going on vacation because my cat would have starved. The exposed feeder compartment was unreliable. Although the battery is blinking, indicating it is working, the feeder only moved twice in 4 days (and was set to a 6 hour schedule).

It's poorly designed, cheap plastic and doesn't work well. Mine had far too many problems to list here. Very disappointed.Also note that it can only be set to feed every 6 hours...Unfortunately this seems to be the state of Auto-feeders...cheap materials used to manufacture it, high cost and poor performance.

This doesn't work in my kitchen, I feed my dog at the end. It is also somewhat small. I have a small yorkie who eats 1/4 cup of small kibble. This unit would work for that quantify, if you have a bigger dog I don't think it would work. I'm returning it. It seems sturdy, so if the design works for you I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing doesn't work and is a piece of junk","review":"It is poorly made and unreliable. Don't trust this device to feed your pet. It will starve. It doesn't allow you to choose feed times except in 12 or 24 hour intervals (which means if you want it to start feeding at a certain time you have to turn it on exactly 12 or 24 hours before that time). It doesn't open so that the opening lines up with the lid position. The cooling packs don't do anything and food spoils."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after 2 months","review":"My cat is an early morning beggar, and expects to be fed again every time I walk past her food bowl. In an attempt to break these habits I bought this pet feeder based on the positive reviews. It was really wonderful for two months of daily use and then it stopped working. I thought at first it needed fresh batteries, but it is the motor. The Lentek warranty that comes in the box is good for 2 months, and I had owned it for 2 1/2 months when it broke. I know some customers have gotten more than 2 years of use with this feeder, so maybe I got a faulty device. My experience with this product is only worthy of 2 stars, but otherwise I would recommend it. I have not contacted Lentek yet, or tried to return it through Amazon, but I would like this product to be replaced or to be reimbursed. A two month return window seems unfair considering it barely lasted that long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pet feeder","review":"So far, I like this pet feeded.

Very unreliable!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality","review":"I purchased this item to use for my cat who is on a strict diet and needs 3 small meals a day. When I opened it up, I immediately noticed how flimsy the item was. Very thin plastic.

I have used other automatic cat feeders and the cats have ripped them apart. So far the cats have not figured out how to get into the dishes except when they are automatically opened. The only problem seems to be the noise when it opens it scares the cats away and it takes some time to get them to go back. I assume they will get used to the noise and in fact look forward to it. So far I am satisfied with the performance of the dishes and I am mostly happy with the product. Just should have been packaged a little better. Up to now I have tape on the two broken covers to the timers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for travel","review":"Our cat loves this feeder - we use it when we are going out of town so the neighbor doesn't have to come feed her twice a day.

I work nights and have 3 cats, so I bought 3 of them. As long as the top is completely snapped in all the way, the cats cannot open it no matter how hard they try. My only complaint is that I wish it had a clock where you could set the timer at any time during the day. You have to turn it on exactly when you want it to feed from 6, 12 or 24 hours from now. You can't turn it on and preset the times to feed. That is the only drawback.

Very annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hard to use, bad design","review":"We ended up returning this product. It's very hard to use, the food compartments might be too small for your pet (they really are not that big and we tried to feed a tiny Chihuahua). The device is round so you need to make sure your pet can access it from all angles meaning you probably can not put it next to a wall, having your pet food dish in the middle of the room is not something we liked to do.The worst thing is that taking off the feeder in order to clean and refill the food compartments is just very hard, you need to simply apply a lot of force to release it and then putting it back is also very hard, it must be at a specific angle for some plastic clips on the bottom (which you can not see) and then you must apply lots of force to push it in. I would expect some smarter way that is easy to use for humans and not so much for pets.Returned this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Do What It Says.","review":"We put it out in the evening & set the timer for 12 hours.

I thought it would be more rodent proof than my old one, but it's built really poorly. It didn't fit together well out of the box. The feeding options are limited. there is not a clock or \\"start\\" button, so it was unclear to me when the food would be available. After setting the unit up, i waited a couple hours for the unit to turn, and it never happened. the first section is always showing, so you have to leave it empty or have food available immediately.My mother bought one of these for her outdoor cats, and a groundhog completely destroyed it in one day. So it's not rodent proof either."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"I ordered this after reading such great reviews, an also compared it to other dishes without such great reviews. I was a little worried that it might be to big for my dog. I have a 17 year old, 5 pound dog. I was worried she may not be able to get the food out of the dish well, or that the dish would be to big for her, or that the turning would be loud and startle her. But it couldn't be any better. The turning does not make a loud noise or jerk at all and it does not scare her. the coating of the plastic is such that the wet food does not stick to it or get stuck in the corners that she might not get to. She only uses 2 of the compartments during the day, so I don't use the other ones, but I am still glad I got this one over the other dishes with the 4 compartments because it just works great! It is easy to figure out, use, and program. It takes 9 volt battery, so if you are in a hurry to use it when it gets to you, you might want to head to the store for the 9 volt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive","review":"It is often hard to recommend books for first-timers.

Some of her prized possessions consist of a a tattered ragdoll, a fishing rod, a ball and bat, and \\"hats! hats! I'll need two or three!\\". When she arrives at her Grandmothers, she remarks \\"Grandma,look up! The moon came too!\\" This little girl will appeal to many young readers and listeners because of her many interests. She is a high-energy individual, yet quietly reads her favorite books with a flashlight in the car. She is a little tom-boy who fishes and gets muddy, yet likes to dress up in a girly bonnet. Some of her companions are her pet cat and her stuffed bunny doll - and of course, she adores her Grandma! The \\"Moon Came Too\\" is a cleverly written story and has an enjoyable rhyme and rhythm!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice little chandelier book.","review":"The history of the Chandelier covers many years, including several eras in history. Taking that into consideration, this book only covers a very small amount of what is a huge amount of history. For those of you wanting a detailed history of the chandelier it will be disappointing, but for those of you who just want to touch on the subject it should be quite adequate and you will not find better for the price as the selection of chandelier books is so limited. I went into a well known B and N bookstore and asked for a book on Chandeliers and was told they did not have one in stock. Not one. So I am keeping this one for my collection, even though it is not an A+ on my list. It was worth the money.Eileen"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Bag","review":"I had been looking into similar bags from Orvis and other 'quality' retailers - but their price for a comparable bag was astronomical (they're all made in China now anyway!!!)

Though I ordered a large, the same size as those I was replacing, the Valeo GLBM Leather Bag Gloves with Wrist Wraps did not fit. They were so small that I could not even fit my hand into the glove. The quality was also very cheap and the leather was super stiff. Because 2 sizes or more too small is not considered a \\"defect\\" I had to eat shipping. Avoid these gloves like the plague."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"I agree (sort of) with prior criticism of the stiffness of the gloves. When I first put them on, one of the seams broke and the blood stopped flowing to a couple of my fingers (white fingers sticking out of the glove just looks wrong). However, it's about what I expected. I worked the gloves with a bit of Leather Honey, stitched up the seam, and now I couldn't be happier with the gloves (though a MMA fighter I'm not).

The right glove split down the side after the first couple of punches on the bag. He's still using the gloves, but they're duct-taped. It might help if the manufacturer supplied dimensions for the gloves, or the vendor supplied a chart or visual info to help customers determine sizing. These are the only XXL bag gloves at this price point, but unfortunately they seem to run smaller than one would expect, and the leather material is subject to splitting under the extremely tight fit. If your hands are a true XXL, you may find them too tight for comfort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Value","review":"I have worn many brands over the years and Medline outlasts them all.

It's very precise once the digital read-out is set up which is easy to do. It's a heavy duty machine that is built to last, it is very heavy though, so it's not really made for a mobile base like those cheap light duty sanders on the market. Changing belts is a snap, and it has the oscillating feature that runs off compressed air that virtually prevents straight lining on your sanding projects. I've owned other powermatic products that I've been very happy with, so I thought I'd give the 1632 sander a try after looking at all the other cheap small machines out there. I'm sure this machine will outlast the competition hands down, no cheap parts here. Perfect for the artisan with limited space.

If you've read 'Carry on Jeeves,' there's a lot of overlap here, although the style was polished up a bit later. The second half features Reggie Pepper, Bertie's prototype. His stories are entertaining in their own right, although they can't hold a candle to later Wodehouse. Still, it's interesting to see the evolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best, still hilarious","review":"I will not rate this item among the best works of Wodehouse, but the Jeeves stories are still extremely funny. Reggie Pepper is the original Bertie Wooster and his accounts are not as halfwitted and entertaining as the Wooster accounts. All-in-all, the Wodehouse charm engages the reader.

I kept after it and I really did enjoy the stories.This isn't a novel - it's a collection of stories previously published in periodicals. Don't expect a 'flow' - each story stands alone, as was the intent of the writer in writing for periodicals. The good thing about it is that you can read them story by story and put the book down not wondering what in the world happens next.

I'm sure there's a target audience out there who like this magazine, but it sure isn't me. Let me emphasize, too, that I'm not the mom who hates her job but works to put foot on the table.

It's great that these companies are supporting working women, but not all of us working moms work there, so what's the point?They also spend time each magazine highlighting certain working moms, but personally, I've never been able to relate to the women they highlight. Another reviewer commented that it's women making 6 figures, and I highly doubt that's the average American working mom.

That makes (at least) six possible combinations, enough to fit any need.And, yes, the holder tilts (and the cupholder insert swivels) to give you the best reading angle. But it doesnt tilt too loosely - you wont accidentally bump it into a different position while trying to change songs; it's even a bit bounce-tolerant, allowing you to push a bit harder without shifting the tilt.Lastly, the cupholder inserts can be turned upside down, with the ipod holder screwed into the outside bottom (now top) of the insert, making a very nice desk stand for when I'm not in the car."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit 03 Envoy","review":"I was so excited to get this for my iPod.

The case barely adds any width to the iPod at all, but it's just enough where it doesn't fit, and it feels like the sides are going to snap off. Renders the suction cup virtually useless as well. All they had to do was add a feature where the width could be adjusted...or at least make rubber sides instead of hard plastic.

I cannot believe that there is this much fine tuned variation in cup holders (a matter of millimeters of difference in the provided cups.) When you find the ultimate one to fit you are left with all these pieces that are obsolete.And then the important part, that holds the iPod is entirely unadjustable. One size fits all?

It arrived a day earlier than scheduled, but when I opened the product box, I found it difficult to figure out. It's NOT intuitive what-so-ever. Then when I finally figured it out, I discovered that the first compartment would not open and/or stay open on its own. It's also very light, so that when your large dog is eating out of it, it will skirt around as they root in the corners for all the food.The company is sending me a new one that they say works.

One of the joys of this books is the author's slow and subtle presentation of the world he creates -- at first it seems almost exactly like our world, then quite thoroughly different (sinister magic is a large part of it) and finally, not so different after all. The characters are all believable, given the oddity of their existence.

This seemed like the perfect solution! It is a good volume and easy to use but I've had a very hard time getting the dog to ring it before she goes outside!! The bells she recognized that she was creating the sound, but the door chime is in another part of the house and she doesn't seem to realize that she is making the sound when she steps on the paw...

The novel is extremely well-paced and well-written. The book clearly was not written in a rush. Wesson continually sets up amusing, involving, suspenseful scenes. I was disappointed with the ending because it was far-fetched and, I think, implausible. There were some loose ends regarding the solution that weren't tied up and that was disappointing, but up to then the book was uncommonly well-writen and entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"On closer examination, not as well written as you may think.","review":"Marianne Wesson seems to use this novel as a vehicle to advance her liberal feminist agenda. She seems to take great effort to make none of her central characters seem like mainstream Americans. I also take exception to her portrayal of Christians and stay-at-home moms as a bunch of materialistic hypocrits. The central theme is not new, and her \\"unique\\" ending doesn't jive with the facts as she lays them out. The novel should have been subjected to more thorough fact checking before publication. She can't even get the date of Nicole's disappearance straight throughout the book - it varies from one Saturday in August (Jason's version) to the weekend AFTER Labor Day (Nicole's father's version). All in all, I don't believe this book is worthy of a glowing recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"The characters are paper-thin, and are comically stereotyped; shaped by the author's knee-jerk liberal feminist outlook. Thus, every white male is a pig, a lout or a rapist, the black male love interest spouts a lot of phony jive dialog, and the female characters are strong, hip and wise - even the villain. None of the characters talks like any real person ever did. If the characters don't annoy you, the plot will. It proceeds at a snail pace through every predictable turn of this type of law novel. The \\"surprise\\" ending is telegraphed to all midway through the book. It's a bomb. My advice: stick with Scott Turow, and hope that Mimi Wesson does a better job on her next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice strap but hard to put on","review":"I had to take this to a jeweler to put on for me but certainly love the result.

However, I felt compelled to make an exception in the case of \\"To Conquer the Air\\". Despite my enthusiasm for the subject matter, I found Tobin's style insufferably painful. He is more interested in tangential minutiae than in telling the story. For instance, he uses a single paragraph spanning almost half a page to itemize the contents of McClure's magazine simply to introduce an irrelevant character by the name of Professor Newcomb (p.117). He regularly snatches boredom from the jaws of curiosity with vignettes about the petty struggles between Bishop Wright (Wilbur and Orville's father) and breakaway factions within his church. How an author can mix ingredients like rivalry, deceit, visionary brilliance, and momentous discovery into such a disagreeable literary cocktail is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total ripoff, poor presentation, no learning value !","review":"To begin with, this video is a only 26 minutes long ! The first 10 minutes consist of the self-proclaimed master sitting in a chair talking to an interviewer. He then does about 10 minutes of demonstration moves, not organized into kata and all seen from the front at full speed (worthless for the learner). He proceeds to do a nonstop sequence seen only from the front at full speed, with some cheesy music and voice over, and then repeats this same sorry look-at-me ego trip.

While Xavier doesn't have a strong voice, it is adequate and his use non-standard instruments (like the didgeridoo and sitar) brings a pleasant uniqueness to his music.

Great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic opening sentence","review":"First, I read some of the reviews and mostly they liked the book, and especially the opening line. Not all were so positive about the rest of the book so I'll just politely disagree. I thought the book lived up to the opening line and did an excellent job of setting up the series with Tremaine et all the characters. M.Wells does an excellent job of developing the characters and as I'm reading book two of this series, she continues doing so in it as well. I grew up reading Andre Norton (and loved her books even now as a Sr. adult) and M.Wells is doing an excellent job of writing with a distinctly more mature feel.

She's managed to make it to a very elite list of mine - the buy on sight list. Wells has an ability to draw excellent characters without sacrificing any attention to plot or setting. In fact, throughout her books (The two stand-alones and the Il-Rien books), she's managed to explore new and interesting worlds and people them with characters you want to spend time with.This new book, the beginning to a trilogy set in Il-Rien (at least initially) doesn't disapoint. Tremaine is one of her most engaging heroines, especially as that's probably the last way she would think of herself. As is usual for Wells, secondary characters aren't stinted; there aren't any two-dimensional people wandering around in the background while your attention is supposed to be focused on the leads. I keep reccomending Martha Wells to friends, and at this rate, I will be able to keep on doing so."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book does not deliver the action that it calls for.","review":"I just finished this book and was overall disappointed in how Peter portrays this historic feat. First of all, he is not kayaking the Tsangpo. Rather, he relays on the kayakers for their point of view. To make matters worst, the kayakers don't like him (as he states often in the book), b/c they believe he is there to exploit them (which he is). Instead of telling of their trek, he tells his story of being on the ground. He doesn't even follow the kayakers, like his coworker Charlie, who works as a photographer. Plus, there are zero pictures.I would have more respect for this book, if he actually kayaked the river. It is just not the same. Also, this is his first book and he has trouble keeping a train of thought. Often, he jumps from story to story which leaves me confused and wanting more. He does not create good imagery, either. Overall, skip this book, unless you want to hear about how to trek, not kayak, the Tsangpo Gorge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never seems to find equilibrium","review":"After finishing 'High Crimes' I wanted to be transported back to the Himalayas. 'Hell or High Water' called my curiosity and so I embarked on it. I should say that white water kayaking isn't as appealing as high mountain climbing. There is something to be said about going up as opposed to floating down that makes one feel excited.'Hell or High Water' never seems to find equilibrium, something to build upon and expand. The descriptions of the landscape are plain, almost unimaginative. The story is simple, not in its totality, but in its mundaneness.I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"self-knowledge??","review":"The only paragraphs worth reading are the once Heller got from other books, I'd suggest you'd read those if you want to know about the Tsangpo's history.Otherwise this book is a story written by a man who has little to no self-knowledge, but seems to know what Lindgren (the expedition leader) thinks and feels. Heller criticizes others but doesn't have the gut to look at his own actions."},{"rating":"2","title":"IS IT THAT GOOD? BETTER!!!","review":"This is an extrodinary book. How these paddlers trekked up this Gorge (with kayaks)and paddled the Tsangpo is absolutely amazing. I did like when the author talked about the history of the Gorge..the steepness..etc. I'm sad that I finished it. No, there is no pictures (for a certain 4th grader)...BUT if you want to SEE this magnificent scenery AND WATCH these exceptional paddlers then buy Scott Lindgren's DVD \\"Into The Tsangpo Gorge\\"..its the movie version to this book. ITS ABSOLUTELY JAW DROPPING! Once you watch this DVD..you will want to read the book again. Anyone who has an interest in this part of the world will ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS BOOK AND DVD!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not that good","review":"Disappointing. This book is not particularly well-written. Heller waxes majestically about the scenery and topography he sees, but I still can't visualize it. And he shifts his voice several times throughout the book, sometimes writing as if he were delivering sacred text, other times casually reaching out and attempting to speak to the reader one-on-one. It's hard to get a feel for the story he's trying to tell. Add that to the fact that there is not a single compelling character in the book and it makes it a little tough to slog through. I find that I just don't care what happens to these people. And this may sound silly, but an adventure book without pictures of the location is a bad idea. I hate to sound like I'm in 4th grade, but it would have been really helpful to have some visual aids to understand the geography they were in and the effect of the water on their kayaking.

Production and playing are excellent, but, to my listening at least, Kelly Hogan's vocals are curiously passionless on some cuts. She is very strong on the raucous It's a Mighty Thin Line Between Love and Hate, Papa Was a Rodeo, Crackers Rule (perhaps the single best cut), and Whispering Pines. But in some of the other ballads (I Still Can't Believe You're Gone and her own Gone, for example) she sounds tentative, as if she's so concerned about going over the top that she checks her emotion at the studio door. And Wild Mountain Berries is just the cutesy kind of song that makes mainstream country such a tuneout now.

This cogently-writtten volume presents a much more nuanced picture. Ghetto walls were an injustice, but also a refuge for many Jews from the tense environment around them. Oddly enough, this circumstance contributed to the relatively large number of conversions to Christianity in the liberal West after the Napoleonic liberations (in contrast to the shtetl Jews in Poland and Russia, who lived side-by-side with Gentile neighbors).

I was really disappointed because I was rooting for the Merkur. In reality I shouldn't have been surprised. How would newer models ever have sold successfully if they were not, in some way, improved? Maybe it's because I have a really tough beard; I can't say for sure. The one place where the Merkur came out ahead was that I noticed I never got any nicks or cuts while using it. But again, I didn't get a close shave either. So, the only thing I can say for sure is that it must be great for some guys (based on the reviews), but it isn't for every beard.

I am really impressed with the shave. As others have said, you want to apply light pressure and make multiple passes.

Wet shaving with a single blade is not a lost art. These new crazy razers with 12 blades are just a bad joke.Want a smooth shave that won't take off your face?

Classic old time double edge blade razors like this one give a much better shave than the current trend of adding more and more blades to (expensive) replacement cartridges. The last time I bought a pack and finally realized they ran around $2 a cartridge I got out my grandfather's old double edge and found it gave just as good a shave. I decided to invest in the Merkur Classic (more finally crafted than grandpa's shaver) and have been extremely happy with the results. The initial cost may be more, but you will save money in the long run.Be sure to get good blades. Merkur's stainless steel blades work well. They are still 1/4 the price of the Mach 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best shave of my life","review":"Took a couple times to get used to, but I actually look forward to shaving now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Move heaven and earth to add this to your collection!","review":"Twenty-five years ago in my twenties I first heard a powerful and beautiful gospel song called \\"Take me back\\" by Andrae Crouch & the Disciples.

The sonar works great except for high speeds but that is an issue with my boat hull design I believe. The Fuel flow sensor was a huge pain to wire but it is nice to have.

The string/tab fasteners are hard to put on because of this and feel like they can slip out or break easily. It would be simpler and easier if it were buttons, velcro, or stretchy even if it took away from the authentic look. Speaking of which, the brand name tag is on the front and top of the leggings, standing out like a sore thumb and taking away the authentic ninja look. These can be easily removed by cutting the thread that attaches them to the leggings but there will be a less visible dotted line square of holes where they once where.

Just listen to \\"13 Years of Grief\\", my favorite from the album, and you'll know why. He has a singing voice that fits the music well, hard for me to describe. This was one of the top albums of 2000, along with \\"Of One Blood\\" by Shadows Fall, \\"Reinventing The Steel\\" by Pantera, \\"And Then You'll Beg\\" by Cryptopsy, and some other great metal albums I'm probably forgetting :). This stuff is old-school. If you miss traditional getting-a-kick-in-the-face style music, here is where to look. I only give this four stars because a few of the songs are boring.

This is no nu-metal crap, the album is full of strong riffs and excellent solos. \\"All for You\\" kicks the album off, an adreniline-pumping opener with a fret-burning guitar solo near the end; this song is amazing! \\"Stronger Than Death\\" is strong too, with backing vocals at the end by baseball player Mike Piazza. The rest of the songs are gauranteed to please Zakk's fans as well, because many have powerful riffs and all of them have at least one guitar solo. I wish Zakk would convince Ozzy to put out material like this. I feel that Zakk's vocals leave much to be desired (they sound like a mix between Phil Anselmo, Layne Staley, and Scott Stapp), I long for Ozzy's glory days of \\"No More Tears.\\" Zakk should form a full time band dedicated to playing true heavy metal and kicking rap-metal like Limp Bizkit out of the music scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"The hard album Ozzy fans have waited for","review":"If you are looking for an album which blends the music of Pantera, Black Sabbath, and Corrosion of Conformity, here you go. Zakk has listened to what his fans have always wanted and has delivered an album full of thick heavy riffs and exploding solos. Yes there are a couple slower songs \\"Rust\\" \\"Just Killing Time\\", but they too are impressive for this one time Ozzy hacker. I doubt that any radio station will have the balls to play any of these songs, but I know I will be cranking this cd over and over.

Zakk tried a new approach, it seems, but the result backfired. THis album is heavy and distorted just for the sake of being have and distorted.

HE's just growling like if he wanted to be Phil Anselmo..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Follow Up","review":"The fact that this album was written and recorded less than a year after BLS's \\"Sonic Brew\\" might have something top do with its unfinsihed sound and unfocused songs. Zakk Wylde just probably didn't have enough time. \\"All For You\\" opens in good Sabbath form, but after that there are problems. The vocals in \\"Phony Smiles\\" and \\"13 Years Of Grief\\" are so poorly mixed as to be inaudible. I thought maybe one of my speakers was out. The laid back laments of \\"Just Killing Time\\" and \\"Rust\\" are redeeming, but short-lived before the album careens back into more uninspired monolithic riffs. This work feels rushed and under the gun, as it more than likely was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely hard to listen","review":"I think Zakk wanted so hard to show how \\"radical\\" he is, how \\"independentt\\" he is, so he exagerated a little bit in this album.

Great book and worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good CD......","review":"I think this CD is pretty good for those who like Dobro music. For those learning Dobro this CD is even better!! However, if you are looking for typical bluegrass favorites or country favorites the quality of this CD lacks the sound. Instead of having a full sound recieved from a typical band, this album is more Dobro oriented, as all other instruments on this CD are played in weaker sense. This CD is used to showcase purely the Dobro. However, as I said, for those interested in Dobro music, this is a great CD for your starter collection, as it gives good overall examples of Dobro techniques."},{"rating":"2","title":"nashville dobros","review":"I love listening to dobro music.

It is well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfying","review":"Perhaps if this book had been published 10 years ago, it might have been more groundbreaking. However, it follows many other published accounts of Chinese-Americans and their difficulty growing up with two cultures. This book would have been more interesting if the author had tried to understand further the conflict between herself and her parents. She present her difficulties from her point of view only and does not offer insights into why they existed. The reader is left thinking 'there must be more to this story'."},{"rating":"2","title":"I found the book interesting, sad, and hope for more.","review":"As someone who is not that familiar with the Chinese-American culture, I found Elaine's recount of her childhood very interesting. The recollections are quite vivid and made one want to read more and more as this young girl tries to find who she is and why. The book helps to put a more defining look at families and their dynamics. I hope that Ms. Mar will pick up from this book and give a much more detailed look at her experience at Harvard. I look forward to seeing how this \\"cultural shock\\" was dealt with and further relationship issues with her family."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent first book by a young author","review":"Elaine Mar's memoir reveals an uncompromising account of an immigrant's life in Denver--a city not known for racism or liberalism. The city provides a backdrop of Americana that a New York or even San Francisco setting could not provide. More such an accounts are needed for all of us to understand the cruel barriers that newcomers to our culture face. She writes with a sharp focus that at times zooms in with breathtaking detail. I finished the book wanting to know what happened next? What is the sequel? Her documentation of working poor struggles is as potent as her experience of ethnic differences. In the end, this class perspective may be the book's most important contribution. Because the author has not yet fully come to terms with her family's class perspective, it makes the book all the more revealing, honest and painful. I highly recommend reading A Paper Daughter and await the author's next book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good, Though Slow at Times for Me","review":"Paper Daughter is a memoir that makes you think. It's indeed an intersting and informative tale about the lives of Asian Americans.

Nothing ties it all together, so to speak. And the ending is abrupt.This book was about a year's work from being done.I would encourage Ms. Mar to keep writing.On a personal note...as an immigrant who came to the U.S. the same year and at the same age as Ms. Mar, I hope she has come to a place of acceptance, forgiveness, and love with her parents.I felt very sorry for her, and more so for her family at the end of the memoir. The way it was written made it almost seem like it was her family and not just college she had graduated from.I hope she has found a way to incorporate her family into her life.I did learn a lot about Chinese-American culture and found it edifying to read her experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"my own experience","review":"I love this book and have been recommending it to all of my friends. Paper Daughter describes so well the experiences that I as an Asian girl went through during the school years. Our parents love for us is unimaginable but seldom shown.

A Chinese daughter of immigrant parents who tries to live in both worlds, old China (her parents may be here in the States, but never truly become part of the culture) and the USA . She finds she cannot live in both worlds without deep resentment and frustration and opts to reject her parents old ways in the end. This was an excellent view of the frustration and pain for both sides involved. Gives you a view of those who live in America, but are not really a part of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this memoir","review":"Some people who've posted reviews here feel this book is not significant but I think we can all relate to being teased at school and trying to get by as a child.

I was offended at the way she exposes her family's privacy with little thanks or appreciation for their struggle. She dedicated the book to her parents, but that was it. What first generation American did not struggle with identity and parental conflicts? As a Chinese American woman born in Hong Kong as well, I am tired of reading books with the same theme of us needing to escape from home and be saved by white America. She is only emphasizing the stereotype of the backward Chinese parents who are a barrier to popularity.

Changed my life!","review":"This is a truly phenomenal book! It absolutely blew me away! It helped me in so many ways, it's hard to write them down. One of the biggest things this book helped me with is the ability to really understand people and what they go through and how to predict what people will do. It is the most amazing guide to predicting behavior! I would occassionally run into someone who would tear me down or tear others down but in a way that wasn't obvious so it was hard to see; I'd just feel bad about myself after being around people who would do that. This book helped me to understand why someone would do that but more importantly, predict who would do that so I wouldn't get blindsided when it happened. I'm so much happier and more secure since I discovered this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Understanding people better","review":"I understand people better since reading this book.This was not the easiest reading of my life - it's a pretty hefty subject, and a pretty hefty book - but it has helped me immensely in my business and personal relationships.It gives one an understanding of the motivations of others - since studying this book, I can tell who is likely to cause trouble. We had a fellow interested in doing business with us, and as the result of my study of this book, I knew he was going to be bad news. We avoided a lot of trouble - his business was investigated for fraud and, simply because of this book, I was able to steer clear of THAT mess entirely!If you have ever found yourself unsure of who to trust, then this book will help!I also recommend \\"The Tone Scale in Full\\" and \\"A Special Course in Human Evaluation.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The most valuable book I've ever read.","review":"This book was mind-blowing. It explained so much about human behavior, how people are going to act, who I can trust, and so much more. I learned, for example, exactly how an angry man is going to act in certain situations, how he will talk to others, how he will handle truth, etc. After reading this book, I know how to deal with people very well.

Hubbard writes at long length about an emotional scale that he called \\"The Tone Scale\\". In his \\"Chart of Human Evaluation\\", he claimed that certain personality characteristics bind to other characteristic behaviors or physiological conditions. I read this book from cover to cover and have never found the data that Hubbard claims as true to bear out in the real world.If you want to predict human behavior, I suggest studying the subjects of psychology, sociology, economics, and linguistics. Those fields will give you a genuine understanding of how us humans conduct our affairs as individuals and in groups. The pat dogma that Hubbard claims in this book is utter nonsense.

For instance, in one of her poems, she writes:\\"Awed by her splendorStars near the lovelymoon cover their ownbright faceswhen sheis roundest and lightsearth with her silver\\"Not only is there beauty. There is a straightforwardness and frankness to the poems of Sappho. It is a clear distillation of the poet's vision confronts the readers of these pages.There is also wisdom and humor. As when she writes:\\"Experience shows usWealth unchaperonedby Virtue is neveran innocuous neighbor\\"Mary Barnard is to be praised for these clear, unvarnished translations. Likewise, the introduction is very useful in dispelling so much of the myth that has sprung up around the legacy of this great poet.

Simmonds' \\"The Gentile Comes to Cache Valley\\" is not going to have widespread appeal, but for those interested in early Utah history, especially LDS history, this little book is a worthwhile gem.Simmonds chronicles some early settlers in Cache Valley, Utah who split with the Mormon church for three main reasons, including the cooperative movement which spelled the end of private business for some of the LDS faithful in the 1870s. Simmonds does an admirable job reconstructing the events that led to the apostasy and also traces the early non-Mormon outgrowth of other denominations.While this book is certainly not exhaustive, it is a good start and has great bibliographic references. Again, this book probably won't pick up a far-reaching audience , but it is a must for anyone interested in how and why early pioneers left the LDS church."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scooby Doo for adults","review":"Okay: (1) The acting *is* wank (except for Dennis Price); (2) the script is hilarious (One classic exchange: \\"If Penny didn't kill those kids, then who did?\\" \\"Someone else, obviously.\\"); and (3) the \\"twist\\" ending is absurd (although it predates by one year the strangely similar finale in _Don't Look Now_).But: This movie is lots of fun. AND it can still generate a couple of screams!! Imagine a live-action, British version of Scooby Doo for adults. This movie is the product of the same time and mindset as the cartoon. It has everything the horror movie fanatic could want: gory murders (even the old severed head rolling down the stairs), secret tunnels, buried treasure, a hint of evil spirits, madness, a monster, sexual intrigue, gratuitous nudity, and lots of creepy atmosphere. That island is the most foreboding piece of land I've ever seen.Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"tower of pleasure","review":"This movie is a pleasure to view even after all these years. The print looks great and it retains a great spooky atmosphere. The acting is fine by any standards and the sets are great. When this was shown on television they had to cut out the nudity and sex scene. This of course has them intact and the print looks great. Elite did a good job with this one. There are no real extras though but at least this cool horror exploitation flick is on dvd and available. I remember seeing this as a kid and it's just as good today as then. The story features two different groups of people who meet a mad slasher on the island and the story is well put together and logical. This is great 1970's horror from the uk and it should be enjoyed by any gothic horror fan. One thing a movie like this proves is that you don't need sudden back and forth jumping that is so popular with some movie makers today to build suspense and thrills."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great transfer to DVD; a far from great movie.","review":"I first saw Tower of Evil when I was ten years old and remembered being scared by that viewing. After just recently seeing it for the second time, I discovered that the film has lost much of its punch. The film starts off strong leading the viewer to a gruesome discovery and a path of mystery waiting to be revealed. Then things slow down. I don't mean just applying the brakes, I'm talking putting it on the parking gear! Towards the end it began to pick up, but the final \\"twist\\" felt very flat to me. However, I must give a strong Kudos to Elite Entertainment for their brilliant job in the remastering of this film. The picture quality is excellent and the cinematography beautifully stands out.

Come on guys! Anyway, half of the songs here are great musically and almost all of them are pretty much OK lyrically... sometimes Jack slips a bit but that's understandable.

We've listened to it again and again and guess what? It ain't great. There is very little creative or interesting about it. The melodies, such as they are, are partially realized; the lyrics are just okay. While I think this might, for some, be decent background noise, I find the melodies too irritating even for that limited purpose.My advice, listen before you buy. Something screwy is going on with all of these positive reviews. My best guess is that Jack has a couple of hundred friends who owed him a favor."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sublime melodic journey","review":"\\"Brushfire Fairytales\\" isn't an album you can bang your head or mosh to, it's something you actually have to sit down and listen to, which makes it absolutely brilliant. This album, which is Jack Johnson's first, will often find it's way into your CD Player or Discman on those days when you just want to relax. Truthfully I consider Jack Johnson to be one of the best musicians lyrically that's around today, some may even go as far as to compare him to Bob Dylan. A great album through and through, and no self respecting music lover should be without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and fresh","review":"Thank goodness for some new decent music.

Very refreshing. The influences of G. Love, Ben Harper and Nick Drake are apparent. However, I feel that some of the lyrics are truely not up to par with their fabulous melodies. At times, I find it difficult to sing along. I do think Mr. Johnson has a great future ahead of him, and his songs will get airplay, but I would ask him to work on his lyrics. Buy this album, you will be glad you did... but just be prepared for the lyrics or you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"totally cool","review":"I picked this up as an impalse buy while in chicago. It is great. I recomend to any person who likes a modern day 50's prom band with a twist of carirbian sound. It has great base and the lyrics are great also.

I really enjoy unwinding to it after a really hard day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic Rhyming","review":"I too was a big fan of \\"Flake\\" and immediately rushed out to buy this c.d. after hearing others rave about it.Unfortunately, the rest of the c.d. did not live up to the promise of \\"Flake\\" or even \\"Bubbletoes\\". Jack Johnson has a terrible tendancy in his songwriting to go with the rhyming lyric--not just in one song or two but EVERY SONG. (case in point: \\"Sexy Plexi\\").The end result is not sophisticated or elegantly written lyrics as one might expect from a celebrated folksy/bluesy writer, but inane phrases. He chooses the easy, simple rhyme rather than going for more emotionally moving and/or intellectual storytelling. I felt your average fifth-grader could've written these lyrics (or even better ones). Bob Dylan he is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack Johnson","review":"This album is fantastic in its simplicity. His lyrics and licks evoke a peaceful, pleasant and sometimes melancholy feeling.

YOU CAN'T STOP!!","review":"AS a 17 year old male, I seldom listen to this type of music and typically listen to the usual rock and other stereotypical teenager bands. I was introduced to Jack Johnson by a friend of mine, and after the opening lines of \\"Bubble Toes\\" i was hooked. Brushfire Fairytales takes you to a place which is calm and exciting. Just closing your eyes and listening gives you a feeling that you just want to groove along with it because it's such a consistent beat with no repitition. The words are a mix of clever thinking and a sense of humour and are easy to pick up and to sing along with as well. I just want to pick up an acoustic guitar and learn all of Johnson's songs and play them till my fingers hurt... it's a pity I can't play the guitar!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahhh, finally able to relax","review":"First off, I've been a rock fan all my life, but I've always had love for bands like Counting Crows, Radiohead and such. And I've always enjoyed solo artists like James Taylor and Paul Simon, one of my friends told me about Jack Johnson in early 2001, and I have to admit that this music is so damn relaxing. If you enjoy something light with message that you can goof on from time to time, Jack's music is just that. I own Brushfire and On and On, while both are incredible, I think Brushfire is a bit better, \\"Inaudible Melodies\\" is a perfect start, just a song telling everyone to take the time to enjoy life. \\"Fortunate Fool\\" also is a great track that easily gets stuck in your head. I'd have to say that \\"Flake\\" is the best track on this disc though, evryone in a relationship that seems to be at a stand still will understand it. I hope to hear more from Jack Johnson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack Johnson is soul moving music.","review":"I had the pleasure of hearing about Jack Johnson from radio station WEQX in Vermont back home. This was about the time Jack Johnson was becoming a household name. When Flake was broadcasted over the airwaves i wanted to hear more, I loved it! Jack is a solid musician and an amazing song writer. His music is full of optimistic and struggle. I love it way too much. This album is amazing.I suggest you to buy this disc for the purpose of folk meets beach music. F- stop blues is the best track on this disc in my opinion, even though this album has so many others. Time for another Saranac...............Love to all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Jack Johnson comes out of Hawaii with an instant classic. Songs that he wrote while he was sitting around a fire jamming with some surfers in Hawaii definitely translate into rock classics. The whole album is solid. He is the Hawain Buddy Holly. Classic riffs and soulful sound permeate this album and will not leave you dissapointed. I heard Jack on WXRT in Chicago in 2001, and could not wait to get my hands on his album, it was worth every penny. I can't wait for the next Jack Johnson album, I don't believe he will suffer a sophomoric slump."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brushfire Fairytales","review":"Jack Johson- Brushfire FairytalesFrom the start of this album Johnson urges listeners to \\"slow down, you're movin too fast\\" and continues this attitude for the albums's duration. At a time when few know how to relax, Johson's message is as relevant now as \\"Walking on Sunshine\\" attempted to be in the mid 80s. The subject matter isn't heavy, but who says it needs to be. Johnson makes music perfect for summer, acheived through his carefree attitude and the bands relaxed sound. Highlights include the upbeat love song \\"Flake\\", the acoustic ballad \\"Ther News\\" and emotional closer \\"It's All Understood.\\" Few artists hook audiences in like Johnson and his songwriting and ear for a catchy melody make up for his lack of extensive techinical abilility. Never before have I heard anything this light, be this good."},{"rating":"2","title":"More fun than toastin' marshmallows!","review":"When I first heard Jack Johnson's Bubbletoes on the radio, I was hooked. I had to find out who this guy was and buy his cd IMMEDIATELY, a relatively impulsive thing for me to do, but I was not disappointed. Brushfire Fairytales is one of those rare cds you can listen to all the way through, then start it all over again and enjoy it at least as much as the first time (if not more)! The tunes are simple and mellow, with subtle grooves that make you bop your head. Personal favorite:Mudfootball ... fantastic, especially if you like to sing along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ben Harper fans pick this up!","review":"Wow, what a great album! I picked this album up as a recommendation for Ben Harper fans and it surpassed my expectations. Simply amazing! Jack Johnson's songs are bluesy, funky, soulful, and a little bit of everything else. I have pretty much been listening to it non-stop since I bought it and I recommend it to anyone with a taste for Ben Harper or DMB. My favorite is Flake, but the entire album is catchy and well worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best mistake I ever made","review":"I copied this CD from a friend, on accident, ad loved it. unfortunately, the quality was bad so I bought it. The acutal copy was 10 times better. do yourself a favor and buy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent album","review":"Basically this album is awesome and you should buy it. Jack Johnson has a good grooving mellow vibe, and if you like Ben Harper, you'll really like this album. I saw him perform live and it was really good, and the album is just as good. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack Johnson is beautiful.....LOVE this CD","review":"The seller for this CD had it delivered quickly, and it was in excellent condition. This is one of my fave albums by Jack Johnson....although they are all great. You will love this one if you buy it... : )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is an awesome CD and it completed my collection. Jack Johnson is by far my favorite musician and his music always puts me at ease."},{"rating":"2","title":"woo-hoo!","review":"you gotta love it! who cannot resist singing along to bubble toes or any other track on this album for that matter? and i love the song flake. it doesn't get any much better than this from a newer artist. and due to the fact that mr johnsons' music is folk/pop, you can in fact compare the feeling of his music to that of the dave matthews band, another one of my favorites. all in all, it's a really good album to listen to, and i would recommend it to anybody!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best songs you haven't heard...yet","review":"This is by far one of the best albums you will buy. It is great summer music. great music, great lyrics, great mood creation throughout the whole CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most popular whisperer","review":"This stuff could potentially groove if they had a singer with more vocal presence (doesn't whisper his way through the tunes). Either way, IMO, it's good stuff that has yet to be realized by a better singer. I'm just not feeling it. Almost Damien Rice, but not as eclectic/quirky....just one person's opinion, try to be objective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the perfect wave","review":"I admit I first stopped to check out this cd at the store bcause I thought Jack Johnson was attractive. Then I got the cd home, listened to it, and had respect for him ( no longer just eye candy.) He has an incredible voice, and he plays guitar and write music too. Kim is a lucky gal ( and great photographer.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"You Must BUY!!!!","review":"I really don't what it is about this guy, is it his smooth voice, guitar, drums, island sound? But if you enjoy Nick Drake and the rest of those kind of guys, buy this cd. I can't stop listening to it. I first heard flake off the radio, now I just can't help myself but to keep listening. BUY IT!!!! Or else you might end up with \\"bubble toes.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"PROMISING,WARM VIBES","review":"Being a big fan and follower of Ben Harper,I found out about this guy,Jack Johnson and his debut \\"Brushfire Fairytales\\" in a magazine article that said that Ben played slide guitar on a songon here.That alone made me eager to check out \\"Brushfire\\" and I'm glad I did because just like Ben or Dave Matthews or even the late,underlooked Nick Drake,Johnson's music is heavily acoutic yet is song-oriented with some elements of surf-popand reggae for extra vibes.My favorite on here is probably \\"Flake\\" which features Ben on slide guitar.But all the songs have their own flavor really.If you like Ben Harper or Dave Matthews or even G.Love and Special Sauce(Jack appeared on one of his albums),give \\"BrushfireFairytales\\" a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"over-rated at best","review":"people seem to flock to the \\"singer/songwriters\\" nowadays... starting with john mayer and followed by jack johnson... there are a few good songs, but in my opinion nothing spectacular... Basically, I would like to say that this has been done before and is nothing captivating..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Jack Johnson is just another in a long line of surf-rockers who's laidback, effortless style will never change. Most of his guitar riffs are the same repetitive chords, and his lyrics are pure lunacy (listen to Mud Football, you'll see what I mean). The only sign of talent on this cd is the opening to brushfire fairytales, but even that song becomes swallowed by the sameness of all the other songs on this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is SOOOOOO.........disapppointing","review":"I bought this album because the San Francisco \\"underground\\" touted it as a great piece of music. I should have figured that once the Bay area's mainstream newspapers began hyping it, something was wrong. All I can say is that most people in my opinion will be extremely disappointed with this CD..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entirely derivative, uninspired drivel","review":"For those whose minds operate on only 2 cylinders and who like to hear music without a flare of originality or creativity, marked by such inspired titles as 'Bubble Toes', the album of your dreams has arrived. If you took good music and removed all its best characteristics, this album is the end result. I even prefer elevator music over this album- at least elevator music often reminds you of the good arrangements or melodies that it came from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly tuneful, un-witty and permeated with boredom","review":"I am afraid I am going to upset a few people but this CD is a touch on the dull side. Well to be fair it is very very dull indeed. Please do not waste your money on this while there are good recording artists out there. Unless you are an Aussie or a kiwi and then the chances are you will love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept album!","review":"Oh! I finally get it! Brushfire fairtales is one big concept album, exploring, and finding, the great meaning of life. That ethereal, vapor of destiny that we all try and find. Some call it God, some call it Buddha, but whatever Jack calls it, he's found it. The simplicity of the same chords over and over again, in the same rhythm, with almost the same melody is just to keep everything from getting too heady so that the true deep meanings behind every lyric can be more readily understood. Man, what a genius. The complex with the simple. The sacred with the profane.No, wait, he's just that unimaginitive and only has one guitar strumming pattern. My mistake.ZZZ"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very poorly written album...","review":"Sure, Jack Johnson may be the flavour of the week, but has anyone actually listened to his lyrics? They're terribly unoriginal and not very well composed. The actual music is beautiful, but Johnson can't write lyrics to save his life (rhyming 'football' with 'football' is a poor lyrical decision regardless). This overall detracts from the album, since it's very hard to enjoy his amazing guitar-playing when his lyrics are so awfully distracting in their poor composition. Hopefully, he'll correct his mistakes by the time his next album comes out, but for now, this record should have been released as an instrumental..."},{"rating":"2","title":"WoW An Icredible CD","review":"After watching a recently released surfing video I came across this one song. It happend to be the track Mud Football on the cd Brushfire Fairytales. Although never hearing of this man before, I decided to pick it up. Expecting to hear Mud Football style songs, I was blown away by the rest of the tracks. The surfer Jack Johnson and his Layed Back Califorina Style will keep u listening for hours. This CD is a mix of Ben Harper / G. Love style, probably due to the fact all three are friends. In the song Flake, Ben Harper accompanies Jack with his famous steel guitar. His music can be ranged from an up beat track like Mud Football to a slow relaxing sound like It's All Understood. He Just had two big apperarences on the Soundtrack of \\"Out Cold\\", on Jay Leno, and On VH1's Late Night with Zack. A CD has never spent so much time in my reciever as this one. I highly suggest picking this title"},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to this every morning","review":"Who doesn't like Jack Johnson!?! I listen to this one every morning, because of the relaxed (yet upbeat) music. Good buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST SONG TITLES!","review":"Ever stroll into a store and wonder why the music sounds so cooool and why doesn't your place ever groove quite like this? Put Jack Johnson on your CD player. Turn it up. Turn it down. The album sounds great either way.And hey! \\"Sexy Plexi\\" \\"Bubble Toes\\" \\"Mudfootball\\" \\"F-Stop Blues\\" The creative titles alone give you a glimpse into the interesting and very listenable lyrics. Great acoustic guitar.And JJ carries a lot of range. An album completely full of good music. Rare!Don't wait for the \\"Best of\\" album. This is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful lyricist and musician","review":"I bought this CD on a whim because I like the song \\"Flake\\" that is on the radio. That was over a month ago and I haven't taken it out of the CD player yet! I really recommend this to anyone-the music is catchy and refreshing and the lyrics are interesting too. I can't do justice for him. Jack Johnson is one of my new favorite artists!"},{"rating":"2","title":"IF YOU'RE SICK OF COMMERCIAL PAP, GET THIS ALBUM!","review":"Just got this cd and can't stop playing it! First heard \\"Flake\\" some two years ago on a CMJ compilation disc and couldn't get the song out of my head. Couldn't find Jack Johnson in any music stores. Saw him on Leno and said, \\"I must have this!\\" And thank God I did. A lot of people have said he's like Dave Matthews, but I think he's more like Beth Orton a la \\"Central Reservation.\\" Anyone can sing words to music written by other people, but when a person writes and feels his own material, it certainly shows. I think this cd will be in my player for years to come. Good chill-out music for cleaning the house, playing with your dog or mending a heart battered by the world. If you like Beth Orton, Dave Matthews or Coldplay, get this album!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Words can never express great music","review":"It has been five years since I have been this excided about new musical talent. This is a perfect CD for anyone who likes excellent, never-boring, accoustically innovative music. A beautiful piece from start to finish. I already love Jack Johnson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where has this guy been?","review":"I saw Jack Johnson open for Ben Harper and I think he should start headlining shows! Everyone at the concert was totally gruven with his music!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It Grows On You","review":"The first time I heard this disc, I thought it was pretty good. I left it on repeat during that day, and I liked it better after each listen. After about a week, I LOVED it! Jack just gets his hooks in you and won't let go. Every person I have played this music for had to have a copy of their own. It is what I wanted in an album before I knew what I wanted! I saw Ben Harper in Asheville, NC a year or two ago. I arrived in time to see the start of Ben's show. Later I learned that Jack Johnson had opened and put on an outstanding show. It kills me that I missed out on seeing such an outstanding musician. Buy this cd if you have to scrounge the last bits of change from the ashtray in your car!"},{"rating":"2","title":"shuflyr","review":"You will never file this CD away because you will never become tired of experiencing it. Jack is nothing short of amazingly gifted. From his lyrics to his melodies to his change-ups and his riffs to his incredibly relaxing uninhibited voice. This CD is the perfect anecdote for the little stresses of life, a perspective Jack shares which is surly rooted in his Hawaiian upbringing. Brushfire gets better every time you hear it, and you will find yourself gravitating toward a different favorite song as time evolves. I'm currently partial to F-Stop Blues. I have heard of no one who didn't immediately fall in love with the beauty of Brushfire Fairytales. I'm looking forward to hearing Jack's music: past, present and future for the rest of my life, and you will too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack Johnson chills!","review":"...\\"Slow down everyone ...you're moving too fast...\\" Those are the words me and my girlfriend can't forget. We were in Boracay(beach) last April and I was listening to this CD when suddenly Jack belts out those words. It was the perfect soundtrack to what we were doing. Lounging! We were on vacation on a very nice beach, drinking shakes and leaving all the stress of city life. As with all the other albums Jack Johnson is the master in making chill music. Brushfire Fairytales is a tad slower than the other albums but who cares, it's still good lounging music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack Johnson","review":"This album, and all of jack Johnsons' are absolutely fabulous. They are a complete masterpiece. IF anybody is wondering, Jack Johnson is around 30 years old, he was a pro-surfer at the age of 17, but sadly had to stop competing in surf contests because of an injury. After Jack stopped being a 'pro-surfer' he started writing and performing music, and has many albums out at the moment. Jack is very close friends with Kelly Slater, and if you happen to have 'kelly slaters pro surf' play station game, you will notice that the back-round music is the \\"Brushfire Fairy tales' album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never before","review":"Never before have i ever heard something so amazing, this cd is like a religious experience. A mixture of Brad Nowell, Dave Mathews, and Ben Harper...lyrics something out John Mayer and a creative spin on every song. Stand out tracks are ...everything actually. If you don't have the cd, then what are you doing wasteing your time here? Go out and get this. Never again will you get a mixture like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"This album is absolutely fantastic. It is upbeat but relaxing at the same time. My favorite band has been Counting Crows for years, but the minute I heard this album, I started questioning that! This album is the best debut album I have ever heard. I can't wait for the release of his next album. Superb!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!!","review":"... Then the next day I played it again and wow. What a GREAT album! It is cool, sooth, and mellow. Yet, it has a slight funky undertone, a nice amount of passion, and very nice composition. A worthwhile addition to your musical libarary. Jack, if you read this--awesome job--you rock!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure and Simple Sound","review":"I first heard Jack Johnson when he was a guest on G.Love's \\"Philadelphonic\\". Johnson's sound is so pure and simple that a true music fan will love. You can really tell that his singing and guitar playing is truly coming for his heart. I look forward to more of Jack Johnson's music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"I bought this cd after listening to my sister's copy of it. I hadn't realized that Jack sang \\"rodeo clowns\\" that G Love put out on the radio awhile back. I bought his cd just for the Jack Johnson track on it! I was also lucky enough to see a free show just last week at Washington State University where Jack played. He had a cold and still put on one heck of a great show. Pick this up, it will not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"This is an amazing CD. I was dragged into a room to listen to it and haven't stopped since. Just trust your instincts and buy it. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I didn't think I could ever really appreciate a guy with an accoustic guiar before Jack Johnson. But this CD is excellent.

Personally, I'd rather be out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Joke Johnson","review":"This is recycled garbage, I respect him as a surfer but not as a musician. Its as though anyone who has some guitar talent and \\"catchy\\" lyrics can start a major music monopoly over the whole world. I could see this coming from a mile away because it very much fits with all the other pop music going on right now. He is not a real music artist, he is a product of the media, just like all the other pop stars out there. If you wanna be brainwashed into going \\"ladedadaa\\" for the rest of your life go ahead and buy this CD. Or take the other path and wake up. This is an IMAGE this could be any surfer with a guitar.

If I could give it negative stars, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Piece of [garbage] album that everybody will love!","review":"Now lets be honest people, do you like Jack Johnson because he actually produces new and innovative music, or is it because you have to like him to be in the know? Well this is a classic example of why the music industry [isn't good] these days, all this album is, is a mess of repetetive songs that don't stand out in any way among all the talentless artists that tear up the charts these days. The thing about Jack Johnson is he floats under the radar so much that he hasn't really been blamed for the aweful music he creates. So why is it that it's not that hard to go platinum these days and it used to be a career defining moment to go gold? because of every single person who watches MTV religiously and listens to music only because their friends do. They call it catchy, I call it [garbage], they call themselves music lovers, I call them sheep. By the way if you want to here good current rock music, listen to the White Stripes."},{"rating":"1","title":"kev al","review":"This would be a very good, calming folk album, if it wasn't for the annoying drums. Everytime that same drum came in,on every song,it ruined everything.Im going to check out his new album. Maybe he left the drummer on the islands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah, blah, blah","review":"Nothing new here. Just a genetic disaster, mixing Ben Harper with Dave Mathews, neither of which are fresh or original these days.

Besides me, is there anyone out there old enough to remember Michael Franks? A twenty-five year old graduate student has me listening to this and one of my co-workers (who's in her early 30s) has sung this person's praises. I feel I cannot join the chorus. For those who think this is new, go back to the seventies and discover Mr. Franks. Then you will realize how clumsily Mr. Johnson has copied someone else's muse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooorrrring","review":"After listening to the entire CD, I want my money back. Jack Johnson uses near-identical chord progressions and strum patterns on every song on this CD. Each song sounds exactly like the one before it, and quite frankly I can't listen to it without falling asleep. For better mellow folk-rock type music, check out the Indigo Girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"his 1st cd is better","review":"i prefer this cd to his second one. the second one isnt as well made as this one. i dont know why, but a lot of the songs on the second cd are really repetative. i first heard this cd while i was working at a music store, i didnt pick up on it quite then, but a few months passed and i really got into it. i guess maybe it has to grow on you. i will say this, i liked it enough to buy it for two people. so there."},{"rating":"2","title":"only one problem","review":"I like all the songs on this album - the only problem I have is that the drum is too loud and it covers up the voice of the singer, so I have to turn the volume up just to hear the singing and it's annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"I need more Jack Johnson!!!","review":"Why has no one heard of Jack? This is by far one of the best new albums in recent years. It has been in my rotation for almost six months, but very few people have recognized it. To the album's credit though, everyone I've played it for has gone out and bought a copy - it's just that good. I can't wait for the next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surfin Soul","review":"Jack Johnson's soulful surf grooves are a must have for anyone who enjoys daydreaming of better places . . . F Stop Blues is right on and will take you to that favorite place. For you surfers in the crowd, check out his film September Sessions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astounding in every way!","review":"No only do I love Jack Johnson's music, the mastering is phenomenal. If you have the audiophile gear to really appreciate the post production work, this is a must have CD. It is my number one choice for demo-ing my music room's system to friends, family and the like. To just see their expressions is such a treat. Jack is not just playing - he's right there with you. Fantastic work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"In a perfect world this would be 10 times...","review":"as popular as John Mayer. Mr. Johnson provides a type of music that has been missing from the scene for a long time in laid back folk and rock. Just one man with his guitar can say so much. These songs are simple while the lyrics are complex and meaningful. Bubbletoes, Posters, Middleman, Flake, Fortunate Fool all of the album stands out! If you only give it a listen or two you might think that some of the songs kinda run together. Well I'd say to you then to listen to this album a few more times. Each track is a work all to its own. Surfing star Jack Johnson gave up his pro career to become a musician and I'm really glad he did. Easily one of the most solid debut albums in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mellow","review":"What a wonderful album. When people make statements such as \\"There is no breakaway artist in music today\\", they ignore people like Pete Yorn and especially Jack Johnson. Johnson is an artist that I find to be a rich man's John Mayer. We're all familiar with the singles like \\"Flake\\" and \\"Bubble Toes\\" but on songs like \\"Inaudible Melodies, \\"Mudfootball\\", \\"Losing Hope\\", and \\"Fortunate Fool\\" Johnson proves that he can do what so many hitmakers fail to accomplish, he made an album. It is a cd that flows from track one until its done. While some artists, even great ones, make cd's that seem more like a greatest hits album, Johnson reminds us what it is like to hear a great record. I am greatly anticipating his second album with the wonderful \\"Horizon...\\" single. Jack Johnson has a lot to live up to on his next album due to the great effort here, but he seems capable of making multple great records.

I'm using some flannel PJ's right now which seem to work great, quickly and no lint or scratches. Hopefully I can find some decent cloths because I clean so many CD's. The machine I use for cleaning the CD-s is professional grade and run's about $199, I can use 1200 grit sandpaper for very deep scratches, but normaly I use two different cleaning compounds and then the spray so there is a lot to clean after I run my CD-s through this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with product","review":"I received the product quickly, however, I was very disappointed with the actual product.

It wasn't for me. It would have been helpful if the manufacturer had put the buckwheat in some sort of lining, so (1) you could remove some of the buckwheat to make this thing more pliable, and (2) so the cover could be washed. But the buckwheat is just stuffed into the zipped cover. The zipper is good to have, but what are you supposed to do with the load of buckwheat, when you want to take it out to wash the cover? And then how do you funnel it back in?! Anyway, mine became a donation to the local church thrift shop."},{"rating":"2","title":"An informative historical read, insightful and inspiration.","review":"My hands are bad, so I'm unable to type much. Overall, it was an enjoyable read. I'm bible college and seminary trained (in a mainline protestant tradition), yet I found the book historically interesting and very passionate. I would definitely recommend to non-Catholics interested in the historical side of the Christian faith, for understanding the times, people's lives and struggles, as well as to those drawn to learning more of God's interesting works and His ways. I acquired the book because of Tauler's influence on Luther, and an affection I've gained for some involved with early European Pietism."},{"rating":"1","title":"A love affair between two narcissists. Huh?","review":"I have the impression that the affair between Chanel and Stravinsky was in fact a trivial adventure for the both of them. Chanel did couture and Stravinsky did music, but neither made much of a mark on the other. How could they? They were a couple of megalomaniacs. So, it's not clear to me why anyone would try to write a love story about two people who didn't love one another.On the DVD there's a short movie; 'The Making of Coco and Igor', which is instructive. We see the actors and film makers having a heck of a time trying to figure out what this movie is about and why they are making it. And not finding out.Unless for the outfits and the interior design."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bit disappointing","review":"definitely not as good and COCO BEFORE CHANEL, which is a classic in my eyes and I view it often.

It seems like they bring Chanel and Stravinsky alive again. The soundtrack, which is very important in this one, is just sublime.The only thing is that there is no real structure. But since this is a biographical movie, we do not seek so much to be entertained as to be informed.Recommended for everyone who has an interest in history of music and biographical movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"Watching this trainwreck for free on television is very different from actually expecting people to pay for it. On television, at first, the main reason to watch was to answer the question, \\"Are these two for real?\\" .But after a few episodes it was pretty clear that, yes, Lisa and Brittney (especially Lisa, the mother) really are as shallow and self-centered and lazy as it seems--with a tremendous sense of self-importance and entitlement. Why do they feel the world should revolve around them? Will people really pay to see them shop, be rude to each other (and those around them), and try to be the center of attention in all circumstances?When Lisa was recently asked on 20/20 what \\"The Gastineau Girls\\" was about, she answered, \\"Nothing.\\" That sums it up pretty well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Useless!","review":"This has got to be the most boring, unecessary show that was ever on!

Insufficient information given.","review":"This might be a nice box for storing or for mailing 2x2 slides. Unfortunately, there is no information about the size of the box or about how many slides it might hold, or whether it might be considered for archival storage of slides. There is also no information about the finish. It would be too much to assume that since it is described as 'natural beech wood' that it was unfinished. Even if it is not suitable for 2x2 slides, it may be suitable for curios or other small items. I might even buy one if the dimensions were given."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holds a 2 x 2 photo in the center!","review":"I understand that dimensions would be helpful in the description, but it seems obvious that this box is about 6\\" x 6\\" square, with a depth of about 4.\\" If you notice the 2\\" x 2\\" square in the center is meant to hold a little photo or momento so that is how I determined the size from the picture. It should hold 3x5 photos nicely.Natural Beech usually has no finish, so a box like this is perfect for decorating! I can imagine it covered with antique buttons but I'm sure you can come up with your own ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid and fast CD-RW drive","review":"The Benq drive is well made and records at advertised speeds when fast, high quality disks are used. Very quiet even when spinning up. Playback speeds vary according to demand and don't just spin up fully all the time like some bargain dirves.

It doesn't go much into the meat of Six Sigma, but is focused around developing a Six Sigma culture within your organization. It is also very redundant, repeating the same themes over and over throughout the book. A good editor could have reduced this book to 50 pages. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent strategic resource","review":"This book provides a valuable strategic framework with which to implement Six Sigma within a company today. Unlike most books on Six Sigma, which focus on the granular details of six sigma implementation, this book focuses on implementation from a strategic perspective; in other words, on how a company's top leadership team must be intimately involved in making Six Sigma work by creating an internal \\"climate of alignment\\" to make Six Sigma initiatives suceed. From my perspective, a critical resource for today's CEOs and their top leadership teams!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Six Sigma Leadership Book!","review":"Well written from the strategic view of Six Sigma and where it fits into your existing corporate methodologies, process efforts and strategic initiatives.

It only took her a couple hours to get through all the puzzles but she has played it again and again after that. Once you solve some of puzzles, players are rewarded with a computer game. I like that it was self-explanatory and she could do everything by herself since she feels more accomplished when she doesn't ask me for help.The other reviewer described this as a workbook, and it is a bit like that, no fancy graphics here. Even so, my daughter has been playing fancier games like Reader Rabbit, Math Missions, and Zoombinis since she was four but she was not bored by the Vocabulary Puzzles format. I feel like the software was a great deal and we really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Was Mr. Frisell Thinking With This One?","review":"I'm sorry but this album isn't what I expected it to be. This album is the embodiment of anything that's not musical. The reason I'm giving this album 2 stars is for the song \\"Wildwood Flower,\\" which seems to be the most cohesive song on the album. As another reviewer said, he needs to be in a band context. I think solo guitar excursions like this should be just for fun not on an album. I'm a guitarist and I play around with loops all the time, but I'm just fooling around I'm not making actual songs up. I think the beauty of playing with other musicians is the fact that they'll make your music head in directions that you otherwise wouldn't go in. BILL PLEASE DON'T EVER MAKE AN ALBUM LIKE THIS AGAIN! You're better off with albums like \\"Good Dog, Happy Man,\\" \\"The Willies,\\" \\"Nashville,\\" and \\"The Intercontinentals.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Return of the Carter Family","review":"Nice bit of folk guitar playing here,but who are we kidding when this CD sits in the JAZZ racks? That's where folks like Wes Montgomery and Barney Kessell hang out.See,Jazz has a fair bit to do with improvisation which produces swing.I discern no attempt to do this here. If this is jazz then Maybelle Carter was up there with Joe Pass.She was a great guitar player but she would have laughed in your face if anyone called her music jazz.Be that as it may Bill plays some pretty sounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"More predictable Frisell: I am getting sick of it....","review":"There was a time a few years ago where I thought Frisell was onto a whole new way of playing. Now I realize he is just limited, his constant stuttering about was not so much about an original way of thinking as much as just being slightly inarticulate as an improviser. Here is the six zillonth record to come out in the past few years with Frisell once again hawking his \\"isn't it ironic that I am such a nerdy genius guitar player\\" schtick. I am just tired of it. And it has never sounded more affected and mawkish than here. The \\"Americana\\" thing as a solo artist with overdubs was done more effectively and naturally by Pat Metheny as far back as 1979 on New Chautauqua (why does no one ever mention the very OBVIOUS debt that Frisell owes to this period of Metheny?) and with this new record, Frisell has worn out his welcome with this listener. If you have any of Frisell's last ten records, you don't need to get this - you already know what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Rated Guitarist","review":"I borrowed this CD and others from Frisell's collection, from my co-worker and have listened to them. As a fellow guitarist who learned off of Coryell, McGlaughlin, Holdsworth, Abercrombie, Martino, and Towner, Bill Frisell did nothing for me. His style is somewhat interesting but that is all. He maybe a good footnote if fusing country, bluegrass and jazz, but I feel that Coryell and Metheny did that allot more effectively. Both guitarists have passion and excitement in their playing. Furthermore, their playing is lyrical and quite beautiful at times. Frisell lacks the above characteristics, plus he seems to be in a rut and his career has not been as vast as the mentioned guitarists. Thus, I must dismiss him as an ok guitarist but nothing more. Even Towner, a 12 String and Classical guitarist (and pianist) moves me. Frisell does not, just put me to sleep and id rather listen to Brian Eno for that. He even has more passion in his works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gracefull, relaxing music","review":"I listened to Bill Frizell's interview on NPR when I was driving back to work from lunch. I listened to his song Poem for Eva and knew I HAD to have this CD. I ordered it through \\"One clik buy\\" - total impulse purchase and have not been disappointed. The music is so simple and elegant. I have really enjoyed listening to it several times over in the past few days. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys pure unassuming music that calms their spirit and restores their soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tell Your Ma, Tell Your Pa","review":"Yeah, so it's not jazz-jazz. Who cares? It's a wonderful CD with some wonderful guitar compositions on it. This is a great CD to just get lost in.

Check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunningly Beautiful Music","review":"Frisell is an artist of the highest order. He transcends the label of guitar player, in fact when I listen to him I forget about labels - I don't even think \\"guitar\\" or \\"drums\\" or \\"bass\\". I don't think about licks. I don't think about canned formulas or show-off playing.Frisell is a walking encyclopedia of American music. He plays with a depth and sensitivity that are unrivaled.Thank goodness for artists like Bill Frisell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money","review":"Very disappointed with this dvd. I could have done better with my own video camera. Waterfall scenes are very poor(looks more like water running over some rocks).

The story didn't quite make sense and definitely didn't come together at the end. It is not animated as you would guess from the movie title picture. It also goes back and forth between silent film (text in its own frame), subtitles and regular people talking. There was so little about it that was erotic that it would have been more productive to leave the description as psycho. Not worth my $1.99 or my 45 mins, I wish I could get them both back. :-("},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't see the need for a review title but the story was good","review":"Interesting, entertaining, generally enjoyable. Too much back-tracking for me, especially early on. Original ending!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An OK mystery, but heavy handed \\"satire\\"","review":"The cover hype promises a comic social satire. What you find inside is a running series of sour, authorial jabs at various aspects of current English middle class culture. The mystery itself is workmanlike, but neither of the dogged pair of sleuths is particularly likeable. All in all, a ho-hum and disappointing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"* Not Entertaining, Not Clever (in my opinion) *","review":"The author tries too hard to be smart, and the poems come off sounding forced and arrogant.

CD if you are into 60s Psych music.I consider this the Deads best Album right with Aoxomoxoa then Anthem of the Sun then Live Dead in that order there best four Albums.My reaction to Workingman's Dead and American Beauty (Both great Albums if you like that type of music) is this a Rock band? Where are the electric Guitars?Sorry I love the Deads early Rock Music."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"This was the best recording ever made by the Grateful Dead. The instrumentation, the singing, the production - it's all perfect. I bought the vinyl version in 1970, wore it out, and replaced it recently with this CD.You may appreciate the bonus tracks if you're a fan of the Dead in concert. True Deadheads are, but I'm not. I would have been happier with Workingman's Dead and American Beauty on a single CD than with another half dozen out-of-key live songs. There are dozens of live CD's out there, and nothing special about the bonus tracks here.But that's nitpicking, and doesn't take away from the beauty of the original record. Which remains a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grateful Dead's breakthrough album","review":"If it was'nt for this album the Grateful Dead would've been long forgotten and would've been forever looked down on as just another San Fransisco sounds group. It was with this album in which the late Great Jerry Garcia (1942-1995 9 years ago today he passed on) was able to fully spread his encyclopedia of musical knowledge and play not only exellant country, but folk also. This was their best album. Pick this one up today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Workingman's Dead","review":"OK, I admit it took me a long time to understand and appreciate the music of The Grateful Dead. It always sounded so loose and rambling to me, but now I think I realize that is what makes it. I suppose it is just one of those things that you have to come to a place in life where you can accept and appreciate it. I have come to love this album quite a bit over the last year, and am going to dive into some more Dead music. No bad songs on this album.

This cooker is not made by Corningware Electrics, but rather Select Brands, which I feel is pretty misleading. Also, it is listed as a \\"programmable\\" slow cooker. This is only partially correct: you cannot program it to cook for example for 4 hours at low, it is preset to cook for 1-7 hours on High; and 8-10 hours on Low and then to switch to warm. And finally, it did not come with a cookbook.

There have been many biographies on Lewis. A number of them dismiss a World So Wide as just another version of Dodsworth. Yes, there are similarities, but grouping both stories together is misunderstanding what Sinclair Lewis was trying to get at in his last novel. In Dodsworth, Lewis was writing from his brother, Claude's, perspective. In a World So Wide, we get a more personal reflection into Sinclair himself.

It's sad because it tells the story of the uncompromising conflict of ideologies between the English settlers and their Native American contemporaries. I watched the Disney movie first, which, though a bit cheesy, is lovable in its own way. The book was completely different. No happy ending, no romance, no love. Especially the chapter where True Son meets his relatives just seethes with hatred. I felt like Richter had tried to portray a fair picture of the wrong on both sides--although history may be forever ambiguous on that point--, but as such, the book makes for some pretty depressing material. The one redeeming factor, however, is its incredible portrayal of the Ohio wilderness. Richter's love for and appreciation of his homeland shine forth in lyrical truth that is not quickly forgotten. The book ends rather abruptly; reading its companion volume, A Country of Strangers, helps tie up the loose ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting view","review":"I thought it was kind of boring, but I did learn some stuff the indiands felt from their side.

For example, there was never any confict between True Son and his siblings. All his brothers and sisters fight, and including a sibling confrontation would have enhanced the book. In addition, after True Son left his indian home to be with his biological parents, he had many conflicts at his house and nothing was resolved. For example, the reader never discovered weather he gets back to his biological siblings. As you can see the book never had high points. It is not recomended for middle school readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"TRUE-SON MUST TRULY CHOOSE HIS OWN PATH","review":"This book is basically about a youngwhite boy who grows up in an Indian tribe.When the boy is about 13 or so the Indian tribewas told to let all the white captives go,andthe boy was one of those captives.Even though the boy does not want to go back he is forced too."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book ever","review":"This book was so boring and everybody in my LA class hated it.

Its about a white boy who was kidnapped by Indians when he was a baby and then raised by those Indians.

Yea, it may have so well written sentenses. It is mind-numbingly boring and pointless. Well, maybe not pointess but deffinently boring. The reason it is not pointless is because it does have soom what of a plot; which is, a boy who is tangled between two caltures. The worst part of the book to use is that he is shuned out of those two caltures at the end which makes the book disapointing to the reader and the author. The author probely would not care because he is dead.

The book is all about his return to and escape from his white family. It has a very shallow plot and the author seemed to take a very long time explaining a small action or custom. In the beginning, the chapters jump from the viewpoint of the main character, True Son, to that of a soldier who observes his actions. The changing of viewpoints makes the book very hard to follow. I do not think a teen or pre-teen would enjoy this book, though I would recommend it to a younger and more naive group of children who didn't care much for interesting plots or an exciting writing style."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzz","review":"What?

The sentences were too drawn out and monotonous. I do not like Conrad Richard's style. Others, however, may like this stuffy, stale book.

For example, when True Son and his dad were down at the river, the author focused too much on their conversation. He should have consentrated more on the feelings True Son was experiencing. Another example is when True Son's father was bringing him back to his biological parents. The book had a entire chapter describing the journey to the camp. Focusing more on being at the camp would have been more interesting. As one can see, focusing too much on the small details makes it difficult for middle schoolers to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I have ever been made to read.","review":"This book was so boring.

After that, his indian customs and knowledge he had gained by his indian father (Cuyloga) were long gone..... until, one night, he escaped with his cousin... to a long journey back home.This story is good, specially for young adult such as myself because it reflects the hard decitions a kid that age had to do.

Also, in the beginning of the book when Half Arrow was marching with True Son, one could that Half Arrow would have to leave after they crossed the river."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of word content","review":"I purchased this book for my son's fifth grade reading assignment. This book wouldn't be a book I would have purchased for my son without it being mandatory. I felt that the story line of the book was good, but I had a problem with some of the language that was used in the book, specifically on page 63. It contained the use of G*d D**n five times. I don't beleive that kind of language is profitable to anyone of any age."},{"rating":"1","title":"The light in the forest","review":"This book was very boring at times. but sometimes is was OK. overall i didn't enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Light in the Forest","review":"This book, The Light in the Forest, is not a book that you want to continue reading. The way the sentences are constructed, with no thrilling words or exiting topics, does not support your enjoyment of the book. With its many brief paragraphs it is hard to keep your attention on the topics discussed. Chapter by chapter your attention span grows short for the lengthy description that you almost drown in. As the book reaches its last few pages, you realize what a waist of time and effort you have spent on such a poorly written and non-eventful book. As you look back on what you read, you will also find how politically correct and simplistic this book is. The Light in the Forest is not a book I would recommend because of its ridiculously clean plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"This book was a waste of time. Its plot was not very interesting. It was about a tribe of Indians who are forced to give up their \\"adopted\\" white son. The son then goes on to live with his real white family for several months, before escaping and returning to his Indian village and Indian family. At the end the Indians no longer accept him, and neither do the whites. Not very captivating is it? The book would be better if the characters had been more developed. Also, the author should have made the book more exciting and eventful. I'm telling you, if it wasn't assigned I wouldn't have read it. I don't think middle schoolers would like this book any more than I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Light in the Forest a good book","review":"It was no action in the book or excitement in it.But when you get reading it gets a little good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!!!!!!!","review":"This book was one of the worst books I have ever read! I had to read it for English class in eighth grade. If it wasn't assigned literature in most places, no one would ever read this book. It was incredibly stupid and boring. It was hard for me to read because it was so BORING! I almost fell asleep reading it. The ending was horrible, too. If you really want to read this book, then feel free, but if you're looking for recommendations, you won't get one from me. If you're really into historical fiction only because of the history in it, then this book is for you, but that's not how I am.

The book is a bad example of how the Indians and the white people got along. Some of the Indians were very hostile toward the white men. But,some Indians were very nice to the white men. I didn't like the book because it sends wrong messages about how things were back then. Because there were more white men that picked on Indians than vice versa. I feel the book was not very well written, I feel that if the author had researche Indians more he would have written a better book and made it sound more real. I would not recommend this book for anyone because it was not well written it didn't have any details as to why the white men wanted John back.

Also, I don't understand why they have middle/high school children reading this book, because the book has the word scalping, or something to that effect,every other word. It is so REPULSIVE. I do not recommend this book to any one. If you must read it I suggest that you don't if are a girl. Guys would probably love the graphic violence in some parts of the book.

The book wasn't terrible, but not something a young reader would expect. This book was about a boy adopted by indians at the age of four. He took to the ways of the indians, and was considered one by the other members of the tribe. At age fourteen, the boy was forced to return to his true family on the American frontier.

I'll admit that they're good looking chairs, but much smaller than I anticipated and the fabric on the chairs is of a lesser quality. Fortunately, with my cost savings, I can easily pick of some fabric and do a quick custom cover of each seat which will result in making the chairs appear far more attractive than the $240 paid (6 chairs).

In fact, we're gonna off the Asgard by letting them commit mass suicide and then we're going to spring a Greek tragedy on poor T'ealc. This show succeeded through its sense of humor (why else watch a show where everyone within three galaxies all speak 21st century English? Duh!).

Season 9 was disappointing. The Ori were tedious, and there were idea rip-offs from earlier seasons that weren't well done. Season 10 had less rip-offs, and the several that were had interesting twists. My favorite episode is the one where SG-1 goes to a planet by mistake, and ends up in a very unusual first contact situation. This episode seemed more like the early Stargate episodes, and less like the space opera Stargate seems to have become.The character Vala adds a lot of zest to season 10. This makes up for Daniel who seems to have had enough of Stargate, and seems a bit tired. All in all, I was glad I bought Season 10.

How many shows about the Ori (the really bad guys) can one see and I didn't like the closing show of the program but at least it didn't leave one hanging with what happens to the characters as usually happens when a show is canceled."},{"rating":"1","title":"stargate sg1 season 10","review":"im sure this would be great but being from northern ireland i wasnt able to play them on my dvd player , i would have to buy an american dvd player to see them"},{"rating":"1","title":"This season bombed","review":"I am HUGE SG-1 fan but thought this season bombed,especially the finale.

I could not decide if I wanted them on the front porch or back. All of the homes in my neighborhood are built with front porches, so I place them there.I like to go out when a storm is coming in and listen to the chimes, they are really lovely.

And it sounds wonderful!Regarding DurabilityI have had issues with one of my Woodstock chimes falling apart. The chimes are suspended from the base by a nylon rope that is threaded through two holes in each chime. Eventually the metal chime would wear down and cut through the nylon rope causing the chime to fall to the ground.Woodstock is now putting rubber grommets inside the hanging holes which should prevent the hanging strings from being cut in this manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Chimes!","review":"Woodstock chimes are the best and these are no exception.

The four small bar chimes harmonizing with the larger tubular chimes are an interesting touch. However, see below.Cons:--Small inner striker started to rust after one night outside.--Made in China.--Requires a stiff breeze to make any sound. In 10mph winds, the chimes swayed a bit but hardly made a sound. In gusts, the chimes sounded, but were very quiet and had little sustain. I needed to be within about 10 feet to hear them clearly over the wind, whereas I could clearly hear a neighbor's chimes from farther away through a fence and hedgerow.--The manufacturer foolishly tied a cardboard tag to the chimes' strings using the same type of string. Be careful removing the tag or you might cut the chimes' strings.

The book takes an overview look at design, and speaks in plain english about many things that I've heard or dealt with. But catagorizes stuff and explains things in a fluid manner so that the different bits of information come together and make sense. It is good for the novice and the struggling self taught.

Ellen Lupton, the author of \\"Design Culture Now\\", came up with a book to fill a void where it was much needed. It is hard not to encounter useful elements in it to both, help you enhance existing designs or tackle new territory.The only downside of the book, and the reason I give it 4.5 and not 5 stars, is that the layout doesn't make it particularly easy to read and follow. Therefore it ends up being a book that you resort to for visual not textual queues of where you are, and for ideas rather than specific content. At least it was that way for me. Still, the number of visual ideas it carries makes it worth your while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top","review":"This book is excellent.I am a design student, and bought \\"Thinking with Type\\" prior to the first of two classes about type, in the hope that I would get excited about what seemed to me to be a very dull subject.

It has some interesting examples of unusual designs and has some value for designers of, for example, brochures or advertisements. But the book has limited value for the remaining targeted audience, as far too much of the book is devoted to oddities and strange designs that a writer, editor or student should NEVER even think of using.The majority of the examples of text settings in the book are unreadable for more than a few lines. No writer who actually wants his or her work to be read should ever want to have the text set in one of these designs.There are some useful guides on matters such as leading and tracking, but these are lost in the overall jumble.

The information itself was good, but to be honest it was so badly laid out that it hindered me from reading any further, and had to force myself to read to the 20th page.

The other problem I found was the caller id redial doesn't dial 1 before dialing out of area callbacks, but if you hit the one fast enough it works fine. Very easy to setup. I had this up about six month's and so far the batteries still work fine.

The book explores some very real and/or mature concerns - e.g., love, an absent father, familial obligations, unwed motherhood, sex, responsibility, culture, etc. - although they are interwoven into a fun and lighthearted tale of Negi's teen years.

Because the piano arrangements are not at all at the beginning level...they are more like what you would see in a book for a 2nd or even a 3rd year student. The hand positions are all over the place, with many shifts in hand position, there are many 3 and 4-note chords, there are pieces with both hands reading/playing treble clef, and there are many ledger line notes both above and below the staff. The illustrations are well done as is the cover art, but the piano arrangements themselves simply are not \\"easy!\\" I would recommend \\"My Christmas Fun Book Level One\\" instead as it really IS for beginning level piano students and players!My Christmas Fun Book Level One (Holiday Fun Series)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"This was a fun book to have over the Christmas Holidays.

The Herald Angels Sing; O Christmas Tree; We Wish You a Merry Christmas; God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen; Pat-a-pan; Shepherds, O Shepherds.There are illustrations throughout the book for children to color, and all-in-all it's not bad for the price.

I was looking for a Christmas book to use with my beginning piano students. While this book is very simply arranged, many of the songs are not in the key of C Major. Several of them are in the key of F or G, even D! Some of the songs also have eighth notes. This is not beginning level! None of my beginners could play from the book.

There's plenty of new material here to entertain. This time, though, the town of Coalwood takes more of a major role. We get to know both new and familiar characters as they alternately cope with and enjoy life in Coalwood.It is a vastly satisfying read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tremendous!","review":"Another excellent read from Homer Hickam! I can never truly know what it was like to grow up in Coalwood and to understand this small mining community's ways.

Homer Hickam does an excellent job of painting pictures with words."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't think he could do it!","review":"But he did. Now, thanks to Homer, I've lost another night's sleep. Just as with October Sky, as soon as I started reading The Coalwood Way, I couldn't put it down. But at least my Christmas list is solved. Not only is this a great book, I realized it's a Christmas story, too.

Homer (Sonny) Hickam tells a story here of true values, of miracles, of passionate truth. I'm in love with all the wonderful people of Coalwood. I intend to attend the October Sky Festival there this year. I especially liked the story of the deer on Christmas Eve. I will be assigning this one to my class permanently so that my students can appreciate how a memoir should be written. I believe Homer Hickam will ultimately be classified as among the greatest of American authors. May there always be another in this wonderful series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The same story...","review":"A story told first time can be fasicnating. As Rocket Boys was.

Now, Hickum returns to Coalwood to detail his life further in the Coalwood way. Set during and slightly after October Sky, Homer and his friends have to struggle to have their normal lives as well as their rocket work. Homer disapoints his mother, who lost her pet squirrel due to his carelessness and refuses to forgive him. Homer's social life is failing and so is the mine that his father works at. Everything seems to fall apart.The one thing that seems to bind the town together is the Christmas pagent that is coming up, and the one that his mother insists on doing alone, without any help.It was hard to put this book down. I had to find out what would happen between Homer and his friends and family, and the book just flew by. It is a very good emotional piece of work and well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very sophisticated kids for 1959","review":"First I read 'Torpedo Junction' a really good non fiction account of the Uboat war along the US coastline. Then I saw the movie October Sky on cable, then I read the Coalwood series. However, before I read the books and as a long time aerospace enthusiest I was somewhat cynical about the stories, but happily, I've mostly been proven wrong except for one small thing. It seems to me like the kids in this book seem a little too 'adult' in their dialogue and thoughts. To me, it reads as more of an idealized reconstruction from an adults perspective. But then again, they were able to figure out on their own how to design and build some pretty sophisticated vehicles, launch systems and fuel. So maybe I'm wrong regarding the thoughts an dialogue?

I found this bag extremely difficult to use because the cymbals simply do not want to all fit. I don't think that I should have to struggle at the end of a long night to get my bag to carry 4 or 5 cymbals. That's not asking too much. I ended up taking out the loose fitting liners, and even then, it would barely zip. I shouldn't have had to do that. I would not recommend this bag to anyone carrying a 22\\" cymbal.

In spite of attempts by some level headed men to control the town's outrage over a despicable crime, a number of men are roused into vigilante justice when some rustlers steal a herd of cattle and kill the owner in the process. This novel analyzes the mob mentality and how easy it is to fall into that trap. After all, these men are just trying to get justice for the murder of one of their own. The tension over the mob's shifting emotions is conveyed beautifully, and the lack of any patience for more information about the supposed murder eventually leads to tragic results. The story is a bit slow overall, being overly descriptive, but it really places you there at the time and place. I'm not a big fan of westerns, but this one makes a convincing statement about the importance and difficulty of assuming someone is innocent until proven guilty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneventfull,unrealistic-hard to follow","review":"I just completed this book in my sophmore english class. I feel that this book had alot of unused potential. It was very slow and uneventfull throughout the first three chapters, and I had trouble following the plot with so many characters popping in and out. The fourth chapter climax was a little easier to follow, considering the drastic change in action from people wandering the streets to the discovery of the accused \\"rustlers\\". Chapter five went slowly again, but having less characters involved in it made it easier to read. Over all, I thought this book was fairly confusing and hard to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"a very boring book","review":"This book was very hard to get into. The first 100 pages just talk about people playing cards and walking around town. There is absolutely no action at all.

I thought that since he was describing them so much, they would have some significance in the story, or maybe be important at the end, but they weren't. Those couple pages turned out to be just another couple of pages I wasted my time with that could've been used doing something else more useful in life.

Two innocent men are caught by the mob who then invite them to a necktie party, (a hanging), and one of the people in the mob tries to stop it realizing their mistake. He's shouted down and the hanging goes ahead in a pass known as the Ox-Bow. By the time it's over, the rest of the mob realizes too late that they've made a terrible mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Study in Mob Violence","review":"Readers who approach this book as if it were a Louis L'Amour formula western are going to be disappointed, for it is anything but the standard \\"shoot-em-up\\" sterotype of the genre. Set in a western context, it is a character study in human frailties. It shows the frightening tendency of humans to follow a strong charismatic leader--even when it goes against their better judgement and leads to destruction and tragedy.An outstanding book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needham, MA Junior in HS -- I liked it","review":"I know that there are some parts of this that are SLOW and such, but once you get reading and you find out who the characters, the ending alone taught me a lesson about Hitler's tyranny in Nazi Germany if you can believe it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Expert","review":"Stick with this one.

But I Hate Modern Library","review":"I loved this book. However Modern Library manages to fully spoil the plot in the second sentence of a four sentence synopsis on the back cover. If you don't want to know aspects of the resolution that Walter Van Tilburg Clark leaves unrevealed until page 210 of a 241 page book, buy another edition - or at least avoid the cover. From now on, I will do my best to avoid anything with the Modern Library logo."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good novel","review":"This book shows the violence that comes from a mob. It is a great example of how when men get angry, their judgement is distorted. In the Ox-Bow Incident the story is told by a trailhand named Art Croft. The book is a regular western novel until the men of the mob let their anger dictate their actions.

Hence I was very eager to get my hands on the latest installment of this series, \\"The Hunters\\". The book started off at a good pace in Hungary but as it progressed the protagonist got involved in endless discussions with various agencies and the storyline kind of dragged on without much steam. I honestly had trouble reading till the end. I have also started disliking Griffin's idea of removing female characters from the stories abruptly. This time it was with Betty Schneider. She was seldom mentioned during the entire story and at the very end she just ditches Charley!! I've seen similar ending with his other female characters in the other series that he has written (\\"Men in Blue\\").I really hope that he brings in a bit more action in his next installment of the \\"Presidential Series\\" which is due in January 2008."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snore...","review":"I've read all three books in this series. Really liked the first one, second one was ok, but this one was disappointing. Very little plot advancement and FAR too much of the characters rehashing events that had already occurred with each other. I'm sure that kind of thing probably happens in real-life FBI and CIA investigations but it's not necessary to subject your readers to it. I can't figure out why in the world Griffin felt it necessary to use up valuable page space with so many plot rehashes, unless of course he was intentionally doing it to meet his publisher's requirement for manuscript length.I actually put this book down about halfway through and was able to pick right up where I left off about a month later without having to go back and refresh my memory about what had happened earlier in the book, because a) there wasn't much of it, and b) I figured (correctly) that Griffin had built in more rehashes later in the book. And no, that's not a compliment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting a little trite","review":"WEB Griffin has set a high standard for himself...and his latest fails to reach that standard. He has his heroes jetting around the world and has continued his love affair with high tech special ops weapons but just sort of tosses their usage in randomly. I think he has now succumbed to pressure from his publisher to produce or perish. \\"The Hunters\\" simply doesn't tell a convincing story or have many interesting characters ...not like his previous books in this or his other series. Take a break and come up with some compelling tale! Perhaps he can talk to some of his Army Aviation friends and write about their exploits in Afghanistan or Iraq. This \\"presidential\\" series lacks believability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quiet long read where nothing ever happens.","review":"Never read anything be Griffin till now. Won't make that mistake again.Nothing happens in this book. Nothing.People just fly around and have meetings to discuss something that happened in the book before. Blah blah blah blah blah. No bad guys, no subplots, just endless discussion of some shootout at a house in another book. Something, anything, might have happened in the last quarter of the book, but I couldn't make myself waste any more of my life reading further."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial, lengthy","review":"I found this one of the weakest books I ever read. In a nutshell: the main hero of this book constantly travels around the world, meets lots of people, many of whom support him because they are old buddies and while traveling he works on a presidential mission. While it is a nice idea of the author to use foreign language to show off his expertise, a lot of the German language is plainly misplaced. Oops! While this is just a bit annoying there is a lot of repetition - the hero tells the story of his chase to basically everybody he meets - and the characters do not develop into more than superficial want-to-be cool action heros. I didn't find any suspension in there at all.When I bought this book I actually also got a second Griffin novel. I hope this is better. If not, it is at least not that voluminous..."},{"rating":"1","title":"1st and last Griffin novel","review":"There are too many characters, no real development of those characters, and the story doesn't really follow any rhyme or reason. It's just a globe-trotting, mish-mash of schemes, murders, and political figures. The seemingly critial characters in the 1st few chapters are non-existent at the end, and other figures introduced in the middle of the story just disappear without explanation. Terrible in all regards."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING boring borrrr . . . zzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"The main character Carlos Castillo is an egotistical, arrogant jerk. His cohorts are portrayed as little more than sychophantic lapdogs. And somewhere in the book is hidden a plot. But it takes hours and hundreds of pages to figure out it's a plot not worth reading. Unbelievably bad writing. How does this author get away with writing such drivel?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything is Too Neat and Easy","review":"Having read Griffin's other books featuring Castillo I was eager to read this one. It is ok. Not great not awful. The editting or transferring to kindle(whatever you call it) is sloppy with many many errors. And everything is too convienent. Everyone speaks flawless Russian, Spanish, Germany or Hungarian like a native. Everyone knows everyone else.

If you look this book honestly, you soon regognize, that very little happens. which leads question what is done with all those pages? and problem two.2. Talk Talk Talk, oh boy do they like to talk. And go over same things again and again and again. And don't get me started with the cartridge case episode at the first half of the book.So to but it bluntly, this book is Boring. It was my first book from Griffin and my last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good conclusion to saga","review":"In many ways WEB Griffin recycles types he has used before in the Brotherhood of War series. Charley Castillo seems to be a 21st century version of Craig Lowell-rich, good looking, irresistable to women, able to leap tall buildings at a single bound, produce his own airplane when he needs it. Yet, he is place into an interesting narrative involving the UN Oil for Food program/scandal,Russian expatriates/criminals and carte blanche authority from the President. It seems part of the struggle for this character (and perhaps where the next installment will lead) about whether he is becoming Ollie North II.The novel is full of action and bureaucratic infighting. It moves briskly and is well written. Like all of Griffin's work each book builds on another, and those who follow the series may find some of the catch up narrative tedious. Those who complete the book/series will find it to be a satisfying experience. I'm eager to experience the next installement in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"After really enjoying the first two books in this series, The Hunters is a big let down. I stopped reading it half way through because I was tired of both Griffin summarizing the previous 2 books for those readers who hadn't read them, and I was tired of Castillo continuing to fill every new character in on the \\"presidential finding.\\" It is as if Griffin is so proud of his Castillo character and his nifty lifestyle that he has to continue to pound it into the readers skull how special he is. WEB: we don't care, we want some action, and action does not involve reading for the 18th time how Castillo does indeed hold dual citizenship, answers only to the president, and flys around the world in a G3. Good lord there was no reason to turn the pages accept to hope that the author would actually start putting some suspense in the story as opposed to a grocery list of people that Castillo had to fill in on the story. Did I mention the book is repetitively dull?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrated beyond belief","review":"I liked the first 2 books, but the Hunters drove me NUTS! It was beyond repetitive, the writing was trash, there were so many spelling mistakes that you wonder if it was ever edited! Please do not try to write in a different language without consulting someone that can speak it. The mistakes were unbelievable.Nothing happens until 3/4 of the book - all it is Castillo going from one country to the next telling a history of the last book over and over again to anyone that will listen. I finally started skipping pages without missing anything..I want the days back that it took to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE HUNTERS (A PRESIDENTIAL AGENT NOVEL)","review":"Griffin's writing continues to be intriguing. However, the book is full of typo errors.For some reason it refers to all married women as \\"Mr.\\" It takes the reader some time to decide whether Griffin is referring to the wife or the husband.Words are run together so that poor Charley Castillo had to stand \\"atease\\" before his superior officer instead of at ease. etc.I'm not used to buying books that are full of errors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"Compared to other Griffin books, this was a major disappointment. There was very little action which I was expecting. Way too much time was spent on praising the main character to the point that you wondered when he was going to walk on water. This was one of those books that you might have thoughts of dumping half way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's back...","review":"W.E.B. Griffin came through with his usual excellent work, unlike last's year's collaborative effort, which I don't remember the name, because I don't want to.

Totally plot driven, populated with gaudy, overrrated characters who resemble a dominatrix rather than a fantasty character. I barely made it through the first 30 pages before I started skimming half heartedly through this haphazardly tossed together \\"novel\\".Perhaps if Mr Greenwood really loved the world he created, the publisher would not have destroyed it. Instead he beat it to death and stunned the fans with garbage like this, which didnt end here. He is not literary in the least-kitchy and childish, yes. Alas the Forgotten Realms, which held so much potential, has ended its appearance in our world."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was a complete waste of time...","review":"...

The movie has everything a horror junkie likes (well not so much on the [...], but that's why the internet was created): great cast, fast-paced, lots of blood, imaginative killings, interesting twist on the zombie genre.But, the movie also has brief, totally absurd musical interludes including a choreographed zombie line dance (think 'Thriller' but to a country/hip-hop beat). Some of the songs on the soundtrack are the narrator bridging the scenes (the narrator, Zach Selwyn, actually exists in the movie, though, and he and his band get turned into zombies, too). It's totally bizzare, tongue-in-cheek, and brilliant.So, a great country/hip-hop/folk soundtrack to an equally quirky movie. Both are highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool...new, insightful, and entertaining","review":"I'm a Belle and Sebastian fan and heard about this book from my friend.

He so effortlessly covers so many themes...the struggle between responsibility and pleasure, the loss of innocence, and the struggle to find true love in today's high-tech world.

My three kids (twins that are 3 1/2 years old and an 18 month old) received this for Christmas and they went nuts for it. By no means is it their favorite thing to play with, nor do they gravitate to it on a daily basis but now and then the button gets switched on, the music starts playing and the hips start moving (their hips - not mine). It's fun to hear them create their own sounds and let their imaginations roll.Our piano hasn't broken yet, but I can see it won't last for too many years to come -- especially with 3 little ones playing with it.Still it is a worth while toy and when their music interests peak, you'll want to take advantage of it and have something like this around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would know this toy better if it worked ;-)","review":"This looked like a good toy for my 2 yr old.

Of course, it was rock that I first loved, and only later through the years have I learned and appreciated the connection. Most people are aware of Eric Clapton and his fascination with Robert Johnson, first adapting his music and eventually honoring him with his CD played in the Johnson style. Canned Heat has a great disc with John Lee Hooker, too. But look at this 9-song disc; Back Door Man (The Doors), Spoonful (Cream), Little Red Rooster (Rolling Stones) are just examples of blues roots to rock 'n' roll in its greatest era, the 60s. Very nice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Willie Dixon - I AM the blues","review":"Ignore the \\"official\\" review and then find this album on VINYL.I purchased this LP back in 1974 on vinyl and still listen to it every so often.

No luck, but I must say I am so glad I am revisiting this LP. And I heartily agree with the other reviewer that if the CD sound quality suffers, it sure ain't because of the LP (or analog tapes).

I entirely overstudied for the exam. The only useful part of this book was that it did review basic math concepts (like multiplying fractions) that I hadn't done since high school.

At season 4 it was already clear that the producers are unable to acquire good acting talent and Sutherland's suffering from nepotism increases with each season.

After a season that topped all others, and after a presidential betrayal, where else could they go, but someplace completely new?Instead they decided to play it cheap production-wise and simply resorted to tricks for tricks sake. It seemed like every two weeks, they trotted out a new (old) story line, hoping something would click, and when it didn't they killed some characters. A lot of the storylines went nowhere and were soon forgotten like so many Mexican drug cartels. This show is over. The shark has been jumped, but not before being tortured tooth by tooth for 24 toothless episodes."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"I own all 1-5 seasons and love all of them very dearly. Obviously, I couldn't wait to own the 6th season. Sigh... Whoever wrote this season did a very very bad job. I could predict everything, every line, who was guilty, who will do this and that. Also, lines were so cheesy that I could not believe! Usually, I watch this show for 24 hours without sleeping because I can't wait to see what happened after. But 6th season took me over a week to finish because it bored me so much. I only finished it just for the sake of finishing it. I don't know if I should wait for the 7th season now. Very disappointed. But I'll recommend the previous 5 seasons to everyone. Just don't buy the 6th season.

Due to that perhaps my expectations were raised because I loved all 5 seasons. But I have to say that season 6 was disappointing and did not offer the same level of grip to the plot and the show. Prior to watching Season 6, I used to wish that the episodes just keep on going and not end, where as in this season I lost that spirit.I hope that in season 7 they recover.

Yes, I agree that Season 6 did not match up to Season 5 or Season 4. However, it was still good. It's very easy to criticise, but, in all honesty, matching up to the excellent Season 5 was probably next to impossible for the writers. So let's cut them a break. I am still going to buy the box set when it comes out in a few weeks. And as one other person rightly pointed out, compared to a lot of other trash on TV, it's still excellent and compelling storytelling.I have a gut feeling that Season 7 may be up there with previous seasons.

I was, and suppose am still, the kind of fan that forbade anyone to call or interupt me while watching the show. I wanted to be swept up in it and often was. Even though some elements of the show repeated themselves over the seasons, it was still done in a fresh and suspenseful way. The sixth season? It became almost a parody of itself. Too many torture scenes, too much patriotic rhetoric pounded over our heads as justificition for what was happening, too little interpersonal interaction. One of the reasons Season 5 was so good was that we got to see more sides of characters like Buchanan, or the arc Karen Hayes had, or the complex relationships between the Logans. I won't beat a dead horse with more critique, but here's to hoping season 7 will bring back the edge of your seat excitement we all love about the show..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst \\"Day\\" Ever","review":"This was easily the worst day of 24 ever. The first 4 hours were great (which is why it gets 2 stars and not 1) and the rest of the day seemed to drag on with no real plot devlopment and storylines just being in there for the sake of being there. Another major problem was the lack of great actors that were previously on the show to replaced with hacks such as - Nadia, Doyle, New Palmer (and his sister who is super annoying). The only good actors this season are Jack, Buchanon, and V.P. Daniels (Powers Booth from Sin City and Deadwood).Even if you are a diehard 24 fan skip this season as it is a complete waste. At best watch it for free - it would be a shame to waste money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"If you have never seen a season of 24, then maybe you'd like Season Six much more than I did. I've seen much of the story line before, and what is new, I wish I hadn't seen. Did anyone really need a love interest for Cloe? Can you say zero chemistry? The characters are weak, (Jack's dad and brother - really???? Whatever.)

Yup, been there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starts out promising, got a little boring, but ended strong.","review":"I must start by saying that I never watched 24 prior to seeing this season. That said, unlike other reviews, I'm purely reviewing this season and no otherBut, even having never seen a prior 24, I still have to agree with the faithful 24-ites on the problems with this season. About 3/4 through the season, they killed off the main villain and finished the plot. This weakened the show SO much. Probably the next three to four episodes after that were boring, dumb, and almost made me completely loose interest in the show. Thankfully, they were able to recover and the season ended strong, but still not as well as when the show started.That said, I am still looking forward to the next season. The plot of the season (well most of it), was very interesting and entertaining, and it had some pretty awesome action sequences.

From my experiences in trading stocks and futures I learned a long time ago not to look for a holy grail.

But the thief-murderer duo are apprehended long before the end, and the last part is his rather mundane account of how the jewels were stolen in India and life at the prison on the Andaman Islands. There's actually very little \\"mystery\\" or detection to it, since we know who the thief-murderer are early on. The boat chase on the Thames is not especially interesting or convincing, nor is the romance between Dr. Watson and the pretty client. What saves this is the almost palpable atmosphere of London in the time of Jack the Ripper, plus the outrageous conclusions drawn by Sherlock Holmes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sign of Four","review":"Interesting plot development. I had an internal battle picturing both Robert Downey Jr. and Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes a combination of both. Along side Jude Law and Martin Freeman as John Watson!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Reader","review":"Perhaps my least favorite of the longer Holmes works, at least the last time I read it, causing it to slip below the magic number.

You still can't go wrong with Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delightful Mystery","review":"A classic book, and the second story containing Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. Even though it's over 100 years old, it is still very enjoyable and quite the page-turner.If you enjoy detective stories, or just mysteries in general, read this book. This book, more than A Study in Scarlet, sets the stage for the Holmes and Watson sagas to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"good audio read","review":"The story leaves a little to be desired, but the reading is wonderful.

I have a fairly extesive address book created in it and it's easy to make changes and modifications from the master receiver to the clone. One thing a dislike about this phone is than every call gets listed as a received call, not just missed calls and messages left on my answering service, and as such, they need to be deleted; easy but unncessary. What's up with that Panasonic? The phone gets a little hot, just like a cell phone after an extensive conversation! And finally people tell me it's clearer when I'm using the speaker phone option rather than the private conversation choice.Other than that Mrs. Lincoln, how did you like the play?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerously hot battery","review":"My favorite cordless phone is the Uniden. It was offline for a week while I located a batteries to replace the old ones. In the mean time, I plugged in two different models of these Panasonic phones. This particular model, the KX-TG5422 heated up the battery in both handsets to a level in which it was nearly too hot to touch barehanded. I promptly threw them away. The other Panasonic model...similar, but not same model, seemed to be fine. I may have gotten a bad battery or system (gifted to me). Regardless, I won't be purchasing any Panasonic phones in the future. As I said, I really like the Uniden phones. They fit well in the hand, function properly, last many years and were inexpensive. All reasons why I prefer the Uniden. I just thought it was important to let everyone know that battery malfunction can be dangerous and did occur on this particular model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased","review":"Better sound quality than my regular phone. Excellent reception - even out in the yard, garage, out at the mailbox, etc. The handsets are very small - smaller than they look in the picture. They are around the size of cell phones from a few years ago. I keep a handset in my pocket and sometimes I forget it's still there when I leave home. Handset is kind of small to hold to your face with your shoulder, but you can plug in a headset or hands free device and that works fine. I can't imagine better sound quality in a cordless and the speaker phone feature works really well. The unit has a high quality look and feel - better than expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"I purchased this phone in September, it stopped working at the beginning of January and has been sitting in an authorized Panasonic service center waiting for a back-ordered part due to come in at the beginning of February.

This one has a few problems. Most annoying is the phones lose connectivity with the base at least weekly necessitating that I power it down and unplug the phone line.

It works fine with my other phones but for some reason I can't use voice when navigating an IVR voice prompt instead having to use the keys to enter data."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can you hear me now.","review":"This phone combo is not to bad.

The handset is not small, so it is convenient to hold with the shoulder. The menus are easy to use. I had no problems with the phone. The only drawback I see that you cannot add to the phonebook the number you just dialed. There is no intervention with wireless computer network."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG Dissapointment","review":"I bought this phone based on the reviews here and its ability to not interfere with Wifi. The features are great:voicemail alerts and voicemail dialingvarious ringersphonebookcaller id enhanced (see caller id of person even in call waiting mode)speaker phone (a big plus in my book)No Wifi Interference.BUT the biggest problem was the quality of voice. Quality of voice coming in is fine but everyone else heard an echo (like I was in a tunnel) when I called them. Annoyed people enough that I am returning this just after owning it a few days.I replaced it with a Uniden Tru Series and that has been much better. Uniden's sound isn't perfect but its MUCH improved than this Panasonic. The Uniden Series is recommended by TomsNetworking (any networking geek should know this guide and review site) The only feature Uniden really lacks is the multi colored alerts otherwise it matches the panasonic feature for feature"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Reception and Doesn't Interfere with Computer","review":"I have owned Panasonic phones for years and been happy with the quality.

So now I have 4 headsets throughout the house!The reception is great and the phone was easy to program. I like the extra features-- the ability to have different rings, sounds and color lights associated with people in the contacts. The phones are much lighter weight than earlier models which makes them easier to hold.I highly recommend the phones."},{"rating":"2","title":"much better than my motorola","review":"This phone works great in my home. The range is better than my Motorola MD681. More importantly I don't get interference from my appliances or my neighbor's phone (which I did on my 681). The sound clarity is great. The menu is pretty intuitive (set up like most cell phones). Some features require you to \\"turn them on\\" like the automatic answer -- where the phone picks up as you remove it from the cradle. I like the feature that allows you to copy the phone book from one handset to the other instead of inputting your speed dials on each handset.It doesn't feel quite as solid as the Motorola and its appearance is slightly junkier. However, cost per dollar -- this one is what I would recommend.Catherine"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite perfect...yet","review":"This is an almost perfect comedy series. ALMOST.The writing is excellent, the ideas are good and Tina Fey is really excellent in the role of LIz Lemon, head comedy writer at NBC. However, and this was the case in the first season, the secondary characters are somewhat unrdeal and often unnerving and tend to distract from what could have been perfect. Teke the page Kenneth, he tends to be very often way too geeky for the good of the series. Also Alec Bladwin's character is way over the top and somewhat unrealistic (OK, it is a comedy series) but he has improved over Season 1. The problem is that Tina Fey plays the whole thing in a reaslistic comedy kind of way and the secondary characters are way too charicatural and unrealistic IMHO for it to gel completely. However overall it has improved over Season 1 and has a lot of promise fro the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"30Rock Laugh-In","review":"Hilarious.

Season two is much better than Season one. Newcomers should probably start with Series Two, or maybe half way through Series One, and go back to the early episodes later.Unfortunately the writers strike meant that series 2 is only fifteen episodes long, not the usual twenty two or so.

When I did, I was shocked to discover a very serious problem.The special features section of this disc included a panel discussion at the TV Academy hosted by Brian Williams that had HORRIBLE audio quality. Brian Williams' mike was WAY louder that the rest of the cast and very distorted. What puzzles me is why the company that authored this DVD did nothing to correct this. Some of the distortion was no doubt present on the original recording but they could have at least fixed the gross level variations. Did anybody at NBC/Universal do any quality control on this disc? I can't imagine that anybody could allow audio this bad to be released on a commercial DVD.

If you are interested in historically accurate accounts of the late Apache wars, this is one of the must-read books. Davis just wanted the truth told, so he did it himself after watching glory-seeking sycophants take credit for, and be lauded for the heroic actions of others. Davis's views on his enemy Apaches, as well as the Apache scouts, show the wisdom and respect only a true and sage adversary can attest to. You won't be sorry you bought this book. Another must read is \\"On The Border With Crook\\" by John G. Bourke."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can close it, but you'll wish you didn't","review":"My daughter stuffed this cas chock full and off we went on vacation.

They are a very nice size but in my opinion, not even worth 10 dollars (much less 20). The first time I tried to close the case, my hand got pinched. Same fate for my husband. The case is ALL plastic and it would not last very long if at all. The ones I received already had stress points where cracking would eventually happen. The snaps to close and open are plastic, extremely hard to open and just overall a very cheap looking item. I found cases from other toy makers that put Mattell to shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I didn't buy!","review":"Thanks to those of you who reviewed this..I WON'T waste my money.

Unfortunately, Angela sleeps on the couch all afternoon.

This has to be the cheesiest and most inaccurate war movie of all time! I couldn’t stop laughing. The writing, acting, and cinematography is horrible. There were better actors in my Jr. High drama class.

The manual is organized in a way that makes it easy to pick it up for a \\"refresher course\\" before you head out when the detector has been sitting in the closet for a few months.

The table of contents would lead you to believe that this is the case.Instead I found that it covered this topic only at a very high level. It might be good for an introduction to this topic, but there is very little depth here. For example, the chapter on Linux and Real-time is only 5 pages long! While the description of configuring BlueCat Linux (seems pretty off-topic to me) is 14 pages.Unless you're a newbie to this topic, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This book is VERY light on content (it's a pretty small book, 193 pages for the primary material). If you just look at the table of contents, you can get more depth in a couple hours of googling.It just isn't a very useful book. It has nothing to offer a programmer with any level of experience with Linux or embedded systems, and it doesn't really educate the guy who's new to those subjects. It's more like a collection of superficial magazine articles.The amount of real-time covered is really minimal. It touches on defining real-time computing, then has a (short and fairly useless) chapter on RTAI that doesn't do anything.Go with Yaghmour's \\"Building Embedded Linux Systems\\", it's a MUCH better book, and is probably cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Message from Johnny Trash...","review":"\\"the EP was recorded on their own in a home studio with a budget that was 2% of the cost of KOP.

The streets by my work seem to flood quite easily, and getting from the parking lot to the office sometimes require hopping over vast puddles. After getting my shoes, socks and pant legs all wet, I got these and they really kept everything dry... The only draw back was that they are very noisy, almost sounds like I was wearing newspaper wrapped around my legs and feet, and they do look a bit awkward.

Apparently it's impossible to translate 920 pages of novel onto the screen successfully, even at the length of 3 1/2 hours, which the video was. Perhaps it's because Jilly Cooper's characters as written are so other-wordly, so impossibly handsome or charming or spoiled or WHATEVER, but none of the actors in this movie were at all how I imagined them from the book. The actor playing Rupert especially was a disappointment -- he had none of the easy charm and calculating cruelty that Jilly's Rupert had.

Inside the case are four pockets; one (neoprene) for the actual mp3 player and three other mesh pockets for cords, headphones, etc.It feels nice in your hand and is small enough to fit in a travel bag or carry around yourself. The dimensions are approximetly 8in (h) by 6in (w) and 2in (d).One handy feature that I liked about this was it has a line out so that you can listen to your mp3 player (for me ipod mini) and still have the player inside the case. The neoprene lining also adds a nice touch.I would reccommend this case to anyone who needs to carry thier mp3 player around and also haul cords and other accessories along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect companion for MacBook Air or other light laptops","review":"I bought this for an iPod I no longer have, but kept it for other uses.It's a perfect companion for light notebooks such as the Air.Small 2.5-in hard drives fit easily, along with other accessories, in my case the MacBook Air power brick, USB cable, all the Apple \\"dongles\\" (Ethernet, Modem, VGA), and sometimes a Bluetooth headset.

Secondly the band size must run small as I could barely get it closed in the front. Third because it has five hooks in the front it came up very high on my chest and very low under my bust resulting it a very constricting and uncomfortable fit. Fourth the cups give you that unnatural cone shape. I immediately put it in the box to be returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not comfortable and hard to get on.","review":"I purchased this hoping ir would be easier to get on because of my arthritis.

One complaint I have is that the straps are not as comfortable as they should be, not thick or wide enough at the top of my shoulder - the widest part falls way forward. Need to find some sort of wrap around the strap \\"thing\\" to solve that problem. I would recommend this bra for full figured women or anyone needing extra support for their frontage.

It did fit -- good coverage, soft. I had it on 10 minutes and had to take it off. The arm pit area is too high up. I hate that. It feels like you're stuffed. I can't honestly believe anyone likes that feeling. I have crossed Playtex off my list forever and will stick with Glamorize bras. I just wanted to try something different...lol Not recommended.

If that is in fact true, than I can't imagine how terrible the other dracula movies are. There are certain parts of the movie that do seem to try and follow the book, but then there are bizzare additions that hardly make sense other than to sensualize and sexualize the story as it was originally written.

The way the vampires are portrayed, so ugly and unfeeling, repulsed me. (For a look at some beautiful vampires, check out Interview with the Vampire). There was far too much reddness and fog in the sky in Transylvania. The visual effect is that of a low-budget sci-fi flick. If Amazon had half ratings (which, they don't, so too bad), I'd give it one and a half stars for Gary Oldman, who can portray a tortured lover like no other (see Immortal Beloved and The Scarlet Letter).

Amongst the most disturbingly graphic and violent scenes is the one in which three vampire women devour a baby. Gary Oldman is interesting as as Count Dracula,but even he can't revive this horrible flop as a film.Keaneu Reeves' acting is a wooden as the stake that went through Dracula's heart.

Either FFC should have ventured to tell his own Dracula story, or he should have stuck with the book, but what he does here is mess up the plot so badly that anyone who has read the original book cannot help but chuckle. He also completely contrives a relationship between Dracula and Mina (not in the book) and makes everything very sexual (esp. Lucy). Do we have to see her nipples every chance FFC gets? Keanu Reeves is awful too. It's a bad product....."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Farce","review":"Coppola gets back to his B-movie, soft-porn roots. This movie is absurd in every respect. Nevermind that it's a bastardazation of Bram Stoker's work; the real problems of this film are in the execution. The horrible acting, the campy sets, the Rocky Horror/ MTV costumes, the forced dialoge, the disjointed scenes, the random meaningless occurances... the whole thing comes across as parody!

The story is twisted, girls are getting raped by Satan himself, Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves acting is out of place. The only person that fits in this movie is anthony Hopkins, at least his british accent is authentic.

Keanu Reeves is laughable trying to mimic a posh British accent, and the high amount of sex thrown in at any slow point (none of which occurs in the story) is enough to put you off entirely. The performances are pablum, and even Anthony Hopkins, who has saved other movies in his time, could not pull this one out of the dung pile for me or anyone I know. All I can say is thank God Coppola did The Godfather, because without that, where would he be with films like this? There are much better Draculas out there, notably the original, silent German film Nosferatu, which actually FOLLOWS THE BOOK, a concept apparently lost on the makers of this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very original, but tragically unsuccessful film","review":"There is no denying that Bram Stoker's Dracula is a very ambitious, big-scale movie with an overwhelming amount of innovation. Unfortunately, it seems like almost nothing works very well. After the impact of the sheer amazement by the fantastic scenes passes, what we are left with is a somewhat choppy, incoherent story that starts to look ridiculously over-the-top very soon. Many of the scenes are desperately repulsive, and there is hardly a good enough purpose to justify it. The film is clearly created with an atmosphere that attempts to romanticize all the disgusting and horrifying things we see - but this does not work and looks out-of-place. Perhaps some moderation would have helped the movie. As it is, the film does not take itself seriously and all the \\"romanticism\\" seems to be horribly wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"An atrocity","review":"This movie is horrible. This is one of my favorite books and FFC ruined it. The whole ruination comes from the \\"love story.\\" Dracula is an evil presence who feeds off of innocence or innocents (whichever you prefer), not a doomed lover. I say shame on FFC for adding a subplot that does not belong. I wish I could give it zero stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a Classic","review":"With all of the vampire craze going on lately, it's refreshing to go back and watch this to see where a lot of the 'lore' came from (not this movie, per se, but from Bram Stoker's story). A huge change I noticed right away was the sound quality: whenever this movie gets played on tv or payper view, or whatever, the sound is okay, but lacking. This is something that one would not notice had you never seen this movie on DVD. Not sure if the producers/mixers went back and 'remastered' the sound, but everything about the sound is better! All the little nuances and subtleties that I never heard before are there! The picture quality is good--this movie was made almost 20 yrs ago, so don't expect picture quality like Lord of The Rings. If you even remotely like this movie, get this edition--well worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best vampire movie ever","review":"I loved this movie and have watched it a million times because it is just a great romantic movie.

Whenever it comes on the tv I run to watch it, even thought I own it on DVD. This movie touches on the love aspect of dracula and what he went through for love.

I definite must see! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A SO_SO MOVIE THAT COULD'VE BEEN A REAL CLASSIC.","review":"I saw DRACULA and afterwards I felt letdown about it. Having seen BELA LUGOSI'S version I was hoping it would be like that unfortunatley it wasn't and here's why I think it wasn't as good as the above. I found that KEANU REEVES and WYNONNA RYDER to be miscast in thier respective roles who they play I won't say just watch and see what I mean. Also I found GARY OLDMAN to be a little weak as DRACULA in his potrayl he didn't seem to scare me at all. The only person who I feel saves this film is ANTHONY HOPKINS who's great in his role who he plays I won't say but I'm sure you'll agree So all in all I can't recommend DRACULA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oldman, actore extraordinare, was the only saving grace..","review":"Although the acting in this movie was superb on Oldman and Ryder's parts(and even w/ Keanu Reeves at some points), the movie did absolutely too little justice to the novel itself. The cinematography, in an attempt to be spooky and ominous, ended up being cheezy and overdramatic. Dracula was done MUCH better by Lugosi in...'54, was it?..All in all the movie flat out STUNK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dracula: PoMo Version!","review":"First off, the extra star is for even attempting to make a vampire movie, which people don't do enough of. That being said, I don't know how this ludicrous dud of a movie received 82% positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, but I can only surmise that free alcohol was provided at the advance screening. Critics praised it as 'unique' and 'lavish', when what they really should have said was 'tactless' and 'gaudy'. The costumes and sets are ridiculous, including a papal length robe for Dracula and hair that can only be described as a twin mohawk afro. Keanau Reeves provides the final insult, delivering all his lines with what must be the first surfer dude inflected Southern English accent. Anyone expecting a faithful, gothic style adaptation is in for nearly 3 hours of bitterness. Unique indeed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"saw it in the theatre","review":"I disliked this in 1992, when I didn't know anything about movies, and now that I work in the movie industry, and see it again, I see why I didn't like it; it stinks. Every great director has an embarrassment, this is Coppola's. Bad casting ( Keanu Reeves must be the most mis-cast actor in history ), bad screenplay. 20 minutes into the movie they start throwing gags at you, like rats running upside-down on the ceiling, and shadows that move independently - every 5 minutes, non-stop; no subtlety, no mystery. Production value is good, which keeps it above 1 star, but still very weird, and weird in a way that does not work, lots of clashing, gawdy designs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too Hollywood","review":"I had originally purchased the video in 1995 and purchased the novel the following year. After reading the novel, I tried to watching the video again and was very disappointed. The \\"romantic\\" scene with Mina and Dracula was so cheesy that I had to fast forward through it. This can't be what Bram Stoker envisioned."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favourites","review":"I loved this movie. It has the most sumptous costumes and set design that I've ever seen. Gary Oldman was a perfect mix of evil and heartbreak.The ending was a bit of an anti-climax though. They make a big deal about how they're going after Dracula etc etc but their actual confrontation of him only lasts a minute or so. That's a bit of a let-down but other than that the movie is a visual feast."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"This was an awesome movie.If only it didn't have to end! I'm not saying that the ending was bad, because it wasn't! The ending was perfect. I just wish the movie could go on and on forever because it was that good!!! I enjoy watching this movie as much as I enjoy reading Anne Rice's books, and I love her books! She is my favorite author!!! In those scenes where Gary Oldman was young with the long dark hair and the blue glasses, he looked SO hot and SO sexy! I'm serious!!! I love this movie!!! You turn it on expecting a horror movie, and you end up with a love story at least as good as Romeo and Juliet was. It's perfect!!! I LOVE IT!!! I also LOVE those scenes where two things are happening at once!!! They are SO COOL!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For what it is worth-","review":"You have to love this movie. The only reason to not like it is the rediculous and pathetic Keanu. What a waste of time this guy is. My dirty socks could act better than he can. Go to school and learn your craft you wastoid.If you can get past Mr. thespian there, you will see a strange but unique version of the original book. If you can even call it a \\"version\\". Many of the actors are excellent. The story is paced well, and I don't ever recall a more artistic approach to film making. There are sceans that just stay with you. The film is oddly romantic, I can see why under a spell Mina would go for this guy. Yet he is still a foul creature from hell, and Gary Oldmann portrays both sides of Dracula with perfection. Excellent musical score. I just wish there were some extra features on this DVD. Because of that I have to knock it down a peg."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The best thing about this film is the lush set design. The rest of the film was a hideous mess and not in a good way. Neither Ryder nor Reeves could carry a British accent. Gary Oldham's young Count looked like a thin version of PigPen from the Greatful Dead. The film wanted to be a cross between the classic vampire tale and a Victorian porn novel. The script was just silly. Was unable to buy the eternal one story between the Count and Mena. And why was Mena using a typewriter? Lucy was portrayed with much scenery chewing as a HObag. The saving grace of this film is that it allowed Mel Brooks to make \\"Dracula. Dead and Loving It.\\" Skip the Coppola version and go straight to Brooks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and breath taking","review":"personally the people who didnt like this movie are blind! i luved it its so romantic! once i saw the movie i wanted to read the book badly. francis did an excellent job with the visual effects breath taking story and excellent characters good work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be called \\"Based on Bram Stoker's 'Dracula'\\"","review":"The title is really misleading, as -- sorry folks -- the whole chick flick love story between the Count and Mina is a fabrication, not from the pen of one Abraham Stoker. There are other distortions from the novel, but this is definitely one of the best productions of the tale. While Bela Lugosi left his mark on the role, Gary Oldman does IMHO an exceptional job with the Count in Stoker's early scenes in Transylvania, with Jonathan Harker. It is definitely worthwhile to see a large part of the novel brought to life, such as the sequences involving the \\"children of the night\\", the three brides (although they pad this with manufactured material), and even the idea that Mina has a mental link with the Count.

I will admit that visually this film is impressive. The scenery and cinematography are quite good. As for the cast, Anthony Hopkins is a very enjoyable van Helsing, and Gary Oldman does very well as Count Dracula- but not Bram Stoker's vision of the vampire.

Everything about it is either way overdone (the effects, the histrionics, the makeup) or way way way underdone (Reeves & Ryder performances). Ultimately this movie doesn't hold a candle to Werner Herzog's matchlessly brilliant & much creepier Nosferatu (with Klaus Kinski's sublime definitive performance)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful horror film","review":"I'm surprised this film had such a huge outing at the box office and on tape. It was the second best selling horror film of 1992 behind only Army of Darkness. I would suggest you skip Dracula and go on to Army of Darkness or to Candyman."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Stoker's Dracula","review":"I give this movie 1 star because it lies to the viewer. This movie is NOT Bram Stoker's Dracula, but a rip-off of the character and then puts the modern spin on the story. If it was named something else or even kept the name Dracula out of it to begin with but called him a different name I'd give it 5 stars.If you want to see the real Dracula story first read the actual book by Bram Stoker, then watch the silent film Nosferatu. Nosferatu is the only Dracula movie that gets the story right. Dracula is a monster, he's not a star crossed lover at all and wasn't intended to be. People wanted there to be some hidden message so they could justify a reason for their otherwise worthless literature degree but there simply isn't one. It's a horror tale, not a vieled porn book, and certainly not a love story. If anything the ones that fail to understand Dracula time and again are his victims who fall prey to his seduction by being anthropomorphic toward him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alacrud","review":"Except for the one who says it isn't boring all the one and two star reviewers hit the nail on the head --- but I thought you had to use WOODEN stakes for vampire hearts? Baffling, meandering, jumpy, jerky, and muddled. It's puzzling enough to sustain interest for a time, but long before the end you wish it would. Nothing seems to work. Yet FFC throws everything bar the kitchen sink into this midden. Bats, rats, crosses, circles, blood, smoke, fire, water, lightning, rain, ruins, forests, prisons, loonies, garlic, steak, nudes, skeletons, lesbians. Nothing works. It's not frightening, funny, or stimulating in the slightest. At one point Dracula gets confused with Jesus Christ, would you believe. Strange, but not strange enough to matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"visually stunning...and a young keanu reeves!","review":"decadent costumes and sets that make the movie worth watching and rewatching.

I thought that this was the movie I was waiting for, since so many others had done such a bad job of adapting the book.When I got to the voice-over line \\"contrary to popular misconception, the vampire can go about in daylight...\\" (or something like that) I pretty much knew that the movie had taken a left turn. The addition of Stoker's name to the title, seems a desperate attempt at legitimizing a complete bastardization of an otherwise classic book.This is Dracula that has been sanitized, prettied up, and produced for all the World of Darkness and Anne Rice groupies who can't stand the thought that vampirism might be a bad thing.I don't know of too many people who fall into a middle ground, I guess that middle ground is for people who have no affiliation to vampire fiction. On that basis, this is quite an enjoyable movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor transfer and low value blu-ray movie","review":"The cover looks elegant, but the movie is a dull/disappointment.

Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wildly uneven","review":"From the opening shot till the final credit Dracula is filled with wonderfully weird images and a great performance by Gary Oldman. There is real tension and drama in this telling but...Firstly, Wynona Ryder, while doing a fine job, is just to cute to be the inspiration of all this depravity. I just can't see Dracula, the ruthless knight, crossing oceans of time over her. Then there is Keanu Reeves who is soooo bad and has such a terrible English accent he destroys every scene he's in. And Lucy's suitors were just as bad. Anthony Hopkins, whom I usually think is great, was distractingly hammy but still fun. All in all a good film with some glaring flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie Ever Made","review":"This movie was beautifully made. Great cast with wonderful music.

The connection between Mina and Dracula is powerful and soulful. You sympathize with Dracula's deep sorrow for having lost the love of his life. Mina is his reincarnated lost love. The costumes, erotic intimations, imagery, and cinematography are breath-taking. The characters are painted in a sophmoric stroke, save for Gary Oldman's portrayal of Vlad/Dracula. He is stunning in this role."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie - Blu-ray quality is low...","review":"For those looking to buy this movie for Blu-Ray... The quality is barely above DVD level. I was disappointed with how grainy and blurry the shots were compared to other Blu-Ray titles available.As for the movie itself, it is a classic, and if you have not seen it, you should. It goes over all Dracula lore, from Renfeld to Van Helsing, to Dracula's 3 sisters. And unlike the newer movie Van Helsing, this movie is very good, and oddly focuses on the character and romance, as opposed to relying on special effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big-Budget Waste","review":"Francis Ford Coppola's epic adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula is a big waste of time. The movie offers lush settings and an elite cast that seems misplaced, but the never delivers the true horror the novel did.

Terrifying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cinema History","review":"I love the reference to the earliest days of the motion picture when Dracula hides out in the darkened cinema. Though, I believe not in Bram Stoker's novel -- I think this is historically accurate.

A nice touch, and a great new way of telling this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Dracula Movie!","review":"This was one of the most original Dracula movies that I have ever seen. The outstanding cast of actors makes this film all the better.Gary Oldman,Anthony Hopkins,Keneau Reeves,and WinonaRyder play outstanding roles in this movie. The character played by Ryder resembles an old love of Dracula's.He takes her to Tranyslvania with our heros in hot pursuit.The special effects in this movie also makes it very entertaining.The scenery used in Transylvania makes the movie even more spooky.

You couldn't get me to watch it again. Bram Stoker's Dracula was one of my first books, so I read it over and over again. It is a classic horror story. I am beginning to believe that it cannot be translated to film. I guess I knew from the very first act that the story was being perverted. Christopher Lee's Dracula evoked more horror than this cheesy version, who at times looked like Liberace,John Lennon and a pathetic werewolf. The lovestory ruined it for me. It dominated the whole movie. I liked Frank Langella's sexy Dracula more. If you're looking for \\"vampires who have sex\\", The Hunger is a much better movie. It bothers me to think of all the time and money that was wasted on this colossal flop. It evoked no emotion in me at all other than to wish it was over sooner.

If you'd like to see a faithful adaption of Bram Stoker's novel, buy the 1977 BBC production \\"Count Dracula\\" starring Louis Jourdan. The 1977 BBC made for TV movie is the most accurate film version done to date -- the 1970's FX are cheesy, but the story and acting are fantastic.

Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bram Stoker's?","review":"I had just finished reading the book Dracula, and I decided to watch this movie. It was so disappointing. The characters were all there, but most of the movie was not even in the book. I did not at all understand the part about Dracula's obsession with Mina, that did not at all happen in the book. And I guess I must have been the only person who did not feel that the whole blood sucking routine was not at all sexual, what was the point of having women running around topless? (I must have missed that part in the book) I also thought the the character of Mina was terribly written; in the book, I felt that she was one of the most respectable characters, and truly loved her husband, however, in this movie I really hated her, and I don't think the viewer was supposed to.The whole movie in general was overly done, and not that bad, but I would not have a problem with it, just don't call it Bram Stoker's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, bad DVD...","review":"I really love this movie. It's a very good adaptation of the novel and a priceless piece of entertainment for a Dracula fan. When it first came out, there were a lot of documentaries and interviews on TV to promote the movie. I think that it would have been great to have a couple of these on the DVD edition. A commentary by the director & the cast would have also been great, but the DVD is FEATURELESS... There's nothing (NADA) on it but the movie. I'm still waiting for a better edition to come out.

I have seen over a thousand movies and guess what, not a one of them followed the book completely. I do agree it isn't wise to say you're doing a true portrayal of the original story and then not deliver. It is a romantic and sexy vampire movie, period. Most men and women will enjoy it. It is definitely not for the kids. Sure sometimes it is almost as funny as \\"Fearless Vampire Killers\\" with Keenu's almost excellent adventure in talking English, but I don't think it takes itself so seriously to be all that bad. Catch it if you haven't. Personally my wife and I are getting it on DVD. How many excellent vampire movies are really out there?

I don't feel scared or heavy- whenever I see him, I see something funny.The reason I like this film is the love story between Dracula and Mina. That's why I am keep upgrading the movie by keep buying new version whenever they are released.Blu-ray. One of the worst bluray that I bought so far. Next to Total Recall perhaps.I don't believe Francis did a lot of color correction or anything before transfering into HD.The color image is really soft and I don't see anything that is close to 'wow, that is really sharp and clean'.No need to buy this Bluray if you already have DVD version.Somewhat I begin to think that even DVD versio is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"How does this compare to the book?","review":"I did not like this movie. I read the book and loved it. When I saw the movie I saw that it followed non of the books story line. The movie was titled Bram Stoker's Dracula yet the movie portrays the characters and their personalities all wrong. They even add things that are not in the book, such as the love affair between Mina Harker and her \\"Prince,\\" in the book she depised the Count, in the movie she couldn't get enough of him.

I encourage you to at lest rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, No, NO","review":"This is not \\"Bram Stoker's\\" Dracula, it is an overdose of pretty costumes and set designs attempting to take the place of plot and drama. In his eagerness to appeal to every sector of the market Coppola's Dracula becomes all things to all people (a villain turning women into undead 'Nosferatu' for no reason, a suffering lover looking for his dead love's re-incarnation, a cobwebbed old man pontificating on history) and since these personae usually conflict, the result is often hilarious. You'll laugh, you'll hurl, you'll cry (if you paid money to rent it, that is.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Undead","review":"This is a very well made faithful adaptation of Bram Stoker's classic novel. It was terrifying, sexy, adventitious, and bold.This film presented Dracula the way he was written by Stoker in ways that films of the past such as those staring Max Shrek, Bela Lugosi, Christopher Lee, and Frank Langella did not have the budget or technology to do, despite all of them being great films.The creature designs, sets, costumes, acting, and over all story telling was great! This makes a very well made horror film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Upgrade to a Classic","review":"Having not watched this movie in almost 10 years I was excited to see how it would look in Blu-ray.I wasn't disappointed. Maybe it's just me but I get a kick out of watching movies that claim to be made in the old style of film making. This movie is great to watch in High Def because it almost draws out the old style filming tricks (if you know where to look for them).The transfer to Blu-ray is really great. Color pops where it is supposed to and blacks are just that, black.The extras are all in high def which is a huge plus.It was fun to relive the (almost) cheesy acting of all involved.

There are several moments where the viewer is left wondering \\"What was that all about?\\" or \\"What was the significance of that scene?\\" But overall, this was a great movie. The acting was strong and convincing, particularly Anthony Hopkins's, and the special effects and makeup are astonishingly good. Quite gory in some places, but still retaining good taste. For the men, you'll be happy to know there are quite a few bare breasts thrown in to maintain interest in the slow spots. Definitely a film worth having, even if the only things you like about it are Winona Ryder and the scene in which the werewolf/vampire is doing Lucy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leg munchingly good","review":"Looks like Coppola set out to give vampires a good name -- nothing better than a bloodsucker you can feel sorry for. I admit it seriously strays from Bram Stoker's ideal but for an \\"American re-write\\" it's still recognisable.Casting's definitely a tad odd though. I realise Keanu Reeves was hot after Bill and Ted but surely they could have found someone, somewhere with a more believable accent? As Elizabeth Graza says it's the phoniest ever -- one to rival Dick Van Dyke's in Mary Poppins.But it's still one of my favourite films.

My favorite adaptation of all the movies is this one.While it could never live up to the classic Lagosi movie it is it's contemporary equal. Everyone has their take on the legendary blood sucker but this one is at the top.My favorite scene is when Dracula (Gary Oldman) comes up behind Harker while he is shaving causing Harker to cut himself.

What I got was a lot of heartache. Francis Ford Coppala took the greatest Vampiric Horror Story of all time, and turned it into a love story between Dracula and his long-lost love, who happens to look like Mina Harker. If that wasn't bad enough, every one of the principle female characters, including Drac's brides, were topless at least once during the movie. It was disgusting. The only good part to this movie was Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Abraham Van Helsing. A great performance that should have been in a different Dracula picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST DRACULA MOVIE EVER CREATED","review":"This movie was a huge let down for me, considering all the great actors in the movie. If you have read the novel and expect to see a movie, do not be compelled to see this movie, it is perhaps the worst dracula movie ever created. It is simply nothing compared to the actual novel. So many of the characteristics of the characters in the novel have been altered. I wonder how a great director Francis Cuppola have created such a preposterous version of Dracula when he has created such masterpieces as the Godfather trilogy. This movie is just so pathetic, so much useless nudity from Lucy Westerna. This movie is a disgrace to Bram Stoker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my god!","review":"One of the worst movies on the subject ever made. A shocking script and terrible performances all round make this a laughable installation to the Dracula legend. Gary Oldman is at his usual over-acting worst, and Keanu Reeves is shocking as Jonathan Harker, effecting the worst English accent in the history of cinema. Winona Ryder bored my packet off; the exchanges between her and Reeves were sickening along with the rest of the script, Harker: We can be married when I return.Mina: Oh Jonathan.....Jonathan....Oh Jonathan.....I'm sorry if I seem harsh, but please try and avoid this movie lest you like it.

I felt bad about my giving this to my husbad as a present. I don't think he liked it, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lush movie for vampire lovers.","review":"Bram Stoker's Dracula is another entry in the trend of pro-vampire movies, portraying Vlad Dracul as a sympathetic character, a religious man who abandons God when his beloved, tricked into believing him dead, commits suicide while he is away fighting off the Turks. When he senses her reincarnation in Mina, the betrothed of Jonathan Harker, he sets in motion a plan to reunite with her. Chased by Jonathan and Van Helsing, he courts Mina and brings her closer to him. Will Dracula be successful, and win back his love, or will he meet his death at the hand of Van Helsing. An excellent movie, fascinatingly different than past treatments of Bram Stoker's novel, with stunning costumes and sets and a well-chosen cast. A lush movie for vampire lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The blood is life . . . and it shall be mine.\\"","review":"The original novel by Bram Stoker is definitely the ultimate vampire story. And this film is the definite adaptation. Dracula is everything that you can ever find in a tale about vampires. The gothic settings, the excellent performances (even Keanu does a good job here!), the blood, the music, the pacing, the cinematography, the dark humor, I mean everything about it is done right. Don't get me wrong about the legendary original 1931 film; it's a classic and still stands on its own. But I'm more for the remake. It has big-time actors such as Gary Oldman playing Dracula himself, Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing, and Winona Ryder as Mina. Francis Ford Coppola has created another masterpiece, even though it isn't even in the same league as The Godfather trilogy and Apocalypse Now. Avoid Twilight as much as possible: Bram Stoker's Dracula is the one that must be watched (and read)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome visuals ....but .....","review":"This movie has some of the best horror cinematography I have ever seen. (And I have seen them all). It shows photography work that has never been seen before- nor since. This is by far the best Dracula \\"visual\\" ever! My main complaint is the story is mostly a visual and lacks certain elements of the acting style that we have been accustomed to in the 21st century. For example when Johnathan Harker spends all the time in Draculas castle, he sees strange things and he does not react to them. From mirrors breaking, to seeing Dracula climbing the castle walls and the weird shadow play - Harker acts like nothing is out of the ordinary.That is by far the films worst downfall. THe story line is pretty much the basic Bram Stoker story. But I will emphasize- the visuals are stunning and horrifying in this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Vampire flick","review":"This is the best dracula movie I have seen to date. I enjoyed it when it first came out and have enjoyed it several times since.

My question is about the audio on the Blu-ray edition. I have a superbit version of this film and on my system, the audio is much more pleasing on the standard DVD. I wonder if anyone else has noticed that the levels and EQ in some parts of the film leave a lot to be desired - compared to other releases or even the special features..."},{"rating":"2","title":"TRUE LOVE NEVER DIES","review":"I was disappointed in this movie on its offical theatrical release, I was expecting a horror film not a love story. I saw it twice in theatres just for my love of WINONA RYDER and grew to accept its plot of eternal love. GARY OLDMAN rocked the house with this performance as Dracula, and RYDER'S beauty is undeniable. Visually stunting, Gothically romantic. Other than that save your money. If you love goth, romance, and RYDER recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"DRACULA FEST","review":"DRACULA IS A NEVER ENDING BUFFET OF DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE SAME STORY LINE.

WRONG!! The Blu-ray is darker, and the sound is so low you have to turn the volume all the way up to understand the dialog. I put the standard DVD in my Blu-ray player and the picture and sound quality was MUCH better than the Blu-ray version, so don't waste your money or your time purchasing the Blu-ray version if you already have the DVD. What a rip off.Of course the movie is excellent, but the better viewing experience is with the DVD, NOT the Blu-ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992) - The Ultimate (so far) Expression of Dracula!","review":"Bram Stoker's Dracula was an excellent five star film made in 1992. As far as I am concerned this remake added much to the Dracula legend in many larger than life ways and could only have been produced as such in the late 20th century by taking advantage of state of the art movie magic.The new interpretations of the forms of the shape shifting count were magnificent as were the make up, CGI and all special effects. Dracula was played with a classic but fresh style as was Dr. Van Helsing who was played by the one and only Anthony Hopkins. The film also had a beautiful musical score which added much to the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Vampire Movie Made In Recent Years","review":"I never thought another movie could beat the original Lugosi film, but this movie comes very close. It takes the character of Dracula and makes him a horrible monster, but also sympathetic. You can't help but feel, and maybe understand, somewhat why Dracula does what he does. Gary Oldman is amazing in the title role and makes the character extremely believable. The special effects are incredible, and although it wasn't that long ago, the movie still holds up to this day. This will surely go down as a classic, and that is saying a lot for a remake. This movie brought a lot and delivers. I highly recommend this movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bram Stoker's Dracula? I think not","review":"I can't believe that the makers of this film have the nerve to title it \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula.\\" The film ceaselessly strays from the novel and fabricates such a different story that never in my life would I call it so. The whole theme of Dracula going after Mina Murray because she looks like his fromer wife was never, ever mentioned in the novel; where the idea came from I have no clue. Small, insignificant changes I can take, a change of this magnitude I cannot. Overall, the film IS highly entertaining and has beautiful cinematography, but if you're looking to get out of a book report by watching the it, stick with cliffnotes. The only thing that the film has in common with the book is its ill-chosen title."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Love With Dracula","review":"I have watched a load of Dracula movies in my lifetime. As a child they were all scary, interesting and intrigued me. As I got older they started loosing that luster and I just basically stopped watching. But as a new one came out I would still want to see if they had improved. Nothing impressed me as Bram Stoker's Dracula! Nothing Dracula has impressed me as much since! Yes it went into my keeper's collection! You actually fall for Dracula and want him in spite of his evil ways. Great actors, wonderful love story and adventure.Bram Stoker's Dracula [Blu-ray]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"I found this adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula downright painful to watch. Suffering through Keanu Reeves pitiful attempt at an English accent as the lead character/narrator was horrible. This film is a gaudy, flamboyant attempt at creating an artful masterpiece and falls far short of its mark. This movie is an example of a studio spending a ton of money on special effects and using all the hottest actors, but forgetting to tell a good story. They try to portray Dracula as a sympathetic lover but the result is a pathetic blunder. I'd rather spend the night in Castle Dracula than watch this dog again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dracula","review":"This is the ultimate Dracula movie. The acting is fabulous!!!!! Gary Oldman is superb, and the actress who portrays Lucy is perfect. I could watch this movie a hundred times and never get bored with it. It is a timeless love story."},{"rating":"1","title":"some things are better left unsaid","review":"This film,although true to the stoker novel, was extremely boring and morbid. It was truly sickening when Dracula hands his female concubines an infant that they devour alive. Was this scene truly needed? It made me sick! Other scenes that seemed closer to softcore porn was when Keanu is in bed with draculas concubines ... truly not needed and disgusting."},{"rating":"1","title":"historical inaccuracy, corny nonsense","review":"I am romanian and let me tell you that the beginning of the movie, insofar as it pretends to portray history, is absolutely ridiculous. First, Vlad Dracul is not the same as Vlad Tepes (Vlad the Impaler) who inspired Stoker in writing his novel, he is actually his father ; second,neither Vlad Dracul nor Vlad Tepes ruled in Transylvania but in Muntenia which is the southern region of Romania. now, I don't know who's the guy talkin' in romanian for Vlad (I heard it was Lux Interior from the Cramps) but I as a native speaker could hardly understand anything.Keanu Reeves sucks.Tom Waits rules.Anthony Hopkins get carried away.Winona Ryder is ok.Gary Oldman is lame.so except for Tom Waits's performance (...), this movie is a waste of time and an insult to romanian history.watch Nosferatu the Vampyre instead"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Technical Assistant in charge of buckets of blood.\\"","review":"...there should have been about a dozen people with that title.This movie is a horrible rendition of the original Bram Stoker novel. Although it follows the main plot points relatively faithfully, the theme and characters are horribly butchered. I'm not saying that they just changed the characters a bit. No. They butchered them adding random junk for pure shock value (the story did not need drug addicts, lesbians, nymphomaniacs, or hardcore bestiality; sorry). And any time something significan happens the set is hosed down with gallons of fake blood.If you want to really experience Dracula, study some introductory psychology (specifically Freudian) and read the *real* Bram Stoker novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable.","review":"Unwatchable. Coppola is sour on every note. Oldman's Dracula looks like a 92 year old drag-queen. Renfield turns up as a reject from a bad MTV video. And Keanu is, well, Keanu. The story-line is barely held together... scenes occur at random without connection to one another. If I hadn't read the book, I wonder if I'd have been able to piece together what was going on? (Not that the movie follows the book; but that's a different topic). After the 3rd time Dracula's eyes super-imposed in the dark clouds as people laughed for no reason in the rain, I had to turn this garbage off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not a classic!","review":"Grossly overrated, historically inaccurate, and rather tepid film-version of the classic written by Bram Stoker. It has brilliant actors and suitable direction that helps the movie to become watchable, but it has neither the primal horror evoked by the novel, nor the distinction of becoming the best dramatisation of the said novel. That honour rests withCount Dracula (BBC Mini-Series), whcih I strongly recommend to all those actually interested in Bram Stoker's Dracula. If you wish to delve more deeply into the legend of Dracula, then you may find good old Norton Critical edition of the novel helpful. If you wish to go through a thrillride of watching the emergence of the character Dracula through the lens of fictionalised history, I recommend reading Reggie Oliver's \\"The Dracula Papers\\". These are classics, and would be appreciated without the association of so-called big names."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Oscar? For this?","review":"Ok the movie is good but...an oscar? Who did they pay off? This movie had potential and some parts of it were good but an Oscar should go to something that would be considered a timeless classic. I had a hard time even finishing it to be honest and I WANTED it to be good.This is a serious case of artistic license taken WAY too far. The main character was well played and well done and there are some really good parts but overall it felt rather spliced together and lacked any sort of \\"epic\\" feel to it. More like watching one sound bite after another. It felt like it got directed by someone who was trying to make a music video.If your looking for a truly good Vampire saga do yourself a favor and watch Interview with a Vampire. Give this one a skip unless your really bored. Its sad too cause this had some of my favorite actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Amazing how this director manages to make so scary a tragic love story like this... He describes very well the dramatic story of Dracula's lost love and at the same time he makes it really frightening! I don't even know if this movie should be included in the, horror section of films or in the love stories.. It is really amazing and unique how this exciting director, in collaboration of course with the writer, manages to make the viewer fall in love with the story and the protagonists... unique and tempting for any viewer. Certainly a must-see for everyone who enjoys the combination of love and horror in a film!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Remove Bram Stoker's Name From The Title!","review":"By the title, I expected a straight forward adaptation of Bram Stoker's original all-time classic. But don't be fooled as I was; this tragic piece of sex-and-gore falls flat in the end, and exploits Bram Stoker's good name.The acting by Gary Oldman and Winona Ryder are very good, actually, but Keanu Reeves' performance as Johnathon Harker is one of his all-time worst. Anthony Hopkins is the only relief, who seems to be having a blast as the eccentric scientist/vampire killer Abraham Van Helsing, and is very entertaining to watch.There's just too much emphasis on sex and cool photograpgy, rather than spending time trying to scare you; it's NOT SCARY!You wanna see good Dracula? Then go see the 1958 Hammer verion (it's great!), or even the Mel Brooks spoof of it! Anything's better than waisting your time with this poor excuse for a horror film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck?","review":"Why all the praise. Interview With The Vampire is scarier and much more gorgeous. There is no bad acting like Mr. Reaves. This film was cheesy and cheap looking. Winona is spectaculer and so are some other roles. It is also boring. It does have some wonderful cinematogrophy but, it pales in comparison to Interview."},{"rating":"2","title":"The legend comes alive,","review":"With this movie the old legend of the Romanian prince, Dracula comes alive, through the representation of Bram Stoker's novel. The movie is absolutely stunning, an eternal love story showed in a dark and gothic atmosphere. It is an incredible horror story and a passionate romance. Anyway, the movie is brilliant and deserves more credit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite good....","review":"Bram Stoker's Dracula isn't quite the exact adaptation of the novel version. While it is fairly good, as well as shortened and all that, Coppola decided to throw in the romance between Dracula and Mina, which NEVER happens in the book. In fact, in the book, we never know about Dracula's past. However, I suppose this is the closest version to Bram Stoker's than any other film. It's quite good. Winona Ryder and Gary Oldman really rock the movie (of course, since Im a huge Winona Ryder fan).I'd definitely recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"DRACULA HAS COME!!!!!!","review":"Ever wonder how Dracula became a vampire??Find out in this film where you journey back to the time of the ruthless romanian knight Vlad Dracula who impaled and tortured his enemies in battle to defend The Catholic Church against the Turks.Find the secret to the evil counts origin in this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Film Version Makes Me Want to Read the Book","review":"I just got done watching this film for the first time and I was very impressed. Keanu Reeves was pretty bad, but not as dreadful as some other reviewers have claimed. Of course the acting heavyweights, Gary Oldman as Dracula (young and old) and Anthony Hopkins deliver the strongest performances by far. I also loved the fact that the music, make-up, costumes, and set design made you feel like you were really in this dark world. I rented and returned this movie, but I already want to see it again. I gotta pick this one up for my DVD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992)","review":"Truly one of the best adaptation of the novel by Bram Stoker. The acting(except for Keannu Reeves), cinematography, costumes, special effects, screen play are superb. FFC succeeded in what other directors failed: Humanizing our infamous bloodsucker. Instead of concentrating on the gore, he opted to focus on the romance between Minas and Dracula.

It does spread the oils around, which seems to be more important to stopping the shedding than brushing out the dead hairs (though it does that just fine too).

She is like a three speed bike, she has three deliveries, slow, moderate and fast. She has a handful of albums out. But the more you listen, the more the songs all sound the same, same inflection, same arrangement, same timing, regardless of which song she is singing.What she need's is to sing with dynamic range and to get some new arrangements, put more of herself, more feeling in the music, instead of making more coy cookie-cutter albums.And maybe give Tomlinson and his Stan-Getz sax tone more space.Her Richard Rodger's album remains her best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, kewpie doll stuff","review":"I just don't understand how performers like this maintain careers.

The interviews are compelling, and while reading the letters I found myself laughing then crying then laughing again. The letters were often inspirational and I found myself thinking, \\"Oh, my daughter should read this one\\" or \\"My sister should read that one\\" or \\"Jane Bryant Quinn, thank you for putting my fears to rest!\\" This is a great gift book.

After I get it back from the friend I loaned it to, I'm going to write my own \\"what I know now\\" and tuck it into the book, and then send it off to my teenage nieces.If nothing else, it is good to be reminded that we do learn much about ourselves and others over time, and that for the most part, struggles that seem insurmountable are usually survivable.

Andrae Crouch is indisputably one of the true pioneers of modern day Christian(as well as Gospel) music. His songs are staples in countless many hymn books and churches worldwide. His body of work during the 70's is as critical as any artist(s) of any genre or era. Its great to get this to be uplifted; but this is also a lesson in music history. I think Bob Marley sung it best: you'll never grow without the roots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"We were very pleased with this order.

Also, another attraction of the book is that these cases are not confined to one country. Examples hail from Australia, Spain, UK and other places.Overall, there is no connection between different chapters, other than the book's title. There is no flow-on between chapters.

Do yourself a favor, and pay more for the Japanese 24 bit remastered versions released this past Fall '03.

I purchased just the first three (Wives/Centre/MythsLegends), but practically, if not all, of the A&M catalog was re-released with 24bit remastering in Japan. Why Universal record company in the US can't get their act together and release these here is beyond understanding. Too busy prosecuting kids who download, I suppose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great concept album","review":"Rick Wakeman spent his down time from Yes creating concept albums like this one. Spoken words told the storyline, while an orchestra, rock band and Wakeman's keyboards added classical-rock-film score sounds. Wakeman was part of a triple bill when I saw him in Philly, coming on after Larry Coryell's Eleventh House and Gentle Giant. I remember him coming on stage for a second encore at 1:30 a.m., stunned that the crowd was still there. He explained that the band didn't have anything else to play, so they played an encore tune a second time \\"changing it up a bit,\\" as he said. For those who never heard what classical rock music was, this is a good start, after ELP, Yes and King Crimson."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely overrated","review":"This is all pointless nonsense that is saved solely by Wakeman's occasional display of his renowned virtuosity . The vocalist is outright horrendous and the obnoxious narration is anticlimatic . Wakeman is at his best when he is constrained by a solid band like Yes . Wakeman on the loose is too much for me . Forget this one !"},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding me!","review":"Don't get me wrong I like some of Wakeman's other solo albums (to some degree). His work in Yes and The Strawbs is still the best stuff he has done though. Well, after listening to this album again, after maybe 20 years, I can only ask myself one question: Is he embarrassed? And people wonder why progressive rock is pretty much universally frowned upon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Journey to nowhere","review":"Once upon a time, the world famous rock pianist Richard Wakeman wrote a couple of half-tunes. After not having finished them, he handed them to his arranger, a serious musical mind called Lou Littlejohn, and said: 'well, here are the basics. You think you can make a large scale symphonic sort of opera like thing out of this? I need to put out a new album.' Littlejohn nodded. He took the tapes home and worked feverishly for three weeks. Out came most enjoyable orchestral bits and pieces. Wakeman loved them. 'Now', he said, 'all we need to do is add my pub band and a newsreader, and there's my new masterpiece.'Again, Littlejohn nodded and dared not speak, in awe of this keyboard giant, this hero of progressive rock. For a moment he considered asking Wakeman to include his name on the LP sleeve, but after another glance at the masters glittering golden cape, he thought better of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"!Que malo es el tiempo!","review":"Con 17 años (en 1977) compré este disco y me pareció una obra maestra. Wakeman era el mago de los teclados y de la composición. Podía codearse de tú a tú con cualquier compositor clásico que se preciara. !Qué ingenuo!. Hacía lustros que no escuchaba este disco. El otro día lo adquirí en Cd y corrí a recuperar esas maravillosas melodías. El resultado fué una frustración como hay pocas. Durante todos estos años he escuchado bastante música clásica. La suficiente como para darme cuenta de que Wakeman es tan sólo un mal aprendiz de brujo. Es un correcto teclista, muy vistoso visualmente, pero poco más. Compositivamente, esta obra es absolutamente vacua, pueril y grandilocuente. En el marco de Yes, Wakeman cumple su papel con mucha corrección. Es un buen teclista para la media de lo que son los teclistas en el rock, pero fuera de ellos, sus intentos por convertirse en algo más resultan patéticos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular progressive rock, plus the London Symphony","review":"This has to be Rick Wakeman's all time solo masterpiece! Not for the faint of heart, the original keyboard player with YES puts this classic Jules Verne story into a musical context that will move you.

It seems like everybody in this movie is too concerned about hurting others feelings that I find myself yawning. Not enough emotional extremes. Everybody ends their relationships on the 'lets be friends' kind of thing. Anybody who's ever been jealous or dumped knows that the arena of love is never always that friendly.

And, while I am sure that there are inaccuracies with regard to geography and leagues sailed and so on, these are not especially noteworthy or destructive of the plot. If there is one objection that might be reasonably raised, it is that of happenstance: whenever the going gets rough, an island appears--or, a long-lost relative just happens to show up in...Jamaica!Stockwin's narratives stress action--the realistic tedium of the voyages (which was handled neatly and realistically in Hornblower and Aubrey/Maturin) seems distatsteful to the author. Nonetheless, I find the series largely appealling and sufficiently different from (say) the Drinkwater group to be worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seaflower","review":"Stockwin does an excellent job with the physical details of 19th century sailing and writes tolerably on the sentence level.Two large elements of the novel don't work so well, though. The first is the plot, so-called. Kydd and his friends go through one apparent challenge after another, but all are easily resolved. Just as the drama starts to build, the characters solve the problem or the danger goes away, resulting in repeated anticlimaxes. The plot does not seem to have an overall arc or a structure of building tension... essentially, there's no point.The second problem is with characterization. Though the characters are appealing enough in themselves, they're never challenged and none of their experiences seem to change them.

I see some maturity, and to me the existence of this film looks like a little miracle.The story is very sad and I understand it is based on Malle's life experience.

No substantiative material is involved, only attempts to suggest other resources or reference points. Completely lacking in tecnical data and much akin to a first rough draft of an English composition thesis statement on factors surrounding issues about information concerning before, during and after A+ cerfication ... see what I mean. It only gets one star because the system does not allow none!"},{"rating":"1","title":"EXTREMELY NASTY!","review":"as has been repeated before this book is a sales pitch with only 1/10 of it being technical info. the info is very vague and poorly organized. review questions are vague and many answers are WRONG. the authors just wanted to make some money but NOT to educate anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A thirty dollar advertisment for CompTIA and A+ Exam.","review":"Most of this book was devoted to selling the exam. Not much else... Don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip-Off","review":"I agree with other reviews of this book. It was a vast waste of time and money with very little useful information. Instead check out A+ study guide by David Groth a book that provides the information you need to pass the test."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, there is another . . .","review":"The book is all right as a general overview, but it does not contain much detailed information about what's on the test. I liked David Groth's books (A+ Core Exam Study Guide and A+ Windows/DOS Study guide). They cost a bit more (about $40.00 apiece through amazon), but they contain much better information."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Waste of Time & Money--Don't even think of buying it","review":"I Learned Zilch from this book. In fact, it contains many errors!!! I was hoping to learn how to pass this test. This book should be titled, \\"Intro to Microcomputers\\" or \\"How to fail the A+ Exam\\". I had to buy a different book to study. I would never by ANYTHING from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother. This was $25 I should have used elsewhere.","review":"This book seems to take as its primary focus the \\"selling\\" of the A+ certification, and as such is grossly mistitled. The book should instead be titled \\"Why the A+ certification is good for the computer industry.\\" As far as providing useful information to persons seeking advice and study aids in preparation for the A+ cerification exam, the book is dangerously misleading. Warning! There is a great deal more information covered on the test than is reviewed in this so-called \\"Success Guide.\\" Of far more value to the certification-seeker would be a bank of study questions, or a different book entirely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too vague, but worth a look to learn about A+","review":"The first few chapters of this book contain good information about being A+ Certified. Unfortunately it gives many charts and graphs which I could live without. The chapters which I purchased the book for, the technical chapters, were seriously lacking. I found quite a bit of the information outdated. Even though I am an experienced technician I found much of the information so vague as to be confusing from a beginner's perspective and often misleading. This book is a good reference about the exam and certification, but I wouldn't rely solely on it for taking the test. Definetly wait for the next edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book doesn't deliver","review":"The book was written more as a summary than anything else. If you don't know your stuff,this book won't help. If you do, you don't need it.Until a better one comes out,I wouldn't buy it.(P.S. It took me two times to pass the exam.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Publisher could do much better, no cd, book upside down","review":"Although the book was well written there were no other aids like a cdrom. Pages themselves were upside down from outer cover and some pages were not properly positioned when printed. There are several other books much better than this one. I would not buy. (hard cover binding reviewed)"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's an ok book for a general overview","review":"Several questions in the sample tests was not covered in the text. This book is a good general overview of the test. Sad part is the first 2 chapters is pretty much sales pitch for you to take the test. Good info on ideas on troubleshooting and client-services skills"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book should have been a magazine article","review":"This book contains about the depth of material you might expect to find in a magazine article about A+ certification. What success it has had was strictly due to the fact that there was so little available on the topic. Thankfully, that situation has now changed. The David Groth titles \\"Core Module\\" and \\"Windows/DOS\\" from Sybex are so completely superior to this thin overview as to not even be comparable. The sad part about all this is that now that there are finally outstanding books on the topic, CompTIA is about to change the tests (due out in July or so). Though to be honest, the tests (especially the Windows/DOS test) are greatly in need of updating."},{"rating":"1","title":"I read the book (3 times), took the test, and failed.","review":"Book is not up-to-date. Questions and answers don't seem to make sense. Wait for a better one. And believe me, the A+ TEST is very difficult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad a rating of \\"zero\\" is not available ...","review":"I've never felt so cheated after buying a book. It was poorly written and poorly edited. Also, the authors place too many \\"war stories\\" in the text and not enough of the technical details needed for the A+. Luckily, I passed the test recently (no thanks to this book)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good intro to the A+ program, but not a good study guide","review":"I have purchased this book to find out what the A+ certification is all about, which it did explained BUT this is by no means a study guide. I recommend the A+ Exam Cram or Mike Meyers A+ All in One Certification or any other A+ certification books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disorder and Early Sorrow.","review":"A fitting description for this book, even though it is also the name of one of Thomas Mann's novellas. This book should not have even been published, because it is confusing, misleading and contains some outright errors. A scandalous waste of time. Don't even read it from the library. Use other guides. Even \\"A+ For Dummies\\" is better than this waste of trees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks Guys, I almost threw in the towel","review":"After reading this book I told myself 'forget about A+ Certification'but after reading the reviews I feel so much better.This book was very confusing for someone with less than 1 years experience in the computer industry.I agree with another reader who said this should be a news/magz acticle.Anyone have any good recommandation for a good test prep for A+ ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"nice","review":"this is a concise and fairly comprehensive book on finite groups.it is very, very nice. in about 200 pages, it gives you all of the basics. a bright high school student can read it.books like these are so much better than annoying books like Artin, or Lang which are like 700 pages and are basically a brain dump of the author onto the student.if you want to learn group theory by yourself and have a patience, read this book, then the book by James and Liebeck. then to learn Lie algebras/groups, use a book like Erdmann or Kirillov or this very short new book by Yvette Kosmann-Schwarzbach. for lots of examples look at Fulton & Harris."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as the first","review":"Bought it for the kids for Christmas, not anywhere near as good, not as funny, not as entertaining, as the first. The characters don't ring true, and the antics are just too out there. The kids watched it once and haven't picked it up since."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's just a feel good movie!","review":"This may not be some big Hollywood production and, yes, it is sort of a knock off of Mary Poppins... but my family loves it and that's what matters! Good for kids and adults who don't want the language and sex and violence of many movies today."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweet movie","review":"We enjoyed this one as much as the first Nanny McPhee! Great movie that pulls at your heartstrings! Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute, Enjoyable for all","review":"Great family film. The story has great characterizations in the children and can provide your children with a lesson, while still being enjoyable for the adults."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],H={key:0},B={key:1};function M(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",B,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",H,"See more"))],8,N)):b("",!0)])}const j=d(C,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-682de44d"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/25.md","filePath":"glossary/25.md"}'),W={name:"glossary/25.md"},G=Object.assign(W,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(j)]))}});export{L as __pageData,G as default};
