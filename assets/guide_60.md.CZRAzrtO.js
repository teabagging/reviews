I was leaning towards this humidifier already, but he inspired enough confidence to make my choice.Only complaint - the \\"capture bucket\\" is small and needed to be emptied twice a day for the first couple of weeks. Once it caught up with the humidity, it went to once every day or two. If they put the same engine in a case that supported a 60-80 pint bucket, it'd be perfectRe noise level:- On high or medium, it's quiet- In quite mode, it's scary quiet ...

It would turn on, but not dehumidify. I called Soleus and at first they seemed eager to help me... However, since the machine was technically two weeks from delivery out of warranty, they would be willing to fix it if I paid full shipping both way $[...], a $[...] per hour bench fee, plus what ever the parts etc. would come to. In a nut shell...probably more than what I initially paid for it. There was no flexibility on there part. Two weeks out of warrenty!

The humidifier is used from 10pm - 5am in my bedroom. The unit is quite. Yes, it sounds like a fan. As other people have said, the bucket removal isn't as smooth as I would like but it's not enough for me to return the product.

Its nice looking, easy to move/operate and its pretty quiet. You can watch TV in the same room while this runs and it won't bother you. But it doesn't remove any water, not 1 drop. I have had it running in a basement that recently had some water damage. Its still pretty damp. I was borrowing a friends unit that is large, old and very loud; that one sucked gallons of water out. This one draws out nothing at all after a few days of operation. Maybe this is a defective unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diamond better than stone","review":"I've used the stone version of the Lansky Sharpening system but find the diamond system to be a lot less likely to clog. However, if you don't believe you'll be using the system all that much, perhaps the added expen$e of the diamond hones might not make it a good value for you; purchase the stone hones instead. I don't use the honing oil packaged with the kit. I clean the diamond surface with water. Lansky makes a great product at a great price. You will find the system VERY easy to use after you've watched the instructional video found on Lansky's website."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lansky Diamond Sharpening System","review":"OK... so I must have watched every single knife sharpening video on YouTube before I decided which one I was going to buy. It was between the Lansky Diamond Sharpening System or the Spyderco Sharpmaker. I chose the Lansky because it looked to be easier for a beginner with the angle guides and I didn't want to mess up my knifes.So I buy the Lansky with the metal stand and extra stones. I just got finished trying it out on my first knife. Just one of my cheap butterfly knifes thankfully. It totally destroyed it. I went with the 25 degree slot. You can't use the 20 or 17 even if you want to because you end up grinding the clamp.I ended up with a 1/2 inch bevel on one side and a 1/8 inch bevel on the other side of my knife.

This book has the gift of speaking to many people who have been traumatized in their grief experience, whether suicide-related or not. I am also a Police Chaplain and have recently been called to minister to four different families who have been impacted by this type of tragic loss. This resource not only helped me in my immediate ministry with the families, but I have used it as resource material for other Police Department Chaplains as well.

A lot of characters didn't interact for a large portion of the season (i.e.- Lucas and Brooke), 2.) the addition of unnecessary new characters, 3.) so many bad plot lines were dragged out way too long while the good ones were either ruined by crappy writing, or cut short too soon...I could go on and on.

Most high school students do not have to go through what these teenagers are going through, but it brings back the days of Melrose Place and Beverly Hills 91210, only dealing with issues of today, like the typical high school cliques: jocks, nerds, popular vs. unpopular. Kids dealing with issues of teen pregnancy, romance, college, their futures, and of course their parents.Season four tied all the seasons together and I enjoyed watching it more so than I did when I started watching the three previous seasons.

You should like it. Many of my favorite bands have released albums in 2005, and it seems that my more hardcore favorites have gone a little soft. I don't know why but it's beginning to change the genre of music I listen too. Anyway, I'm not saying they are hardcore or that they are selling out or anything. I am just saying they are a little softer than the last couple of CDs. Good cd though... good CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good","review":"This is my favourite effort from the band so far. They've maintained the sound that brought in their fanbase but also, they've expanded on it and matured a bit out of that crappy emo stage.

Good rock album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what was expected","review":"I've been waiting for this release for a long time; so, I rushed out and bought this album today. I put it in expecting the same, intense begining that I got from \\"Rookie of the Year\\" on Casually Dressed. Well... to say the least, I was thouroghly dissapointed. This album lacks in two ways. First(and mostly)it lacks in intensity. There is hardly any screaming on the album. I know that everyone's not into the screaming, but it's what made their previous two albums. Second it lacks in originality. I'm kind of biased on this part. Last week I picked up Finch's new album, and it was so different. This album, however, basically follows the same formula that Casually Dressed(minus the screaming). What this album has is way more technical guitars and way better production.Like a previous reviewer said... if you want something a little heavier, pick up Finch's Say Hello To Sunshine"},{"rating":"1","title":"I've learned my lesson on impulse buying...","review":"OK, so I was downtown, saw this in Woolworths, I'd heard one or two songs from \\"Casually Dressed...\\" and I'd liked them a little. I had a bt of spare money and the shop wasn't carrying much worth interest in, so I ended up taking it home. What a waste of a tenner.The reason for the low score is because this album has NO musical direction. It seems to be content just oozing emo for 40 minutes-odd. Honestly, I've listened to the whole album, and I can't remember a note apart from the intro to \\"Recovery,\\" the only good thing on this album and the only thing saving it from one star. It may not be actively irritating, but it has no redeeming features either. It's just the same bland mess from start to finish. So if you want my advice, download \\"Recovery\\" somewhere, listen to the first thirty seconds, then forget this album exists."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've had better","review":"Not to say that this band is untalented, but it wasn't what I expected.

There really is at best four or five metalcore bands that I like ,but this can't even compare, boring riffs, unimpressive \\"solos\\", hack bassist, and a drummer that can't even get his beats right. The lyrics are just whiny and cheesy, no real sense of maturity or maybe even penmenship and it's just more lyrical rehash from their other albums. You want some good punk go for The Clash, The Ramones, Black Flag, The Misfits, Sublime and Suicidal Tendencies. For great metal, Soilent Green, Venom,Celtic Frost, Suffocation, Voivod, Metal church, Behemoth, Daath, Amon Amarth and Mastodon.

Without selling out, they've managed to create a melodic, stand-out album. This isn't like all the EMO you're used to listening to. It's deep, dark and meaningful. Without getting too depressing, the lyrics attack relationships and the pain that goes with them.If you're not sure about them, check out songs like \\"All the Rage\\" and \\"Streetcar\\".I play \\"Hours\\" nearly every day and I plan to see them live this Summer.

It is not the most \\"in depth\\" book on investing, but it isn't a \\"dummies\\" book either. The Gardner Boys are clever and their writing is lively.

The problem is that their homework is very sloppy. Lots of factual errors and no backtesting of their statements.

If i was a novice I might be more impressed. Most of the basics are covered on the www.fool.com WebSite, so if you want the flavor of this book try that first. I found the chapter on reviewing Annual Reports the most valuable. That alone might justify the price for me, but everything else is pretty much on the web. The humor wore thin on me, as others have stated. Sometimes I found myself skimming, looking for the next bit of serious text.

Almost every investor lost money on stocks then, but a listener following the advice in this book on tape would have lost much more, with some tech stocks never recovering (because of bankruptcy).Some of the advice is quite good, but about 25% is downright wrong and dangerous. If you know enough to know which advice is good and which is bad, then you don't need this book.Perhaps something went wrong when abridging the longer written text to produce these audio tapes.

Over the course of 2 high tech careers, my wife and I accumulated dozens of mutual funds and stocks. Each year, we'd look at the results and say either \\"that was a good year\\" or on occasion the other. This book gave me a great start on doing that type of analysis. The only downside I'll mention (which cost this book a star) is that the book talks about how great the \\"dogs of the dow strategy\\" is - that you easily beat the S&P by spending a few minutes a year finding the top dividend dow issues.

Three of these songs made the top ten in the USA: the poignant Claire, Alone Again (Naturally) and Get Down. He specialized in the mid-tempo ballad, although Get Down was a real rocker with a catchy hook. Other UK hits on this compilation include Ooh Wakka Doo Wakka Day, No Matter How I Try, We Will, Ooh Baby, Nothing Rhymed and I Don't Love You But I Think I Like You. What's In A Kiss was a solitary stray hit from the late 70s when his time had passed.

Who has not heard or used the phrase: \\"for heaven sake\\". Several weeks ago, my father passed away and I have been searching for the perfect book to read to my child about where her grandfather went. For Heaven Sake, follows a young boy on his journey to learn about heaven (a place where everyone tells him, his grandfather is). This book is written in a gentle and caring way, that helps both the child and adult cope with the very challenging and difficult subject of death. It answers the most common questions that children ask. The illustrations and content of the story kept my child's attention. I enjoy reading it to her and feel my own sense of comfort with knowing that my father is in heaven. It has become one of her favorite books at bedtime. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has children that have suffered a loss of a loved one or who one day might. It is an excellent book to have around."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely exploration of the idea of heaven","review":"Rabbi Sandy Sasso has an amazing way of exploring a complicated concept like \\"heaven\\". I love that she articulates it as being a feeling in our heart, which even very young children can understand. While she does include the concept of God, it's not featured, but just part of the context of the story. The adventures which Isaiah takes with his grandmother are accessible and the story unfolds gently. There is no fanfare or parting of clouds in this story - it's just sweet, simple and reassuring even to my adult mind. I felt peaceful reading it as I remembered my own dad.Thank you, Rabbi Sandy, once again you have created a beautiful work that will help me share my spirituality with my children."},{"rating":"1","title":"One good idea","review":"The book has one good idea in it.

I clipped it to the steering wheel bracing (under the dash) and it worked fine. The only drawback to this is the slight interference (static) you receive when passing under overhead electrical lines....To solve that problem I disconnected the \\"Sure Connect\\" component and installed the FM Coupler component (separate purchase @$35).....no more static and clear reception...Problem solved...XM is the BEST....now, if they would only figure out how to get XM TV working we'd be set....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks to the Reviewers","review":"I have a Samsung XM radio.

For the price, give it a go and watch it on a rainy night if you want to have a haunting feeling as you watch it. At the very least it's entertaining and curious. I felt the fella who was channeling music from John was the most sincere and wouldn't it be more accurate to say he's inspired by John's music?? At worst, it's a poor attempt to get this Beatle fan to believe that the sensitives in this show got the \\"real\\" John Lennon.

'Parachutes' is a solid debut effort, and by far the rawest Coldplay album. The energy is evident on every track, and their guitars and bass also hit a lot harder on 'Parachutes' than their next two albums. \\"Yellow\\" everyone has heard, and it's certainly a beautiful song. \\"Trouble\\" was also a single, and worthy of praise. \\"Shiver\\" is another good song, but the album's magnum opus, and possibly Coldplay's magnum opus to this date has to be the album ender, \\"Everything's Not Lost\\". 'Parachutes' is tight, fit, and a lot of polish lies within the raw energy, which was a sign of things to come for Coldplay. Recommended, and those looking to get into Coldplay should start with this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soaring Through The Sky","review":"From the opening strings of 'Don't Panic', this is one of the very best debut albums in history. It goes from strength to strength, with 'Shiver' 'Yellow' and 'Trouble' being the standout tracks. It has a beautiful elegaic tone. Its not quite Scottish band Travis, or Irish band U2, it stands on its on right and is destined to be one day the biggest band in the world, once Bono puts down the microphone. I would strongly recommend that you buy it and listen to the whole thing right the way through - it will have you captivated. There may be some tracks that you mightn't be crazy about at first, but they'll grow on you. 'Yellow' is the song that made Coldplay. Chris Martin said that he found it amazing to owe Coldplay's entire career on the 4 and a half minutes of music that is 'Yellow'. Coldplay's music is constantly being used on television shows and movies. And rightly so. They have such amazing, beautiful music."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the second coming of Radiohead","review":"Coldplay have bee compared to early Radiohead, the implication being if you wanted \\"The Bends part 2\\" instead of Kid A, then these are the boys for you.Don't be fooled! Coldplay are fourth-rate impostors. This CD does not stand the test of repeated plays - I never want to hear \\"Yellow\\" again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk Lyrics","review":"The music is 'nice' but the lyrics are junk. But most people don't listen to lyrics anyways (see the other reviews)."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAH!","review":"THIS IS DISGUSTING!!!! These guys ought to be ashamed of themselves. Never in my life have I heard such lame songs. The lyrics are incredibly corny, the piano tinkling in the background is pathetic, and the singer's voice could use some help. Trouble is an okay song, but the rest is pure garbage. I hate this more than I hate Norah Jones' new album. Get back to England where ya belong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, Awful, Awful","review":"First let me start out by saying that I absolutely love Travis, Radiohead, and Starsailor. Now, a lot of people will tell you that Coldplay is exactly like them. DON\\"T LISTEN. Coldplay is very bad. Sure, Yellow is a great song, but for me, that's where it ends. The music is very boring and just...doesn't sound good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guys, guess what?!","review":"There's already a Radiohead!!You know how when you're making photocopies, the original is always well definied, and then the copies from the copies get lighter and lighter? Coldplay are like the 50th copy. Radiohead Lite. Radiohead for Dummies. If they bit Radiohead's style any harder, Thom Yorke would bleed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Copycats!","review":"I know saying this now might eventually cause a riot, but Coldplay ARE copycats! So are Travis, so are Muse, at least Doves do have some degree of originality and dignity. Everybody is raving about the album now, I've listened to this for a few times, tried to make myself like it. Well, the conclusion is... they are just ripping off Radiohead, not in the same way as Nirvana ripping off the Pixes,but in a way that makes the album sound cheap, maybe(? ) Coldplay will be the next Radiohead, they do make a few good tunes here and there, but NOT NOW! There are just toooooo many 'the next Radiohead' around, Travis, Muse...even Grandaddy(at least they try to make another 'OK Computer' instead of making another 'The Bend') now there is Coldplay. A parade of wannabes. It's time! Radiohead is releasing 'Kid A' soon, the landscape is going to change again!You don't believe? We will see!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"I don't understand the fascination with this band. I have read all of the rave reviews calling Coldplay \\"atmospheric\\", \\"beautifully tender\\", \\"touching\\", blah, blah, blah. I must be missing something because this album is BORING.I can normally listen to and enjoy atmospheric music or more tempered rock music with original sound twists, but this is neither. This is simply Oasis at a slow pace. It has neither the atmospheric tones of Radiohead or the sorrowful guitar riffs on some of the Pumkins more relaxed tunes (See \\"Spaceboy\\" - Siamese Dream). The album comes close at times, but it's just missing a certain element to push it into the territory that these critics want to place it in. Perhaps the album drones on too much without enough variety between songs. If you suffer from insomnia I would suggest you chew some valerian root and listen to this album for 30 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"I'm really late on this review. Parachutes is a classic album and my personal favorite from Coldplay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adult Alternative","review":"I was told that this CD sounds like 'Bends' era Radiohead. I purchased it only having heard 'Don't Panic', which is good. The part about sounding like Radiohead is inaccurate, and despite what people say, they don't sound like Oasis either. Noel Gallagher was right about these guys, they are soft and so is their music. That is ok, but this is no great rock opus as some critics have deemed it. I would recommend 'Don't Panic' and 'Shiver.' But otherwise this is mostly moody, sappy, and tame. The lyrics are at times downright terrible. If you're feeling kind of emo, go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Coldplay CD","review":"I have 3 of Coldplay's CD's and I must say \\"Parachutes\\" definitely beats the other two hands down. Favorite tracks include \\"Don't Panic\\", \\"Shiver\\", and \\"Trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"The hype is justified, 'Parachutes' is excellent","review":"It had to happen. Coldplay catch a break and now they're threatening to be huge. Along with David Gray's 'White Ladder' their debut album is the success story of 2000 and yes, the Travis comparisons haven't stopped coming. Only, Coldplay have shown us just one facet of their musical talents, while we know Travis can rock (yet for reasons unknown to me they choose not to).But back to Coldplay. The single 'Yellow' is superb. It's one of those songs that you hope to hear everytime you turn on your radio. Without this one song, I don't think I could give this album such a high rating. The band picked the right songs for singles (Yellow, Trouble, Shiver) as these are 'Parachutes' highlights. If you want to buy this album and need just one more endorsement then you have one from me. It's a tough act to sound sensitive and comforting without coming across as dreary and miserable, but Coldplay achieve it in fine style.Four and a half stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoozefest","review":"I really wanted to like this record, having loved Coldplay's brilliant second CD, \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head.\\" I've listened to it several times now, and one word keeps coming to mind: Soporific.With the exception of \\"Yellow\\" and \\"Shiver,\\" which are fine songs indeed, the rest of the album proceeds at a snail's pace. I fail to see the similarities with Radiohead, whose dynamic and challenging records never sink into the torpor that ails \\"Parachutes.\\" A closer comparison is with Travis' similarly moribund debut, \\"The Man Who.\\"I like mellow artists (c.f. Richard Aschroft, Seal), but there's a fine line between mellow and mind-numbing. Fortunately, Coldplay did learn how to mix things up a bit, and it shows on their next record.I give \\"Parachutes\\" 2 stars for the two great songs (\\"Yellow\\" and \\"Shiver\\") which are almost worth the price of admission alone. (Great cover, too)."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST SOUND BUTT..","review":"excellent purchase, I arrived at the agreed time and that I live outside the U.S., plus the package COMES IN A BOX PROTECTED FOR GUARD, WAS NOT EXPENSIVE dispatch arrived in excellent condition, very good shop, BUY SOME OTHER CDS CAME WITH THE BOX ITEMS BUT NOT AFFECT THE SONG OR THE CD, NOTHING TO FIX THAT CAN NOT BE WITH A NEW BOX"},{"rating":"1","title":"its not the worst album ever","review":"apparatly these are the new rock stars.strange though because i thought rock stars had to rock coldplay on the other don't rock they write slow moving ballads which is fine just not 10 of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yellow is NOT the best song on the album","review":"I do not like \\"Yellow\\" so much and it does not provide a proper representation of the entire album. I bought the album after seeing Coldplay play live at the Brit Awards where they played \\"Trouble\\" which is the best song on the album and is nothing like the overplayed \\"Yellow\\". While everyone is comparing this work to Radiohead, Buckley, and Travis, I think that track #8 \\"High Speed\\" is something that could have been taken from the Verve's \\"A Storm in Heaven\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"One good song...so it gets two stars","review":"I bought this CD because Amazon.com stated if your music tastes center around bands like Badly Drawn Boy and Radiohead, then you might like this album. Well, this CD is a far cry from the above mentioned - both of whom are innovative, cutting-edge artists with an individual voice. This band sounds like so many others, it's hard to regard it as anything new. One question if you are considering the purchase of this record: Do you like Dave Matthews voice? If so, I'm sure this one will get you off -"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album, but not the new Radiohead","review":"Hell, I'd say that the NEW Radiohead is the new Radiohead right now. Anyway, I said that because these guys will eventually seperate themselves from Radiohead's shadow, and if this record is evidence, there's good things to come in the future..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Britrock album of 2000!!","review":"In the spirit of Travis's \\"The Man Who,\\" \\"Parachutes\\" is another mellow well-crafted rock album. The kicker is, it is actually even better than \\"The Man Who\\" in my opinion. Travis is a good point of reference, but Coldplay have a sound all their own. Lead singer Chris Martin's voice is arguably more emotion-filled than that of Travis's Fran Healy. With two successful singles so far, \\"Shiver\\" and \\"Yellow,\\" the album is getting both critical and commercial success. My sole complaint is that this 10 track album clocks in at under 42 minutes. I want more. Deeply moving, part happy, part somber, all about true emotion (love lost, found, denied, etc). Musically a gem. Soars, crawls, and ends before you're ready. Just the way an album should."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful World, Beautiful CD","review":"In an age of fake pop and insincere rhyme-rock, this is an absolute masterpiece. In fact, I dare to say that this would be a masterpiece in any era.If you want to hear and feel current songwriting at it's very best, this is the CD for you. From top to bottom, \\"Parachutes\\" is an incredible piece of work.Chris Martin pours everything he's got into every song, from heartbreak to happiness, self-doubt to self-understanding. He is surrounded by three other \\"professional musicians\\" who know how to play, and play well.It is mellow, and perhaps at times a little depressing, but it is as beautiful as fine art in a museum. A true masterwork that will surely become a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"I will define this album as soothing and easy to play repeatedly. I am a fan of a group called The Church which had success in the early 1990's. Many of the songs on this album remind me of The Church, especially track one. Enjoy! If you like it, try The Church as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnetic","review":"It's impossible to pick a favorite song on this c.d. You think you like one song the best, then the next plays and takes you to a whole new world. The only problem with this c.d. is that when a song begins, your mind drifts off with it, and makes it hard to concentrate on the beautiful lyrics which add to the magnitism of the sound. Brilliantly done, well worth the money.(P.s. this c.d. is great to pop in when stressed out, it works for me all the time.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely beautiful","review":"I docked off one star from this gorgeous, gorgeous album because although all the songs are simply beautiful, the album has too few songs and short ones at that.Having said that I can't even begin to describe Chris Martin's amazing voice or Jon's (or is it Chris's?) magical guitar bits, which just leaves you slightly breathless, with a huge smile on your face.For those who think the album is depressing, have another listen to Don't Panic and Yellow.A must-buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simon's Review","review":"A good mixture of songs and a very mellow and relaxed sound.

Originating in the UK, they are now getting their much deserved respect here in the U.S. This is by far the best Cd that I have bought in the last 6 months. It's smooth rock and hypnotic sounding voice of the lead singer make it a sure bet for any music fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"thought provoking and ironical","review":"I had actually never heard of Coldplay until I read an article about Charlize Theron in \\"Esquire\\" magazine. She had remarked that it was the CD she presently had in her car. Now I sure have! I read in an earlier review that \\"Spies\\" reminds them of 9/11/01. I have that same specific thought. I had just purchased the disc right around that time,and listened to it constantly. Maybe its a timing issue, but I find the lyrics haunting. ...they're going to catch us where we sleep.\\" \\"they're\\" being bin laden and the rest of those ignorant, sadistic folks. Enough ranting... I absolutely love this album. I look forward to more great stuff from Coldplay. I hope the next one won't be as ironical though.

The novelty soon wore off though. While at first songs like Yellow are easy to get caught in and sing along to, below the pretty surface, there isn't much substance. The lyrics are really almost nonsensical. The whole CD has the feeling of one terrificly long, dragging song, with the same sweetly melancholy guitars and sappy lyrics about all the trials and tribulations of love. This music is very non demanding and easily slips into the background, going unnoticed. Chris Martin uses the same tone of voice and style of singing in every song, and really demonstrates the saying \\"Difference makes a difference.\\" For better bands within the same general genre of Coldplay, I would check out Flickerstick, an underrated band not many people have heard of, Live, Seven Mary Three, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"astounding and haunting","review":"This is an album you will play and play over and over again. If this is their first album,... what will their 2nd sound like? The vocals are haunting - just check out the song \\"Spies\\" - and the music is melodious and flowing. This CD is new, fresh, and wonderful...there is nothing I can think of to compare it to. And by the way, it's a LOT better than Kid A, and that's from a huge Radiohead fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GROUP WITH A FUTURE","review":"Chris Martin of Coldplay is easily one of the finest male vocalists to hit the scene in the last few years. He has emotion, smooth delivery, and a good range. His voice is what makes these songs extraordinary. Not to mention the musical arrangements and productions are spectacular. The over all feel is somewhat Pink Floydian- but more so in a pop music sense. The songs are light and easy to like. \\"Yellow\\" contains lyrics which put a good feeling in your soul. \\"Trouble\\" is seen occassionally on MTV. All the songs have an otherworldly mellow mood to them with strong guitar solos. All in all I'd say Coldplay has a future in the music business. If they keep on making music like this they will probably be around for a very long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the Heart and Not the Purse","review":"This lovely act of bravery shows there still are some male artists who are in touch with their sensitive side and not afraid to show it. Coldplay takes a unique leap down the trail of modern music- and takes time to stop and smell the roses. Pure Artistry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Album, BUY IT!","review":"&#65279;This is an amazing album. I heard the song \\"Yellow\\" on the radio a few times and really liked it, so I decided I would go buy the album. Wow, what a treat it was. \\"Yellow\\" has a unique sound of its own, so if you are looking for an album of \\"Yellows\\" you will be disappointed. But if you are looking for a moody album that is not scared to show some emotions this is it.Sometimes I wonder why it takes so long for the British bands to get their sound over hear to the US, but when many of them do I am so glad. \\"Parachutes\\" has won quite a few awards and they are all well deserved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely the best Coldplay record","review":"I don't know what happened to them.... Jonny Buckland's guitar playing on this record was outstanding on this record, but all the records following this one really weren't guitar driven at all. So naturally, as a guitarist I like this record most. His tone is soooo killer on it and all the lead lines are perfect. Guitar playing aside, this is an all around great record, songwriting, musicianship... all of it. Definitely worth $5 and WAY more than that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hip Thing Now","review":"This band is white-hot in Britain right now, and I'd highly recommend giving this disc a spin. The songs \\"Shiver\\" and \\"Yellow\\" (a UK #4 single) are particular standouts.If you're a fan of jangly guitars and moody pop soundscapes (think Travis, Mazzy Star, Radiohead without all the moaning), then you won't be disappointed..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hello world","review":"Introducing coldplay. Honestly, haven't listened to this one as much as their others, but still catches you ear. Like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simplicity can be a good thing...","review":"Coldplay is not trying to break musical barriers. Instead, they seek to do great things within existing musical standards. Hmmm...sounds like another english foursome I've been a fan of...No joke, though. Like the Beatles before Sgt. Pepper, Coldplay isn't trying to re-invent the wheel. Instead, they're trying to perfect the wheel.Listen closely...the beauty is in the details."},{"rating":"1","title":"*Yawn*....","review":"Perhaps last year's greatest musical irony was that most of the critics who found Radiohead's stunning, atmospheric Kid A to be boring/pointless/whatever other misconception they could conjure up (the rock equivalent of player-hatin') seemed to be head over heels for Coldplay's Parachutes. This is solid stuff; good singin', good playin', and \\"Yellow\\", hit or not, is a beautiful song. But what it doesn't do is take a single risk, and there's not a band out there who couldn't do four-stark-chords-and-passable-lyrics just as well, if not better. They're promising... but not quite there yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"A special album","review":"Yeah, everyone (except the Coldplay haters) loves \\"Yellow\\" and \\"Trouble\\", but what makes Parachutes special are the lesser-known songs that give the album its original, indie-rock identity.\\"Don't Panic\\" packs a pithy punch of melancholy optimism, while the mind-blowing conclusion of \\"Shiver\\" commands your full attention. \\"Sparks\\" is the one that causes shivers, though.\\"High Speed\\" exudes a nonchalant confidence that embraces uncertainty, while \\"Everything's Not Lost\\" encourages a glass-half-full introspection. This moody, provocative--yet understated--collection is the must-have rainy-day album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple yet stunning","review":"What a CD! Chris Martin's voice is an instrument in itself; he bends and twists it beautifully, each time producing stunning notes that combine nicely with the heartfelt lyrics. I've listened to this CD over and over and have yet to tire of it. A few of my favorites on the CD:Shiver: This was one of the first songs I heard from Coldplay and I was in awe. His voice is so passionate and unique. It's a great song.Yellow: Yes, it had a lot of airtime, but it's still lovely. His voice is superb in this song, and the lyrics are very nice.Everything's Not Lost: Pretty song. I love when he starts singing “Ah, yeah, everything’s not lost�?toward the end of the song in all high notes. It’s brilliant.I could comment on every song on the CD as I did about these three. They're all great, all different, and all special in their own way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still my favorite.","review":"This is the album of theirs that started it all for me, and to my ears, it is still their best. I very much enjoy their new albums but the compliation of tracks on this disc is varied and exciting. Really, I can't not recommend this disc to any fan of well crafted music. Some will claim that the musical ideas of repetative, not much unlike some electronic and trance music, and while I agree to that on some level, all music is repetative in nature. The point is that they are creating musical repetitions that are intersting and one would want to hear over and over. Really, i'm not doing this album justice in this here review. I'll just say that if you like some rock/folk music with really singable/catch melodies then this one is worth a try for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I was recently introduced to Coldplay. This is one of those rare groups that come around that actually create music rather than spew it out for mass consumption. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE for the music lover!","review":"I cant say enough about this cd. I had no idea who Coldplay was until I heard \\"Yellow\\" and after listening to that, I got interested. After listening to Parachutes, I was left in amazement. Each song was beautifully made and the lyrics were incredible. My personal favorite is Shiver. If you want a cd that exemplifies music at its best, go out and get Parachutes by Coldplay, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"Remember back in summer 2000 when this cd was starting to fill people minds. Well this is a really good album and I see why it was so popular. This album is really good and all the songs here are good except maybe for one or two track but it is really good. It containes 4 hit singels YELLOW,TROUBLE,DON'T PANIC and of course many people's favourite SHIVER. This album is without a doubt one of the best debut albums ever. I hope their next cd will be as good. Only problem I felt later with this album when it won the grammy for best alternative album. I didn't like it. Not because the album didn't deserve it or anything because it dit deserve it. It's because it was released in 2000 and became a grammy winner in 2002. I also think it should have been nominated for album of the year. Thank You and I hope you will read this review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Debut Album","review":"I've been lax in my reviews of late, but I'm here to make amends, and the first one in a while has got to be this one--a disc my roommate turned me onto.After so many repeated listens, I was able to get past its derivatives and maintain to any of Coldplay's detractors that it doesn't suffer when compared to its obvious influences (Nick Drake, the Cure, the shoegazer-era bands circa '91), and boasts a few of the best tracks that will come out of this early decade.'Don't Panic','Yellow', and (my personal favourite)'Trouble' particularly stand out, but I do hope that they can make their next album as impressive. A mellow-fest to be sure, but strangely addictive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be Still My Heart","review":"This cd is one of those I can listen to over & over. Coldplay has captured the feeling of unrequited love in their song \\"Shiver\\" which is my current favorite on this album. After listening to the entire cd a few times, I find all the songs pleasing -- these guys are quite the artistic musicians as well as poets. They're the kind of band I would love to see in a cozy little pub on a rainy day."},{"rating":"2","title":"A chill out CD worth owning","review":"I hated this CD when I first heard it. But now, after I've listened to it at home I've decided it's one of the better CDs of 2001. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bones Sinking","review":"Wow...every time I hear that opening line to \\"Don't Panic\\", a shiver is born. If only I could think of the words to describe the power each of the songs on this album has.

British accents, soft piano, and chords that resonate throughout the \\"bones\\"...wow. Buy this album! :-D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Groovy","review":"I really liked the \\"Yellow\\" single (reminded me of Dave Matthews Band except not as sophomoric) but \\"Don't Panic\\" was what made me buy the album. I'm really glad I did. Simple and thoughtful. Radiohead-lite comparisions are apt and not insulting, and it even reminds me a little of Nick Drake. I listen to it several times in a row before switching CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chill","review":"This is the most chill CD I have ever heard. Don't Panic has put me to sleep so many times I want to kiss the guy who wrote it.

This song and album gives makes me look at things differently. We do live in a beautiful world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coldplay is AMAZING!","review":"In my opinion, I think this album is way better than a rush of blood to the head (not that I don't love that cd as well)...I love his laid back melodies which have a different aura to them then most of the tracks on rush of blood to the head. 'Don't Panic, Shiver, Sparks, Trouble and Parachutes' are just awesome...I cannot even begin to put my finger on what makes this band so great. This CD just makes me happy! I definetly would recommend this to anyone who likes Coldplay and just went to pick up rush of blood to the head... if you're interested in coldplay this cd is well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music to balance your checkbook to...","review":"COLDPLAY is like a less energetic version of Oasis, with yodeling thrown in. Maybe I'm too tainted or bitter to give it it's due, but PARACHUTE is just a step away from STING singing on that lame Jaguar TV commercial. Sure, the lead singer's heart is broken, but it comes across like an After School Special when compared to TREMBLING BLUE STARS or PEDRO THE LION. This album is so inoffensive and milquetoast, I'd consider giving my copy to my 55 year old mother, who'd easily enjoy it more than I would.Don't fall victim to the hype...Coldplay is a weak, mushy bore. If you like Julia Roberts movies, this CD is probably for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baa Baa Baa","review":"They can play their instruments - about as inventively as 14 year olds, picking up a guitar for the first time. They do write their own songs - in that tired old vein of British pop, everything's the same. The singing is a joke - why do the sheep take that whole falsetto bull**** so seriously? If you buy this - you're over 20 and slowly your braincells are crumbling, soon you'll spend every Sunday shopping with your partner, drink half a bottle of wine a night, you'll tut at children with any hint of life, you'll begin to get indignant about manners, you'll find Terry Wogan funny ... and then you'll die, having only ever listened to mid-tempo soft rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flabby, paltry formula.","review":"Coldplay are just another bland, inoffensive, watered-down 'rock' band that ride on their influance's backs to inexplicable chart success. Pop is in a sorry, sorry state when cack like this passes as the music of today.

DEATH TO MEDIOCRITY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WERE THEY TRYING TO BE DAVE MATTHEWS","review":"I know this group has been around for over a decade, but they are new to me. I'm exploring their albums and have listened to 4 of their other albums.I really like the others except Parachutes which sounds like Dave Matthews on Valium is doing all of the vocals, and there's not much variety in the songs. Same thing over and over. Nothing moves very far. If you like the first song, you'll like the rest of it.If you're a Dave Matthews fan, you might like this one. If you're not, then skip this record. The critics and a a big majority of Amazon reviewers liked it. Listen to it yourself and decide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coldplay leaves me Warm and Fuzzy","review":"I frist heard their music as soundtrack and loved it so much I had to have more!

Fair play to Coldplay!"},{"rating":"2","title":"4 stars","review":"I think this is Coldplays best album. As a whole it is better than Rush of blood to the head. Every song is good beside Spies which i really dont like."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would Highly Reccomend this Album","review":"This album is truly unique. The instrumental aspect of the music is beautifully mastered, and yet strangely simple. Adding to this is the distinct voice of Chris Martin. You will instantly fall in love with his voice and the lyrics. My favorite songs are Yellow (of course), Sparks, Don't Panic, and Everthing's Not Lost. This is not an album where you have to skip tracks to listen to something decent. Then entire thing is great and you can play the whole album through without skipping tracks. Coldplay is definitely one of the best new bands to hit the US."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Expense","review":"Bought the CD because I liked \\"Yellow\\".

Maybe spies is the only good song inside the album, others are just so-so."},{"rating":"2","title":"coldplay- parachutes","review":"this album grows on you. you'll find it hard to part with. easily one of the best albums of the past few years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coldplay/Coldfish","review":"I, too, was lured in by the glowing reviews by others, but was disappointed. These guys need some Wheaties. The music is limp and the lead vocals are anemic. The band just sounds tired, like they will never be able to muster the strength to really play. It's all kind of morose sounding, too. Not even cheerful pop."},{"rating":"1","title":"impossible for them to live up to the hype","review":"ok yes i they do have something but they dont live up to the hype if this album was less hyped i may be giving it at least a 3 but since this band has been so hyped up i have been kind to give it 2 because of the hype of this album this ends up seeming like a half arsed effort steer well clear unless youve never heard of them"},{"rating":"1","title":"The best example of modern pop trash","review":"I bought this after hearing part of clocks, and let me tell you, I regretted it, a lot. The only good track is 'Don't Panic'.Tiring, terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"Wow. I love this album. I like it better than their second. There seems to be more of an honest passion here. They were very young when they wrote this album, and I am impressed with their insite, and the song's melodies. Chris, though a bit nasily, has a listenable voice. I heard clips of their 3rd album, and it sounds like Clocks part 2. I just really love parachutes, and I am amazed at the people who have a rush of blood to the head, but don't have this one. Parachutes is just mellow and nice. Every song is really good. Ironically, \\"yellow\\" was there most popular song, and probably my least favorite. So, for those of you who are new to Coldplay, or just have a Rush of Blood To The Head, you are in for a treat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent album","review":"If you enjoy coldplay's other musical works then you will also likely enjoy this album as well. Worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore \\"A music fan\\" and his hate","review":"I just read the hateful \\"review\\" by 'A music fan'. I'm surprised that people with nothing but hate are allowed to review at Amazon. Parachutes is a sublime record, and that is coming from someone who loves Metallica, Fear Factory, Killswitch Engage, SYL, Emperor, and many more metal bands. I also love great music from other genres. Stop the Brit bashing from fools like 'A music fan', and enjoy this for the great rock record it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"my new obsession....","review":"i recently got around to buying both \\"a rush of blood to the head\\" and \\"parachutes\\". both of these albums are just astounding. \\"parachutes\\" is brilliant, touching, and endearing. i am currently really into track 9, we never change. not only is chris martin's voice very emotional, the music itself is subtle but nearly hypnotic. this album, also, has that certain british sound that you can't quite explain but you know when you hear it. i guess that is why coldplay gets the radiohead comparisions...bottom line, i love this album because it obviously came straight out of this band's heart and soul. and that is what makes wonderful music, as far as i am concerned!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great body of work, needs to be remastered!","review":"Coldplay's Parachutes is a great body of work!! I would have given it 5-stars, but the sound quality of this CD needs improvement with a serious remastering. Coldplay is not a bass-heavy band, but most of the glaring flaws are in the lower frequencies. Some songs(#2!) sound horrible on transparent systems where they should be magical, it's such a shame because the music is soooo good. For new listeners/fans, I would not let these issues prevent a purchase. This album is brilliant, a classic...which further justifies the need for remastering. Coldplay, pleeeeeeease consider giving this classic the sound quality it deserves!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More play","review":"There's something evidently different between US and UK rock bands. Here's an excellent UK alt-rock band. Coldplay dishes out an album of emotive and guitar-laden tracks that both touches and captivates the listener ultimately. From the sublime sounds of the opener Don't Panic to the hit Yellow and the closing Life Is For Living (hidden track), Coldplay displays a range of heartfelt emotions mostly evident in lead singer Chris Martin's brooding voice. Excellent album, check out some of the band's earlier stuff too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing...","review":"This album is one of the most relaxing, inspirational albums I've ever heard. From the beautiful intro \\"Don't Panic\\" to the hopeful \\"Everything's Not Lost,\\" every song contributes to the amazing experience. It gives an optimistic feeling without corny cliche lyrics or all happy, simple melodies. Chris Martin's voice goes perfectly with the style of music. \\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head\\" is another great album, but doesn't seem to have as many quality tracks. I would still give it at least 4 stars, but it's not on the same level as \\"Parachutes.\\" I would list the highlight tracks but I think every track is just as important as the one before it. Even the 48 second title track has potential to be a great song. Bottom line, go pick up \\"Parachutes\\" and if you like it, \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"chilling!","review":"I just wanted to give my thoughts on this album...I think the album is amazingly produced. I think Chris has an exceptionally unique high voice and it really adds to this band! I think the arrangment of songs on the album is well put together. The lyrics are unique...it's just a good uplifting album with love songs and stories..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good emotions","review":"I'm a Coldplay fan since the appereance of this album! I think this one has something more charming than A rush of blood to the head, more indie, less spectacular, calm and relaxing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy Me!","review":"The reviewers who are dissatisfied with this album aren't really explaining their aversion to it, and I choose to belive that they're simply uncomfortable with its deeply moving, juicy, and gut-wrenchingly amazing aspects. Of course, it is still pop-music, but therefore you shouldn't expect it to be the most intelligent and complex art, right? I mean, it is in its own way.Someone mentioned that this album is \\"human\\" and they were right; the lyrics and music labor to penetrate all audiences and those of you who are unaffected I believe are in the minority. This album is worth buying in every way.And one more thing, if you're deciding between this album and \\"a rush of blood...,\\" choose this one.peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depressing, yet uplifting...","review":"Coldplay manages this and more in their debut album, Parachutes. Lightly strummed acoustic guitars and lightly pinged symbols accompany the soft beautifully sung vocals turns Parachutes into an almost orchestral album, with all instruments working together to support the cause. As so many young, talented artists such as John Mayer have sold out their music to MTV on their debuts , Coldplay remains true to form. Highlights of this album include Everything's Not Lost, and Trouble. This music is perhaps universal as I listened to primarily jazz before buying this album. Buy Parachutes, you won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing Comparisons","review":"While comparisons among bands/singers can be misleading, I believe a few comparisons are in order. I thoroughly enjoy Coldplay's Parachute CD (and will leave it to other reviews to describe) but a few minutes into the CD I determined that several bands, unmentioned by knowledgable critics, must have had a hand in helping create Coldplay's sound. Early Catherine Wheel and, more importantly, late Talk Talk. If you like either, you will find Cold Play rewarding...If you appreciate Coldplay and have never heard of Talk Talk or Catherine Wheel, you have some CDs to buy and some wonderous music to experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Travis, only slightly...similar...","review":"Hmm...You can't help but feel there's a fair bit of The Man Who'ness about this album. But where Travis' effort hangs completely on the hits (Driftwood et al.) with the rest of the album featuring great swathes of guitar pop so inefectual it could barely concuss a badger, this forges a more cohesive direction.It's sad, but realistically it's a four star album 90% of you USA-oids will never listen to. I don't think you'll be missing that much however... try sticking the Travis album on again and set your CD player to cycle round the decent songs. You'll get the flavour."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this one...","review":"I brought the album on the strength of the single Yellow, which is truely fantastic. The first time I played it, I thought I'd made a mistake. But after a few more plays, it has really grown on me. There are some particularly good melodies, (We Never Change is excellent), and it is constantly on in my car at the moment.I'd recommend it, but don't be put off first listen, give it a few goes in the CD player before you make up your mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solid","review":"A good album and a deserved mercury nominee, not as outlandish as radiohead or bubbly as travis but quite good nevertheless. whatever about \\"Yellow\\", \\"trouble\\" for me is the standout track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a bunch of words put together.","review":"Most of the songs on this album sound like a bunch of words put together to fill up space. Take for example, the hit song 'Yellow'. \\"I wrote a song for you, and its called Yellow.\\" What the heck is that supposed to mean? Most of the songs are dreary and lifeless. Just because the lead singer sounds like he is in pain, doesn't mean that he is. Just listen to the lyrics and you'll realize how silly the songs are."},{"rating":"1","title":"COLDPLAY IS A CLONE","review":"Is it just me or does Coldplay remind you just a little bit too much of Travis? The only reason I gave this album 2 stars is because there is only 2 good songs on it 1-Don't Panic, 2-Yellow, the rest of the album is just pretty much filler. There was so much hype surrounding the release of Parachutes that I just had to go out and see what all this commotion was about for myself. Also forget all those comparisons being made to Radiohead, Coldplay is not even remotely close to being mentioned in the same breath as Radiohead. If you are looking for something to tide you over until some new Travis material arrives then I suggest this album. Otherwise don't bother, this is a very unoriginal and sappy album, I hope that Coldplay one day find there own identity and sound and then maybe, just maybe you could mention them in the same sentence with the likes of Radiohead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a new singer.....please!!!!!","review":"The songs are good, the music well done and the lyrics are cool. BUT....this guy has to be the absolute worst singer I have EVER heard! I really tried to listen to all the songs, and tried to like it. I just couldn't get past his completely tone-deaf voice. He reminds me of a bad karaoke singer. Do yourself a favor and avoid this bad attempt at singing if you can, and wait for them to hire someone that can hit a note."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't really know...","review":"I like Chris Martin's vocals, which is probably the most impressive part of the album. but the rest sucks... All of the songs are the same, lame and uninteresting. Yellow is a cute song, and shivers is pretty good but thats all. It's cute but I don't think that these guys deserve to be the biggest band in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for the uninspired","review":"If you're one of those people who thinks The Bends is a better album than Kid A (hint: it ain't) then you're going to love this. Nice, inoffensive, catchy pop rock at it's most.. well... NICE. There's approximately a trillion (give or take a few million) bands who do this sort of thing much better, but Coldplay get the hype, so Coldplay get the sales. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"is that the fave band of Justin timberlake?","review":"is that the fave band of him? the band has already to take a pause for one year until 2005! because not only the lead singer gets married but he worries that the fans will be getting bored with them all.PS: that's why the dino hard rocking bands like Zeppelin, deep purple, uriah heep, sabbath who are still able to continue their golden ages since the last 33 years, and the fans are still loving them until today. But the new youngster like Coldplay?? they just started their career for 3 years ago?? and they want to stop now?? it is a wonderful shame!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dave Matthews Rip Off!!!","review":"What a sham. Isn't anyone original anymore? Coldplay is just another cookie cutter mainstream wannabe. The lead singer's embarrassing attempt to emulate his vocals from Dave Matthews immediately tells me that this band lacks the guts to create anything original and progressive... If you're still looking to buy this album, wait two months since this last Coldplay \\"gem\\" is headed straight for the bargain bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music is OK but lyrics are horrible.","review":"I have listened to this album about 5 times now and I don't think I can listen to it anymore. This band has about the dumbest, most trite, awful lyrics I've ever heard. Dave Matthews has better lyrics, and theirs don't even make sense half the time.Here are some sample lyrics from \\"Yellow\\":I came alongI wrote a song for youAnd all the things you doAnd it was called yellowWow, very deep. The song was called Yellow? OH MY GOD, that's the same name as this song? Holy crap. He should have called the song Bellow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Admitedly, I've only heard one song off of this CD.","review":"I've heard the song Yellow many times on the radio. Based on that, here is my impression of Coldplay: They really really REALLY love Pavement.EDITED 8/28/2001:I just heard a second song on the radio, Shiver. Therefore, I must re-write my review: They really really really really REALLY REALLY love Pavement. Just buy Pavement's Slanted & Enchanted instead. You'd be buying the original instead of a facsimile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suprisingly Good","review":"When i started hearing that song \\"Yellow\\" on the radio, which is a cool song, I couldn't help but think \\"oh no just another boring radio friendly brit-rock band,\\" but once i got a hold a of Parachutes and listened to it all the way through I couldn't help but fall in love with it. Parachutes provides little in terms in originality and innovation, but who cares this is just plain old good music that will set you at ease, and I guarantee you that its beats listening to bands like Creed and Godsmack...yikes. Along with the hit \\"Yellow,\\" \\"Dont Panic\\" and \\"Troube\\" are cool songs too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Album","review":"Coldplay's first album \\"Parachutes\\" is a very entertaining and fresh album. It is good to find a group that does not sound like everyone else and can be slow and calm yet not boring. I have listend to it numerous times and it does not repeat itself or get stale, it is entertaing start to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeply affecting and heartfelt","review":"Back in 2000 Colplay managed to release an amazing pop and rock record - amazingly their first . \\" Parachutes \\" stands out from all other recent music releases for having as much feeling as it does . \\" Yellow \\" is the perfect cd-single while the rest of the tracklist , although mostly lo-fi ballads , is undeniably striking . From the melancholic quality of \\" Don't Panic \\" ( \\" All all that i know / there's nothing here to run from ...\\" ) to the tender sadness of \\" High Speed \\" this is first-class songwritting for one's soul searching moments . Ofcourse a basic element behind the group's magic is Chris Martin's bittersweet , beautiful perfomances . For a band as talented and famous as they are , Coldplay have adopted a humble public image and kind manners and they deserve credit for that . They seem to focus only on the important stuff which is creating good music ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary Debut","review":"Coldplay exploded onto the scene in 2000 with one of the most remarkable debut albums of the last few decades. Parachutes grabs you from the very opening chords of 'Don't Panic', and you're immediately hooked. Followed by 'Shiver' which is a dazzling and exhilarating tribute to relationship frustration. Each track on this album is brilliant, from the most rocking moments in 'Shiver', to the melodic nature of 'High Speed', and the bittersweet tones of 'Everything's Not Lost'. It is an album that will have you reeling in amazement, and you will find it difficult to remove from your cd player. A definite must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Half Of The Works","review":"Coldplay, football, and i mean football, 11 players one ball two goals, and manchester united winning, yes this is an Englishman finally telling you that English music is back. Oasis, Radiohead, Ash, Travis, Stereophonics, Pulp.... This being the best album to come out in 2000 period. It just leaps out at you, melancholy, yet deepful. It can brong you up on tracks like shiver, and quickly bring you back down on Don't panic. Yes, it is a rollercoaster that will grab you by the [neck] and bring you once around the block. ALL I CAN SAY IS BUY BUY BUY"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"Parachutes represents quality music with originality. Yes it may be classified as another Oasis band however the distinct feature making this band better than any other indie bands is their sense of musicality. The lead singer Chris Martin is very talented, he has won music competetions as a young child and has thus been dedicated to music. Perhaps the main reason why Coldplay have produced a brilliant album is because they are not playing for money and have infact declined many large offers because they fear it will affect the music they produce. This album can be described as dreamy and beautiful. It is not too imposing and not background music - it is very melow. I would recomend this album to those who enjoy Pink Floyd, Air and The Verve. I would also like to add that the album has been brilliantly recorded (every sound is crystal clear)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfulfilled Potential","review":"With the exception of Yellow, which is a wonderful pop song, I found the album to be an overall disappointment. It is better than a lot of crap in the market. However, the reason why listening to this album is excruciating is that you can hear that they have the potential to put out an excellent album. Unfortunately, they try too hard to tread the thin line between pop and serious music and don't quite pull it off. Most of the songs would have sounded better if they had held back on their guitar flourishes or if they had gone full blast as they did with Yellow.I do look forward to hearing future releases to see if they do meet their potential, but for now I find their debute disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I Listening to the Same Album?","review":"Okay, I know they're the darlings of the alt-pop movement. And, yes, I love Rush of Blood to the Head. In fact, I would call Rush of Blood to be one of pop music's most complete successes. But Coldplay's first album, Parachutes, is a stinker. Thin, derivative and colorless, this is one of the biggest head-scratchers I've ever come across. Granted, Yellow and Trouble are worth owning - so buy the singles. The rest of this cd contains some real forgettable slop. Shiver, while a fan favorite, is not that great a song. Spies is dull. High Speed embarrassing. A major disappointment all the way around. Martin & Co. are lucky they survived long enough to make a second, and markedly better, cd. My copy of Parachutes is already back at my local record store, warming up the bargain bin and selling for five bucks and change. In my opinion? Not even worth that."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am missing the point I guess","review":"I expected more substance from an album with the rave reviews and awards. Instrumental accompaniment is worth 2 stars and honorable mention but simple sing-song melodies with simplistic lyrics don't hold my attention. Comparisons to Radiohead are appropriate because I can't figure out what the attraction is with them either."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it zero stars, I would.","review":"I never buy cd's. Do you know why? You take a big chance on not liking them and then you can't return them. Parachutes is no exception. This is an example of one good song and the rest is filler. After \\"Yellow\\" the rest of the cd is just one long, boring, slow, drone after another. All of the songs sound exactly alike and no. 7 is 20 seconds long. Spend your money on something else. I'm amazed at how good the other reviews are. They must have been written by...or the band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated dirge","review":"I can't believe the hype this clone of where Radiohead WERE is getting. This type of thing is clogging the UK 'alternative' scene with its tame and unemotional whines and passionless vocals, and is probably the main reason most kids listen to Steps or Craig David over here now, at least those styles have some life to them. Muse, JJ72 and Coldplay all pale next to true classics by the likes of Nick Drake, and Radiohead themselves. This is so overblown its unlistenable,a nd has nothing at its heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh","review":"Sorry all you hip, fashionable, Colplay fans -- but this CD sucks. It's lackluster, banal, boring, and pretentious.You might like this album if: (1) you're an ultra-sophisticated fratboy (or girl) unwinding after a long night, (2) you're trying to fall asleep, or (3) you're not quite ready to enjoy Radiohead, but \\"Hey! This Coldplay is really cool!\\"Save your money. Try Lamb of God instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not there yet","review":"I wouldn't buy this album just for the fact that it's british pop and I hate it. But, in general there's nothing to this album. It all goes in a straight line. You could consider them beautiful songs but I just find them boring as hell. If he's so depressed as he sounds why doesn't he do us all a favor and jump off a cliff or something? Jeez, get over it. Stop whining and start rocking."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be Kidding!","review":"I read the reviews and then I listened to the samples. If this is \\"great\\" music then I'm a bow-legged octopus. This is boring folk-rock at it's best. I cannot believe what's being passed on as \\"talent\\" nowadays. And to characterize this as \\"perfect\\" is stretching common sense and rationality to their very limits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I cannot say that I have heard an album so soft and \\"fluffy\\" to be called any type of rock. This is Brit pop garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"Yellow alone makes this CD worth buying. Then don't panic (a beautiful song).

Overall a fantastic album."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CD","review":"I love every song on this song, all the songs are so beautiful and touching. Coldplay feels my soul like no other band has ever done before,they make it want to do more in life. I swear I play this cd every day !!! My favorite songs are \\"Don't Panic\\" , \\"Shiver , \\"Everything's Not Lost \\" , \\"Spies\\" and \\"Parachutes\\". This is a must buy cd, you won't regret getting it ."},{"rating":"2","title":"No need for parachutes","review":"There's no need for parachutes with this album, because it absolutely soars. Chris Martin's vocals, slightly reminiscent of Thom Yorke's, has so much depth, from naive to scorned, that all of the songs lyrics of love and love lost ring true instead of coming of cliched or disingenuous. A really solid album that I've been enjoying for quite a while now. Sadly, with the band's growing pop success, I have an overwhelming suspicion that it's only a matter of time before you start hating them due to over-rotations on radio stations. But for now, definitely worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beatiful Debut","review":"In just one CD and ten tracks, Coldplay has proven to be better than Oasis and dozens of other fly-by night Brit bands. The music is touching, because a lot of the songs you could actually relate to. Someone said that Chris actually sounds like a troubled man, not some punk teenybopper-I agree. His vocals aren't exactly high class, but they work on a different, more arty level. Don't Panic is a morsel of a song, with a catchy chorus a nice piano solo. Shiver is a sweeping song, full of big guitars and nice lyrics. The chorus rules as well. Spies is a great song, I love the lyrics and the gentle feel. Sparks is almost silent, purely evident in the chorus when his vocals break in they sound a little loud. Yellow everyone knows this track, is a beautiful, pure love song. The best songs are the first five, but the others rule. Parachutes is better than Radioheads trumped-up Kid A, and a timeless masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything's not lost in the world of music...","review":"This is one of the best and I repeat one of THE best cds I've ever listened to. The lyrics are superb and the voice is amazing. After the coming up the so called pop divas and boy-bands, this tone had disappeared from the world of music for a while. The songs like Spies..Trouble..Yellow..Shiver..High Speed..I could actually name the whole album in that matters..that the music is going to draw you in. Though people tend to think of the music more as depressive in the beginning but they actually portrays ecstasy at the extreme levels.People who were the fans of the band... will love this album, me being one of them!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Parachute rises............ and falls.","review":"I really like this album , I think it is something that you listen to after a hard days work to chill out a bit. After the seventh song you may lose interest because from here all the songs aren't very fetching. However, I suggest that you buy it since it is extremely good from songs 1 to 7 and you will enjoy mellowing out to it. Just don't expect a dance around your room or a head-banging affair."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must have CD","review":"This Cd has so many songs that just rock. All 10 are awsome. If you dont have this CD you should buy it. Yellow, Shiver, and Trouble are just simply the greatest.

I made it to the end of the CD...but really no \\"WOW\\". This is passable music...perhaps best left to the elevator.If you want Alternative Rock to make you go \\"WOW!\\", skip Coldplay, then get \\"Girls Can Tell\\" by SPOON. Each song is melodic, good basic guitar & drums, and unique unto the other songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filler","review":"I honestly do not understand the Coldplay phenomenon. Chris Martin has taken Radiohead's \\"High & Dry\\" off of the Bends album and made an entire sound off of that one song. There is a major difference between being influenced by someone, and making music that is a direct copy of music made 10 years ago. Coldplay is insanely stale, the only reason I gave this album 2 stars rather than 1 is due to the sheer fact that \\"Don't Panic\\" and \\"Trouble\\" are not half bad. The rest of this album grates my nerves. It's a piss-poor attempt to be the next Radiohead, as are the other subsequent albums. As said before, this is Radiohead-Lite."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Album You Can't Buy!","review":"I borrowed this from a friend of mine who, until recently, lived in the UK. I'm very impressed! Radiohead comparisons are inevitable, but I don't mind. I would say that Coldplay is to Radiohead as the Sundays were to the Smiths. A strong correlation exists, but refreshing differences, too. If retailers could get enough stock of this album, it could actually place on the US charts as an import. What a strong message that would be to program managers at so called \\"alternative\\" stations here in the US. Unfortuately, as of the time I'm writing this review, you just can't buy \\"Parachutes\\" anywhere--including here."},{"rating":"2","title":"COLDPLAY IS MY DEFINITION OF GOOD MUSIC","review":"I bought this cd after hearing a rush of blood to the head . I have to say that I didn't thought that this cd could be better that a rush of blood to the head, but it is!.

As time passed i couldnt help but pick out songs that i liked and after a couple years just admited to myself and unfourtunately my friends (who dispise coldplay) that yes, i do like parachutes. Sometimes you just can't control the music you like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable Music!","review":"I bought this CD after hearing only the song \\"Yellow\\". That is a great song, but so are \\"Spies\\", \\"Shiver\\", \\"Trouble\\"... Basically, there is not a song on this CD I do not like. That doesn't happen often, when you buy a disc for one song and end up liking every song on it, which only makes me appreciate this one all the more. They have a fresh, distinct sound, which seems to be carried forward into their new CD \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\". I have only heard \\"Clocks\\" from that one, but I have it on order and can't wait for it to arrive!I also like Sarah MacLachlan, Sheryl Crow, Peter Gabriel, Morcheeba, Train, Creed, MatchBox 20, Natalie Merchant, REM, Enya, and Dido. If you have these tastes in common with me, then ColdPlay is a MUST!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heralding the Arrival of Superstars","review":"Coldplay, simply, is about as close as we're ever going to come to another U2. They don't have quite the social consciousness or lyrical consistency (at least yet), but they have the best singer and the most creative guitarist to bring their music across the pond since the Irish rockers. Direct and poignant without Radiohead's slight tendency towards a condescending tone, Coldplay offers a varied musical landscape rife with cranking guitars, ringing pianos, gospel choirs and soaring strings in astonishingly effective packages. One never gets the sense that the arrangements are overdone or even close to getting out of hand. The only thing missing from this album is more vocal harmony, but one can see why - what harmonist could ever complement Chris Martin?

This album can't get any better. It's probably the most subtle, simple, and touching Coldplay album. Even though Coldplay's sounds, style, and music hasn't really grown or changed much (hopefully in time they'll be less predictable and more experimental, they have so much potential), there's still so much to like in this album and their other albums. If you appreciate good music, you will like this album.

From the moment the album is placed in the stereo it seems to flow timelessly from great track to great track. Parachutes has a great slow melodic feel to it that can just set you into a really good mood, but on occasion it ups the pace and you find yourself unkowingly bobbing your head and humming in time.I originally owned the regular Parachutes album but I gave it to my girlfriend as I had no money and I needed a good gift for her. A friend of mine knowing I really liked the album found the box set and ordered it for me.The Box set is by far the best album purchase I have made since Pinkfloyds Shine On Box set. The little extras that it contains just serve to make an already complete album brilliant. I would recommend this album to any one who hasn't yet experienced Coldplay or even if you own Parachutes, the singles in the Box set still make it a worthy buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"6 MIXES ALL LISTED HERE:","review":"1.

For the Club department, that is where 20 Fingers and Armand Van Helden come in.

Despite that, I found it an entertaining and captivating adventure. The authors do a great job of showing how easily things can go awry when you put soldiers into an environment for which they've not be adequately trained. Their real-life military experience helps everything remain believable. The political scenarios also draw from current events. The characters remain true to prior books and the action remains fast-paced. I'm not so thrilled about the \\"cliffhanger\\" ending, particularly since it appears to be a case of one large book made into two small ones yet it was good enough that I'll be pre-orderig the next one.

Well not this fan. The \\"oscillating\\" option does nothing but cause the front grill to rotate. The fan stays stationary while its front grill spins and causes the air to change very slightly. Seriously, as an oscillating fan, this thing is a joke.... But as a stationary fan to just sit and blow in one direction this unit is alright. Overall I'm very disappointed as I was looking to buy a wall mountable oscillating fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than I thought","review":"First of all I got this to fit in a backpack and it was much bigger than I thought. I was a little dissapointed at first. Then when I turned it on I noticed how cool the air seemed and how much of a wide area it covers. If you put it close to you, you will feel air on pretty much your entire body if you turn the oscillator on. Not that much power though but enough to say it has replaced another fan I had and that fan has more power. Now I have to find a smaller one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not oscillate it just has a rotating grill","review":"I absolutely needed an oscillating wall mounting fan, and this fan is not that. It's not what I would ever call oscillating as the fan itself does not move back and forth, just the grill rotates. I realize that some consider a grill moving in a circle with \\"fins\\" that direct the air in different directions to be oscillating, but I do not, and think people need to know this before ordering this fan and waiting over a week to receive it. Based on the photos it appears that the fan \\"sweeps\\" back and forth in an oscillating motion like every other fan like it on the market that claims to be oscillating.So, hopefully this vendor lets me return it, as paying $13 for shipping that takes over a week is annoying enough! Now I have to find a fan that will do what I need, and unfortunately it won't look as cool mounted to the wall as this would have."},{"rating":"2","title":"I ignored the obvious \\"flaws\\" but......","review":"I am still pleased with this fan. It's efficient and effective and it's QUIET at all speeds! I like the rotating grill feature (they call it \\"oscillation.\\") - it works really well.What I DON'T LIKE is that it tilts at a 45-degree angle, so once you have it tilted to aim it where you want the air to go, you have to to reposition the entire fan to get it to blow in the desired direction. This is a real PAIN. But as I said, I ignored this flaw when I purchased it. It would be almost perfect if the pivot points for the \\"tilt\\" were at 9:00 and 3:00."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soleus Air Fan","review":"This fan is great!

When I finally recieved it there was a loud ticking sound every time I turned it on. I was very close to returning it, but I decided i'd try to fix the problem myself first. When I took the outer cover off the fan I noticed the blade was about to fall off because the screw was so loose. Upon further inspection I notice that about 90% of the screws that hold the fan together were also loose. Whoever manufactured this did a pis poor job in doing so. My four year old daughter could have done a better job putting this thing together. If I would not have tightened everything up myself the fan surely would have fallen apart in no time. Waste of time and money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Push Much Air Comparatively","review":"Not a bad fan, since it's very quiet, but it achieves that relative silence at the expense of the amount of air pushed (CFM), which I would estimate is about half that of my two other quiet 12 inch table fans. The blade and grille design create a large hole in the middle of the airstream, thus additionally reducing it from even a normal 10 inch fan. Overall if you're looking for maximum air for minimum noise you need a bigger fan, but the problem is that these big QUIET ones are either rare and hard to find, or expensive.I like the regularly designed table fans better as well since 1) with their adjustable heads, one can direct the airstream more easily, and 2) their footprint is smaller. One can, however shave the plastic notch off and remove the back grille which otherwise prevents this fan from rotating downwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just received a defective product","review":"The timer works, the oscillator works, but no air.

With the temperatures already in the low 100's (and it's the end of April), I was really wanting a fan I could mount over my bed.Looks like I'll have to look elsewhere.

I used it for my desk at work, if you have a smallish work area you might want a smaller fan then this. I have had it for about 3 monthes and it has stopped working. This might be partly my fault because there have been times when I would leave work for the night and forget to turn the fan off. All and all I feel like this is not the fan for me because 3 monthes is just too short of a life span for a fan.Just wanted to update my review. This was operator error. It is working again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not an oscillating fan. Disappointing.","review":"It may be a nice fan if you don't need it to oscillate, but it is definitely not an oscillating fan. What they call \\"oscillating\\" is simply a fan grill that spins around quite uselessly. Supposedly it changes the direction of the airflow, but it certainly doesn't give a full 90 degrees of airflow swing. I couldn't tell any difference at all on the angle of the airflow when it was spinning. It's a silly design that needlessly inflates the cost of what is simply a 10\\" stationary fan.

I experienced the annoying ticking of the timer when I first got it and tried it out, but as long as you don't turn that knob, the fan doesn't tick. Some reviewers complained that the fan doesn't really oscillate. The grill rotates counterclockwise and moves the air only a little, not nearly as much as a fan that moves from side to side. I get dizzy if I watch it. $20 is a great price for this awesome little fan. I highly recommend it.

Then with \\"The Whores Hustle and The Hustlers Whore\\" and \\"This is Love\\" added in for good measure with the electrifying guitars and great lyrics.This album is a must-have and Pj Harvey is hugely talented."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart as Ever, But More Accessible","review":"This is my favorite record of last year. More immediate and accessible than its predecessors, it aims for the low hangin fruit and connects masterfully. As always, there's a delta blues uncurrent to her work that's plainly evident here. What's surprising is just how well she's been able to accent her sometimes arid sound by cranking up the guitars and lifting the tempo. This really is a rock record, through and through. The duet with Thom Yorke is gorgeous and literate, the very essence of PJ."},{"rating":"1","title":"A misstep backwards","review":"This is one of those records where fans of early work will say, \\"It's rad, just like her early stuff, dude!\\" After all, she's returned to the same (non-)production team and stripped-down band which created her first two records (which include 'Rid of Me' - one of the most overrated alternative pieces of the 1990s). Unfortunately, the record is a regression in every sense.For those of us who thought P.J. Harvey grew up (musically and lyrically) with 1995's refereshingly schitzophrenic 'To Bring You My Love' and 1998's wonderfully narrative 'Is This Desire' (aided by Flood's superior production), this offering is very disappointing. The dark melodies and tongue-in-cheek quality of her last two records has been supplanted by the dry, monosyllabic rumblings that are all too characteristic of her earlier material."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"PJ Harvey's DRY is one of those raw, brilliant, primal, literate masterpieces, like... nothing else on this earth. You must hear it. I cannot recommend it enough. It will change your life, if you play it loud enough, while driving. It is awe-inspiring.STORIES FROM THE CITY, in contrast, is about as musically appealing as lint on toast. It is the most rudimentary, 4/4, repetitive, dull, dull, and duller, dreary, mess of impossibly dull dreck. It lacks musical imagination. Poly-rhythms are gone in favor of an unchanging 4/4. The lack of variation is inexplicable. Melodies are 2-3 notes, boring as hell, and repeated ad nauseum. This is mad, mad horribleness, and it makes me shake my head. I've tried and tried to see what people like in this and I have failed. Bah."},{"rating":"1","title":"I JUST DON'T GET IT","review":"P.J. Harvey is most defintely one of the most critically praisedartists of the 1990s.It's impossible to read any \\"Best Of The '90s\\" list without seeing one of P.J. Harvey's albums on there.And to a \\"Rolling Stone\\" editor,she's probably a goddess.Now I will say that I did like the single \\"Rid Of Me\\" but I just don't see how she gets all that praise.Look,I listened to this album and my eyes started glazing over.I listen to EVERYTHING.And I love good,emotion-filled music that P.J.'s music is touted to be but I listened and I just don't see anything worthwhile.Maybe I'm missing something.If I am,can somewhere please tell me..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not really under 13. And I don't like this album!","review":"Okay, anyways, this CD is boring. I mean, where else can you get interesting rock music besides PJ Harvey? Hundreds of bands! Bands that push the limits and don't just rehash tired guitar parts and boring melodies. The only reason that it gets 2 stars is that the lyrics are decent. The only reason this CD may be useful is as a token girl CD. And there are plenty better girl groups to listen to - Sleater-Kinney, the Breeders, Sheryl Crow, X-Ray Spex, etc. This is boring music for boring people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its the real thing","review":"I get tired of hearing about so called soulful rock singers. The ones with voices that are supposed to move you like B Holiday, N Simone, etc. or so the critics say. Well I often end up with sugar pop girl albums I return or just never play. When I buy a grown woman's CD I want to her a real woman's voice, OK? Not some little whiney chick.SO if you like that sugary pop stuff. Don't buy this CD. Cause Ms Harvey can SS-sing. Capital S ok? With Soul capital S again. Take it from a true soul sista who when she is not listening to Ms Harvey is listening to Sarah V., Billie, Nina et al. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perspective from a Teenage Boy","review":"I have been waiting to actually pick up this CD for a little over year, and still have not untill yesterday. And I am so sorry that I just didn't buy it ASAP. This CD is amazing !! I dont know how much more I can express how excellent this CD is. And I love the fact, that it revolves around New York (which I love). Every song on this album is beautifully written and is quite refreshing to listen to. If you love PJ Harvey, and you dont have this CD. Buy it Now !! This album totally blew me away, and has made my 4 Top CD's I own list. Go get it, and blast the volume on each track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Come On! Are you kidding?","review":"I love PJ Harvey! I have a shrine to her next to all her albums. I've never been disspointed by PJ Harvey, but I can not endorse this album. For someone who made so many waves with her raw style and piercing lyrics before I have to wonder: Is she trying to sound like Patti Smith on purpose? I would never have accused her of being cliched before but the lyrics on this album are as mature as a 7th grader taking their first creative writing class. Yikes! Polly did you sell out?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A2,PJ?","review":"I write this review after giving PJ's latest a month's worth of listens.Some songs, such as Good Fortune and The Whore's Hustle..., have such a nice cute flavor of Patti Smyth packed inside that it makes me ill (don't get me wrong, I like Patti's work quiet a bit, just not so unrefreshingly repackaged). Others, such as the duet with Radiohead's vocalist, have lyrical content so cliched and predictable they feel more atuned to a boy band album than PJ. It makes me wonder if these two musicians really had any desire to work together at all, or if this was just a science project gone awry cooked up by one of the top brass at Island.\\"Is This Desire?\\" left PJ, to her credit, in a place almost impossibly high to work from (my favorite album from 1998 hands down) - but I guess I had hoped to hear her work continue to break off into new directions, and not take me through the beaten path."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark and mysterious","review":"This album is my introduction to PJ Harvey. I must say it's great work even though some people say it's more polished than her earlier albums. I'm sure my opinion about this album will change once I listen to her older albums (I may like them better, who knows) but for now I am content with this. Standouts include 'Big Exit' (which includes one of my favorite lines 'This world's crazy, give me the gun!') the optimistic 'Good Fortune', the unique 'The Whore's Hustle And The Hustlers Whore', the crazy 'Kamikaze', and my favorite 'This Is Love'. If you are looking for a female songwriter/singer/guitarist that is a cut above the mainstream then PJ is your choice. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"stories","review":"PJ Harvey takes the world by the balls on this album and proves why she's a standard of excellence. this woman takes her songs and shoves them into your face and into your head. the energy of the songs are unbelievable and come through perfectly forcing you to think and feel on those levels you'd like to ignore. its been too long since we've gotten a raw, experience driven album from a female artist. PJ's new album will be a welcome addition to anyone wanting strong passionate songs from her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Of course it's different","review":"Reviewing P.J. Harvey's works by comparing them to earlier releases is next to impossible. She is always reinventing herself. This album is no exception. Though Is This Desire? is my favorite, Stories...is a close runner up. The tone is moody and consistant. Like always, the lyrics are introspective and pure poetry. While this album is a little more mainstream, and little more radio friendly, it is still completely original. The first single, Good Fortune might even make it onto top 40. Not that mainstream popularity is any measure of success, it would be nice for her to be heard by a larger audience. A must have for any PJ fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CREATIVE ROCK MUSIC, WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT?","review":"P.J. Harvey does a nice job at a variety of things. She rocks hardcore, but knows when to quiet down. I repect both her guitar work and her vocals. The songs are tight and well written, not to mention genuinly interesting, the rarest of all things in current radio. Her duet with Thom York from Radiohead, \\"This Mess We're In,\\" is a standout, as are \\"Good Fortune,\\" \\"You Said Something,\\" \\"We Float,\\" and \\"Kamikaze.\\" If you saw her perform \\"You Said Something\\" on Letterman and liked it a lot, expect more of the same, but don't be surprised by something different. Polly Jean is a rocker at heart, but she isn't one note by any stretch of the imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected","review":"I decided to buy this cd on a whim when I was standing in Borders staring at it after hearing tons of good things about the album and the artist. I usually have to consider things very carefully before buying a new cd, and it usually turns out that the ones I buy on whims end up being my favorite cds. PJ Harvey's \\"Stories From the City, Stories From the Sea\\" is no exception. I was truly satisfied with this album, although some of the songs are better than others. My favorites were Big Exit, The Whores Hustle and the Hustlers Whore, and We Float. I liked the other songs, but some of them sound the tiniest bit whiney--such as Horses in My Dreams and This Mess We're In. But I do think the album is worth it.... So, inconclusion, I highly recommend this album if you're willing to put upwith a few annoying songs, and definitely get it if you're a long-timefan. This was my first PJ album, and I would readily get another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"pj is one of the most unique artists of our time","review":"Stories was my introduction to PJ's work, and it's one of my favourite records. Some of the tracks don't grab you and may seem slow, but they eventually grow on you. Either way, the tracks that do stand out at first listen are enough to make this album more than worthwile. I wouldn't describe A Place Called Home as \\"catchy\\". I think this is one of the most beautiful songs to have been made in quite some time, and if you're reeled in right away, it has more to do with it's poignancy.I also think the word \\"happy\\" doesn't quite describe the album. Stories is more about taking urban decadence and making the best of it. In a way, PJ's music, as \\"dark\\" as it has alway been, oftentimes carries an element of fun. Try singing This Is Love while you shower. Isn't it a blast?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Polly, my muse","review":"This album is wonderful...PJ's voice will seduce you and blow you away--sometimes simultaneously! My favorites: \\"Beautiful Feeling\\"--This track makes me feel as though I'm being serenaded in PJ's arms and completely lost in another world. \\"The Whores Hustle and The Hustlers Whore\\"--A powerful, beautiful, rock groove and that whoop she lets out after the line \\"Speak to me of your inner peace\\" gives me goosebumps. \\"Kamikaze\\"--Who says girls can't rock? This is one of the best rock blasts I have ever heard by anyone, anytime. Oh, and the lyrics are nothing short of mind-blowing: \\"10,000 willing pilots flying/Interfacing space and beyond.\\"Buy this CD today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"I have liked everything that Pj has ever done. but this? this is schmaltz. Some people have said that it's her most accecible as if that's a good thing. accesibility on records generally means that the writer wasn't trying hard enough, that this music isn't anything you havn't heard before. very true with this album. this stuff is hardly original, hardly deep. Now, i won't blame Harvey for being happy, you can't hold that against her. But i will blame her for not trying. There is no depth here, especially in the production which is sqeaky clean and edgeless. This album bored me. Two stars because of the song horses. not a bad one. and the tom yorke songs come kinda close to being good. the last song is horrid, fluffy, cheesy you name it. SOrry Pj, i do feel bad giving this a bad review, but it wasn't that long ago that your albums were works of art...what happened?"},{"rating":"2","title":"She Floats","review":"PJ Harvey's songs can occasionally tend to be on the bland and repetitive side, but this album stands up very well to repeated listening, revealing a low-key acerbic insight beneath the standard rock presentation. And it sounds like the duet with Thom Yorke has done her musical ambitions the power of good, as Ms Harvey now confidently breaks away from her traditionally punctuated vocal style and allows her voice to soar in a spirit of melodic abandon (showcased beautifully on the sublime \\"We Float\\"). Mick Harvey's production job may have had a lot to do with these changes, but it definitely sounds like PJ is discovering a whole new side to her musical persona."},{"rating":"2","title":"i want to marry her","review":"i cant stop listening to this album. it is truly a rock masterpiece. sure it sounds like patti smith a bit but polly is still in her own league. i like this so much cause its very straight forward and you dont have to get used to it and you wont get tired of it, i loved it the first time i heard it. is this desire is extremely suttle and complex and it took me a while to love that one. but this just takes off from start and never loses its way. oh i think im in love with you polly jean. love this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Warning to anyone who hasn't heard PJ Harvey before: don't start with this album. You won't continue on to her others, and that would be a shame! This album lacks all of her originality, ferociousness, and passion - it has heart, but it's of the Sarah McLaughlin-type heart - a wee placid and boring. Anyone could have made this album and written these songs. It has its moments (the duet w/ Thom Yorke, and \\"We Float\\"), but it doesnt have enough of these moments. Buy \\"To Bring You My Love\\" instead, and see what she is really capable of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Polly's first grown-up album?","review":"This may be remembered as Polly Harvey's coming-of-age album. I love everything she's done and have admired her cajones since I first heard \\"50 Ft Queenie\\" way back when, but this new album is a real turning point. After dabbling in garage rock (\\"Dry\\"), grunge rock (\\"Rid of Me\\"), electronica (\\"Is This Desire?\\"), and everthing else (\\"To Bring You My Love\\"), she's ditched the studio musicians and uber-producers (i.e. Flood and Steve Albini), and made a wonderfully understated rock-and-roll album that's all her. Get it (along with all her other ones)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If it's not Scottish it's ... well, you know.","review":"There's definitely some Beatles coursing through the veins of Pilot, but the influence I recognized (and really enjoyed) was Queen. Check out the guitar licks in Magic. This is the kind of high-octane pop from the 70s that could only be the result of 3 boys from Scotland. (Especially endearing is when the brogue breaks through, like in Canada or Just a Smile.) If you want a CD that exists simply for the purpose of making you feel good, this is the one. If you are a product of the 70s (the NINETEEN 70s) like me, then this CD will feel like an old Scottish friend who sings charming pop songs to you. Oh Oh Oh, It's Magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than \\"Magic\\"","review":"Catchy, Catchy, Catchy tunes. Sure the lyrics are simple...sometimes downright silly(see \\"Auntie Iris\\") BUT you'll never find a 70s band with songs with more hooks. Also, David Patons vocals are so unique and very captivating.Not only do you get all of the fingersnappin' gems from Pilots first album, this special release includes 3 songs from \\"Second Flight\\" and 2 from \\"Morin Heights\\" their only other US releases. Both recommended if you can find them!Obviously the group was tremendously influenced by the Beatles but there is certainly nothing wrong with that! Especially when you pull it off the way these guys did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing power-pop from a sadly-forgotten band","review":"Perhaps the most underrated band ever, Pilot played a great mix of powerpop with falsettoed lyrics, blazing guitar harmonies, and those great handclaps. Get into them, you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Remakes of Scottish band's major hit and follow-up","review":"The Scottish band Pilot had one memorable U.S. hit: 1975's \\"Magic.\\" Their follow-up, \\"January\\" was a success in the UK, but stalled at the bottom of the American chart. Thistwo-song MP3 collectionby Purple Pyramid (not to be confused with theCDby Collectables, which has been incorrectly cross-linked in the Amazon catalog) may feature the original lead vocalist, but these are not the original hit recordings. Don't be fooled by the vintage \\"Dynamic Stereo\\" banner, which itself predates these mid-70s hits by fifteen or twenty years. If you want the original hits, you can find them on the legitimate reissues of the band's first two albumsFrom the Album of the Same NameandSecond Flight, or on their compilationA's B's & Rarities.

I thought the characters were well developed even though the scenario really wasn't plausible. I liked the way the selfishness, fear and greed of some characters was portrayed along with all their frailties. The counterpoints were the goodness of the hero and heroine who worked together to land the aircraft, even though they were being thwarted at every turn by those on the ground.I found the book hard to put down"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I generally enjoy DeMille's books a lot, especially Gold Coast, Gatehouse and the Plum Island.

The story was compelling and kept my attention (although I did skim over some of the overly technical stuff). My one complaint about the story was that the main characters should have been more expressive and likeable. I found it to be a major waste that there was very little interest with the character Linda (the 13 year old girl). There was great potential to beef up the story with the likeability factor, especially with the survivors on the plane.So, while I couldn't go with 5 stars on this book, I would have liked to give it 4.5 because I think it is definitely worth reading.

I felt all the emotions the authors wanted you to feel- I also felt that the plot twisted and turned like a roller coaster ride! These poor people surviving on this plane had so much against them.

Maybe the problem is that it was co-written; it's pretty hard to come up with a good result with this process. Whatever the cause, the writing is clumsy and self-conscious. The initial descriptions (the 'set-up') go into too much dry technical detail; it often feels like the start of a science-fiction story where the author feels compelled to explain all the high-tech magic so we earthlings will be able to understand what's going on.

It got progressively worse, but since I don't play that many dvdrs, I did nothing. When it locked up on the Talking Heads dual discs I sent it back for repair. I received a refurbished unit with 'b-stock' stickers on the box and on the back of the unit. It is playing dvdrs better, but still no luck with the Talking Heads. Surveying the net there seems to be some major build quality issues with this unit, in addition to it's faulty firmware. Since there is no updated firmware, it is likely that some future DVD-A and/or dual disc releases will also fail to play on this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all costs","review":"I was drawn to this unit because it plays everything (including both DVD-audio and SACD formats) and is a five disc changer. Unfortunately, the unit is very slow to respond to commands, especially loading the discs and opening the tray. Moreover, the tray doesn't rotate or come out all the way, so it is very difficult to access the back two discs. More importantly, two units have failed on me (stopped responding to commands altogether) after a couple of weeks. I have had to send both units back to the distributor full of CDs/DVDs.

Once again he put on an awesome show.He has a soothing and unique style of music, and his goofy stage humor and side jokes entertain the audience rolling with laughter.

This particular time machine had the effect of causing Spock to act as Vulcans would have in their warlike past before Surak's philosophy of logic would spread: he ate meat, showed no shame for emotions, and fell in love with Zarabeth a woman whom he ultimately had to leave behind.Two years later, Spock is shocked to discover that Zarabeth give birth to his son, Zar. He uses the Guardian of Forever to bring Zar forward in time, as tradition dictates that he must teach his son the Vulcan mental disciplines and culture so that he may be accepted into the family. But can Zar accept his father for who he really is before the Romulans discover the secrets of the Guardian and serious consequences arise for the course of history?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Epic in its own right!","review":"A.C.Crispin's first novel ever, published in 1983 by Pocket was an instant New York Times best seller.

It's paced well, though the usage of 'tapes' along with computers slightly distracts. Still the story isn't harmed by the dissonance in technological advancement, and I enjoyed how it unfolded.This book is the first stories of Telzey Amberdon, but you would be better served in buying the book \\"Telzey Amberdon\\" edited and compiled by Eric Flint, which contains this entire volume along with additional stories.

Whoever J.Wagner is, he must have stock in the company and I'm sorry I based my purchase on his 'glowing' review. The box clearly states: MADE IN CHINA. The photo here on Amazon & on the box makes the fan appear of higher quality than it is. The fan unit is plastic and cheesy looking! It's certainly not a quality fan.

And a remote control is a luxury when you are too hot to move.IMHO the sole design fault is the LCD display which is too small to read farther than two feet away.However,when I opened the shipping box, a strong chemical smell overwhelmed me, causing a headache - and I am not chemically sensitive!

Desperate Housewives is a boring, bland show compared to the excitement Dallas offers viewers. I don't mean to knock DH, it's a good show, but compared to Dallas, it's nothing. Dallas offers everything guilty pleasure you could want. And season 3 is one of it's best seasons - the Who Shot JR finale which redefined television forever, the love triangles, the manipulation, the jealously etc - all is so engrossing and tantalizing.

It gave me my fix on deep, thoughtful, and complex music with real melody, irony, and a metalic edge where it fits. There is a hint of Pain of Salvation influence to some extent, but that is ok as I love those guys too.....This album never lets you down. Not every track is perfect, but it is truly satisfying and original. I love the balance of keyboards and guitars, with hard hitting drums, and really interesting melodies.A great new band that is contributing to the depth of progressive rock with originality. If you like Symphony X, then give these guys a listen. Tremendous balance and sogwriting skills. Can't wait for the next one!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This singer can NOT be the future of this band","review":"David Fremberg is meant to be singing live on stage - the acting stage. It's a very emotional voice, able to contrive a whole range of feeling. Unfortunately, Fremberg is unable to display a range of *melody*. It's amazing how quickly these songs just die, because on any given track, David sings only 5 or 6 different notes. Songs stop becoming songs as soon as he enters - they morph into \\"displays\\".And I don't know about you, but I just hated it, every quiver and rasp. II = I ends up sounding like a quirky off-Broadway soundtrack, rather than an experimental rock band. This isn't music, it's a musical.If that's what you want for your band, Johan, more power to you. But if you wake up one morning and realize that Fremberg is the wrong guy for the job, you'll probably find more than one fan (and probably even fellow band member) that feels the same.Till he's gone, I'm not buying any more CDs - I should have stopped at EOTW."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book","review":"Very glad I purchased this book and I look forward to someday visiting some of the locations mentioned in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A blast, but with one major flaw","review":"This book is great from start to finish -- provides locations and history for all kinds of disparate pop culture stuff. The one major problem with the book is that the writer desperately needs a copy editor. He mixes up some details and spells names, places and titles wrong all over the place. There are points where he spells the same person's name two or three different ways on one page. Considering all the research he seems to have done, this is kind of bonehead stuff. Still, if you can look past that, this book is a lot of fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong","review":"As a professional historian (Honours, MA, PhD) I can only say this book is wrong on so many counts it should never have been published.

The new notoriety is due largely to Chyler landing a high profile role as a cast member of the popular TV show Grey's Anatomy.Really no difference from the original that I can tell (no added footage nor bonus features) but the video quality is noticeably better, though still not great for a DVD. The often embarrassing B-movie (Chyler won't even put it on her resume) deserves 1 star, but gave it 2 for the improvement in video quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Edited Version of Kickboxing Academy","review":"While as the previous reviewer mentioned, the video quality is better, this re-packaged version of Kickboxing Academy has also been inexplicably edited, losing at least one hilarious scene.

The body is now far ahead with no hope for the voice to catch up with it. I am forced to coordinate with the image and disregard the comment; but if i had the ability of doing the routines without following the voice AND the video i would not need this dvd.Or maybe it's just my copy, but note that i have tried it on both my dvd player and my computer.

There's no flow to the workouts. The workout sequences are spliced together so that one pose ends before another frame begins.For example, there's one routine where you lie on your back, hold a belt stretched between both hands,pull it over your head, stretch, and then pull it back over to the starting position. That's it. The sequence ends and the next pose queues up and begins.A lot of the poses are good, but there is no flow to the routine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just in case there's any doubt...","review":"...let me reiterate that this is just a mess.

The ballads are nothing new -- they are all the same, over all 15 years. Avec Toi has whole sections practically lifted off the Rouge et Noir, off Alone, lyrics and notes both. Same problem with Cosmic Girl, aka Taxi Girl. Granted, the earlier version has been improved on, still it's a bit annoying. Unlike the previous effort, which was rather weak, this one has several of great songs -- No Face, No Name, No Number is by far the best, since finally they managed to create something that's not instantly recognizable. Time is On My Side, After the Love is Gone are the other highlights. The rest of the album is pretty much even -- no big surprises, but very few disappointments, which is always a good thing.

Edwin Prevost examines and explains what is generally considered invisible and inexplicable - the deeper implications (musical, cultural, and social) of improvising, of what it means to make music. Well-written and well-reasoned, this is the only book of its kind I have come across. In some future decade this may prove to be a turning point in how we think of music (equivalent in a way to 4'33\\", Pierrot Lunaire, and Free Jazz), a step taken when the \\"avant-garde\\" stopped seeing itself as a reactive entity and became a pro-active one instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner!","review":"I totally agree with the other reviewers!

It took me a month to read it when I usually read her books it a 3-5 hour session.

Ellis and Isabel make a great couple and the secondary characters such as her sister and brother-in-law and their side story are also very entertaining.I wish the other reviewers would not tell so much of the story!!

However, the dreaming aspect of it was complete gibberish and hard to understand. The characters were typical JAK (fiesty heroine/dominant hero). The ending was a complete surprise and partly redeemed the mass confusion of the rest of the novel. The reviewers who claim this is her best novel yet need to re-read Truth or Dare and it's sequel or any her Jayne Castle books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I do not understand how all the reviews above say this is one of her best books....unless they all read the Jayne Castle books. I have not. I have read all of Jayne Krentz books and I have enjoyed every one. This one spent too much time in a fantasy dream world. Usually she has some type of fantasy, but the characters are usually better and the story is usually easy to follow. I did not care about any of this story's characters or about all the level five dreaming. In her last book there was some paranormal stuff but she explained it quickly and then the story moved on. In this one she constantly has to tell more about the level five stuff.....and it was very tedious.The end was good though, I did not expect the who dun it person. She weaved that quite well."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title's the only good thing about this book","review":"I typically enjoy this author's work - so this was a major disappointment!

Enter Ellis Cutler who has been sent from a super secret government agency to recruit Isobel. The two team up to find the rogue agent who is trying to take over the agency.Usually with a Krentz book I am wrapped into it from the beginning sentences, not so with this one. But eventually I was enthusiastically reading to find out who the bad guy was. This reminds me more of a Jayne Castle book than a Krentz book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable light mystery romance","review":"In Falling Awake, Jayne Ann Krentz is again off on an exploration of paranormal talents, with a very likable heroine and hero and a number of plot twists, turns, and subplots. Also a cute curmudgeon of a cat.The science background on sleep and dream research seems solid, except for a lapse on the question of whether cats dream. Considering that a lot of the basic sleep research has been done on cats, it seems surprising that Krentz would imply that the question is unresolved and mention only Freudian and Jungian theories in speculating on it. Anyone who has watched a cat sleeping has no doubt that they do indeed dream, and in lab experiments they exhibit REM episodes similar to those in humans during dreaming. In Jouvet's classic experiments, when the inhibition of muscle action during sleep was removed, cats were observed to stalk prey, attack enemies, and exhibit other typical cat behaviors during periods of REM sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreaming","review":"I was dreaming to even read this book! This is not the usual read for me. I was caught by the title. I had used dream analysis with the help of a Jungian therapist and thought this book would be similar. It is not! I never did figure out what the levels in the book represented or did. There was no suspense to the drama. It went as predicted and all the characters opened up and told everything. Police work would be a lot simpler if real crimnals did the same thing! The main characters were perfect.

After having endured and zapped countless, boring Cinemax-like erotic thrillers, it was great to see one that is extremely sexy, intelligent, witty and fun. Jaime Pressly is absolutely stunning as the girl out to avenge her mother. Her performance is also outstanding, a great balancing act between being a teenager, a femme fatale, but all this done in a tongue in cheek way. By the way, her nude scenes are jaw dropping.The movie also has fun with itself, playing with many of the genre's clichés. All in all, a great surprise.The DVD contains the R-rated and unrated versions, as if anybody would want to see an R-rated version. It contains no extras.

What's more, the authors would have us believing that 80% of Star Fleet is Jewish, Arab, or is intimate with Jewish customs. Enough already!

At the begining of chapter fourteen is written \\"...and that traitor of a Vulcan--a paranoid schizophrenic, assuming McCoy could even apply that diagnosis to Vulcans..\\" (165)It is the height of misinformation to charecterize this villian as \\"a paranoid scizophrenic\\". This charecter has a particular madness reserved for totalitarian dictators and cult leaders and is nothing at all like paranoid schizophrenia.Sered is cruel and in league with the Romulans. Paranoid schizophrenics are mostly gentle, and don't even trust their families--never mind Romulans.

This is essential to any fan of Spock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but needs some additions.","review":"I loved this book the first time I read it, but the second time it was a little slow.

So, upon receiving this book as a gift I was skeptical, to whether or not I should actually read it. I took a chance and enjoyed every page of it. Unlike other Trek books which, seem like the authors are trying to out do previous Trek authors by who knows the most details to respective series, this book weaves an two interesting stories, about Spock that helps any fan of Trek to better understand everyones favorite first officer"},{"rating":"1","title":"A 'not very exciting' Star Trek novel","review":"I just couldn't get into this book, as for the most part it was so boring. The superb characterisations were almost a redeeming feature, namely Spock, Uhura and Captain David Rabin, but that alone does not make for exciting reading. Some interesting set pieces. Commander Uhura left in charge of the USS Intrepid goes up against a Klingon ship. There is some insight into Spock's background but it was far from engrossing and left you gasping for some in depth anecdotes about his Starfleet Academy years and not about his sketchy reasons for joining Starfleet. There's his well established prickly relationship with his father Sarek but there was little else of interest. David Rabin's suggestion of Starfleet as a career not withstanding.I'm sorry we've yet to see the definitive Spock novel, this is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable historical atlas; couldn't be better","review":"This is an amazing atlas presenting in-depth covering of the long and turbulent history of Armenia. There are numerous publications on Armenian history, but they either contain plain maps, or plan text. This one not only presents an enormous number of extremely valuable and rare historical maps covering about three thousand years' history, but also presents in a very reader-friendly style unbiased historical facts associated with every single map. More than that, it presents invaluable statistical information, such as the population by regions. It also presents very intriguing architectural data. One of invaluable features of the book is the coverage of the Armenian genocide and the first republic.This is more than a book - it is a great treasure that anyone interested in history in general and Armenian history in particular MUST have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, some answers that make sense.","review":"Kudos to the authors (and shame on those who are addicted to denial and zero-think debunking).The type of intelligence operation documented in the book was common in the Cold War, and no one would blink an eye if they were told the KGB or CIA had initiated such an operation. Considering the intelligence and special operations backgrounds of some of the Priory characters, their use of such techniques is practically predictable. But it took Picknett and Prince to recognize the pattern.There are still odd aspects to the interweaved threads of the Priory, the Rennes-le-Chateau mystery, and the Merovingian Legends (such as the book by Jules Vernes), and plenty to speculate about. But as far as what the Priory really is ... the book is well worth the read to answer that question. And yes, it is not a simple answer. But then, reality is often far more complex than we give it credit for."},{"rating":"1","title":"endless facts, sources, and names.......but it all goes nowhere","review":"I enjoyed reading the book at first, but after about 75 pages I simply couldn't stand it anymore. Maybe I just didn't know enough before picking up the book, but I was completely lost in the deluge of names, titles, and politics of France. I skipped far ahead in the book and it still seemed to lead nowhere. Eventually I skipped to the end...even that seemed uneventful.Now if your obsessive about French politics and Pierre Plantard you might feel like your in heaven when you read this, it just didn't work out that well for me.Also noticeable was a nearly complete lack of maps, photos, or graphics. These would have broken the book up nicely and provided a break from the endless amount of teasing, yet ultimatly non-connecting facts and names.If possible, you might want to pre-read a few of the pages if they are available on amazon. It might give you an idea of how the book is structured throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost.","review":"I am afraid that I don't get this book. It seems to be material moulded to fit the preconceptions or the aims of the authors. The writing style is dense, but the story just didn't make me want to finish it, not matter how hard I tried.For me it just seemed to be faction, rather than facts, mixed with what the authors wanted the story to be. I can only hope for more actual source material, because for me it is an interesting story and I am sure there must be more to it than what these authors make it out to be. I am giving it 2 stars, because there were a few tidbits which I was able to use as the basis for further research of my own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picknett & Prince \\"protesteth too much\\"","review":"Picknett & Prince have produced, in The Sion Revelation, another item in the debunking of Pierre Plantard genre that fails to conclude a convincing argument. Indeed, The Sion Revelation is no revelation at all, but a blatant attempt to convince the readers that Plantard was a charlatan; however, their arguments against his veracity in the end merely leave one wondering if Pinknett & Prince \\"protesteth too much.\\" At no point do the authors of this droll account consider that Plantard might have been exactly who and what he said he was, and that his disclosure of spurious documents might have covered a hidden aggenda. In the final analysis, however, it is unimportant whether or not Plantard was a charlatan or authentic. What is important is that authors such as Pinknett & Prince do a great disservice to an important topic by utilizing a so-called \\"history\\" to defame a character, rather than to elucidate and inform their unfortunate readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"well researched","review":"The author speakes to the reader. It is well researched and although a controversial subject for many Christians, it is a breath of fresh air. It is about time we took a good look at history and religion.

Itzkoff is, simply, funny, and his book is smart and well-written, and thankfully much more than a rah-rah recounting of life inside Maxim. To be open, I know the author, but knowing him had no impact on the fact that at many times while reading I actually laughed out loud as Itzkoff described his jobs, his life in the NYC publishing world, his family, the painful dating world and those he worked with or for. But for all the criticism he lays on others, Itzkoff saves his harshest comments for himself; it's not self criticism, it's self flagellation. It's also exceedingly honest, and his examination of being a man in this Maximish world is thoughtful and thought-provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thermal cat Cushion","review":"I love the print and not to mention having my bed back from my kitty's.

If you haven't read either of these books I would highly recommend reading \\"A Walk Across America\\" first and then this book that I am writing this review for. Peter's books are very well written, extremely interesting and heart warming to read. I would eventually love to meet Peter and his wife Barbara and discuss in detail the walk being described in these two books.

This one takes the brains and brawn of all our guys, Kirk, Picard, Riker, Data, and the never dying Leonard McCoy in his new suit. I Loved AVENGER. There is enough mystisism and magnetism in the book to equaalize the characters. I know a lot of people tell me that Kirk through William Shatner is the no-option -to- fail, can-do guy with the crooked grin of a thirty year old overachieving schoundrel. I say \\"so whats your point?\\" Anybody who expects anything but the classic Kirk from WWm.Shatner dont know him too well do he? Keep it up sir.

Since I love Spock, it was a treat to read about him again. Besides the fact that I'm tired of Kirk dying and miraculously comin back, this book was amazing. It even touched on one thing few Star Trek books do - the friendship between McCoy and Spock. Vulcan's Forge touched that aspect, and Avenger mentioned it.

I also want to question several points. If Spock was affected by Bendii Syndrome, wouldn't have he want to kill his father's murderer. Don't tell me that the Vulcans have never arrested non-Vulcans. And why would Sarek want to mind-meld with Kirk as father to son.Ashes of Eden was okay. I even found The Return quite good. However, I found Avenger disappointing.

I had heard most of what I was now reading, and since all of the essays were written since 2001, they were mostly fresh in my mind. Not that they weren't interesting, but they simply weren't new.

It does not matter that I preheat the carafe prior to brewing the coffee; it only stays warm for about one hour maximum.

It is the weakest coffee I ever tasted. We actually take the brewed pot of coffee and have to pour it back through again in order to get something close to resembling what we used to get with our $50 Capresso coffee machine.

The lid is really a non-issue for us - tighten it all the way down to brew and after pouring; open it about a third of a turn to pour.It is expensive. And while it works and looks great, I question if it is worth the amount of the premium over competitive products. I'm willing to concede a premium - the amount is what moved this from 5 stars to 4 for me.Two suggestions for the manufacturer - 1) make the mark on the lid somewhat more obvious - different shape - different color and 2) put markings on the inside of the water compartment to mark how many cups (okay this is a very specific personal preference).Over all, if the price isn't going to stop you from buying you will be very happy with the look and performance of this machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"great coffeemaker","review":"This is our third Capresso coffeemaker (in a good number of years).

I am glad we read the previous reviews which indicated it was a very good coffeemaker. So far, it continues to brew the best coffee of the last 4 brands we have owned. Of the problems mentioned in earlier reviews, the only one we experienced, is the dripping problem while pouring a cup of coffee.

Do you try to put 15 gallons of gas in your car's 14.5 gallon tank? This is a 10 cup coffee maker and the gauge on mine is dead on accurate.Difficult to align the carafe - I haven't tried this while totally drunk but otherwise I don't see how you can screw it up.If you appreciate exceptional drip coffee (and you want a timer for early mornings) this is the product to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good coffee... but the machine has issues","review":"I must agree with the others who have reviewed this machine that it does make very good coffee.

Well, it would depend on what you are used to drinking. If Folgers is adequate for your taste and you never go to Starbucks - this machine is a waste of money for you.However, if you frequently go to Starbucks and coffee is a priority in your life - then this machine is well worth it.

We don't use all the bells and whistles available, but it provides simple one-button use. The water is a little difficult to pour in the back because of the narrow front-to-back reservoir.

Though the voice insists you'll get a call back if you leave a message, no one ever returned my call. Likewise, an e-mail I sent got no response from Capresso.My MT-500 continues to hold water in the filter chamber rather than send it through to the coffee pot.

I wish I'd kept that ancient thing.We've had this machine long enough to have gone through all the cycles of ownership: the initial excitement, the first disappointment when the a single coffee ground caused several cups of coffee to flow over the cap and onto the counter, and now the continuing irritation of its inability to brew a full pot.I could live with having to make certain the basket/holder/filter area were spotless with every brewing; I am about to chuck it because it now takes four tries to get my morning carafe of coffee brewed.I'll keep the carafe. Coffee stays hot for hours in it. I just wish the mechanism lived up to the carafe. It would be a four-star machine. As it is, I give it a two."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"After about 6 months of use, this coffee maker quit. I've had Cuisinart grind and brews in the past and didn't want to deal with the messy grounds and cleaning. The Capresso worked great and made a decent cup of coffee for a couple of months, then started slowing down and not brewing all of the water in the water tank. Cleaned it, it worked well again for a couple of months then finally quit. Also, inevitablly whenever the carafe was removed to pour coffee, several remaining drops from the basket would drip on the base. I never had any problems with pouring or temperature as others have reported. I was hoping this coffee maker would last at least 5 years. My husband threw away the box, so I don't have any warrranty info. Any suggestions?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Coffee Quality","review":"The coffee quality is mediocre at best, with a consistently off-taste. I don't know if it's temperature issue or a flow issue, but I get much better tasting coffee from a drip cone. Also, the thermal carafe does a poor job keeping coffee warm. It's barely lukewarm just an hour later. Otherwise, a good looking machine and the timer works fine. None of the overflow problems mentioned by others (except when I've forgotten to put the carafe in place, and that's pure user error). Still, I would absolutely NOT recommend this machine given the very poor coffee quality/price ratio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes great coffee","review":"I've been researching for a long time to buy a good coffee maker as I've been used to the espresso machine all the time. After a lot of research finally decided on buying this one.It took a couple of attempts to make good coffee until i figured to use 3-5 cups option for making strong coffee. Since then, I've been enjoying the great coffee every morning, now I almost don't miss my espresso machine anymore. It's definitely pricey compared to other coffee makers, but it's certainly worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"best cup of coffee","review":"This coffeemaker makes the greatest tasting coffee, even withbasic store brand coffee. The only drawback is that the carafedrips when you are pouring the last few cups, but this is a small price to pay for such great taste. The manufacturer doesclaim this event will occur. We are very pleased with our purchase. It even came in brushed stainless steel to match our appliances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest coffee @ home ever!","review":"We've used auto drip coffee makers for years. 2nd cup always had a bitter taste.

After much searching on Amazon, I decided to purchase the Capresso machine.I'd never heard of this brand, but it had the stainless carafe that I like, and other features I'm used to, and after reading all the reviews from Amazon customers,I felt comfortable about trying this brand.Once again, Amazon customers haven't let me down. The coffeemaker is good looking, works well, and makes great coffee. I'm used to the thermal carafe, so have no problem with opening and closing the top, or overflow.My ONLY wish is that it was a 12 cup pot, but it brews so fast that I just make a second pot.Thanks Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee tepid after an hour","review":"Brews fast and hot, but the coffee cooled off too quickly in the carafe. The outside of the carafe is warm to the touch and coffee was tepid after an hour and room temperature after 2 or 3 hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many design flaws","review":"I would not recommend this coffee maker. Reasons:1. If you use the gold filter and try to make strong coffee, it goes so fast that the coffee does not have time to drain through the grounds and it overflows all over the counter. The company when called said to use paper filters which did fix it but that's not the point.2. The carafe pours too slowly. If you tip it to get a faster pour, it runs back down the carafe outside and on to your foot.3. The valve where the coffee goes into the carafe is always sticking. Then when you remove the carafe it runs coffee all over the hot plate.4. It makes too little coffee for the amount of grounds used. I think this is because it goes so fast you have to use more coffee to get a strong cup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee Regular","review":"The Capresso (a) regularly leaks when pouring cofffee; (b) overflows from time to time; and (c) when you call Capresso for assistance, there is none.

For me, the music has always been kind of bittersweet. Plaintive yet hopeful, it conjures up memories- some real and some imagined. Sort of like discovering a dusty trunk in your attic filled with old family photo albums and seeing the sepia toned images of your parents or grandparents in their youth. Their is a sense of connection and also a sense of loss. Again, this is my own personal interpretation of this beautiful music. This is what I hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"We play this at work--guests love it!","review":"I bought Naked Keys when it first came out.

I could not finish it. After about 130 pages I figured I had better ways to spend my time and put it down. First of all, the interaction between the hero and heroine was almost non-existent while the mother/son interaction was entirely too prominent. Secondly, it seemed like Heyer repeated herself quite a few times in the 100+ pages I did read, and I found myself skimming paragraphs of dialogue that I felt I'd already read.For those reading Heyer for the first time I'd recommend one of her other books, like Sylvester, The Nonesuch, or Frederica. She really is a brilliant author but, in my opinion, this is not one of her better works."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Editing","review":"This is one of Georgette Heyer's finest books-a take of a twin brother forced by his mother's debts and his brother's disappearance into a masquerade. For romance fans-it's a must read... just not on Kindle. The editing is possibly the worst I've ever seen. Paragraphs aren't indented, words are split up willy nilly and there are pages that appear to be one run on sentence. I spent good money on a book that's almost impossible to read in this form.Buy the paperback-not the Kindle version of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Heyer's best","review":"I can't get enough of Georgette Heyer books.

Had False Colours been my very first Heyer book I would never have purchased another. I would have deprived myself of many wonderful hours spent with such great characters so beautifully developed in her other books. If you are reading by Kindle, do get a free sample. If you have any interest after reading the non-stop breathless idiocy that spews forth from the mother of this plot, be certain that you will find much more of the same nonsense throughout the book. This book pales in comparison to her others and makes me wonder if it was actually meant to be a short story."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERRRRRRYYYY SLOW.....","review":"This book was nothing like \\"The Grand Sophy\\".

Georgette Heyer's characters end nearly every sentence in an exclamation point! They don't converse with each other as much as shout to each other! Her characters end up sounding like simpletons!Honestly, the plethora of exclamation points in this book gave me a headache. At one point, I even considered grabbing a bottle of white-out to eliminate them. The time that would be required to obliterate their vast number, however, was prohibitive. Heyer can't hold a candle to Austen, nor to Anya Seton, and while Austen can write humor that is actually laugh-out-loud, Heyer's attempts to be amusing fall flat. I can't imagine picking up another book by Heyer - one was punishment enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Track List","review":"Twenty 4 Seven - Slave To The Music (Germany) / ZYX / 2000Song list:1} Slave To The Music (DJ EFX's Funky Tribalist mix 6:20)2} Slave To The Music (DJ EFX's Bonus a la Pump 3:08)3} Slave To The Music (Tyler's Radio mix 4:03)4} Slave To The Music (Tyler's Club mix 6:19)5} Slave To The Music (Ferry &Gamefski; Club mix 5:02)6} Slave To The Music (Razormaid mix 6:04)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully balanced view of the world.

Most of the history books in English tend to look at the whole world from Western point of view. This book talks about Asia and Pacific Islands in an amazingly fresh and fair manner. There are plenty of pictures to please the eyes. The timeline at the beginning of each chapter is broken into parallel timelines on different continents in the world, which makes it very easy to have a general idea of time and space.

The radiator's thermostat audibly clicks when turning the radiator's heat on and off, but the periodic clicking is not loud. The clicks do not disrupt my sleep.Sadly, the radiator does not put out an adequate amount of heat. In the master bedroom, where the radiator is located, one might get a one or two-degree increase in temperature after operating the radiator for an hour, or more.

The content included barely skims the surface of what needs to be done, then moves on to the next model year.Very frustrating and not worth the money spent.

I really enjoyed the complex portrait of the intriguing Romulan society and government, and the exploration of the concept of Romulan honor. There aren't enough novels in the Trek universe (or television episodes) that really deal in-depth with the Romulans, and this helps fill in the gap. Also, this novel contains one of the most delightful characters in Star Trek literature: Subcommander Ruanek, the impulsive Romulan warrior with the incorruptible sense of honor and Vulcan thirst for knowledge.

Dimmu is up there in my top ten favorite bands of all time, and until now, they were the kings of Symphonic Metal. After all, they are the progenitors of the Symphonic Black Metal sound, and I thought that the dark beauty that was Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropia (their magnum opus) could not be beat. Turns out I was wrong. Septic Flesh has put out one h3ll of an intense album that is a masterful blend of many metal genres; black, death, goth, doom, a wee bit o industrial, and of course, the symphonic element that ties it all together. The production is gorgeously done, and the overall feeling is seriously massive. If you like extreme metal that challenges the \\"established boundaries\\", get this album!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This album was not worth the dig to find it","review":"So this album was supposed to be sooo good and it was nearly impossible to find.

Shortly into Dark Star, Jerry cracks open the void and leads his brethern through some of their most intuitive playing ever. It's all there: the Dead play with passion, color, texture and clarity. It is 23 minutes in a transcendent reality where the listener and the music are the same thing. It is too bad it is the opening cut on the album because the rest of this excellent show pales in comparison to the first 23 minutes of the best Dead zone ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Top-Five Version of \\"Dark Star\\"","review":"Okay, there's not a lot here, but what IS here is a stellar version of \\"Dark Star.\\" Clocking in at over 24 minutes, it bears a strong and spacy resemblance to other versions for the first half but then goes into an up-tempo, funky jam in the second half. I've long been a believer that no \\"Dark Star\\" beats the Live/Dead version, but this one comes mighty close. If you're a fan of this song (and what Dead fan isn't?), then track this down somewhere. Well worth finding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darkstar/jam worth the price of admission!","review":"A short but oh so sweet edition of Dick's picks opens with, in my opinion, a top 5 all time dark star into a tight jam with Jerry leading the way out the gate. Next comes a sugar magnolia that is nothing special. St. Stephen is wonderful at a slower than usual pace and Not Fade Away Into Goin Down the Road feelin bad is awesome. Jerry is on fire during GDTRFB and the Not Fade Away reprise, closing the show out with dynamite. Great Energy and sound this short pick leaves you wanting more but it's also nice that you can give it a quick listen. If you're a fan of the dead, you can't go wrong with this one.

While The Grateful Dead album is a fine collection of songs, it is a little lacking in improvisation.As a deadhead who for years has been trying to justify my obsession to non-dead heads, I have to say that Dick's Picks Vol.2 has always been a dependable standby. First of all, the Dark Star does not have a slow moment. The extended feedback sectionwhich turns many people away isn't here. Secondly, the NFA>Going Down the Road...>NFA is just pure rock and roll. I rank it among the top versions of either song.While this collection is short and the presence of Pigpen and Mickey Hart is missed, I think the quintet format of the band gives them an intensity and focus that is sometimes missing from their shows.A perfect gift for converting the non-believers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible collection of live Dead","review":"One of many incredible live performances by the Grateful Dead.

I have heard he was an Elvis impersonator at one time in his career. When he was interviewed on the PBS station he mentioned he would be in Boston in the spring of 99. I think that when this vocalist makes his debute' in America he will bring to this country a very fine talent.

I used it for about half an hour per day. The oscillation is noisy and un-stable, but that's all right. However, today (Feb.20) it finally reached its end of life.

Get one!Addendum: It crapped out one day after warranty expired. Worked great until it died. I guess if you don't mind repurchasing everything each year, this product is for you.

The only complaint I have is that the timer makes a slightly noticeable noise, especially when automatically turning off, and sometimes it will continue to make a faint clicking sound after shutting off.

Five minutes after trying it out, it went back in the box. I wanted to get this to use while laying on my sofa in front of the TV. The amount of light this thing gives off is way too distracting unless you don't mind a blaring light in your face. The low setting is annoying, the high is just way too bright for me.

The authors do a good job of combining secular research with biblical perspective. Along the way they provide answers to important questions about beauty, the experiences of women, and what should reasonably be expected by men. In a society where popular media advances the contradictory messages that women are objects to be used and that women are equals to men, this book helps explain that women are of equal value to men and yet their beauty is not without value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I have my money back?","review":"The authors often jump to conclusions about Gods point of view without giving the Bible verses to back up their statements. On page 197, the authors write that \\"God weeps\\" and \\"God is saddened when we veil ourselves...\\" What Bible verses state this? On page 249, a woman on a trip to the Dominican Republic with an aid organization wonders whether she would have time to keep up her nails. She prayed to God and SENSED God telling her that nail polish had done its work in her, so she let the nail polish go. I could go on and on with examples of this type of shallow nonsense.

This is mainly a collection of anecdotes from a variety of \\"in-laws\\". About 70% of these stories are about positive in-law relationships. The author merely strings these stories together and at the end of each chapter offers a small paragraph or two of vaguely-defined, common-sense suggestions.If you are looking for some real life stories that you can relate to, you may enjoy this book. But if you are having real difficulties with your in-laws or prospective in-laws, this book offers little solid advice or insight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understanding Inlaw Relationships Priceless","review":"Unlike baking an instant cake, successfully coping with and managing family relationships is a complex task. The wide range of potential issues and approaches call for sensitivity, perceptiveness and understanding.I found that this book provided me with a valuable perspective as well as insights and creative ways to improve inlaw relationships, well really, ALL kinds of family relationships.Best of all, this book is not written in some obscure, multi-syllabic medical or technical style. It is very \\"digestible\\" information and I recommend it to anyone about to \\"acquire\\" a new set of inlaws or someone who is facing inlaw issues today.I'm hoping to see future writings by this very accessible, human author who demonstrates the compassion and understanding we all need to improve our family relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evil comes in many forms","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book.

Highly improbably scenarios thickly laced with cliche made me cringe with embarassement for the writer. To think that this made it to print! I counted two typos in the first two chapters and inconsistency with the character development--in Chapter 1 Skyler is described as being 32 years old. A few chapters later when only a week or so has passed in the storyline--he's aged to 35! What the heck? Don't waste your money. Well unless you like to read a good trainwreck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing and Brilliant!!","review":"\\"Feel No Evil\\" is one of those life changing books. It captures the reader from the very first sentence and does not let the reader go until the end, but the reader is still left wanting more.

I have recommended this book to everyone I encounter and they all have loved it. It is brilliantly written! It is a masterpiece of literature and I can't wait for a second book by Judge Aquilina.

This book would make an excellent movie. I highly recommend Feel No Evil to others and anxiously await the author's sequel to this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gripping, page-turning read","review":"Hard to put down! It's surprising to find this is the author's first novel, considering the complexity of the story line and the deep character development were executed with the care of a well experienced author.

The script relies too much on knowledge of the past \\"Star Wreck\\" webisodes, and the humor mostly falls flat. The acting ranges from passable to amateurish. While the Finnish with English subtitles was only nominally distracting, for a comedy it might've worked best if they'd dubbed an English version.

What a bombshell.This was not a bunch of whining or political rhetoric. Instead Huberman writes in a crisp, succinct style which he backs with facts. Bush-haters will relish the facts while Bush-lovers will say they are not true. Huberman has written a love it or hate it bombshell that is sure to stir controversy.(BTW as I write this review the news story about Paul O'Neill has come out.O'Neill contends that the Bush administration began to lay the groundwork for an invasion of Iraq just a few days after Bush came into office. O'Neill's book is another one where you will love it or hate it.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"While there are better \\"reads\\" out there, like \\"The Price of Loyalty\\", if there is one book that you should buy to get a bird's eye view of the damage this adminstration is causing, it's this one. The reason is that it is concise and has a broader scope than the others I have read. It's almost like a pocket reference. On a side note - I really have to hand it to the Republican supporters of this president for their loyalty. This administration has been so remarkably, incredibly, deceitful and awful, if I was a Republican I would tell people otherwise, let alone defend Bush or vote for him. But - I digress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan of Bush...or this book","review":"While the book is an easy read, it's hardly a serious examination of the issues. If you are a Bush-hater, this book will reinforce your hatred. If you're a Bush supporter, this book will reinforce your disdain for the Bush-haters. If you're really looking for an honest and intellectual review of the Bush presidency, this is not the book for you. Huberman's arguments are blatently one-sided, and he uses the same arguments to criticize Bush that we've all heard before. While the author documents most of his points, few sources are credible (most of the sources cited here are other Bush-haters, not political scholars or historians). Bottom line: there's nothing new here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Factual?","review":"Political bias and solid information are two totally different realms. The book is full of opinions, not facts, and I found myself constantly disagreeing with Huberman's reasoning. The few facts may be true, but the spin he puts on them is unprofessional and inaccurate.He doesn't give any evidence that Bush is the worst president in 100 years.

Although the album was unpopular with some traditional Krall fans used to her previous jazz standards approach, this work has also attracted a new whole new group of fans.The transcription of the piano, voice, and sometimes guitar and bass are well done. Many of the slower originals are thoughtful and introspective, while the blues covers (Stop this World, Love me like a man) really rock. It should be noted that due to the complexity of Diana Krall's playing, this book is for the advanced player. However, it's also a rare insight into the playing of an amazing jazz and blues player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than expected...","review":"Okay, I confess-when I first sat down with this book, I wasn't really expecting much.

One of the things that makes me enjoy Star Trek so much is that for the most part, all the series, movies, and books tie-in with each other for the most part. At first reading, I wasn't sure about the following facts: 1. The Borg ally themselves with an un-assimilated race 2. The Borg have the technology to basicaly raise the dead 3. The Borg have the ability to reconfigure their ships 4. V'Ger is actualy Borg-originated. 1. Episodes of Star Trek: Voyager have proven that the Borg will ally themselves with an un-assimilated race, only to betray them when the crisis has been averted. 2. Seven of Nine revived Neelix, thus proving that the Borg can raise the dead. 3. Beats me, but I'll take Captain Kirk's word for it. 4.

Thank God they didn't. The book is actually well written (he had two adept co-authors) but the plot is a old, fat, bald man's dream to be the teen idol he never was.

The only problem is that some of the facts are a little off. For example, the CURRENT phasers in Star Trek are not blue. They are reddish-orange. The phasers may have been blue in Kirk's time, but not now they aren't. Also, how would Kirk know how to work a holosuite, and how would he know that it was one, by only watching Slatrel? HELLO!!

BUT","review":"Hey, this book is one of the best, but I must say that to bring Kirk back to life again (kind of) is pretty stupid. I don't think Shatner should have included the borg in his reincarnation. He could have had them come into the picture later. I think the brainwash or something like that was a great idea.

THe writing style on this is really terrible. It concentrates on the idea that only one person can save the universe when it could be the exact opposite of that very easily. The plot is slow, the characters unbelievable, and the book (dare I say) terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shatner's Delusion - Kirk as Superman","review":"I'm not sure which is less forgivable, Shatner's distorted vision of Kirk as a super-strong, super-intelligent being or his 2-dimensional portrayal of all of the other cast members of Star Trek and The Next Generation. You would think that with the vast amount that has been filmed and written this would be the easy part.The book is well written and the ideas behind the plot are interesting and consistent with the Star Trek mythos.

Well he made a difference to the world of ST novels as well. This is his work. I am only assuming that for him it was, well... important work.As a sequel, it follows generations perfectly, and AoE not so perfectly. But, for all those goofs that hate Shatner, why did you even read this book, if you really did read it at all. Given what others left him, I thought he came up with a brilliant way to RETURN. I have the book and audio CD. Shatner reads the book on the CD and does a wonderful job. So here¡s to you and your friends Mr. Shatner :)! You just keep writing books about James Tiberius Kirk. Include Dr. Mc Coy in them will ya."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abandon Tek, stick to TRek! Shatner CAN write!","review":"Legends never die. Apparently. And apparently Jim Kirk is still going strong. Directly after the events in Generations, and brought back to life, rebuilt by a deadly alliance of the Borg and Romulans, an amnaesiac Kirk is convinced he must destroy Jean Luc Picard. He subsequently sets out to find him, and battle ensues. Eventually, all is put well with the world, and Kirk, Spock and McCoy (at 145 years old!) are reunited, and team up with the crew of the Enterprise-D and take on the enemy that corrupted Kirk with an explosive conclusion.Read this novel. It is actually the second in the \\"Oddessy\\" trilogy, but the first one set in the \\"Next Gen\\" era, so in that sense it stands alone quite nicely, and is frankly incredible. I don't own my copy any more and frankly I miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic","review":"I realy could not beleive that William Shatner wrote this book. It was fantastic!

I look at them as individual stories, and this one takes the cake. If your a Kirk fan and a Picard fan, then this book is fantastic. I couldnt put it down and read over half of it in just one sitting.

Keep it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book is great!","review":"I read this and the fact that kirk was able to defeat a Worf is the fact that kirk is tougher that you think ok so its a little unreal but hey it makes a good story and the fact he knew about holograms is he did come back from the energy ribbon to learn about the this of the future so he wasnt compleatly stupid and times change with the phasers some ships carry blue phasers the ENTERPRISE D carryed reddish orange phasers different ships different phasers"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Crap!","review":"I cannot believe the kind of stupid senseless drivel that the StarTrek universe has come to.

TNG characters, proves himself smarter than everyone and SINGLEHANDEDLY kills all the borg. You expect a little ego from big Bill Shatner, but this is ridiculous - I'm honestly surprised he didn't make a point of mentioning how well-hung his alter-ego is. Worst of all is the fact that he couldn't write if his life depended on it. The diction is poor, the dialogue is awful, the descriptions are horrible, the characters are wooden and the story is simply bad on so many levels I simply don't know where to begin. Every once in a while you can see the (normally decent)writing of the Stevens' show through the dross, but that's like wading into a swimming pool full of manure in order to get a few buried cubic zirconiums. Unless your idea of a good read involves massive Shatnerian ego trips, avoid this [junk] like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent with Next Gen","review":"I can only assume that the bulk of the people giving this book 5's have never watched \\"Star Trek : The Next Generation\\". If you're in that crowd you probably won't mind \\"The Return\\". It has a 'Kirk is the coolest thing ever' feel but this is consistent both with original series Trek, and William Shatner. And the story is probably up to the quality of an average Star Trek Novel.However, this book is inconsistent with Star Trek: The Next Generation's portrayal of both the Next Gen characters, and the Borg. This story reads as though Shatner either never watched Next Gen, or he just didn't care in his desire to glorify Kirk.If you're setting a novel in a pre-existing universe, a strong familiarity with and respect for that setting are absolute prerequisites. Since William Shatner's ego appears to have overwhelmed any efforts to remain true to the setting, \\"The Return\\" is worthless as a \\"Cross-Generation\\" Star Trek novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Careful with title..","review":"Certainly a good compilation , but bear in mind the title is a little misleading, or could easily be misunderstood.This is the complete collection of the first Animals with the producer Mickie Most.It doesn't contain the songs the first Animals recorded with their second producer Tom Wilson, released on Decca records in the UK. There is a disc covering that period, called The Decca Years, if you buy that and this album, you will have everything from the first Animals , EXCEPT - the US version of We've Gotta Get Out of This Place,(a different recording to the same titled single released outside America), and the tracks on the US ONLY LP release Animalism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good collection","review":"I really like the collection. The inclusion of \\"Bo Diddley\\" was worth the price.Two quibbles: The collection doesn't include some of the later Eric Burdon and the Animals songs (but I understood that going in, just wish they could have worked out whatever deal was needed to get those songs in the collection) and the version of \\"We've Gotta Get Out Of This Place\\" is lame. Eighth season of \\"Night Court\\" lame.Really happy with it otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"whats not to like?","review":"This is a prime collection of their early, very R& B influnced work. They were just finding themselves and expanding into similar covers that other gritty Brittish bands were exploring. You can never go wrong with any Animals recording. This is very primal rock and roll. The sound quality is good for such old, presumably remastered or rediscovered recordings"},{"rating":"2","title":"..a beloved \\"alternative\\" to the Beatles...","review":"The Animals were a beloved \\"alternative\\" to the Beatles during the first British Invasion. They issued only three American studio LPs in their original configuration with organist Alan Price. This collects all the \\"hits.\\" But the Animals were also an album band, which gives this compilation its strengths.Everyone knows the immortal \\"House of the Rising Sun\\" & the awesome \\"We Gotta Get Out of this Place.\\" But you'll dig the rest of this stuff, most of it snappy yet tough R & B. It also includes the hilarious & true \\"Story of Bo Diddley.\\"The Animals carried on in this vein for a few albums after Price quit the band. Those cuts, which include \\"Inside Looking Out,\\" \\"Hey Gyp\\" & the Zappa-produced \\"All Night Long\\" are well worth seeking out. Then Burdon took complete control of the Animals name & headed for the psychedelic colonies in America. But that's another story & another music.Bob Rixon, WFMU"},{"rating":"2","title":"two in a row","review":"Four stars for a great compilation. But a caveat- I've received two CDs in a row of this where the last track on CD1 had digital crackle/distortion or simply wouldn't play. It's only a two minute track but....Seeing that no one else has mentioned it here, I suppose I'm the lucky receipient of two defective discs in a row. Maybe I should've gone the third round but 'nuffs enuff already.

He loved it! It arrived quickly and in perfect condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"There is no indication of who is performing the music. There is some sort of noise suppression that seems to limit freq. response tremendously (although it may have just been recorded that way! The performances sound like covers. If they were original recordings, it should say so in the accompanying notes. Last, but not least, you cannot copy the files of this to listen to on your MP3 player.

MS. Holt captures images in time that reflect much depth in emotion and the little surprises in life that seem to keep us going. She seems sincerely moved by a deep spirit and imbues her work with a rare tenderness and keen eye for nuances that many of us would miss.Her work has rich textures and soothing colors.

This waistpack can be worn backwards and frontwards allowing for easy hiking and quick access of either of my cameras.

Its as well made as anything I have seen and I would have loved to have used it. Love the pockets, ease of access, included small carrying case, and great construction.Two things didn't work for me; the first is that it is very big and bulky - great for shooting in the outdoors or the woods, but too conspicuous walking the streets of South Africa.

With its Angela Carteresque overtones and its nods to everything from Dario Argento to the latest American teen flick (The Forsaken in Paris, maybe?), Deep in the Woods is to be avoided at all costs.

I'd write more but Im busy cleansing my DVD player after loading that steaming pile!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The type of film DARIO ARGENTO SHOULD be making","review":"I've seen mostly negative reviews here about this film, I really don't think americans get it. So bombarded with \\"scary action horror comedies\\" like THE MUMMY or the new DAWN OF THE DEAD, the modern American perception of horror is a \\"non-threatening boo\\" with no substance. Another great example of modern american \\"horror\\" is 13 Ghosts which was ruined by a jive talking, step'n'fetchit maid.That said, this movie is different. It's very artistic and truly gothic in a surreal Argento way. Of course it had slow spots and faults, but for a first time director, low budget and in France?! I loved it and was shocked by sequences and respected it AND was inspired by it. That's so much more than I've gotten from films over here for the last 25 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Curse is over!\\" review by former minor leaguer and ENG teacher turned WRITER","review":"Stephan King continues to demonstrate his versatility as a writer. What another great notch he has etched into his legacy as one of the most important writers of our time. For another example of King stepping outside the box, check out his memoir ON WRITING."},{"rating":"2","title":"The title says it all: take it for what it is","review":"Anyone who thinks that this book should be entertaining to anyone but a Red Sox fan needs to re-read the title. This book was never advertised as anything more than two fanatics game by game reactions to and experiences with each Red Sox game of the 2004 season. For a Red Sox fan, it was a great read, especially knowing how the whole thing ends. For anyone else other than those who are just true sports fans, I can clearly see how it would be a huge bore just as a book entitled \\"Astrophysics: Two Diehard Scientists Chronicle the History of the Science\\" would bore the hell out of me. Frankly, I enjoyed the season itself and then enjoyed reliving it through the eyes of O'Nan and Uncle Stephie. It's a shame that more authors haven't picked up on this notion for other sports teams looking at promising seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Retrospective on the World Champions","review":"King and O'Nan help us to relive the typical drama of every Red Sox season, but within the context of an extraordinary Championship journey - from spring training through the dog days until we reach glory in October. Their appreciation for the annual BoSox experience as fans, as well as for the nuances of the players involved, is a welcome chronicle of a season which will live on forever in the hearts and minds of the Nation's faithful.p.s. No reason for Yankees fans to be bitter. Just read this book to be reminded how the biggest payroll in your history collapsed under its own greedy weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful read, knowing how it ends","review":"I really enjoyed this book on many levels. For starters, it was great to read this knowing how the season ended. Watching the writers go through the roller coaster of emotions as the season progressed was delightful in a devilish sort of way. After seeing their complete despair following the third loss in the ALCS, I wanted to jump in and tell them not to worry, the best is yet to come! I also enjoyed the personal notes about the life of the writers... personal trips, ancedotes, and the e-mails. I appreciate Stephen King as a \\"regular guy\\" and, although enormously successful and wealthy, you could have a beer with him and talk about rock-and-roll, baseball, and whatever else came to mind. Stewart O'Nan is the most diehard of the two, going to batting practice, shagging balls in the stands, and nearly stalking players to get as close to the game as a fan can get. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING:","review":"This book may be harmful to your 2004 Red Sox memories. Indeed, if you treasure your recollections of that glorious World Series year, you'll want to keep them untainted by this laborious and witless tome. It does nothing to enhance the memory of that magical season, and only serves to crush it under a torrent of unceasing and pointless personal detail as written by these two unrelentingly self-satisfied and self-referential would-be diarists. The whole experience is akin to being trapped on a bus or plane next to two high-fiving Sox fans who ramble on and on about the games (and even more tediously, themselves) in the most smug and annoying manner imaginable. If you really want to relive that wonderful 2004 season, just close your eyes and let your own memories unfurl. And if you feel you must check out this book, just wait a little while and pick it up at your local bookstore on the bargain or remainder table, where it is destined to be very soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was okay","review":"I did not expect a journal about baseball.

I will comment further when finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"How many BP balls did Stewart O'Nan catch today?","review":"In what was one of the most unprecedented baseball season in the last century, the storyline for a great book was there for the taking. Unfortunately Steven King and Stewart O'Nan didn't come close to telling the tale. This book was for the most part a post game wrap-up of each nights action, an occasional email discussion between the authors , and O'Nan describing how many foul balls or BP home runs he caught (it seemed like dozens).If you're really looking for a good review of the season, I'd suggest saving your money and getting the NESN DVD (not the MLB one). Stick to the horror SK... - EH"},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWWWNNNNNNNNNNN","review":"This book is easily the biggest piece of crap I have ever had the displeasure of reading. I was given it as a Christmas gift as I am a long standing member of Red Sox nation (Bucky F***** Dent). It reads like a two year old wrote it and to be quite frank I don't need to hear about the special treatment Steven King gets on a daily basis. Besides that it is just plain boring. I plan on trying to return this overblown piece of horse turd as soon as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faith...um, I mean \\"DREADful\\"","review":"I'm a life long, fie hard Red Sox fan and I was excited to read this \`diary' of the greatest baseball season ever. It would be an understatement to call this book a HUGE disappointment. Most of the book is about collecting batting practice baseballs and talking about how great their free seats are. King and O'Nan are obviously fans but their knowledge of the game seems limited to what they hear the announcers on NESN say. This book is also full of clichés. There were many times I cringed while reading this book. I really wanted to like it but it's dreadful. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible book","review":"I am not a BoSox fan at all, I am a huge BlueJays fan but I have read many baseball books about the hated Red Sox or Yankees and enjoyed them thoroughly.

Not recommended at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Foul-Mouthed Jerks","review":"In real life this was a great story. In this inept retelling the co-authors come across as foul-mouthed jerks.

The Red Sox deserved better, and will get it from other authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive and dull","review":"This book is such a waste of a golden opportunity. It is repetitive and dull. Repetitive and dull. Repetitive and dull. O'Nan comes off like a ball-chasing goon, forever trying to snag one wherever he goes. Couldn't he write about anything else at least once? Throw in lots of cursing, and the Red Sox winning the World Series on the TV in the other room, and you get the essence of this book.

Anyone could have wrote this type of book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book but he should keep his politics out of it","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book from the time I first heard of the project. I FINALLY got a chance to read it recently and it was a nice, relatively quick and fun read. Stuart O'Nan is quite the character, showing up in the monster seats during BP with a butterfly net to snag balls and other humorous antics. It's ironic (spooky) that they chronicled the 2004 season and the Sox first World Series win in 86 years. My only objection would be Mr. King having to inject his loony left political views periodically, sounds like he's got a crush on 'Longshot' John Kerry for one which made me want to #uke. Hey, Mr King, a village in KENYA is missing it's idiot (not Texas). Just wanted to clear that up for ya."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for the Faithful","review":"I was born an Oriole fan and I plan to go out that way. I also chose not to get on the \\"Saux\\" bandwagon last season. With this said, I highly recommend this book. You really get the feeling of what it was to be a fan during what was obviously a wild ride for the Red Sox. You finish the book hoping that your team could some day do for you what the Sox did for O'Nan and King.(Also, it will fuel whatever \\"Yankee Hater\\" instincts you may have brewing.

When I tried this product I had a feeling it was going to make me break out. I went a head and tried it.i had heard and read so many great reviews on it. I ended up breaking out with it so I never got a chance to see if it works? I am going to look for this in Sensitive skin. I know ROC has products for sensitive skin but I don't think they have this exact one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I smell smoke","review":"This is my first experience with this brand. After the third or fourth day of use, when I woke I thought my eyes were on fire. They were swollen and burning. Instead of letting the product go to waste, I gave it to my sister. She had the same results. For both of us it took a few days for the burning to stop. I would not refer this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smell","review":"This is just my second night of using this product so I don't know if it will work or not. My problem is that it smells like \\"old lady rose water.\\" The stink is really strong and hard to take. Why don't they make face products with no smell...especially when you have to sleep in it?

This product has parabens","review":"I searched the internet before buying this product and couldn't find anything stating that this product contains parabens but I should have known since the ingredients list was not shown. Anyway, I got the package today and of course, it contains methylparaben and propylparaben. Parabens are synthetic preservatives used in cosmetics and personal care products, The danger lies in the fact that our bodies readily absorb parabens and studies show that parabens are hormone disruptors affecting our endocrine system by mimickng estrogen (in both men and women). Excess estrogen as you may know has the potential to cause breast cancer. Lesson learned. I will not buy any more products without seeing the ingredients label. Amazon, you could improve by being more transparent for your customers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why No Expiration Date?","review":"I bought this after reading many online positive reviews. The RoC Night Creme arrived today and though the RoC Eye Creme and RoC Daily Moisture plus SPF30 cremes had expiration dates, The Night Creme did not. I will save you a call to the RoC. Here is there number should you have more questions however: 1-800-782-1964.The Lot # on the box reads like this: 0639V AThis means the product was made on the 63rd day of 2009 (March 4th). I was told that there are no expirations on cremes with an unlimited shelf life such as this Night Creme. Other cremes such as the ones with sunscreen have a shelf life with expiration dates. Cremes can go rancid, and stop being effective. Always smell product, and make sure you yourself do not contaminate products with unclean hands or leaving caps off near sinks etc.There was a 10 minute wait to get to a RoC phone Representative but he was very helpful with my questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had high hopes for this product but...","review":"I had high hopes for the Roc Deep Wrinkle Night Cream since it had a lot of good reviews, and its Roc brand.

For me, the most noticable results were the lines on my forehead. I'm 43, so I don't think they are going away with anything OTC or without surgery, but I really could tell a difference. I did have a little sensativity around my eyes, but I would just not apply the product there for a day or two and I was fine!

I get random small pimples once or twice a month (even more around that time of the month) but this lotion made three pimples appear in my face by day 4. I wasn't 100% sure if it was the lotion so I continued using it. At the end of the week I had around seven pimples all over my face. My face was not flattering from any angle! I stopped using it right away and my face went back to normal in two weeks. Not ready to throw away all my money, I decided a few weeks later to try this on my boyfriend and see what happen. He noticed the same breakout problem without me saying anything about the lotion.

Strong Scent for \\"old ladies\\"","review":"I am rather shocked at the very strong, fake-flowery, 1950's perfume that dominates this cream. It is so overpowering it marks hair, clothes, sheets, furniture, the whole area you inhabit. If you have a husband/partner who is sensitive to scent, better think about this. I can not bear using it, so much perfume on the face gives me an almost instant headache. Some people will like or not mind the smell, but I really hate it. It screams \\"old fashioned, little-old-lady wearing too much bad perfume\\"! And of course, if you are wearing a perfume you like, this will overpower and ruin it. Why not make a face cream unscented?

Thought it was time to possibly get rid of the few wrinkles that were appearing. I used the ROC Correxion cream and not much was happening. However, after 3 weeks, my face began to itch and then I noticed deep lines throughout my face. It became a nightmare. The deep wrinkles that appeared looked awful. I immediately stopped using the product. How could this ever be reversed was my concern. I used nothing on my face until the itching stopped (about one week.) Then I slathered my usual Olay moisturizer, and after two months, my skin is back to normal. My experience is not the norm, but just beware if you have sensitive skin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the list of ingredients","review":"I praised this product at first.

I used it for s week. A BIG mistake!!!!! I wish I read other people's reviews before using it. Besides burning your skin, (and that can't be healthy) it has ADDED DEEP WRINKLES under my eyes all the way to the top of my cheeks. I now look 70 and have to wear sunglasses to hide my eyes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I don't have sensitive skin either. I am hoping the aloe gel I got will help heal my skin.

The author explains how to create miracles in your life using tools such as meditation, generosity, and compassion.

Through the book omri experiment with the cupboard by putting other things in it, like Star Wars action figures and bringing them to life.I really like the book because it lets your imagination take over.

As a consequence the book works on two levels at the same time - it certainly has an interesting adventure/fantasy storyline, but the hero's learning to cope with the situation presents a second distinct and subtle storyline. How Omri ends up handling the whole experience actually ends being as interesting as the fantasy events themselves. And maybe that's what accounts for the continuing popularity of this book, despite some of its outdated cultural missteps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasy and history","review":"The book was an interesting read. It uses the magical, never quite explained cupboard and key to introduce some key points of American history and culture and race relations.

Then Patrick (the one who gave Omri the indian and makes boone come alive) wants Omri to take boone to school to give to him. Little Bear wants to go to school too. Then a disaster happens at school. After school Omri takes Little Bear to a store and he picks out a wife. You should read the book and find out the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunning imaginative journey","review":"This book is fascinating in many regards. One, it's got magic: a real, true, amazing bit of magic. Two, it explores the friendship between two kids, complete with the sudden I-hate-yous and all. Three, it presents children with some thought-provoking scenarios. Should the children continue to make people until everybody has a wife, etc, or should the children return all the people to plastic after they've witnessed the real emotions and personalities of those people. The book asks deep moral questions in a way that kids can handle.This would be a great book to read aloud. It's got enough action and a fast-paced storyline that kids would just love to hear you read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"the racism overrides anything else","review":"I am appalled that all these reviewers are either ignoring or are unaware of the offensive stereotypes in this book.

It is read by the author who knows the text, so she knew that it was a revision when she read it (She probably made the revision), making this an even more odious lie. If an author is going to revise thier story, let us know. Don't get me wrong updating is okay, but let us know.I got this audio book so my kids could listen and read along. With the inexplicable changes, it was useless for this purpose. Again don't get me wrong, the story is still good.

I work with students who struggle with their reading and reading along with an audiobook increases student comprehension of the material. I was disappointed to discover that the author (Lynne Reid Banks) changed parts of the audio version. At first, I only noticed a few changes, such as trousers for leggings. Then I discovered that she completely changed parts of the text by doing adding descriptions and by changing Little Bear's name to Little Bull. I'm not sure why the author felt it necessary to make these changes, but it makes it difficult for students to follow along in the book when the audiobook does not follow the text word for word.

Great beach read! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid Characters - very very unrealistic","review":"How can anybody like a book where the first 190 pages are about the most inane misunderstandings. If anybody had acted normal then the misunderstanding after misunderstanding would have been cleared up in 10 pages. How can half a book be about the flirtation between the wedding consultant and the (supposed) fiance of the client? Because NOBODY ever uses the fiance's name??? How can you spend 190 pages saying \\"YOUR FIANCE\\" and \\"MY FIANCE\\" instead of \\"NICK\\". How could a woman be so stupid as to flirt with an engaged man without ever saying \\"WHY ARE YOU FLIRTING WITH ME WHEN YOU ARE ENGAGED?\\"I did finish this book, but I had to leap 10 pages at a time for much of it to see if it was going to get less slapstick. It never did. I did find the Darla & fiance wedding at the end funny (in a 3 stooges type of way), but I immediately threw the book into the \\"donate\\" bag. This is not worth your time.

I would have given it 1/2 of a star if I could have. The first two hundred pages of the book kept harping on the same storyline with the author treating the reader like an idiot. I knew what was going to happen (I don't know why I kept reading- just a habit to finish things I start) before it did. All the \\"surprises\\" in the book were telegraphed long before they happened.

The details illustrate the German Army's ability to improvise in the face of incredibly daunting odds. Ad Hoc units scraped from anywhere and everywhere were welded together as kampfgruppen under seasoned leaders and thrown in first to surpress the allied airborne forces, second to prevent the linkup of heavy forces trying to punch through the airborne corridor with the final airborne objective, and finally establish a viable defense west of the German border area.

While Ryan's \\"A Bridge Too Far\\" covers the whole battle from all points, this book tells the German story. While books like \\"Arhnem\\", and \\"Poles Apart\\" cover the British and Polish views, this book only tells the tale of the Germans.

Which is not the case, not really.Many Buddhists in the USA will tell you that they have drifted into Buddhism naturally, finding in it a place to forget about the cares and the oppressions of the Western way of life. They are emphatically not drawn to it because of its reputation as a nearly 100 per cent white practice.

How on earth anyone could stand watching this and enjoy it, I don't know.

Now I have and can honestly say that Children of the Living Dead SUCKS! Why is it so bad? Because they didn't even try on any level. They just figured they could make a buck off the \\"Living Dead\\" label. It even seems like they screwed not only us but also Savini, Russo, Hinzman, and everybody involved. The folks in charge of this abortion clearly didn't care one bit about the movie or the audience. They just wanted quick cash at the expense of everything and everybody.

George Romero should kill him for what he did to Night Of The Living Dead and now the horror continues.

Director Tor Ramsey actually wrote a letter of apology for it due to the fact that the producer really nailed his balls to the floor, creatively.This film attempts to link itself to the original NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (for shame) as some type of undead child molester (WTF?) keeps bringing back zombies. The camera work is awful and I challenge you to find a movie with worse acting and dialouge. To its credit, the opening fifteen minutes featuring Tom Savini are actually pretty good but once he bites it so does the movie.Unless, you are the type who like to laugh at bad movies (which I am), you should avoid this one.

It started off with a lot of potential, where Night of the Living Dead left off, shooting zombies in the field. Well after the opening scene this movie falls apart or should I say is ripped apart by a lot of bad acting and a really bad story. Tom Savini is lucky his character is killed off in the first scene. The rest of the movie is based around some cockamamey story about some guy named Abbott Hays who killed a lot of people however many years ago and he's still be alive and eating dead people which brings them back to life as zombies which are, after all, required to make this an actual zombie movie and so on and so forth, etc., etc., blah blah blah.In short, buy a GOOD zombie movie, a category in which this movie does not fall."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't find a good thing to say about this movie","review":"This cinematic masterpiece is a worthy addition to the Living Dead Saga!! This is what I would be saying if I even remotely enjoyed this movie, but unfortunately I can say nothing of the sort. Perhaps it was the random, scattered, and unfocused plot. Or maybe it was the trite and flat dialogue. I won't even go into what I felt about the acting, but heed my warning, it's not good. I have to admit that the first 5 to 10 minutes showed promise. But drawing from my own experience, promise don't mean squat if you have no direction.

It was a shiny door. The cameramzan was smiling. Not just for that truck but for 4 trucks where you could see the crew clearly in every door).The action was absurd.

It starts with a bunch of cops standing in a field picking off zombies with rifles, handguns, machine guns, etc. Then as soon as someone spoke, I became suspicious of the quality of the film. The story then takes you 15 years into the future and it took me all of five minutes to come to the conclusion that this is an amateur movie at best. I know nothing of any of the actors or the director, but this MUST be their first movie. The only thing I liked in what little I watched was the lead zombie, Abbot Hayes. I thought he was pretty cool looking, but he was more gruesome than scary. Maybe if I watch the entire thing there might eventually be a plot, but I doubt it.

WRETCHED acting, and i mean dismal folks.3. lame special effects, what few there are.4. a terrible soundtrack, if you want to call it that.Bottom line: if you buy this, you will only watch it all the way through once...if you can make it that far, and then never again because it is terrible. basically, a complete waste of cashYou'd get more satisfaction in throwing 10 bucks down the toilet and watching it spin after you flush than watching this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this movie....","review":"but the inane story, the dialogue that sounds completely improvised (and post-production dubbed, no less) made it impossible. When I heard the Tom Savini didn't like the movie at all, I resolved to try it anyway. After all, if this one made money, maybe they'd get Romero to film one the right way.Oh, god this is BAD! Bad story (\\"Zombies don't care for children\\") bad acting, bad makeup (Ok, so the zombies in Dawn of the Dead wore similar green/gray makeup...GAR has said that he regrets that choice in makeup).Just bad. Look onward. Don't buy it. Don't rent it. Run from it. Take that money and spend it on anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"this is horrible. they just slapped \\"living dead\\" on it to make a buck and put nothing in the movie to entertain anybody. one of the worst 'b movies' i've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"I love \\"bad\\" movies. I have thousands of them in my video and dvd collection. I \\"get\\" the love of bad movies and horror cheapies and love those types of films. This isn't one of them. This is just an incoherent mess. Don't waste your cash. Skip this. This isn't a fun bad movie. It's just TERRIBLE and a waste of your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Zombie film ever!","review":"As a fan of zombie films I was hugely disappointed by this film. Just awful! If you're a fan of living dead films - keep away fromthis. The storyline was ridiculous, the zombies were not scary, and the acting was just terrible. I've seen many low-budget Romero ... films with stupid plots and bad acting (and enjoyed most of them in spite of those challenges) but this one was no fun and a complete waste of time. The only good part was the beginning with a good zombie hunting sequence reminiscent of Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead - other than that - this film should be avoided by zombie film fans.Thank goodness the DVD version has Spanish subtitles. At least I got to practice some foreign language skills. If it weren't for that, viewing this would have been a COMPLETE WASTE OF MY TIME."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honestly? Poorly made movie.","review":"The cover is what sold me-it looked like a great zombie movie with awesome special effects. But it's not. Some of the make up was good on the zombies. But it was almost like watching a B-movie, without all the sex. The story was good, but the movie just seemed to drag on...And the poor acting makes it even worse. Don't waste your money buying this. Maybe you can catch it on the Sci-Fi channel some day."},{"rating":"1","title":"the bad egg of the living dead","review":"the first twenty minutes of this was great with tom savini kicking ass just like he did in from dusk till dawn.

Plot: A superzombie, who has survived undetected by hiding in a house for 30 years, re-animates 5 auto accident fatalities. Subsequently, construction of a used car dealership, built on the site of a graveyard, unleashes the corpses for an evening of mayhem. Although it features Tom Savini (no fx work, just a small acting role) and was produced by John Russo, this is truly a miserable effort. Completely devoid of plot, special effects and production values, it in no way resembles the 1968 shocker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid it.","review":"I guess I'm what you'd call a zombie aficionado. I buy every movie I can find involving the walking dead. Doing so I've had to sit through some real stinkers and let me tell you, Children of the Living Dead is the worst.There are a lot of bad zombie films out there...Some have a bit of charm about them, Burial Ground for instance...Awful film, but an enjoyable watch. The only thing enjoyable about this film however, is when the credits roll.I guess I'll get into the story. It jumps around a lot which is pretty annoying, you've got Tom Savini doing karate...Some annoying sheriff with a huge birthmark on his face looking around an old farm house. Oh, and there's this zombie serial killer on the loose. Abbot Hayes, I believe that was his name.Sorry for real lack of a description, but that's all you really need to know about this movie. Bad acting, bad directing, awful script, did I mention bad acting?If you're a real glutton for punishment and you're dead set on seeing this film...Don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I was required to read this book for my English class at UNC-Charlotte and found it to be absolutely dreadful. If you're a teacher and thinking of using this book... DON'T! The majority of my class really attempted to read it but found it simply impossible and everyone just quit. The topics discussed in the book are simple and typically rather obvious but the authors find it necessary to weave these simplicities into a giant web of complexities. In addition to this, the authors attempt to prove their point by providing studies but each study was laughable because the samples included tiny groups of minorities mostly that were supposed to represent the U.S. population as a whole. At other times, they would take a simple inability, such as being unable to read, and create a 40 page chapter with the most ridiculous implications. My class took a vote as to whether this book should be used next semester and the outcome was 100% no."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculously heavy and not waterproof.","review":"This watch is ridiculously heavy, and even so it's a dud as a diver's watch, which it earnestly claims to be.

This is the only type of watch we buy in our family. This selection is nice because it can be worn with dress clothes as well as casual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Watch!!!","review":"I have been looking at this watch for awhile and I finally purchased it the other day. At first it seems very heavy and cumbersome, but then after a few days of wearing it, it seems to grow to your wrist... now if I take it off my wrist feels naked.The stainless band hasn't pulled on a single hair on my wrist yet, finally a metal band that wears like a leather, or rubber band. Also I would like to mention that there is not a plastic part to be found on this watch, contrary to what is said in one of the other reviews. This watch is ALL steel, and feels VERY durable... Also I read on another site that this watch features an 8-year battery life... I'm not sure if that's true, but if so... BIG bonus! Anyway, if you want a great shock resistant, steel, 200M Diving watch that lights up and glows from sunlight too.... then pick this one up... you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent watch, outstanding value","review":"You can't go wrong with this very handsome, rugged, and functional diver-style watch. Mine is now five years old and has worked perfectly. One previous reviewer complained about the waterproof feature not working, but I suspect the screw-down stem was not properly tightened. Another compaint centered on it not being large enough for true diving, but only a few specialty divers watches are oversized. This watch works beautifully for all watersports, and at 200 meters, is waterproof far deeper than recreational divers are allowed to dive. Another reviewer complained about the band, but I find the band as sturdy and high quality as on watches costing hundreds of dollars. Add Indiglo and a date function, and you have the perfect divers-style sports watch. I'll buy another just like it if this one ever fails."},{"rating":"1","title":"FM Transmitter useless. Loses position if battery changed. Badly designed.","review":"The specifications of this player looked like it was the perfect MP3 player at an excellent price. Resume, FM transmitter and 2GB.The resume works, sort of, as long as you dont pull out the battery. And then it will tell you - no files found. You have to play with it a little bit, move between voice and music to make it find the files. Didn't Trekstor have a Quality Assurance department?The FM transmitter doesn't work without headphones attached. Now, why would I want an FM transmitter, if I wanted to attach wires? And even then, the quality is bad.It wont play in order unless you have the files numbers in the front of the file name, not at the end as files are usually named."},{"rating":"1","title":"too quiet & fm transmitter is lame","review":"I'm sorry, but this unit is a horrible mp3 player. The fm transmitter doesn't have enough power to get into ANY radio I tried, without lots of static, if at all. Also, the battery life is dismal, compared to my iriver. Also the volume doesn't go up loud enough. I'm disappointed and would not recommend this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suspect in the extreme","review":"This is a very average mp3 player indeed. It would seem from the descriptions to have a lot of functionality for a relatively inexpensive device. However the product description gives a false impression.The storage it is said to have would seem okay, however it begins to seriously wobble once you reach the 200 song mark. After that the songs lose all order in terms of songs from an individual album being grouped together. They then proceed to be spat out in any direction and many songs will simply be deleted.Also toggling between different functionalities on this device is a nightmare. The buttons are awkward to manipulate and the stick for skipping between songs and changing the volume malfunctions relatively easily.All in all, even at this budget price, I would not recommend buying this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible, horrible player.","review":"Actually, this is an ok player...until it dies. My player died after a week of use. Avoid this at all cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool device","review":"You get a lot of features for your money with this player - large storage capacity (2 GB) that can also be used for data, a dictation mic, as well as the handy FM transmitter which has a range to fill a large room. It readily clips on a lanyard that I hang around my neck. I'm very satisfied with this TrekStor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great! I'm being gentle with mine, though.","review":"So far, after three uses, I have had no problems with my PastaDrive motor. I do have a couple reservations about giving a 5 star review though:1. The motor housing is metallic-colored plastic, not metal like one might assume just from looking at the pictures of it online.2. It does not feel extremely sturdy.I have been using a rolling pin to get my dough almost as thin as the \\"0\\" setting before I roll it out with the machine. This way, the motor isn't getting stressed to it's maximum capacity -- it sounds like it is struggling if you push the dough through as thick as you would when using the manual crank, which is to say, just patted out with your hands. Frankly, I wish this thing were made with all metal parts, especially as it is so expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"plastic gears break","review":"I have been making pasta for many years and about 4 years ago I decided to treat myself to a motor for my Atlas machine which was only a few months old at the time (older machine went to grandkids for clay).

Beware....it can happen to you"},{"rating":"2","title":"Work horse of a motor","review":"I bought this motor after our current Atlas motor made some funny sounds. I thought it was about to bite the dust. It is almost 6 months later and the original motor is still going! I use the motor at work almost daily to sheet gumpaste and fondant pieces for cake decorating. My only complaint is that the end of the cord sticks out at a 90 degree angle. I have hit it multiple times and have managed to break the plastic piece that holds the socket end in the motor. Electrical tape now holds the piece onto the motor. A flat head on the cord would work better to remedy this issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Olga Kurylenko","review":"This is a good movie. I just love Olga Kurylenko.

My son just turned 6 and I agree with another poster...this is perfect for ages 5-8!! Any younger and it would be too frustrating and any older and they'd get bored. It is a slower-paced game that requires thinking and problem solving! You create cars...you help out the people in your town..but you have to think. For example...to get to a destination that you need to go (like a party you've been invited to) you have to cross a muddy patch...if you don't have the correct tires, you can't go across. You have to find the right tires in the junk yard, but if they aren't there then you might have to go do some other favors for people and they will give you spare parts in return...and maybe someone will give you the right tires!!

Bosnia and Kosovo are the centerpieces but the book also touches meaningfully on Iraq, Somalia, Rwanda, and Haiti. The thumbnail biographical portraits of all the leading American figures is a great joy and asset of this book. Foreign policy can be a confusing issue, not least of all because of its lack of intelligible coverage in the media or on campaign trails. Halberstam makes all these complex issues and myriad personalities shine through clearly.

The straight ahead account of the events is interesting, but the behind the scenes profiles on the players is what made this book great for me. The personalities, politics, hidden agenda and faults of the players are brought to life and really illustrate how foreign policy decision, even in the best if circumstances, are multi faceted beasts. Amazing the we ever get anything right and this books shows how many times we have gotten it wrong.Definately a must read for any history or foreign policy buffs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Case of bad timing","review":"This book has the misfortune of bad timing. It was published in the May, proceeding September 11. It provides an insightful and detailed review of the Clinton's administration problems in coping with the Yugoslavia crisis. Regrettably that is almost all that it covered. The near complete omission of any discussion of the Middle East and terrorism becomes glaringly apparent after September 11. It is likely that this book would have been considered too incomplete on the subject matter to be published, had it still been on the editor's desk on September 11. As a very pro Clinton review of the Yugoslavia crisis it is of value, but as a review of the overall foreign relations situation during the Clinton years it is only 1/3 complete.A great deal was going on in the terrorist arena during this time period, and it is simply not addressed in this book. Also Clinton's attempt to broker a Middle East peace, and its failure, is barely mentioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply poorly researched","review":"How long can Halberstam continue on reputation alone?

Stick to Robert Kaplan for any real balanced analysis of the U.S. and its relationship to other nations and cultures around the world.

It's a treasure chest's worth of facts and history that brings to life the true story (often more interesting than the fictionalized version!) behind the pirates of film, novel, and legend. Open the book to any page, and you're sure to find a fascinating tidbit that you didn't know. I was surprised to learn how many common expressions (\\"going off half-cocked\\") had their origins in the pirate life. The appendices are a fun addition for anyone wanting to delve further into pirate lore or pirate reenactment groups.My only small quibble is that the book covered so much about the subject that sometimes only a few lines were devoted to a particular topic before the author moved onto the next one, leaving me wanting to know more. But, overall, a fun-filled sail through pirate history that is guaranteed to shiver the reader's timbers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book that every one must read","review":"This is an excellent source for those who are just starting out learning about pirates or for any one who does not like to read those long, boring, text book like histories.

Contrary to popular belief, pirates did bury alot of their ill-gotten gains in hopes of coming back for it or retiring with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing at best","review":"I am very disappointed with this watch. First, the instruction manual is indecipherable. It has very little to do with this actual watch. Second, although I am familiar with GPSr's and the problems with lost signals in adverse terrain, it is unacceptable that this watch wipes out all previous data every time it loses the GPS signal (which it does a lot, even under for what are ideal conditions for other GPSr's). So much for the \\"distance\\" function."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fades Away Quickly","review":"When I first got this watch I would go to a local park and run one or two laps at 2.2 miles per lap. The first five or six times I did this run, the watch was perfectly accurate with both the pace and the distance. Last time I ran two laps the watch measured the distance out to be 4.6 miles, .2 of a mile long, and earlier today it measured one lap out at 2.44 miles, a full quarter of a mile off over just 2.2 miles. Its just not reliable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as Advertised","review":"I received my Timex Ironman Triathlon Speed + Distance watch/pedometer today and just finished using it on an inline skating outing. The paved trail I skate on is mostly in the woods yet the GPS received kept a signal despite the foliage. I hooked the receiver to by belt which was underneath my shirt and still worked fine. There is a slight delay on your current speed however, it's about a 5 second delay but that was easy for me to overlook. Also, before I purchased it I thought there must be a cable connecting the watch and the GPS receiver and maybe it states this above and I am just a lazy reader, but the GPS receiver and the watch communicate wirelessly which was a big bonus for me.All in all it does what it says and $80 is about the best price I've found for a GPS pedometer watch (there was a sticker on the box that said $200)."},{"rating":"2","title":"AFU-RA CAME STRONG ON LONG AWAITED ALBUM","review":"AFU-RA BODY OF THE LIFE FORCE IS AN ILL ALBUM.

Second, the photo on the box is very deceiving. I knew it came with no furniture but I was expecting the wallpaper and curtains shown on the picture of the box, nope just cheap, plastic, empty walls.

But if you actually want to PLAY with it, which, i'm assuming, is essentially the purpose, then you're just outta luck with this house. There is just NO WAY to fit anything in this house....it's just too small! It's too small in 2 ways: 1) not enough rooms in the house and 2) not enough room in each room--you can't fit all your furniture in there--much less little hands. We mostly just use our Calico furniture out on our dining room table. I'd recommend purchasing a REALLY BIG doll house if you actually want to play with the Critters IN the house.

This is a classic case of someone gathering 'half-facts' to try and support their case and culling out the massive exculpatory evidence.If you react to a basic priciple of scripture it is natural to try an discredit the presenter of that truth so that one can salve their own conscience. However ad-hominem attacks cannot discredit a basic truth of scripture.

I was saddened to see many distortions of what Mr. Gothard's ministry (IBLP) really teachings on the principles of God's Word.

The views he holds regarding circumcision, grace, authority and much more are available to view.Im sure that, after comparing what this book claims that he teaches and actually seeing what he teaches, you will clearly see that the authors of this book have been sadly misinformed in their portrayal of Mr Gothard. The book makes a faulty presentation through either tweaking or embellishing biblical concepts in order to give them enough error that they are rejected on the whole.

This gleeful passing on of a bad report by Mr Veinot was later found to be untrue and the IBLP ministry was completely exonerated from the false charges. But Mr Veinot has failed to apologize or even remove his links from his webpage. His failure to report that the IBLP has been completely exonerated from these accusations shows that he is not being forthcoming and has done quite a disservice to the Christian cause.I have found this book to be likewise presented with the same approach.

With capable assistance from one of evangelical's leading scholars, Dr. Norm Geisler, the authors, have issued a rebuke and warning to Gothard, his followers and those who are integrally connected to them.

They further endorsed the Institute's work and strongly encourage others to take advantage of the good work that they are doing in and around the city. They further stated that the IBLP was an innocent victim of these false allegations.The author of this book should apoplogize for promoting these false allegations and write a retraction.

I pray that what ever animosity he has against Mr Gothard will be overcome by God's grace and that his eyes would be open to the truth. The time in our country is come to stand for what is right and as Paul tells us not to fellowship with darkness but rather reprove the deeds of darkness. I pray that Mr Veinot would have assurance of salvation that he may have true fellowship with the Lord and rebuke the divisive spirit that has overcome his thought life, and walk in true power to overcome the temptations of our enemy.

Along with Lonnie Donigan's version of Rock Island Line and Cumberland Gap, Last Train enjoyed a brief stint at the top of the pop charts in the UK in the late 50s. Skiffle died shortly thereafter, placing Country and Western in the position of least listenable music for this reviewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not MY Johnny Duncan!","review":"I'm sorry, but this is NOT the artist in whom I have been interested for the greater part of my life.The Johnny Duncan I WANT once recorded for Columbia Records, had hits such as Sweet Country Woman, Stranger, Slow Dancing, Atlanta Georgia Stray, She Can Put Her Shoes Under My Bed, Anytime, A Song In The Night, etc. (He also had hits with songstress Janie Fricke, who went on to become a hit maker herself.)However, since the time I first wrote this review, I ordered the Box Set of the \\"Skiffle\\" Johnny Duncan and found him to be excellent at that particular style of music.

If you want a truly incredible worship experience, buy this album, find a comfortable place, and just worship away. People buying this CD just to get every single Sonicflood CD, or just for the new songs, or just for the sake of musical enjoyment might find themselves disappointed, because yes, it does repeat songs off of their first album. However, I would recommend this album over the first one for the sole reason that is shows the passion these guys have (or had...since the band as we knew it is no more...), and while no recording can do any band justice, this one sure shows that the holy spirit came in power.

The longevity information is right up his alley, but this book is so packed with other great info and is so fun to read that I bent-up too many of the pages reading it and had to order a fresh one for him. Then I forced my bike-crazy husband to read the \\" Rolling Relationships\\" chapter #12, which was so illuminating and entertaining that it seems like it could be a book all it's own. Thanks to that, we're going to get a tandem.There's more surprises throughout the book. I didn't know about that osteoprorisis problem, but now I'm going to the weight room-my husband, too..

Much of the information is found in other cycling and exercise books. The chapter, \\"Rolling Relationships: Rules for Reconciling Significant Cycling and Significant Others\\" is where the authors show their colors and their testoserone levels. The general idea is that males rule cycling as a sport and as a way of life. Whatever they decide to do with their sporting life takes precedent over any personal relationship.

The best part is that these are working actors, successful and well respected by their colleagues but maybe not so well known to us.

I never have a problem with a well established band branching out into a new style, but this effort is substandard for a band that I've come to expect great things from.The beats are too straightforward, the songs are hard to distinguish, the choruses are repetitive, and it sounds like they stifled the band's most important & creative instrument, Jonathan's voice. He's been reduced to a piece of the band rather than the star that flies above, and interacts with, the dark & passionate instrumental melodies & harmonies we heard on past albums.I have come to expect great music from Korn over the years, and this album simply isn't great music.

At least, it heals all the wounds I have got after \\"Take a Look In the Mirror\\" which really sucked!

Then you have songs like throw me away and hyprocrites that also make the album very diffrent from their previous work. It is diffrent but at the same time you get to feel like this is still korn music. See you on the other side is a new korn and while alot of bands who try to replace a member many fans just won't feel like that's the band they liked since the begining. Korn is diffent. There may not be a second guitarest but this album shows that they're still korn and they will always make great music. Korn fans will not be dissapointed and will enjoy it alot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gone are the days of Ball Tongue","review":"I really miss Korn.

The stuff that made me love Korn in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I absolutely loved the first 4 korn albums. Personally, I think that they help release a lot of pent up frustration and anger (try listening while working out). So, although I've purchased the last few, I've grown more and more skeptical with the increasingly slow tempos and whiny themes of the songs. This new album is a huge disappointment. It sounds like emo-rock (a movement that couldn't go away soon enough)! It sounds like the group has given up the good fight. There's no more anger or drive. There's no need to put your fist through a wall or scream at the top of your lungs. Let's all just sit on our beds with our arms around our knees and cry a little. That's what this new album is...a whimper. I still love korn because of the strength of the earlier albums, but this stuff has to go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome! this is sweetness!","review":"twisted transistor-10/10politics-7/10hypocrites-7.5/10souvenir-5/1010 or a 2-way-3/10throw me away-10/10love song-7/10open up-10/10coming undone-7.9/10getting off-7/10liar-8/10for no one-9/10seen it all-?/10tearjerker-1/10 :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"This is album is very weak.

On one side of the coin it's experimentation where by they've pushed the boundaries of what old korn fans will accept and what new korn fans will either love or hate. And on the other it's pure unadulterated Mental deleerium and pyschopathic whirlpools of rage so much so now that John doesn't have to scream and shout and cry, it's more painful than that, past suicidal tendencies and verging on the unthinkable.

I listen to korn because I can actually understand what there saying, half the song does not consist of someone going AHHH! and he actually has vocal cords instead of grunting and screaming everthing. And what exactly is adult music, someone screaming at the top of their lungs for 4 minutes and giving it a title.

It pains me to think the greatness of Korn has passed, but perhaps the loss of Head will be too much for the band to overcome. I, as a fan, would rather see them \\"retire\\" than attempt to sell us on another album like this one. Jonathon needs to find more of the rage from within and drop more of those lyrics.

What I mean by that is; Jonathan Davis has no vocal melody patterns on the majority of this album. \\"Twisted Transistor\\" is probably one of the few songs that do.It seems like he's making his patterns up as he goes along, with no real repetitiveness or hooks. This makes it difficult as a listener to recall the songs later on (for example, singing them in your head). What Korn needs to do is return to repetitive patterns like they had on \\"Got the Life,\\" \\"Falling Away From Me,\\" and \\"Make Me Bad.\\" It's still possible for them to do that and keep their unique rock sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh god","review":"nu metal has never been my thing even thou my favourite band system of a down is addmittedly nu metal nu metal have always been ok they where the pioneers of nu metal but ive never really liked there work they are good for the genre there in but in standard terms i dont like them they seem to shouty admittedly they are innovitive at times but there isnt that much passion just break neck riffs i give it two because by there standards this is a good album any other korn album ive had the disadvantage of hearing would get 1 so if you like korn this is the one for you"},{"rating":"1","title":"ehh","review":"[...] I think the \\"insatiable craving to play with trouser snakes\\" drives one to talk about squirrel nuts and pole smoking.

But I guess that's to be expected when you ask a producer who's famous for making Avril Lavergne a pop star (threw up in my mouth) and mix that with Korn.

Flush this Korny log right down the toilet."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is something Madonna or Britney would have done","review":"Ok,How to start, i spent my money in this album, and it was a dissapointment, i've been a fan of Korn, since the beggining but i think that Brian \\"Head\\" Welch wasn't the only thing they have lost, they also lose their touch and for me this is the crappiest album i've ever heard in my entire life, none of the songs are good and im truly sorry to say this but this is a big dissapointment, it's good that Jonathan aint bitchin' bout his past anymore, but the change of new metal to pop crap rock is awful, cause this ain't heavy at all, and it took me by surprise cause it has been commented \\"the evolution of heavy\\", but these days there are heavier bands around. For any of you guys that it's planning to buy this album, don't spend your money in this, listen to their old stuff or any real heavy bands like Chimaira, Trivium or whatever you want to listen, but please don't spend your money in this, you will thank me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nu Crap!!!!!","review":"This is probably the worst album I've heard in my Life!!!!What a waste!!!!! Many years ago KORN defined a genre (Nu Metal).With this release they defined another one,..... NU CRAP!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great songs, a new direction","review":"Nu-metal has been dead for quite some time, but waning trends didn't keep Korn from dropping its best album in years. See You on the Other Side abandons the group's relentless angst for a groove-heavy but no less twisted sound.Virtually every track is a classic waiting to happen. From the opening ode to sex \\"Twisted Transistor\\" to the \\"We Will Rock You\\" beat of \\"Coming Undone,\\" Other Side is a sick head-bobbing delight. Where bands like Limp Bizkit (didja hear that Wes Borland re-joined the group? Didn't think so.) and Staind (whose sound hasn't changed over the last three albums) have faded since the late \`90s, Korn marches on through the funky sludge of seven-string guitars and depraved lyricism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why not??","review":"First off, there should be a warning label on this album. It should read something to the effect of: \\"Die hard korn fans beware: Different sound and direction is on this CD. Open minded listeners are appreciated.\\"Yes, this is very different from what we know of korn. It's closest comparasion would be to Issues (which I did not really care for). This album is very industrial and is riddled with samples and loops. I was worried about the one guitar sound but it is pulled off well (and well, you can do MUCH in the studio). The lyrics are the biggest improvment. Well thought out and meaningful. With all these differences this is not to say there are not a few \\"back to basics\\" tunes on here. Liar and 10 or a 2 way are examples of that.So yeah, why not make this album? They just released a greatest hits album and their co-founding guitarist left. Why not take a chance and experiment? Great work and and a great buy for the open minded music fan. Thanks for reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally...Different!","review":"wow, koRn has finally done it! This is probably their best work since their self titled debut album, life is peachy and follow the leader! this really puts them in a different state of mind musically and emotionally. no more talking about bad childhoods, something different! KoRn, keep on rocking your doing it! my fav. tracks are TearJerker, and Hypocrite, and Love Song"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, but definitly could have been better.....","review":"Let me start off by saying old korn fans are proabably not going to like this album. If you liked untouchables, most likley youll love 'See you on the other side\\" because its an untouchables type album. Being a big fan of 'Take a look in the mirror\\" I was dissapointed by this album, but its not horrible. It definitly grows on you.The standout tracks are Liar, Hypocrites, Twisted Transistor, For No one,and Coming undone which has an awesome beat. The thing that changed most on here was the way jon sings. Its more higher then usual.Bottom like you should check this cd out because even tough its not great, its interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"New KoRn in a new and kick A$$ way!!!!","review":"Despite the fact people will give different stars for this album, all the reviews seem to be the same thing in general. All i can say that hasn't been said yet is that KoRn is just as heavy as eevr, just in a new, refined way. This album isn't all about hate and rape, but this album still contains true to life, everyday things such as: politics, love, lies, self regret....the works. This new sound KoRn has found is definately different from anything you've heard before from KoRn. They had their sound stolen by many bands, and now they created a new one. Stick near the sound KoRn. It rocks, so please check it ouy. If you've \\"lost hope\\", give them this last chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ready...set...SUCK!","review":"This album is where Korn died...at least to me it is. I thought everything before this was great, and then from here on out Korn just lost it. They got too emo and mainstream with this. Their second self-titled tried to pick it up a little...but was still way too mainstream. And now with Korn III - Remember Who You Are...it's just too little too late. It sounds so bland. I wish Korn would take some advice from their album title and remember who they were."},{"rating":"1","title":"The end of an era","review":"Let me start off by saying this isn't a bad album. It doesn't blend in with the \\"nu-metal heap\\" or anything, it is worth listening to, but if you're an old school Korn fan who was far less than content with Issues and/or Untouchables stay away. There are two major problems with this cd that I can pinpoint exactly: 1)only one guitarist...there's nothing wrong with munky, but there's only one of him, 2)NO SLAP BASS!!! I miss fieldy's slap bass...hearing the smack of every note as he pounded it out was incredible, and it's gone. To me, that sound coupled with Jon's voice was Korn's identity. On a larger scale, the whole album just doesn't sound as great as it could have. Have of the stuff is too melodic nu-metalish, and the other half is too Nine Inch Nailsish. I was hoping Korn would be able to continue with the lose of Brian, and though they are, their change in sound will not appeal to old school fans, but it will most definetly bring in a new generation of fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed Old school Korn fan","review":"I must say that I am really disappointed with this CD. I just bought and after listening to it for less than an hour, and had to stop. I do understand that bands need to evolve and that the days of their first album and of Peachy will not ever come back, but this is not what I expected at all. I expected some changes in the sound, thanks to Head leaving, but that was it. The whole dynamic of their song writing process have changed. I do not feel the connection I used to feel when they were my all time favorite band. New Korn fans will probably appreciate it, because it is not bad musically. It still has some hard riffs and the music is ok, but the lyrics are not there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A complete guide to small business image development","review":"\\"Some entrepreneurs view their smallness as such a negative thing that they hardly make an effort to gain lucrative corporate clients.

There are MANY cities and towns in the U.S. having 4-year colleges .... and this book perhaps looks at 0.5% of the total number .... Perhaps I should have looked at the book's page count before I bought it. That would have been a clue to the low number of cities and towns covered.

But despite the great pains the author takes in the introductory chapter to tell us how many miles he traveled in researching it, for anyone -- like me -- who has looked into the subject a little Choose a College Town will feel slim and superficial, with a decided tilt toward the places -- Santa Cruz and Bennington, VT, e.g -- that the author already knows well. I could also do without the cutesy (?) borrowing of obvious 60's song titles for chapter sub-heads. Exam this in-store before buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Choose a College Town for Retirement","review":"I was very disappointed also with this book.

Obviously a lot of the construction is plastic, but the inner metal portion doesn't feel very solid either. I haven't tried, but it seems like you could pry this off with a crow-bar.Some of you will note that this type of lock is usually meant to discourage (not prevent) a thief. In this aspect, the lock met my expectations. Still, I can't see someone being overly discouraged by this lock.As far as postiives, I like that the key hole has a cover, and after using this for about a year, I haven't noticed any fading or discoloration.Buy it, if you like, or consider a more expensive (and more secure) option. I'll keep using it, but I wouldn't buy it again, if given the opportunity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buying peace of mind","review":"I use this in conjunction with a tire lock and a master lock on top of the coupler. The idea is to make the premise of stealing my camper as difficult as possible. This lock seems to be well built and does fit well into the coupler but it is a little loose. This is a solid, heavy unit but I don't think anything is perfect. I would suggest using as many locks and deterrents as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Security","review":"It may be hard to believe how many trailers get stolen because some thief pulls up, hooks up, and is gone.

It seems to me an aggressive thief could pry this lock off, but of course I have not tried it. It fits a little loosley in my 2 5/16\\" hitch but does it's job.My main complaint with this lock is removing the insert that fits into the hitch ball area as it slides backwards to release the lock. Almost every time when taking this off we have ended up with nasty grease on your hands from inside the hitch ball area. I highly recommend using disposable plastic gloves when removing. Obviously a learning curve to pay attention to this messy situation.I do recommend the lock and would buy it again, just be aware that it can be messy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lock is just okay","review":"The lock is cheaper than the picture shows and barely fits on my trailer because of the type of coupler on the Haulmark. I bought two locks, but have 3 trailers so I can use them on the other trailers. The ball that fits up into the hole I thought was solid metal, that's why it is not shown in the picture, it is just two pieces of metal tacked together in the shape of a ball.

This device seems to be made well, but the \\"hood\\" does not actually fit a standard 2\\" hitch. Yes, the ball fits inside the hitch just fine, but the hood is not wide enough to actually slip fully over the outside of the hitch. So putting this lock onto my hitch even one time fully scratched up the hitch. The hood cannot fit around the hitch so it just ends up rubbing the hitch.But, the lock does work and it stays locked on with the hitch clasp in the up or down position. So I still give it two stars. But for me, I will glue some rubber strips into the inside of hood and then at least it can function as a good lock without scratching."},{"rating":"1","title":"It works great right up until they stole our trailer","review":"Got the lock and a trailer to fit it in Oct 19, 2008 and on Feb 9, 2010 somebody stole the trailer with the lock right on it out from in front of our house.

That Branagh fellow in 'Dead Again' defines the malaise. In the flop under discussion, Bob H is meant to be a cheery con-man monk from the deep south.His inability to hit a single convincing vowel is made further excruciating by the slides into dud South African or, more understandable, his native south London drawl.

I found the characters quirky in an enjoyable manner and that the setting created a fun sense of some parts of London and environs that I have enjoyed.

It is evidently an attempt to write a modern multi-cultural PC version of Margery Allingham's great London detective stories ('Tiger in the Smoke' 'The China Governess' and 'Hide My Eyes') but it fails. One of the child characters in 'The China Governess' is introduced into the novel as an adult and is an assembly of cliches.The sense of London, so profound and chilling in Allingham's work is lost and the presentation of the city is shallow and indeed journalistic. Worse, there are authorial interventions ventriloquised via certain approved characters which read like op-ed pieces for the Independent newspaper. I'd recommend that readers try Allingham rather than Stevenson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suprisingly amateurish","review":"I was surprised at just how poorly written this humorless little book is. Ms. Stevenson is an established author and a professor, so it pains me to say that London Bridges has the distinct whiff of Creative Writing 101. Perhaps she is trying to prove a point about the state of British publishing by passing off one of her students' fumbling attempts as a real book.

They are all here. I tried reading the book, but couldn't get past the first chapter, so I thought I'd try the audio book. That was even worse. The dialogue is embarrassing and the writing sounds even worse read out loud.

Instead, Gomez goes for progressive hard rock. At their best, Gomez sound annoyingly like Pearl Jam (\\"Do One,\\" \\"Where Ya Going?\\"). At their worst, Gomez regularly serve up stale riffs and a healthy dose of meandering bull----. I dare anyone to make it through the CD's finale without lunging for the remote and punching mute.Standout Tracks: None, though if a gun were held to my head, I'd choose \\"Do One.\\"For more reviews, visit http://unpaidrockcritic.typepad.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"what's the difference?","review":"I think the biggest (and possibly ONLY) difference between \\"Split the Difference\\" and previous Gomez albums is the presence of Tchad Blake as producer. The drums are more up front and driving the songs rather than filling in atomosheric room as on their other efforts. The voices also seemed to be mixed differently - more distinct and present, yet sounding more part of the instrumentals. Every sound and texture just seems bigger on this album, but you can still hear those individual guitar parts. And it's still Gomez - the songwriting, the melodies, the sing-a-long quality. But it's refreshing to hear Gomez through another producer's ears (all previous Gomez albums were self-produced). It would be interesting for their next album to invite George Martin (the Beatles' producer) into the studio..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money, pick a few songs to download","review":"Real quick review: The album opens up with 2 solid tracks, then derails.

The temperature settings appear to be accurate, as is the timer. The only problem I have with the unit is: The maximum time you can set for cooking is 15 minutes and then it automatically turns off.

Frozen foods cooked in it sometimes aren't heated as evenly as they could be, but it's close enough.Before buying it, I noticed another review that said it made a loud noise when it ran. The noise is just the wind-up timer (silly person!) which really isn't that big of a deal.It's a good value for the price. But like many toaster ovens in the same price range, it's built to be disposable. Over time the finish/trim has gotten stained from cooking, and it just doesn't clean up 100%. The chrome discolors from the heat and food. The white exterior has gotten little stains that don't always come off. I hate to say it but I suspect I'll have to throw it away before it's 5 yrs old.

The bra baby's holes are too big and allow the straps and such to come out. I do like the bra ball much better just wish it allowed for larger size cups. Thank you for the product.

Anyway, I placed one bra in each of the 2 balls and was excited to drop them in the washing machine. The feeling of seeing my bras damaged when I took them out of the balls was anything but excitement. However, I really wanted to believe the reviews since there are so many raving out here, so I blamed myself for not following the instructions properly and managed to test (destroy) a third bra.

The second album was recorded in 1965 at The Shadows in Washington, D.C. The last album was recorded in 1968 at Eugene's in San Francisco. This is an excellent document of Woody Allen's early years as a standup comedian. And it's funny, too. The recording quality isn't really the best, though. And the transitions between the three different shows are sometimes awkward, especially when it switches from the earlier mono shows to the later stereo show. The two discs here are split into four parts which are 20 or so minutes long each, duplicating the four sides of the original double album. Most of the material here is quite funny, with Allen playing a similar persona to the one he played in his early films.

I rarely do reviews on books that I didn't like, but I'll make an exception in this case.

The reader is forced to read through every little detail about the job, including road directions that you could actually follow, directions that are often repeated. Details are important to flesh out mission impossible style plots, but this is a very basic armored car take-down at an out of the way cafe. The adjoining plot has more potential, but never really builds up any suspense or momentum. There is a daily bathroom break for someone Parker has \\"on ice\\", and that's real exciting too.

True that the battle system leaves a little to be desired butI personally throroughly enjoy building little hamlets for troops, and wandering around finding lost chests, creatures carrying items and generally enjoying the rpg story line, the main plot is straightforward and engaging, the sidequests are fun and intriguing. over all it's got marvelous graphics, decent voice overs, you have to give kudo's to any game that gives sound to every single sentence the character's speak, excellent character customability, and hours worth of good old fashion goblin bashing. my only gripes with the game is your character is human, no choosing race there, and you have to build towns to get troops. don't get me wrong, i love empire building games, i'm just not used to doing it and an rpg at the same time.it's just..odd. but over all i love the game and forsee many many more hours of fun game play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't run","review":"Before you buy this game, I'd recommend you read through the Forum for Spellforce and see just how many people are having problems with it not running.

Their website offers no help except the discussion boards suggest they may issue a patch to fix this at the end of the year or the begining of next year! That's just TOO long to wait. Why didn't it say this on the box? If it had I wouldn't of bothered obviously. Add to this that it locked up my computer and even their latest patch didn't fix the compatability problem...

There are many opportunities for fun (and educational) play here.We purchased additional cars and another engine at the same time, adding yet more fun (and educational) play for our 2 1/2yo son.Brio makes wonderful toys.

He has enjoyed playing with it for several months. Now 21 months old, he's old enough to totally destroy it, but it holds up to his abuse. It's definitely well made.When he plays with it, he gets a kick out of the different colors and the tracks on which the beads fly. It's almost a lesson in physics, learning that the beads will stop in certain areas, and they'll go really fast in others. He doesn't seem to ever get bored with it -- usually I tire first.Also, the size of this particular version makes it relatively portable. My sister often tosses it in an overnight bag, or brings it in the car to entertain him.

So, for the whole first tune I just had to look away. Then I realized it's all off by the same amount, at which point I knew there was hope. So with a difference of 105ms between when I see the video and when I hear the sound (sound before video), it got pretty good. If I could have gone further I would have, but my TV lags 105ms.Dave Weckl absolutely kills at 1hr10mins! And everyone else is great as well. If you make the adjustment described above, this is well worth a viewing. Otherwise, it's still worth a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Light on the Steel Drums","review":"Nice music, relaxing, etc. but not a lot of steel drum sound to it. Mostly guitar with background. Don't expect party dancing kind of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY LIGHT ON STEEL DRUMS","review":"This CD should be titled Tropical Music with other percussion. The music is good, but not what I expected by the title. Guitar is what you get mostly (80-85%) and when the steel drums finally come it is overshadowed by guitar. As far as Caribbean I would say not so much, more Hawaiian. As a tropical CD you will not be disappointed, but if you are looking for steel drums it isn't here, not one song is exclusively steel drums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"The first disappointment for this book was the simplistic diaglogue. It is written, roughly, on a 7th grade grammer levelIt is a sweet story, but shallow. Then I picked up Anna, Grandmother of Jesus by Heartsong. There is no comparison for depth and content. There are several appendix & resource information in this second book. If you want more than a sweet story read the other book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought it - dumped it!","review":"Just reviewing to lower the average overall rating here. Trying to save some bucks for the masses.Books like these are exactly the reason why some people do not understand mathematics. These people always complicate the abstracts in their head and get stuck in a rut. What does this book do? It encourages that kind of thinking.Stay away from it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Insufferable","review":"This is the only book I have ever thrown into the trash and then fetched back to tear in half. In the front it mentions that the author had numerous (short?) teaching engagemnents. I know why. The author writes as if practicing in front of a mirror. Very self-indulgent prose.For a good example of how a tough subject can be handled beautifully for non-mathematicians try Simon Singh's \\"Fermat's Enigma\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Math as beauty","review":"If you need a practical introduction to basic calculus technique, you would be better served by Silvanus Thompson's Calculus Made Easy. If you want to gain some understanding of why calculus is, like the cathedrals or the music of J.S. Bach, one of the greatest achievements of the human mind, try this. Depending on your temperment, you will either want to pitch it out a window or keep on your nightstand. If you dislike art, music, or poetry you would do well to leave it alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Death is preferable to reading this cutesy fluff!","review":"I will not detail the things wrong with David Berlinski as a writer; the other reviewers (those giving his book two stars or less) have done an admirable job of describing the shortcomings of this book. I will say this: The book is so bad that if I was given a choice of reading it in its entirety, or being shot at sunrise, I would tear the book to shreds (to spare future genrations from having to read the book....a fate worse than death) and eagerly and joyfully await the dawning of a new day and even give the firing squad the order to fire! All first aid stations should have a copy of this book at their disposal. Why? If someone has taken poison then just reading a few lines at random from the book will cause the poisoned individual to throw-up, thus saving their life! Mr. Berlinski are a mathmetician but a writer he ain't!! His book deserves an infinity of negative stars but unfortunately the smallest number of stars available was a positive one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy book on a great subject","review":"I can see why most of the reviews of this book in Amazon are either very good or very bad. This is one of those books that you either love or hate - I hated it. The book has a very noble aim - to explain the basics of calculus in easy non-mathematical language to the layman. Throw in history of the theorems and mathematicians as well, and you should have a winning combination in theory. What killed this book for me is the writing style. I abhorred the way in which this book was written. Berlinksi rambles on and on about anything and everything. I don't know why he has to constantly refer to calculus as \\"the calculus\\". In summary, this book did not go too well with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tornado of projectile words","review":"I am a graduate of a top college, I teach calculus, and all I can say say is...what point is Berlinski trying to make with any of this? And why does he feel a need to use obscure words...to show off his vocabulary? He calls Descartes \\"valetudinarian\\", when he could have just said \\"sickly\\". With regard to mathematics, he makes errors and fails to clarify ideas. With regard to language, he creates ridiculous (and inappropriate) metaphors. What a windbag. What a waste of my time. And what a waste of time for anyone trying to learn calculus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly enjoyable","review":"As a returning Math student of many years I wanted to read something inspirational, not mathematical. This book certainly didn't disappoint. I was thrilled by the thoughtful and simple analogies that brought the mathematics that I knew in my heart as well as my head out of the obscure. Yes, the words are big and some rare vocabulary, but nothing that should discourage anyone from reading the book. I recommend it to anyone interested in mathematics and being inspired by it. Very Good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I have been searching 30 years for this book.","review":"When I took my first course in calculus, \\"bilingual education\\" meant a German graduate assistant lecturing American engineering students on a subject replete with Greek. And all we did was proofs. As I wandered the dorm at 2am, looking for upperclassmen to help me, I was filled with a despair deeper than anything I have felt since. When I found that the juniors and seniors didn't understand either, I fell to memorizing. Until this book, I still thought that little delta and little epsilon were on the same axis. I have always felt ashamed, and cheated, about my lack of understanding. Thank you, Divid Berlinski for helping me to see the light. I loved the book. I loved the glimpses into the personalities and the history of math. I loved all the little personal stories; I found them to be helpful in remembering.(I did have a problem with the picture of the mean value theorem. Why is the label \\"t-a\\" applied to the chord rather than the t axis? any help?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Annoying","review":"This book is painful to read. I tried but could not come close to finishing this book. Berlinski is way to wordy for his own good. Please don't waste your money and time on such a sad excuse for a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORRRING!","review":"Boring. I was not at all interested in the ramblings of the author about his summer vacations to europe. There is the promise of an interesting book unfulfilled here. I hope Berlinski will write another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Calculus lost in verbiage","review":"Good luck to those who try to extract the concepts of calculus from this endless stream of verbiage. For the novice, the only way to follow this book would be to first gain an understanding of the calculus from other sources before trying to find a way through this morass of words."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mixed Bag","review":"I can definitely see the split of high and low reviews given this book. I thought the book was pretty good at giving an explanation of calculus concept and key theorems (especially on the differential calculus side). I particularly liked his explanation of the construction of the reals from the rationals by cuts in the number line. I recently reviewed a formal exposition of this that left me brain dead for several hours. On the other hand, Berlinski's cutesy anecdotes are horrid in the extreme. His use of the term \\"the calculus\\" instead of just \\"calculus\\" was also both pretentious and obnoxious. The writing style is not to my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star NOT","review":"I have taught calculus for the past 20 years and I consider it one of the ( if not the) greatest achievements and the most beautiful constructs(or findings?) of the human mind.In the hands of MR.Berlinski it turns into a gargoyle,even worse it turns into a heap of shapless being (if any). I rated the book with one star because I had no other option. My honest opinion is that it desreves a star NOT."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretentious drivel obscures a beautiful topic","review":"This book has good potential - explain in a non-technical way the fundamental theorem of calculus, why it is important, and the history of it's development. The mathematicians who discovered and refined calculus are a fascinating lot, and the mathematics itself has proven to be perhaps the most effective engineering tool yet discovered. Sounds like good stuff. Unfortunately, Berlinski choose to shroud this simple theme in page after page of self-important, over-written, pretentious drivel. One of the reviews on the jacket puts this book in the same category as Godel, Escher, Bach - holy smokes! Nothing could be further from the truth. Buy GEB, stay away from this book!I give him 2 stars instead of one because the material underlying the terrible writing is interesting and worth knowing. Hopefully someone will write a readable book on this material!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Detour of the Calculus","review":"I'm not sure what audience this book was written for. Those who know about calculus will be annoyed by the mistakes, sloppy proofs, pointless anecdotes, and the author's writing style. Those who don't know about calculus but are hoping to learn more will probably be lost for the same reasons.As others have said, the fictionalized accounts of historical figures are ridiculous. If fiction with Newton, Liebniz, et al. as characters sounds interesting, read the Baroque series by Neal Stephenson. The historical development of math is interesting by itself - just tell us the facts! Who cares if Berlinski thinks Newton would enjoy pleasant evenings in steamy pubs with a glass of bitter in hand?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bore!","review":"This book is such a drag- not for the math bit, but the non-mathematical sections. The stories and ramblings are absolutely unnecessary, and detract from the substance. The problem is that the stories are inextricably intertwined with the math, and quite impossible to skip if you don't want to miss the math bit. To the extent I was able to drag on, the calculus portions seemed great, but it became too tiresome going through the flab.The great book on calculus has to be \\"How to enjoy Calculus\\" by Eli S. Pine- a book I regret not having known in my school days."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a jerk","review":"I had such high hopes for this book. After studying Pure Mathematics in college I wanted something to tie it all together. If Berlinski were to remove all of his assanine sidelines, idiotic metaphors, and embarrassing commentary this could have been the book. I only came away with the feeling that this guy, Berlinski, is a real jerk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not learning any math here","review":"As other reviewers have said, this book is verbose and teaches little math. Sometimes in Sunday papers, I read these accounts of chess matches. These can be entertaining, even w/o an understanding of the chess moves. This book is like those columns. It's describes math, but doesn't teach it. In fact, the few pages devoted to actual math are in a small font & are quite terse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kill Me Now! Please!","review":"Reading this book is like performing open heart surgery on yourself: It's painful and the chances of completing the task are slim."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not A Calculus Made Easy, But A Good Book","review":"There is no doubt in my mind that this book is not supposed to be similar to Silvanus Thompson's Calculus Made Easy or books of that sort, rather this book is a literary journey through calculus that is not meant to teach you how to do it, but more or less teach you how it was brought about. I found the book to be verbose at times, but on the whole, decent reading material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Calculablahblahblah","review":"I bought this book a while ago and, fortunately, seem to have lost it. The soporific verbiage, the self-aggrandizing tone, the useless tinsel that masquerades as prose, an incredible inability to obviate the obvious, \\"wit\\" that withers like a dehydrated plant...hey wait, am I droning on? Am I beginning to sound like Berlinski?If you can get through 4 pages of the excerpt posted, you deserve this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"why mathematicians should stick to math","review":"Without any doubt, the single worst book I have ever read in my life. If you cherish the sanctity of your own mind, stay away from this book at all costs. It is convoluted, poorly written, and only complicated my knowledge of THE calculus. Berlinkski seems to rely on a very big thesarus to attempt to convey any point he tries to make. I got absolutely nothing out of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Calculus crushed to death by weight of the English Language","review":"Berlinsky simply tries too hard to wax poetic. He needed to decide at the outset, is this a math book or a rhapsody in the key of Calculus? He waxes and digresses, seduced by his own overwrought prose which takes him places I'm sure his mother warned him about and I suspect very few readers followed him. I was game enough to tag along for 100 pages out of respect for the subject, but could hold my nose no longer. Where were the man's editors for God's sake?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the Calculus isn't Interesting","review":"I wanted to better understand the calculus, because I thought the topic would turn out to be fascinating. I had just read Einstein's \\"Relativity,\\" which, in simple terms, explained the theory in a way that made me think differently about the world. Berlinski, however, didn't let the calculus stand on its own. He used outlandishly flowery language that constantly distracted me from what he was trying to explain. The more I read the book, the more I said to myself, \\"He thinks he's such a good writer....\\" The more I read, the more I thought to myself, \\"Perhaps the calculus isn't that interesting after all.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigma(Parts) >>>>> Whole","review":"For those who love Mathematics - buy another book. For those who love Prose - buy another book. This is an excellent book for a Middle School writing teacher in need of bad examples to show students! The author should be pitied, the editor fired, and the buyer refunded. I bought this book hoping for a novel view of Calculus, and perhaps some interesting history of the personalities who shaped it. Instead, I found the most pretentious drivel I've ever read. If you want an entertaining book about Mathematics, read Leonard Mlodinow's \\"Euclid's Window\\". This is not a review - it's a Public Service Announcement. Save the Trees!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the worst writer of prose ever!","review":"I bought this book expecting a great read that would elaborate on the history and the beauty of calculus. Instead I got one of the most pretentious and out-of-touch books ever written. The only joy I got from this book was reading passages to my roomates laughing out loud. I still reference this book in conversations years later as the worst book I ever read.One chapter sums up the book better than I ever could: \\"Yo.\\" Berlinski decides to explain irrational numbers using a proof that the square root of 2 is not a rational number. To do this, he says: \\"The ancient proof is unassailable and proceeds with the irritating authority of a waking nightmare, one of those squalid episodes, say, in which a disheveled taxi driver, unshaven and no-necked, turns and addresses you insolently, but with perfect and disturbing confidence. . .\\" He then LITERALLY has the cabbie spout out the proof using \\"yo\\"s and \\"chief\\"s to give it that \\"real\\" feel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book with no audience","review":"A dilettante can't gain by this book. In the author's baroque style, the math message is lost on the uninitiated. A mathematician, on the other hand, may have an uneasy feeling trying to decipher the author's intended meaning at the flourishes the book is replete with. Two examples from a single page (18) bring the problem to the fore:\\"...but in mathematics distance is defined by reference to a space of some sort and is thus a concept that requires, among other things, a fixed point...\\" (A.B.: needing a fixed point is a clear misnomer.)\\"The number 10 is, after all, nothing more than ten of those 1,s; and with the number 100,000, it is more of the same - 1's strung out as far as the eye can see.\\" (A.B.: What's then 1,000,000? Andwhat's to make it different from 10,000,000? Should one climb the Everest to make it possible to count that far?)The book is absurd; the back cover reviews by The New York Times and SF Chronicle are utterlymisleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guilding the Lily","review":"Way too much metaphor. The overly florid linguistic style completely obscures the supposed object of the text...namely Calculus. Or said another way, it is REALLY hard to winnow out the extremely convoluted forays into an infinity of non-related domains to figure out what in the hell is Calculus anyway. Or, said another way, the author tries to hard to be clever and in so doing travels from New York to New Jersey in an eastward direction...to use a metaphor. I tried to get through it I really did. I have tried three times, but failed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful inflight to the real math","review":"Mr. Berlinski book has made me see, through a powerful pedagogical lens, that most mathematics books, Calculus in particular, are a distilled and purified product of a brew made from the blood, sweat and tears of many mathematicians across the centuries. The next time I pick up a textbook and read \\"it easily follows\\" or \\" it is clearly evident\\", I'll know for sure that those words are, at least, presumptuous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars","review":"This is one of the worst books that I ever thrown away. I like recreational math, but this book is not about math. This book is about David Berlinski's masturbatory writing and his European vacation. He loses the reader and his own train of thought in his flowery run-on sentences.He is a horrible teacher and cannot express simple ideas clearly. Albert Einstein said, \\"if you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.\\" Apparently, David Berlinski understand neither calculus or writing well enough. If you are reading this, Mr. Berlinski, I recommend Strunk and White's \\"The Elements of Style.\\" Please."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hate It.","review":"I hate this book. I bought it because its writing looked informal and intimate, but I soon realized that the writing style is pompous and cryptic, the writer turning what I had dearly hoped might be the one easily-accessible and enjoyable book on calculus, into a hellish morass of insider references and pretentious SAT snob words. If you've ever heard Dennis Miller's stand-up \\"comedy\\", with all his exclusionary insider references, you have a very good idea of what this \\"Diane Chambers\\" of a book is all about. My advice? If you're looking for an easily-accessible book on calculus, I'm afraid you're just going to have to keep waiting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book!","review":"I found this book an absoloute delight. With all due respect, I think those reviewers who have found the book boring and confusing, are the ones who have studied calculus and passed the exams with good grades without having underestood the philosophy behind it."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless rant. Editor should have cut the non-math stuff.","review":"I read this book by jumping over the author's meandering way off topic which is just a worthless rant, Maybe he things he is Proust? Toss this guy over the side. If your are looking for a literary look at mathematics that will walk you through the ideas and proofs therein (including calculus, continuity, and limits) I recommend instead that you are David Foster Wallaces \\"A History of Infinity\\" (Here is a review I wrote of that [...])"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"David Berlinski's writing in this book is so terrible that I couldn't bear to read past the first chapter; and I love math!

The book starts off slow, with a history of calculus, but then speeds on with much more interesting topics. Mr. Berlinski's style is both lighthearted and easy to read, especially if you really have asked yourself, \\"why was calculus invented?\\" In summary, a good read that I heartily recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"not even bad","review":"Read all of the bad reviews, then read this book just to see that it is impossible to describe in mere words how truly terrible this author's writing style is. This book is truly deserving of zero stars, assuming negative stars or anti-stars are unavailable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Can't We All Just Get Along?","review":"Berlinski's effort to explain calculus in terms of its historical development will motivate students and teachers for years to come. This book puts a human touch on a dry and impersonal subject. It helps to have some math knowledge, but simple intellectual curiosity will do for most. Read the excerpt - it captures the overall tone of the book very well.Berlinski's challenges to the neo-Darwinism establishment earned him enough enemies to last a lifetime. The thought that some of them reviewed this book is unavoidable. The interested reader might consider discounting some of the more personal attacks in evaluating this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive","review":"As I recline gently in my reproduction eighteenth-century leather-backed desk chair, my hulking athletic frame weary from the day's toils, I breathe a sigh, and casually reflect upon my Berlinski reading experience. Each evening for the previous fortnight I had curled up in front of the warm, flickering fire, book in hand, brandy at side, and marveled at how many adjectives could be strung together merely through the prolific use of commas. Oh calculus, noblest of mathematical fields, will my weary intellect ever fully comprehend your vast depths and many intricacies? As I remorselessly toss this volume onto the hungry flames I feel a flood of relief overcome my body, heightening my spirits with the knowledge that I would not have to read this drivel again.If you enjoyed plodding through this wordy (and poorly written) review just to find out that I thought this book was not worth the paper it was printed on, then by all means buy this book. It's for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hugely Disappointing","review":"I am not a mathematician. I took calculus in college but never really understood it. I have, however, always wanted to understand it.This book got glowing reviews so I bought it without leafing through it. My mistake. Compared to Berlinsky's book, the average college calculus textbook is a model of clarity.Berlinsky is infatuated with words. He's never heard of a simple declarative sentence. One metaphor per sentence isn't enough. Indeed, if there is a literary conceit he doesn't indulge in to excess, I can't think of it.His editor should have required him to read Strunk and White's Elements of Style daily for a year.In short, as far as I am concerned, the other negative reviews I have read here are not only right on the money but not harsh enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried twice to finish it, I really did...","review":"This time I picked it up thinking I could finish it because I'm teaching calculus this term. I knew the prose was absurdly flowery, to the point of severe distraction, but I thought I could get some nice images and phrases for my students. But I can't read any more. It's like listening to a Dan Fogelberg song. The points Berlinksi wants to make are terribly contorted in order to fit around his intended imagery. I must look elsewhere. Berlinki cannot help since he's just too full of himself here. I will not give this book to the library. I'll throw it in a Goodwill bin and hope they only charge a quarter for it. It is worth that. I'd throw it in the trash but I can't do that to any book."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is a book about Berlinski, not about calculus","review":"If Berlinski's literary talent was only half as big as his ego then he would have been a good writer. Unfortunately, that is not the case. It was not bad enough to confuse the readers with awkward explanations of math concepts but he had to make us endure his pompous prose and annoying literary interludes. Add to this open contempt for the readers and you will get a book for masochists.What people other than masochists will tolerate an author to tell them that he feels sorry for them because they can not comprehend a particular mathematical theorem? This on top of having to endure his amateurish attempt to write prose.I read the book several years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concepts, but puzzling English.","review":"What I hoped I'd get from this book is a simple introduction to the concepts of Calculus. I've taken Calculus before, but I wanted to really understand it.I felt like the author used too many obscure metaphors. The English was unnecessarily advanced.It didn't hold my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this book","review":"I agree with the other reviewers who gave this 1 or 2 stars. This is a tedious book that doesn't help someone enjoy the beauty of math. Why the author takes pages and pages creeping up on the description of the number line is incomprehensible. This book was so disappointing and needlessly wordy that I couldn't finish it. Buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good book to make you sleep","review":"I don't know how many times I fell a sleep while reading this book. The excessively verbose descriptions go on and on and on... I do not recommend it to anyone who wants to read an enlightening math book.The book also contains an egregious and intolerable mathematical error. He leaves out the important \\"dx\\" in every integration. As the derivative of F, \\"dF/dx\\" means the ratio of the differential of F (dF) to the differential of x (dx). Integration has to contain the \\"dx\\" so that the anti-differentiation is applied to dF rather than to the derivative."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tour of the Calculus","review":"I took several calculus courses in college in the fifties and sixties. Until reading this book I never had a fundamental understanding of the calculus, and only got through by memorizing some of the tricks. Berlinski has the uncommon talent of lucid, interesting exposition married with rigorous grounding in mathematics. He joins a small list of scientist/writers such as Richard Feynman,Richard Dawkins, and Brian Greene, all who have the ability to make the reader enjoy the study of difficult subject matter. For some, Berlinski's detours into history and the creation of imagined domestic scenes may be an aggravation. For me, they provided comic relief at exactly the right moments. The use of an imagined, or maybe real, class of calculus students is an excellent didactic technique, and the students offer more than a little comedy of their own. Buy this book and read it twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"Wordy, prose filled, book with little math. There are many heavy hitters in this field.

There was literally no interviews at all with Rob in this DVD. I actually got bored with it, which should say something because usually anything having to do with Rob has my full and utmost attention.

The plants came from various nurseries, so I don't think it was the plants. The salvia is yellowing out now. Don't want to lose them so will stop using the product on them. The geraniums on the other hand LUV this stuff. I have never seen such great reactions on a geranium before. Due to the fact that no warnings are given for certain plants, I give this a one star and am still insecure to use it on anything except the geraniums. P.S. I am also seeing negative results on begonias, but not as bad as the impatiens.

This 29-track double-disc is better than 'Up Up Up' and 'To the Teeth' combined. The bad news - this means that I only like about 8 of the 29 songs here. Ani's funk attempts haven't improved much, the low-key acoustic songs get the sound right but often drag noticeably. A lot of fans have advised people to \\"give it a chance.\\" I would agree with that if I thought that time and attention would pay off. But I just don't play this CD much. I never had to be 'forced' to play the 'Puddle Dive' and 'Out of Range' CDs. Her earlier work COMPELLED my attention. 'Revelling/Reckoning' is so lengthy and hit-and-miss, the great tracks like \\"Garden of Simple\\" & \\"Subdivision\\" are hard to spot. (Though the song \\"Grey\\" is absolutely wonderful). If I buy Ani's CDs in the future, it will be more out of consumer habit than out of eagerness. If you buy this CD, feel no shame in actively using your CD programmer. You may find you need it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poetic and mellow - but she's done better","review":"Ani DiFranco's poetry is always beautiful and insightful. What is lacking in this CD is her charismatic energy and variation of music within a collection. The songs are uncharacteristically similar and many of the soft beats are uninspiring. Each of Ani's albums are different and wonderful in their own right, but this fan expected something else and something more - not 2 CDs worth of music to fall asleep by."},{"rating":"2","title":"A more mature Ani","review":"Revelling / Reckoning is a much more musically and lyrically mature album than her previous discs. Myriad shades of tone, myriad gradients of lyric, and a more complex interaction of the two. R&R is one of Ani's most subtle works. She is realizing the most interesting politics and battles are the ones between your own head, heart, and soul and this album feels more personal than many of her previous. Not to say that her subject matter has ever not been personal, but this album FEELS more real, more human, and closer to the realness of her truth. On R & R, Ani has penned more thorough and complete songs than before and she delivers them with hints and slight gestures - a wink and a whisper, rather than a stomp and a scream.Ani often achieves excellence; in this collection she sometimes achieves sublime brilliance. A delight to listen to, Ani keeps getting better and I look forward to hearing her work when she gets up there in age. I imagine her prime has yet to come..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm so disappointed :(","review":"I basically ran to the local NRM to purchase this new ani difranco cd. I stuck it in the my guy friends cd player and was shocked to find out that ani sucks, her lyrics still beautiful, but her music is almost fading away. something happened to that strong voice and stong guitar, its as if listing through a brick wall. I love ani but as many times as i listen to this album i just can't get how you can go from Not a Pretty Girl and Imperfectly to this... well im not going to say not to buy this, because it is good, but its not what i was expecting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathless","review":"Wonderful as only Ani can be- clean riffs,but the words are so current and so sharp-haughting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this even folk still?","review":"Ani changed the meaning of folk rock with her earlier albums. Here, she has changed the way people will classify her music. I enjoyed the folk-rock music of Ani's past. The music on this new album is very different and hard to compare to her past music. I really feel that it is not at the same level as her previous releases.I think that fans of Ani will buy the album, listen to it 100 times and find that they can at some point sing along. But it is not the fun/angry music which Ani had made people crave. This album is slow, quite and simply boring. I had hoped for something more.I respect Ani's artistic search for new things...but this is really the first of her albums that I felt no connection to. And owning all of her albums, it is sad when you feel you have lost that connection to the artist.I hope that if you buy it, you have a better experience with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"I didn't care for even 1 song on this album. I am a bigAni fan and I just like her old acoustic poetic stuff.I don't know what this was? I will probably tryand unload this one. I will be cautious about buyinganything again before I listen to it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give the jazz shtick a rest Ani","review":"I am a huge fan of mid-career Ani. Out of Range through To the Teeth were brillant albums. I think that the success that she enjoyed cultivating the funky side of To the Teeth (probably with the help of others) gave her an inflated impression of the scope of her abilities. She is not a jazz musician and the music that she creates when she is trying to be jazzy/funky just plain sucks.None of the songs are catchy. The feeble moaning of horns at strange and inopportune times are irritating. The lyrics are occassionally interesting but not what they used to be. The arrangement of the music is amateurish. She could handle a couple of guitars, bass, drums and vocals but she is in way over her head with the jazz ensemble.In short I think that this album has few, if any, redeeming features. I will proceed with caution with Ani in the future. If she pulls another one of these she will be off of my instant-buy list."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back!!","review":"I have been a dedicated fan for years, and this will be my last DiFranco purchase for a very long time. It is clear she did not spend much time or thought writing either of these CD's. The CD jacket is the best thing about this purchase. If you are looking for the old DiFranco who rocked with meaningful lyrics, this is not for you. This CD is a testament to how an artist can suck her fans dry by putting out a bad product, (the last three albums) and they will keep buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious political ranting makes my feet sad","review":"admittedly, this is from a first listening during which I skipped most of the tracks after 30 seconds, but what I like about ani is her attitude and her frankness; what I really dislike about her is her tedious doctrinaire leftist politics. The first thing I hear when I listen to this disk is this politics, in my face. Eye'm an anarchist individualist myself, eckchelly, and this makes the disc pretty much unlistenable for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh come on","review":"Even if you dont like Jazz, these cd's are undeniably amazing. Ani as always is breathtaking in her lyrics, just LISTEN to them! Ani is amazingly talented musically, but I have to admit that it is her words that have always gotten to me. Just LISTEN."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ani's White Album","review":"Ani's new double disc shows growth and maturity, and boundless experimentation, while remaining true to her roots. On the first disc, Revelling, she charts through funk, hip-hop, electronica, and rock, extending the intense experimentation that have been the hallmarks of her recent work. Standouts include \\"OK\\" and \\"Rock Paper Sissors.\\" The second CD will probably appeal even more to her long-time fans, full of plaintive acoustic songs that lament the state of the world (\\"Your Next Bold Move\\") or angst-driven relationships. Put the two discs on a carrousel CD player and emerse yourself in Ani for two hours... Sure there are a few tunes that could have been excised, but you could say the same for the Beatles' \\"White Album\\" or Dylan's \\"Blonde on Blonde.\\" Revelling/Reckoning shows what Ani's friends and fans have known for years: this is a true, independent, unadulterated talent. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm...","review":"Well.. being a major fan of stuff from 'Not a Pretty Girl'; Dilate; Living in Clip, LPC (my fave) the more alt/folkie stuff... I was VERY disappointed in this cd. I live in Buffalo and will ALWAYS love Ani. I'm not a huge fan of jazz... which is why I liked Ani so much before To The Teeth and this cd. Mind you.. there a couple good songs on the double cd, but I thought that alot of it sounded the same. As in the always flanged out guitar and the basic sound of the thing.Don't get me wrong.. I totally believe in people changing their sound. I have often gotten pissed off at the fans whos website were like: I hate Ani.. she changed.. (that annoys me to no end)But.. if you like jazzy stuff.. go buy the cd. If you prefer older works.. dont buy it. I just wish she would combine the two. I personally think the best song on the CD is Grey.But like I said.. for an Ani cd.. it sucks.. but for a jazz cd.. its ok.."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Didn't Believe Classics Were Made In My Time, But...","review":"...Then I heard Revelling/Reckoning.

Revelling is a more care-free disk, with some pretty simplistic lyrics, and happier tunes, while Reckoning is a more thoughtful and powerful side with deeper beats. Better than Not A Pretty Girl in my opinion. This is a great disk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear! where has Ani gone?","review":"I have every CD Ani produced but this might well be the last one I buy.The only word I can find to describe it is irritating. Irritating packaging, irritating production, irritating songs, irritatingly sung. This CD is the unavoidable result of the musical direction she started with Little Plastic Castle - over-indulgent musical production, less than incisive lyrics, a bizarre melange of musical styles. I don't blame her for this. If she wants to develop in this way then fine, but I will not follow.If you like Ani Difranco prior to Little Plastic Castle, do not buy this cuz (sic) you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just buy it... trust me","review":"Not Ani's best CD, but definitely not her worst. I saw her in concert in November and she performed a few songs from R/R (\\"Revelling,\\" \\"Tamburitza Lingua,\\" \\"Marrow,\\" etc.) so I couldn't WAIT to buy this CD. I wasn't disappointed. Ani's musical style seems to have evolved a bit... slightly more folk, less rock. But it still kicks butt. \\"Marrow,\\" \\"Tamburitza Lingua,\\" and \\"What How When Where (Why Who)\\" are among my favorite songs on this smartly written album. As always, the lyrics are among the best parts of this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best","review":"This is my first Ani Difranco record, i kinda just jumped on the bandwagon. I saw her in concert last night and she is so awesome!! One of the best concerts ive ever been to. there really is no one quite like her, and there will never be another like her. Revelling is more upbeat and has the full band. My favorite song off of this is \\"Marrow\\". its the 4th song she performed and is a beautiful and well crafted song. Reckoning is just her and her guitar, and the chemistry is indescribable (or is it UNdiscribable? i dont know) the best song on this one is the title track. This is the perfect album for the new ani fan as myself. since then i bought two of her other records, \\"Little plastic Castle\\" and \\"To the teeth\\". this one is the best of the three in my opinion. maybe the other ones have to grow on me. i dont care how you get this cd, just GET IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for any fan","review":"Ani has always been true to herself and her music with each album she produces (evidence of this is that she still produces her own records on her own label). This double set is definitely no exception. It is full of insightful lyrics, odd experimental pieces, heartbreaking images and personal revelation. It is personal and political in a very different way from \\"To the Teeth\\", which I found a little too aggressive and angry. This album is more assured, no less adamant, but a bit more civil. Some may say it lacks passion, but what it may be missing in raw energy, it makes up for in honesty and intelligence. Throw both discs in the player, kick back with the lyrics in hand and just enjoy the work of an artist. In the current climate of Britney's and Destiny's Child, it is a rare treasure to listen to a woman with a mind, heart, and more talent in one track than any of the pop girls can put together in a set of albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool!","review":"I asked my Mom to buy this for me for Christmas, and she said yes!!! I\`m really excited! The best part of this amazingly low-priced set is the recorder, and I was about to buy a set with just a recorder but I chose this since it comes with a book so you can reach yourself how to play the instrument. My friend plays recorder and says it's really easy and doesn\`t require much experience-in fact, she said it doesn\`t require any experience what so ever! But I used to play trombone, so I\`m guessing this should be fairly easier. You should buy this, recorder's a cool instrument, and great for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice starter Kit","review":"Yamaha is the best recorder to start with.

The gist of it is that the paradoxes on which modern mathematics depends, were not paradoxes at all--they weren't anything at all, they were letters pulled out of a bag. Of course, this raises the question of what is the implication for many theories we now consider internally consistent. Many things you will read here will make you open your eyes VERY wide. Above all, his history of Richard's paradox reveals not only that it was not a paradox, but also, Nagel and Newman's misstatement of it in their Godel book once again raises the question of how this piece of nonsense figures in Godel's theorem, that is, is there a flaw in Godel's theorem? Here is my take on it:Ryskamp, John Henry, \\"Godel's Theorem Disproved\\" (January 19, 2005). http://ssrn.com/abstract=651382"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have for Kenton Fans","review":"I owned this set on vinyl and hesitated playing it too often in fear of getting the records scratched. For me, \\"The Kenton Era\\" is the most important piece I have in my extensive Kenton collection. The best version of Stan's theme, \\"Artistry In Rhythm\\" is to be found on this album collection. Be very careful of buying this CD set as it will take control of you for the rest of your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful book, on many levels.","review":"This book, written in Douglass' later years, not only lifted my spirits but did a great deal to reestablish my faith in humanity. This was a man who had every opportunity, and reason, to be bitter and/or vengeful. He, instead, chose to fight, with his intellect and his golden tongue, for what he, and others chained in slavery and social subservience, rightfully disserved as a member of our human race. He was a man of conviction and inner strength who taught himself to write with an elegance that I have never seen equaled. I strongly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great start!","review":"The book started well, with author describing his early life, and escape to freedom. Later, he describes his efforts to educate the general population about slavery. However, since he didn't talk about what he said, but about how the meeting went, and who assisted (or hindered) him, after awhile it just seemed like a bunch of facts, not the heart of what he had to say. It's clear he's articulate, and passionate, but that seems to get lost somewhere, at least for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conventional Micrometer Set","review":"I have not yet ascertained the full accuracy of its graduations,, but thus far seems to be of an acceptable quality for conventional micrometers.

Think Britney Spears on steroids, and you have Willa Ford."},{"rating":"2","title":"Willa Rules!","review":"Willa Ford is such a wonderful and talented singer. I believe that \\" I wanna be bad\\" will be Willa's first of many hit songs. I'm also glad that this song has a single.

Keep up the good work, Willa, and if you haven't heard her sing, I think you should get the cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"I Wanna Be Bad\\" meets \\"I Wanna Sound Bad\\"","review":"I think \\"Bad\\" would be the key word in the title of this song. The word \\"bad\\" was used in this song a total of 20 times! I think that gives you a clue right there. It makes me sick to think someone like this would get a CD out and someone with real musical talent would remain undiscovered because they can't shake their butt around in a music video. This is not music, this is noise. Don't waste your money, how about a Beethovan CD instead?"},{"rating":"1","title":"what I think","review":"This song really dissapointed me. Willa shows poor vocal skills in this song and it dosn't sound like she has a large vocal range. The song is overproduced and the chorus is repeated way too many times. I wouldn't recommend that anyone waste their money on this single."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad is the key word here","review":"Oh no. Here comes the next Britney Spears. She can't sing, she can't dance, and she has no problem showing way too much skin. Her song is stupid. Buy some real pop, not this junk. The lyrics are totally dumb. Bottom line- save your money for something better. Which is just about anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"So what's new? NOTHING!!","review":"I was really hoping that the next female pop star on the market would have something new to offer...she doesn't. Her vocals are uninspiring. (she's not exactly Christina) She does write her own music. Although she isn't saying anything that hasn't already been said or delivering the message with any type of creativity. I don't feel that any true success is in her future but her album will sell well at first based on curiosity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Song...","review":"This is another hit song that I don't understand why it's a hit. Sure, it's catchy, and a bit edgy, but in a trashy way. Plus she can't sing live, I could go into a recording studio and sound decent in the end. I am getting sick of blonde solo female singers that look good but have no true talent. Who signs these people? I would suggest artists like Alicia Keyes or Krystal Harris.Us girls need some true singers out there. Christina ruins it with her ditzyness, although she has a good voice. Britney can't sing, Jessica Simpson is often overlooked, and Mandy gets stuck with immature songs. You can't help but compare Willa Ford to them as a third rate clone that makes up for her lack of talent by showing some skin."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wanna be bad too","review":"I must say, the single was an eye-opening piece. It was like the first time I've seen Britney Spears perform Opps I did it again, which was an eye-openning experience as well. Willa Ford is so cool. She has this bedness that she expresses,that is amazingly seductive in a way I exactly want to be. I think if you were having a self-esteem problem or something, this single could blow you away, and you could feel as bad as Willa looks in her video. I think all these pop music are the best therapeutic tool to the self-esteem problem, for me any way, because all these pop stars make me feel of myself as bad as they are. After being around all the weird people I see around, pop stars just bring my sanity back. I wanna be bad too, baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much there in this single","review":"I was disappointed in this single. It just isn't as great as it promised to be.

Once I turned 50, my knees started giving me trouble, and my doctor told me that I needed to give up running for good. My husband bought me an elliptical machine and a small TV so that I could watch movies while I exercised. But I missed seeing trees and hearing the sounds of nature. Then I heard about the Fitness Journeys, a virtual trip through different surroundings. I ordered several from the Ambient Collection DVDs, and I've been enjoying my exercise more than ever! The Tropical Scenery Fitness Journey includes four different tracks with tropical images and sounds that vary in length, from Mountain Sea Views, which is a about 14 and a half minutes long, to Coastal Butterflies, which is nearly 33 minutes. Each one has its distinct views and sounds. I enjoy them all, though my favorite is Mountain Sea Views with its breathtaking scenes of the ocean."},{"rating":"2","title":"fitness journey tropical scenery","review":"this DVD was absolutely beautiful; so peaceful both scenery and sounds.

Ms. Wunderlich takes the artist on a journey as if she understands that everyone needs to know both elementary and advanced techniques. Nothing is left out in her demonstrations as she easily SHOWS with wonderful pictures and TELLS with few words. I've been painting watercolors for two years, have borrowed or bought almost every book on the subject, have listened in classes, watched in seminars, and made every mistake possible until I got her book. Her simple demos gave me the greatest understanding of glazes/layering and texture application.

This is also a great resource if you are getting into journal writing and want to put in pictures of plants and flowers (many people keep a garden record journal, for example.)The instructions are very good, from how to draw and sketch plants to choices of color. There are good examples to copy to learn the technique.

And as he states in the opening line of the first track: \\"Well, I done got old.\\" And as he sings over an acoustic guitar, Guy's moan makes him sound as old as the blues itself. Guy has been recording the blues for more than forty years, and this album holds up well against the best of his career.Guy follows that with another Junior Kimbrough cover--he does four altogether. And he provides some searing guitar work on \\"Baby Please Don't Leave Me,\\" in stark contrast to the opening track. Yet both tracks leave the listener emotionally drained with their gut-wrenching performances.In the album's lone original track, \\"It's a Jungle Out There,\\" Guy sings: \\"Everybody's in a hurry/ and there ain't nobody goin' nowhere.\\" If this is the kind of music Guy continues to create, let's hope he doesn't go anywhere for a long time. Running time: 54:26 RECOMMENDED"},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes Me Miss Junior Kimbrough","review":"I wanted to like this record, especially after the slavish praise heaped upon it by the... community, as well as various blues publication. Hailed by many as a return to Buddy's roots, I think this is true if you think Buddy's roots date to the early 90s. While recording the music of various Fat Possum artists is a nice marketing ploy, Guy doesn't approach any of the original versions in terms of gutbucket power. His versions of Junior Kimbrough's Hill trance drones only make me miss Kimbrough all the more.It was once said of Buddy Guy that he plays guitar like he's trying to catch a plane. I think his recent ouput sounds more like he's trying to crash a plane, and all the bombast and sonic lightning and amplification in the world can't replace tasteful playing and production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hellhounds indeed...","review":"Now THIS is more like it. No slick songs, no pointless guest artists diluting the music, just Buddy Guy, sounding like he's jamming somewhere between a mean juke and a swamp. With the good taste to employ Spam (the world's 2nd coolest drummer behind Chalie Watts) and some other excellent backing musicians, Buddy also has the savvy to cover some of the best 'contemporary' Mississippi bluesmen, including Junior Kimbrough (R.I.P.) and T. Model Ford. Buddy's solos come screaming like a moonshine shot out of this greasy roadhouse mix, and the result is some of the best gut-bucket guitar voodoo I've heard the man crank out in years. One tip: if you like this album, you're going to love things like T. Model ford, older R.L. Burnside, and robert Belfour. Don't be afraid to go deeper..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buddy gets down in the swamp blues!","review":"Buddy Guy went to the swamp and mixed his classic blues sound up with some voodoo electricity. The result is an album so hot that it sears the soul of any listener brave enough to get down in Buddy's swamp blues. I haven't heard Buddy Guy sound this inspired since his revered \\"classic recordings\\". Buddy has found his Mojo again, and it is working overtime! His guitar playing is focused, and it cuts right down to the bone as it shrieks and howls through the stereo speakers. Buddy's vocals seem to be pulled from the very depths of his soul, and he sounds like he means every word he shouts, moans, and groans over his powerful music. This is a man ignited by and caught up in the blues. Buddy Guy may be an old man, as he sings on the first track, but on this album he sounds more like a mannish boy. If you like raw, passionate blues with an edge so sharp it makes you bleed inside, then this album is for you. BUY THIS CD IMMEDIATELY!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome idea, but ...","review":"The idea of Buddy Guy exploring the raw roots of the north Mississippi artists in Fat Possum's stable - seven of the nine songs are by Fat Possum artists - is an outstanding one. I couldn't wait to hear how Guy approached it. Alas, Guy injects all of the excesses fans have moaned about on this, a disc which is certainly not outright bad (two and a half stars would be right) but must qualify as disappointing. The acoustic opener is quite fine, but after that comes pseudo-blues amped up to 11, like music of rumblings and squallings echoing to our ears out of some tunnel that goes straight to hell. The vicious sound is at times alarming. Buddy Guy tries too hard to peel the wallpaper, engages in too much rock-oriented guitar histrionics, and, rather than keeping it simple and raw, like country blues, he tries to be ultra modern, ultra cool, super nasty, with vocal effects and colossal guitar sounds all over the place. Hey, just play the blues. Remember \\"Slippin' In\\"? I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad production, songs, unsuitable to Buddy's style","review":"Buddy Guy is great.This album is not.I found the production, especially the overabundance of reverb and effects, unsuitable to Buddy.I don't know what they were thinking.

I think I own everything he has ever done that is commercial available. I've also seen him live maybe half a dozen time. That said, I would not recommend this recording. There is almost nothing on this CD that works well. The song selection is poor or at best not suited well for BG. The recording and production are poor to average and the performance is at best mediocre. I appreciate BG's desire to record old roots-blues, but his performance style just doesn't lend itself well to this music. Simply stated, this is one of the worst CD's I've bought in years. If your looking to get started with BG, do yourself a favor and get \\"Damn Right, I've Got The Blues\\" or \\"The Very Best...\\" and skip \\"Sweet Tea\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Copy cat","review":"An essential?! The best blues album in the past 10 years?! Hardly. This album is a collection of songs by the artists of the Fat Possum Label (T-Model Ford, Cedell Davis, and Junior Kimbrough) which have been covered by Buddy Guy. Why has he abandoned the sweet fluff he's been pumping out the past 15 years in favor of raw rural blues? Has he seen the light? Or is it a move by him and his label to cash-in on the sector that Fat Possum has dominated for the past 10 years? Either way, Guy's covers do not contribute to any of the originals in any way, so don't waste your time. Go to the sourcec, check-out T-Model Ford, Cedell Davis, or the late Junior Kimbrough, and see for yourself where the real blues are found. And what's with the shack on the cover?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite album of 2001!...Junior LIVES","review":"A couple of years ago I was brousing around a CD shop in North Carolina while on vacation. In their used blues section I dug up 3 CDs by Junior Kimbrough. I'd never heard any of his work, so I popped one in the CD previewer and immediately had found a sound I had been looking for for a long time. Junior cranked out long, soulful & heavy songs on all 3 discs I purchased that day.After the first tune on Sweet Tea, a fine acoustic \\"Done Got Old\\", I immediately felt Junior's soul coming through with a distinct twist of Buddy Guy's frenetically aggressive guitar work. Sure enough, I checked the liner notes and was pleased to see that several of the tracks were Kimbrough's.The pace keeps up throughout the CD. An amazing energy. I won't go into details about each track, but rest assured it's all GOOD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Fudge, comming on in.

Well, its now been about 7 years since it's release and I have finally gotten around to purchasing this one. ... HOLY CRAP!! It is super-fantastic!. I am ashamed it took me that long to pick this album up, and upset with myself at the same time. How could I allow an album of this calibur to set on the back burner for so long. I had heard it was a good album, but had no idea ... It is that good. If you are gonna buy it, well open up cause. Hot fudge is comming on in.

This is Davis' version of the blues, and he lets you know it. Thankfully, he has the skill of a consummate wordsmith, an encyclopedic knowledge of the subject matter and a fan's love and appreciation for the music.

The series had interesting storylines, intriguing characters, exceptional heroes, and the villains we've learned to hate and love! Back in the early 90's, a simpler time of course, there were X-Men. This animated series was a milestone and became a must watch TV show every Saturday morning.I am a huge comic book fan and don't understand why fans of comic books never have the luxury of seeing their favorite characters hit the big screen or the little screen more often. So, when i found out X-Men was going to be on Fox, i knew it would be one of the best shows ever, and it was. Yes, the animation is not top notch, but its still great underneath the surface.A few reviews have complained that the DVD release could benefit from a re-mastered cosmetic upgrade. I wonder if that would truly make a difference. Regardless, i enjoyed this series thoroughly.

The animation and sound are terrible, the dialogue is worst and there's no real sense of pace to the episodes. The only thing they have going is nostalgia and years of fantastic X-Men comics to work with for plots and characters.

Unlike volumes two,three,and four, where half of it is either about the phoenix saga, dark phoenix, journey to the savage land, or the alien shapeshifting shiar. This is why I stopped watching it regularly back in the 90's they'll have a whole episode on the Silver Samurai, but hey that's just me. I understand they incorporate alot of different characters, settings, and events etc. The xmen universe is mighty large, for instance i didn't know that Captain America made an appearance in the series (volume 5) that's one I wouldn't mind watching either. I just enjoy it a little better when they focus on the xmen themselves, rather than long drawn out episodes that end with next time on part this and part that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!!","review":"This product was exactly what I was looking for!!

And even with that I must rate this series among the best animated shows I've seen!While it is true the animation is a bit dated, it still does it's job in providing vivid imagery of this amazing and riveting show! The message that X-Men brings is still is dire need of being heard today, over 10 years later. Equality and an unbiased world is what we should be striving for, even if it seems hopeless. The voice work, though at times cheesy, does the story justice.'Wolverine and the X-Men' may be the new show in town, but it, in it's equally vivid demand for equality, can't stand to the depth and awe this series commands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what i wanted","review":"I recently purchased volume 1 and 2, and it's exactly what I had expected.

Not everything HAS to be flashy to be amazing. Anyone that love's the x-men movies, will definitely love this tv series.

Their season is a different type of funny though and much slower to develop, and not nearly as laugh out loud funny as that 30-minute special.

I just love the show and was disappointed to here that band had discontinued the show, to spend more time at home, bummer, but understandable. Now, some will not be able to grasp or comprehend the music without watching the show, so I would first recommend watching the show starting with season one, and working your way up to season 3. I promise it will be worth the investment. Drive by is insanely funny, catchy, and ironic."},{"rating":"2","title":"FOTC season 1","review":"Excellent TV series. Best way I can describe it is that it has a similar comedy style as the Office, but with music. The songs in this season are very clever, original and also very catchy. Just watch it already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This show is so funny and unique. It makes a good gift for someone who's hard to shop for.

It's hysterically falling on the floor can't breath funny. The season fizzles a bit in the last episode or two; appears they ran short of song material. Looking forward to the second season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great dry humor","review":"This is a great gift idea for anyone with a good sense of humor- particularly dry humor.

It's probably not for everyone b/c the humor isn't usually smack you in the face or slapstick humor. The songs are straight up funny, but most of the other laughs simply come from the interaction between Murray, Bret, and Jemaine. They are clueless in the ways of the world thinking that leather suits, goatees (Murray doesn't like it but he thinks it makes him more \\"rock and roll\\" which caused Jemaine to tell Murray he looked like a goat), and getting whacked-off on drugs are cool. You can always get wardrobe tips from Bret and what animals sweatshirts to wear. Or ask Jemaine about Business Socks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny!","review":"Flight of The Concords is a funny, original comedy team in the mock-music genre of This Is Spinal Tap or A Mighty Wind. The wit is similar to British or Australian comedy and seems to go over the head of some American viewers. Season 1, on HBO, is fresh and unique. The group has a tough time creating new material in Season 2 -and seem to be too self-aware. This is one of the brightest comedy/pop culture performances in the last decade. Concords effectively poke fun at the superficiality of dating, romantic ideals, the fetishization of consumerism, artistic angst, pop culture, quest for fame, and often produce better songs than get played in the top 40. It's a great alternative to that raunchy, superficial, male-fantasy BS in Entourage. I'd rather hang out with the Concords any day."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Curb Your Enthusiasm, Arrested Development and the Office...","review":"you will love these guys! This is an innovative way of sharing stories. The humor, musical interpretations have laugh out loud moments and the presentation is witty and smart comedy.

The dry humor coupled with so much brilliant satire make for a great pick-me-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny - Not So Much As HBO Special","review":"This is a pretty funny show. The plot of each episode is contrived to fit two songs from their *actual* folk-comedy duo days, with only a few jokes in the dialogue. I think the versions of the songs here are far inferior to the ones in their HBO live special (two of them with a blue background of new york). Until that's released, you're pretty much stuck with this.On the other hand, for someone who's never heard the songs prior, this is absolutely hilarious...\\"They're turning kids into slavesjust to make cheaper sneakers,But what's the real cost,'cuz the sneakers don't seem that much cheaper?Why are we paying so much for sneakerswhen they're made by little slave kids,what are your overheads?\\"--Episode 4"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly funny!","review":"This DVD of the first season is great!

I came in at the middle of one of the songs and I wasn't really impressed. However, I sat down to watch a few episodes in a row, and found that it really grew on me. The humor is much more clever than some people give it credit for. It may seem like your average dumb comedy, but Flight of the Conchords is a fantastic little gem. Great show.

Although the first episode was a little iffy, I stuck with it, and it was SO worth it! This is tears-in-your-eyes, pee-in-your-pants funny. The second season wasn't quite as great, though it too has some really funny moments.If you love Season 1, you might want to get \\"Eagle Vs. Shark\\" before you order Season 2. Jemaine Clement is perfect in it. You can see his potential to become an actor of the calibre of Jim Carrey or Steve Carell -- someone who can move from doing quality humor to taking on heartbreakingly dramatic roles. I hope we get to see more of him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conchords in full flight","review":"I am really not a huge television watcher, never tune into a particular show every week...that is until now. Sunday night you will now find me on my couch watching HBO. From the first to the last episode, Flight of the Conchords has never ceased to entertain me. A very different type of humor than your usual comedies, yet a very awkward and odd humor that everyone, including myself, will quickly enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than HBO...","review":"We fell in love with the Conchords on HBO...were happy to see that the first season came out so quickly on DVD. The lack of DVD extras was a bit of a downer, but we quickly noticed that the episodes on the DVDs are uncut with more jokes... likely, as Bret and Jemaine had initially intended.If you're a die-hard fan, you'll like the DVD versions better. Some extra dvd extras would've been nice, but the additonal footage (albeit subtle) made these dvds a good purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Every Penny","review":"If you haven't seen Bret and Jermaine, theyre hilarious.

I did not enjoy this show and that is simply because the singing ticked me off. I was not patient.

It Has a training mode that is very easy!!! The good part about it's realisim is that it makes it fun, but the bad part is that you have to memorise all the knobs, dials, and switiches to be an effective player. Maybe the only very bad thing about it though is that the multiplayer mode is hard to use. But the game is still really fun without Multiplayer!!

They just sound like a bunch of noise - and they all sound almost the same. Yes, Higher has catch to it. But their next single \\"What If\\" is just a flat song. It sounds more like glorified noise then music. Truly a huge disapointment after My Own Prison. Sounds like Creed has run out of songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creed does not know how to rock","review":"I swear, this CD is awful. If I hear With Arms Wide Open one more time, I'm going to pull my hair out. It's bands like this that have great talent but waste it on producing mellow songs with no moral. All the lyrics are exactly the same, and are boring. Scott Stapp has no anger within him, all he is is just a pitiful excuse for a rock singer. He should appear in a Dido CD or something, because all they sing about is happy things. Also, they rruse the same tunes. Beautiful and Say I, placed back to back, is the EXACT same song with different lyrics for each one! Also, they never start off into the \\"rock\\" immeadiately. They always dawdle with Mark's guitar for about half a minute, then start, but they get lame and downright sorry once the words start up, because the lyrics are all about happy things, and not a member of this band knows how to rock. Forget all about Creed and pop in a good Korn CD...you'll feel better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well I Just Heard . . .","review":"This is the worst .... I've ever listened to. The music is unoriginal, and the lyrics are a bunch of sown cliches. Do these guys have something special that I don't see? Not even close to the bands of the grunge movement. Repugnant as the other Korn, Match, and Bizkit heads. Totally uninspired. Check out the album cover . . .whew!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"This is the worst CD I've bought in years. Purchased to hear one song that received tons of airplay, the rest of this album is horrid. It's all the same song in the \\"I wanna be a rock star\\" style. Arrggghh!! Really a disappointment. I'm going to sell it to a used CD store but I expect to find about a dozen already there."},{"rating":"1","title":"poseurs","review":"I think I liked this stuff better 10 years ago when it was a wee bit more original and fresh.

Once again, Scott Stapp is succesful in lending listeners an ear to his tortured soul, and the band's lyrics will take us to world we have never been to before! The album is filled with dark, Tool-like rhythms, and will take over your mind. The best and most emotional track in my opinion is \\"What If?\\" But this recording is strictly for the hard-core, no wannabe rock/pop hits here! I give it two thumbs up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Creed never really has much appealed to me. Scott Stapp's voice is good, but boring. All the songs on this are also boring and WAY to soft. The only really good song is \\"What If\\" and \\"Higher\\"'s OK, but nothing special. Personally, I don't see what all the hype is about them.

This album, while simpler than the first album, draws much more on their strong points, which are Strapp's vocals(which have much improved since the first album) and the gloomy minor keys in which they write their songs in. Awesome CD"},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST BAND OF THE NEW MILLENIUM","review":"of all the post-grunge bands, i nominate this band as the band that does the most talking without saying anything at all. this music is some of the most generic and uninspired i have heard in the last few years. stealing riffs from soundgarden, led zeppelin, pearl jam, and even (choke) cinderella! the lyrics, however inspired by this guys aspirations for martyrdom, are blase and boring! if you wanna hear christian rock go listen to stryper! this album just plain stinks - like the band!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Creed are a joke...","review":"It seems that instead of trying to craft at their sound and innovate themselves to become a better band, they've takn a step back and are becomming just another pop act. And, please, note to Stapp: just once, try not to mimic Eddie Vedder's voice. Soon, these guys will be reveale of the talentless fools they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creed is horrible","review":"If there were an award for the most pretentious piece of trash on CD, Creed's Human Clay would win top honors. I bought this CD, and i couldnt even get through it one time. I sold it on ebay. I felt like I was being preached to on religion through a web of extremely poorly executed rock. Their sound is indistinctive and there are better alternatives that have a cleaner sound and that dont have religious undertones such as Lifehouse or Pearl Jam. I cant wait until Creed falls into the annals of Bad Rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"the flaws of our world.","review":"to all of you who like creed:wake up. i know where you are. i was there in sixth grade, you are feeling angsty and maybe hear a catchy song on the radio, with words in it like 'pain' and 'higher' and you think, whoa deep. if you are still reading and you still like creed you may discredit my opinion now, but this is part of what is wrong with our world today, that art is hidden behind the wall of fake-art, and the wall of fake-art is all that many can see. do yourself a favor and dig yourself out of this hole of mediocre music. There is so much better stuff you can enrich your mind with. if you keep listening to this you will regret it in a couple years."},{"rating":"2","title":"CREED-Good album, but not as great as \\"My Own Prison\\"","review":"I love Creed. I've liked them since they came out in '97. I was kinda anticipating buying this because I didn't like what they played on the radio, BUT after seeing them L-I-V-E, I definitley had to get this album! If you are not sure of this album, I'd recommend seeing them in concert first, be it on video or at a live show. It will make you appreciate how good this album really is. But it's still not as good as \\"My Own Prison,\\" but good nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"CREED is brilliant","review":"I liked this album. The songs are wonderful and they have a message. Sometimes dark, sometimes happy, this is good album which is well written.Some of the good songs are \\"What If?,\\" \\"Arms Wide Open,\\" \\"Faceless Man,\\" and \\"Never Die.\\" Most of the songs are depressingly uplifting. (If that even makes sense.) With it's religous undertones that make it good, and the Pearl Jam like style, CREED has done it. I liked the first album more. I give, Human Clay *molds a four out of clay* a four!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly good songs!","review":"If you like hard stuff this may be for you. This isn't quite as hard as matalica but there are some songs that come pretty close. I only really like three songs on the CD at this time but every time I listen to it I find there is something else that I skipped or didn't think would be that good. I gave the four stars for their two hit songs and a few others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Similar to their First Album","review":"There seems to be some controversy over whether \\"Human Clay\\" is better than Creed's first album, \\"My Own Prison\\", with the majority view being that the first album employed less sophisticated production techniques.Nonetheless, the difference between the two seems minimal to me. If you like pounding guitars and vocals that sound like Pearl Jam, you'll probably like this again. In particular, \\"Faceless Man\\" is a reasonably good song.For what it's worth, I liked the first album marginally better, and wish I'd saved my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pretty good effort for a mediocre band","review":"Creed's certainly not a terrible band, and this cd is quite a good display of their limited skills. While some of the songs are actually listenable, others aren't so great, but on the whole this cd is worth any fan's money, if you happen to tolerate Scott Stapp's nasal vocals and the grungy, derivative sound. So if you're a creed fan, you definitely should get this. Other people might want to stay far, far away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creed's sold out.","review":"Creed's first album, My Own Prison, was a smash rock album. They brought a sound that hadn't been heard for years. With this second album, they've sold out. They changed their sound in order to get airplay (overplay) and you just get so sick of them and Stapp's \\"blessed\\" attitude. What happened to their rock sound. They've gone commercial and they're just another pop band now, unfortunately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creed Hidden message underneather","review":"well Although alot of people are dissapointed with this album i still will listen to it, maybe i just can put up with music or maybe some people dont know good music, but either way, i think creed is awesome, not only do they play awesome music on every cd they put out, they have christian refrences in them, and how many bands can put out music liek that and have hit songs... not many, besides that they are hard rock band that had the potential to do somthing but held back... thats what i think anyways, and about the cd i think its pretty good, its slower then their first cd and way harder, which makes it cool because not one of their cds is the same, their newest one and last for them was the best, it was a mix between hard rock and fast pased beat, the lyrics on the other hand were a bit not as \\"serious\\" or more to the point some could say, anyways i give this cd 7/10 (average) because its nothing bad but nothing extreme~"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over done","review":"Granted, Strap should be excited about his child, and a song for him (or her) is a splendid idea. However, it should be a simple accoustic song, hidden at the end of the tracks. There is no need to craft an absurd opus, particularly when you have limited vocal range. Perhaps that is why he chose a violin laden song for \\"With Arms Wide Open\\", because he does not have the vocal talent to carry an accoustic song.By the way, could someone explain to me the line, \\"I lie beneath the tree of wisdom/ Your ax is cut and would you be there???(What If)"},{"rating":"2","title":"CREED rocks the house!","review":"every once in awhile a band comes along with great lyrics and a great frontman..it doesn't happen that often! here we have Creed, a great band that combines rock and meaningful lyrics with a lead singer who's voice is one of the best in music today!

However if you liked there debut album you will also like this one. They are very similar...Creed has carved out it's own unique sound and it's a good one. For some reason there 1st album seemed to have something that this one lacks...I can't put my finger on what exactly that is..but it doesn't hit me as hard as \\"My Own Prison\\"...at any rate if you liked there debut you'll like this one as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a really bland CD","review":"I like simplicit rock as much as the next guy, but c'mon this CD is flat out boring. Just about every song starts the same, they use some spacey guitar riff, then rock out. Their first CD was good listened to sparingly, and this one is just more of the same. In interviews I've heard them say that the first album was just a demo. I'd say if that's true, this album is an over-produced/effected demo."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS CD IS INCREDIBLE","review":"I listen to all types of music from ska and punk to rap.

Buy this cd"},{"rating":"2","title":"creed- only improved","review":"While shopping online, I came across this CD and wondered, \\"What's the difference between this one and the regular 'Human Clay' CD?\\" Well, a good bit.For example, the clarity on this CD is a lot better than the original and there is one surprise: a bonus track called \\"Young Grow Old\\", an absolutely awesome offering from Creed.However, there isn't much else original about the CD- and that's fine. The original \\"Human Clay\\" CD is here, with its showcase offerings like \\"With Arms Wide Open\\", \\"Higher\\", and \\"What If\\", and nothing is missing that made \\"Human Clay\\" great. Still, there's just something missing that prevents me from giving it the full 5 stars. Also, the second CD contains acoustic versions of \\"What's This Life For\\" and \\"With Arms Wide Open\\", plus three other songs.Overall rating: classic Creed, with a brand new single- what more can you ask for? 4.5 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Still hate it, sorry","review":"I don't get it. I've tried so hard to enjoy this CD, but I just can't ever like it. The melodies are uninteresting, the vocalist sounds like a bad Eddie Vedder, and the musicians as a whole aren't particularly good.Sure they have a positive message. So? Kenny G has a positive message, does that make him worthwhile?I understand many people like, even love, this album. But I can't understand it. I always feel like something is just lacking from all of the songs - soul. This is just too bland for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd","review":"All I can really say about this album is that it is one of the best that I have ever heard. Creed, along with a few other bands, has revived the music industry from the despairingly bad music that has become popular lately, and for that all I can do is thank them. I don't really care if this is about Heaven or God, I just recognize good music when I hear it, and this is definitely, but in my opinion, this does not sound like Christian Rock at all to me. Anyways, with the great vocals of Scott Stapp and the awesomes riffs in songs like beautiful, how could you not go buy this cd. If you liked this review, please click on the yes button below. I would appreciate it. thanks for your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"some good songs but not a very original sound, if you like this then you should get some alice in chains, pearl jam, or soundgardan, which by the way are the bands that creed trys to sound like."},{"rating":"1","title":"How does a sane man like this band?","review":"I loved early 90s grunge rock. I listen to my cds on a regular basis, Alice In Chains, Nirvana, Soundgarden, even some of the more obscure bands like Mudhoney i've gotten into. This band just wants to be like Pearl Jam and all of the early 90s grunge bands only they dont have the talent to do it. The band is terribly subpar including Mark Tremonti who is the most overrated guitarist ever. Scott Stapp is the worst singer/songwriter i've ever heard and i have a voodoo doll that i use to put various curses on him so this band will never make another record.Go buy some early 90s grunge, Alice In Chains-s/t says Jared, go get that.

The Best Tracks on This album are \\"What If\\", \\"Beautiful\\", \\"Say I\\", \\"Never Die\\" and \\"Higher\\". i don't really like with arms wide open because it is to soft and i am sort of tired of hearing it.

A very good cd, I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing...","review":"Creed is my all-time favorite music group, and with their spectacular hits \\"Higher\\" and \\"What If\\", I like them even more.

It is definitely great rock music. But a lot of people seem to miss the spiritual quality of the music, both in the lyrics and the passion that Scott Stapp and the band deliver. This is not a religious record, but rather, it addresses issues above and beyond the routine of life; it is about the meaning of life. I don't know what the band's personal beliefs are, but this is not a specifically Christian record. I'm a neopagan, and it speaks to everything I believe and the type of concerns I think are important. It is a spiritual record that calls us to peace and love. It is also a criticism of American commercialism and our shallow culture that leads to meaningless, destructive, and self-destructive lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Non-Decent follow-up to an amazing album","review":"Creed's first album, my own prison, was great. It was an amazing CD, and gets a 4 on my list. But...Human Clay just didn't offer me much. Sure, 'Higher' was great when it first came out, but now it's so annoying I want to break the record in half. Most songs are dull, and the same, and didn't catch my interest. Thankfully, Creed's new Weathered Album is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll Love it or you'll hate it","review":"This is a one-sound band. Their songs are basically dirges of various degrees of misery with the singer moaning over a thick wall of sound layed down by slow but nimble drum-playing (I think the drummer only knows that one beat, but he does it to perfection), a thick bass, and droning guitars that were probably overdubbed many times over.There is no great musicianship, no great guitar solos, and - even though he can carry a tune - the singer could be picked out of a million different alternametal outfits.So why 5 stars? Because this is simply just some of the best damn songwriting I have heard since Nirvanna hit the charts about 10 years ago. There is an intensity in this CD that will not allow you to push the stop button from the first song.Pick this one up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shape us (like clay), but not make us...","review":"Take me higher - what an awesome number! But the rest of this CD degenerates into a third-rate Pearl jam thing that I was ashamed to listen to. The passion is just not there with these guys...and MTV sweat does not count!I must admit I was excited at the fact that ALT music was not dying with so many bands 'popping' on to the scene after Pearl Jam had a 'break' and Soundgarden just called it a day - but CREED is not the answer to the alt or any fan's rock today (unless you like bury your head!). This CD is pretty cool, however there is a LOT of great music out there that is just as good that does not have the corporate endorsement that CREED has...(or maybe HAD)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly passionate, spiritual & gives you EXCELLENT music!","review":"What can I say - CREED ROCKS! Human Clay gives you a rich variety of music from ballads to hard rock songs and you just want to keep playing it over and over - can't get enough. As a follow-up to My Own Prison (which is also highly recommmended!) I look forward to CREED's 3rd album. The lyrics that Stapp writes is amazing and deeply spiritual given the history behind how they got to start CREED. I highly recommend this album without a doubt - especially songs like Faceless Man, Inside Us All, Beautiful, What If and of course Higher and With Arms Wide Open. This music touches you on a deep level......."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting Mystical ROCK!","review":"One word Can describe this C.D. and that is \\"WOW!\\". I was simply blowned away by this C.D. Every Signle Song on this C.D is great! With a sound like Led zepplin! and Poetry sounding like it Came From Jim Morrison Himself! Creed comes through on this sophmore effort with flying colors. The Key Tracks on this C.D are \\"What If\\" A great Power song! you can feel the Adrenaline going through your veins on this one! Then The Beautifully arranged \\"beautiful\\" With Rocking guitars as if they stole it from Hendrix's Basement!. The Poetic Faceless man. One of my favorite tracks \\"Never Die\\". ANd the 2 legendary Songs on this Album The Inspirational \\"Higher\\" And the quasi religious \\"With arms Wide open\\" And The song Closer Inside us all is highly inspirational and is intellect spanding!. You can't get any better then this. With Songs Written Like they were the doors Creed is probably the best rock band out and thats all i have to say about that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"definately a good buy!","review":"I 'discovered' this band through my friend - we'd be working or driving or whatever and a Creed song would come on and she'd be like \\"I love this band/song\\" and I'd be like \\"Yeah, cool\\" and started to agree with her so I bought the CD Human Clay and it rules! I didn't know people thought they were a 'christian' band until I read reviews and listened to people diss them - I just thought they believed in god and thats cool - I'm not religious and I don't like what I consider 'Christian rock' but I LOVE this CD an I don't think you need to be religious to appreciate it! Creed is awesome and I hope they put out a 3rd CD that is as cool as the first two!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the heck is this band so popular?","review":"Jim Morrison's spirit called, he wanted his voice back as does Eddie Vedder. Oh and the people from Seattle called to say that grunge is dead too."},{"rating":"1","title":"human crud","review":"Why are they so popular?Is this the same mentality that makes Saddam Hussein popular in Iraq?By force feeding?They sound like a tone deaf high school band that emulates Pearl Jam.He bellows his way through \\"what if\\" like a wounded elephant seal.The verse sounds almost exactly like \\"give it away\\" by the Red Hot Chili Peppers.The chorus sounds almost exactly like \\"Bad Company\\" by the group of the same name.In each instance it's done badly.I mean they're just awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"creed rocks","review":"To all that thinks this is a pearl jam ripoff--I have got a statement for you. Creed rocks harder than pearl jam. Listen to what if, and are you ready, these boys can jam. Some albums you buy nowdays have one or two good songs, the rest filler. This album is 90% great. So get off your high horse and admit it Creed rocks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"First cd I ever bought...","review":"...And I can't say it's my best. \\"Wrong way\\" and \\"Never Die\\" are great songs, but as a whole, this album comes off a little weak. \\"My own prison\\" is a better cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT SIMPLY ROCKED","review":"I have always said I did not like Creed. Yet when I unintentially bought HUMAN CLAY, I knew then I was going to be a fan of them for life.With songs like \\"SAY I\\",\\"ARMS WIDE OPEN\\", and \\"HIGHER\\" this has turned me into a creed fan. Every song is excellent it makes you beg for me. I am such a big fan,I am listening to it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent ! We would like our hits on Your Audio?","review":"This Album was well constructed, Well reheased and Well Done, I Love it!. But my question to Amazon is, Why didn't you let us here their two best songs on this album on Audio? Higher? With Arms Wide Open?"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"I am a huge fan of music and will basically listen to everything, but this CD surpases them all. The reason I picked up this CD was because I heard With Arms Wide Open and Higher on the radio and loved them. After I listened to the whole CD I was impressed by the sheer talent of the group. They have an amazing talent to really reach out to you in their songs. This CD is really worth buying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, haunting, unexpected","review":"\\"Human Clay\\" is a wonderful example of how pop and hard rock can be perfectly fused together. Arms Wide Open is an amazing song, it really tugged at my heart, reminding me of days gone by. Really, I can find nothing wrong with this daring, well crafted, power house of an album. If you liked Creed's stuff before, then you'll love this one. I just wish the guys could decide on an image for their videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but still some boring songs...","review":"I think this CD is worth the money. I am in no way saying this is a bad CD. But there is some definitly boring songs on it. I have MoP and it is the same, about 2-3 good songs, another 2-3 pretty good songs and the rest are just bleh. Out of them all I have to say that i like Say I the best just because the excellant lyrics and guitar work.I really don't feel all that strong;y about this album. It's good but not the best I've seen. And i personnally prefer it to MoP.A lot of people are saying how they ripped off other bands but i really don't see any resemblence to any other bands. I really dsilike STP and Van Halen. But I truly like this band, they have meaningful lyrics and a great sound!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best New Album","review":"This album has even more feeling than My Own Prison. Youhave tocheck out \\"With Arms Wide Open\\". I have never heard a songwith more feeling. It is just beautiful. Other excellent tracks are Faceless Man, What If, Beautiful, and definitely Higher. This album is gonna be the next big thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE","review":"First off Creed is garbage. Their music is garbage and his lyrics are garbage. You want some real lyrics, listen to some EMO-CORE. This is a perfect cd for hanging out at the monster truck rally and comparing the utter coolness of your MULLET cut. Great music for small town heroes with tight rolled jeans and camaros. Get a clue. Creed is junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"simplistic, patronizing, pseudo-grunge","review":"The ascendency of Creed to multi-platinum status disturbs those of us in our late 20s who were around when talented bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam and Alice in Chains blew away the then dominance of the hair matal bands (Poison, Winger et al.) I'm saddened by the fact that a new generation of music fans have been duped by the shameless way in which Creed has stolen the sound of artists that changed the way rock music was heard and have turned it into the soundtrack for millions of video game addled suburban teenagers who think this stuff 'rocks.' Well, children, it doesn't so much 'rock' as mock a genre of music that was challenging, primal, and occassionally ugly; in other words everything that Creed's music is not. I doubt the mall queens and frat boys will give up on this - they need something to do stupid things to during the summer - but the rest of us can wait out their popularity and go see Pearl Jam."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dullest Album of 1999","review":"I honestly cannot fathom how somebody could listen to this CD and actually want to listen to it a second time. I'm sorry but it's just so *DULL*. When will these incessant post-grunge/mainstream rock groups END?! Do people actually hear a difference between Creed and Third Eye Blind? I sure don't. Every song I'm nearly convinced this is actually Eddie Vedder singing. I realize he can't change his voice but that's not the only thing they borrow from Pearl Jam. The songs range from stagnant to simply annoying (\\"What If\\"). The lyrics, which are supposed to be \\"deep\\" or something, come off and pretentious. To readers - do humanity a favor and don't buy this album. To Creed - quit flogging a dead genre!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Question...","review":"Remember about 3 years ago, when both Creed & Days of the New fell under the category of \\"Neo-Grunge\\"? Days took the more brooding S'Garden /AIC approach, while Creed took the PJ by-means-of Metallica way. But that was then & this is now.While DOTN (or Traivs Meeks) has decided to take their (his) music to new levels of grace & power, Creed have decided to play it safe & recycle \\"My Own Prison\\"'s formula... with mixed results. Where \\"MOP\\" had moments of true power & beauty, \\"Human Clay\\" is just a boring rock album. However, I won't knock the entire album. \\"Beautiful\\" is just that & \\"Never Die\\" has alot of merit. And let's face it, who hasn't gotten \\"Higher\\" stuck in their head at least once? But other than that, there isn't much here.If you want impressive musicianship, get \\"DOTN II\\". If you want a good Creed album, \\"My Own Prison\\" works just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of 99's best efforts!","review":"from the beutiful song with arms wide open and the powerufll higher this album is a wonderfull masterpiece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD Ever","review":"This is by far the best CD to ever exist. Every song illuminates the superb talent of the musical giants that call themselves \\"Creed\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"This is one of those Cd's that you can listen to from beginning to end. The whole CD is awesome. My favorite songs are WHAT IF, WITH ARMS OPEN WIDE, and the HUGE hit, HIGHER. They have a unique rock sound, that is not to heavy, yet certainly not soft. They have been compared to Pearl Jam, whichis a fair comparison. You will be happy with your purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT?!?!?!?","review":"Creed is the most awesome band. Every single song on this CD is awesome! When I heard the song higher for the first time I went and bought the CD and expected nothing else good on the CD. But I loved the lyrics. And the guitarest Mark Tromonti Knows how to play. He writes riffs that have depth. And about 1,000 per song! He's not one of those people that play 2 riffs through the whole song. It's good stuff! The only thing I didn't like was the fact that the drums were too slow. Not to say He isn't good, I'm positive he COULD play fast. But then creed would not be creed. Unfortuneatly The bassist has left the band. So I won't talk about him. As for Scott Stapp I don't really listen to the vocals a whole lot because I am not really interested in them. But I can tell you Scott Stapp is a very good singer. Bottom line BUY THIS ALBUM, AND DON'T LISTEN TO WHAT THE PEOPLE UNDER ME SAY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PURE GARBAGE","review":"Creed is the epitome of all that is wrong with music. They are playing the same music that Alice in Chains was doing 10 years ago. Their lyrics are mindless and uninspired, and their taste in apparel ridiculous. If you love these guys as much as they so obviously love themselves, I pity you...for you cannot be that into music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever!","review":"... this [is] deep religious rooted rock... I personallydisliked this album and dislike a great deal of this music. I suggestthat people check out Jackyl's Greatest Hits, Poison's Power tot hePeople, New Tattoo by Motley Crue, and even certain tracks off Crushby Bon Jovi. But, this stuff is just entirely too good boy for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over rated and over produced.","review":"I first got into Creed when they first Realeased My own Prison and like everyone else I thought they were great. I liked the album but the more I listened to it, the more I didn't like it!I then got their second album and again I was blown away by them and thought they were great......and then the same thing happend. Don't get me wrong, it IS a good album and it sounds good but it just seems to have something missing. The lyrics go from bad to worse, which for me, brings the whole album down. Scott Stapp is a good frontman and has a good, if unremarkable voice but as a lyricist I find him very poor. All the songs all seem like overwrought ballads or rock songs and seem to go on far longer than they should and it seemed vastly overproduced.If you like Creed or are a fan of the first album then go ahead and buy this one, you'll probably love it. If not, don't. It just doesn't seem worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical.","review":"Even somewhat great writing compared to today's pitiful manufactured pop world can't lift this album from catchy to good. Innovation is not in Creed's vocabulary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet!","review":"I'm sorry, this CD is incredible. I love it. The first song I ever heard by Creed was Higher, and I just fell in love. The incredible vocals and passionate music keeps me reaching for it over and over when I need something good to listen to. The passion they put into their music you can hear all the way through the album. One song I think really stands out, if only for the message it sends is Wash Away Those Years. It's a great song for -anybody-, not just for those affected. People can be stripped down to nothing, by anything, and the music on this CD is just right for any type of mood. One of my favorites, if only for the music, is Beautiful. Is it just me, or is it like the drums and guitar are fighting each other? It's incredible to just close my eyes and follow the music in my mind. I also especially love What If? That, I think, is a song too many people -need- to hear. Creed's music is fascinating, and I love every bit of it. This is definitely worth looking in to."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Music is not original","review":"First of all I am not a Creed hater but a music fan, I listened to there cd and felt it was very inspiring and obvious that he was influenced from a higher calling. I think the music is un-original, you cant honestly say that after listening to the cd that you have not heard that type of music voice. I suppose the only thing i did like about it was that it was positive and easy to listen to without the annoying explitives in the music because that tends to get old. Im sure after listening to the cd you can comprise a list of music bands that make Creed out to be a carbon copy of those bands (ie: Pearl Jam, STP, etc.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sure to put Scott Weiland back in rehab","review":"Not bad for a blatant, blatant Stone Temple Pilots knockoff. I believe they mean well and I wish the band all the best. I just hope Scott Stapp puts earplugs in his son's ears before he drags him onstage for Arms Wide Open. The audience would do well to put in earplugs themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good as My Own Prison!","review":"I just got this cd yesterday and i like it alot, but not as much as their first - My Own Prison.

But besides that, the songs are great. My favorites are Higher, What if, Say I, Beutiful, and Wrong Way. They have a very strong voice and it sounds as though he cares what he sounds like more than other bands. I suggest buying this CD today and listen a few days nonstop. It's really cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alrighty...","review":"This is just an awesome album! I love all the songs; they're all so good! But, I still like their first album, My Own Prison, better. That album is more hard rock and I seemed to like that one much more for some reason. Depending on your tastes, you might like this one or My Own Prison better. *shrugs* They're both good, in my opinion. I can't wait until they come out with their 3rd album (November 20, 2001)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocrity at it's best","review":"This album is a disapointment to me.\\"Higher\\"is a fine song, with it's good singing and catchy/burly guitar riffs.\\"With arms wide open\\"is sweet(The strings version is even better).Those songs are worth the purchase of this Cd.How ever things go down hill after that.Some of the other songs are okay& some are just terrible.Think monotonous,bland,simplistic,sluggish& predictable.The lead singer has a good voice, but is monotonous. There's no blazing Pearl Jam-like guitars,crafty guitar work/rythyms of Alice In Chains, sharp/powerful tempo changes like Live and it just doesn't rock out like a Stone Temple Pilots Cd. I know the comparison will upset some people, but I would much-rather reach for and crank up something like that. As popular as this Cd is I expected it to be real good, despite a couple bright spots it just isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"This cd was AWFUL. i was going to buy it but i listened to my brother's copy and now i m glad i didn't.

(if you've listened to \\"What If\\" you have to admit it sounds like he's screaming WERD ERF! WERD ERF! over and over.) And all the songs sounded like that! Unless you like that kind of thing over actual music, you should NOT but this cd. if you like \\"Higher\\" and \\"Arms Wide Open,\\" get the singles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best rock in years!!","review":"I have been listening to rock music for over 30 years and I must say that Human Clay is one of the best CDs I have ever heard!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Power.","review":"This is an album about Power. Not only spiritual power, as has been addressed by other reviewers, but the power of us as humans. We have the power to make this world what we want. Creed powerfully suggests we use that power to make the world better. How can anyone disagree?This album is a hard rock presentation of that message. The incredible bass underlying \\"Higher\\" accentuates the question being asked - are we strong enough to use the power we have - while intimating that yes, indeed, we are strong enough, if we only try. The amazing \\"With Arms Wide Open\\" imposes a parental responsibility to not only exercise our own power for our children's benefit, but to further instill that power in our children, and to try to make our children's power greater than our own.The power of the message and the power of the music both on one disc. How can anyone disagree?"},{"rating":"2","title":"creed, human clay","review":"this is my favorite cd by far! i think that every song on it is written very well and it really potrays the thoughts well. my favorite song on it is never die or what if, so if u havent heard those songs go listen to them they are wonderful! well thats about it, so go buy this cd!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best rock in years","review":"first lets get the comparisons of pearl jam out of the way. i have been a pearl jam fan from the very begining, and still continue to follow the band. i feel the only comparison between these two bands is the fact that EDDIE VEDDER and Scott Stapp sound a similar. their music and creative talents are totally different. pearl jam maybe an influence , but creed is it's on band. my own prison was a refreshing return for rock considering all this rock/metal/rap crap coming about nowadays. human clay is just another huge step for creed and rock because the album is truly unbelieveable and still has no comparisons to pearl jam. if you do not enjoy this album it's because you are not a true rock fan and you do not like to think because stapp's creative talents make you think about life and that to me is awesome when someone can make you think and feel better about your life. so pick this album up if you relly want to go higher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creed is one of the better artists in popular music.","review":"For a while Creed fell out of popularity, but I don't care about things like that. These songs are good for people that are just getting into music, like teenagers. Like so many other bands in popular music, I think to myself; Where is justice? These bands are not much better than average and they are raking in millions, while many virtuosos can barely afford their clothes. Frankly, these songs are just too simple for me to get much enjoyment out of them. I listen to these songs maybe 3 times and am sick of them until a few years later. Then, I get bored and put it back in the player and reminisce. When I think of Creed, I think of the power of corporate America to make something only slightly above mediocre quality popular, especially because it conforms to a genre that is modern and popular."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely worthless garbage","review":"This has got to be Pearl Jam's worst ever album...no, wait. This is \\"Creed\\". Oh no. First there was Milli Vanilli, now this. Whereis music going to these days when a lame band can steal a sound pioneered by another and all of a sudden get their videos played on TV and sell millions of albums? I mean, has anyone ever actually seen the video for \\"Higher\\" and actually not laughed? This band are the biggest bunches of poseurs. Totally unoriginal and nauseating, please saveyour money for an Alice in Chains or Mudhoney CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's All Been Done","review":"Unfortunately for Creed's musical maturity...they won't experience it.A far better version of this album exists...it is called Ten, and it is by a humble little seattle quintet known as Pearl Jam...The problems with this release are numerous. The catchy guitar hooks and repetitive choruses serve to irritate true fans of grunge. Stapp's voice was pleasant on My Own Prison; he had a rich baritone, which has since become hoarse and grating as he valiantly attempts to imitate Eddie Vedder. With Arms Wide Open is a blatant rip-off of PJ's Release, but what makes the rip-off all the more sad is that, while Release was a spontaneous jam session by the PJ boys, Stapp et. al. had to really sit down and THINK about their song before they \\"created\\" it. And of course, lacking Mike McCready's spontaneous giutar noodling, this album's gitars sound engineered, at best. My advice? Go buy Pearl Jam, STP, and Alice In Chains."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I'm not just another Creed basher. I actually think this CD is horrible. Just listening to Scott Stapp's voice makes my blood curdle. How can anyone like his annoying voice?

And don't use the defence line \\"They're the biggest band in the world!\\" No, they're not, they are popular but they aren't the world's biggest band. Plus, there are BETTER bands out there!

I was a big fan of Creed's first album, and I can honestly say that this sophmore effort is exactly that...sophomoric. Higher has to be one of the worst songs on the radio today, and most of the songs have the main chorus being repeated so often you would swear that the intent of the song was to hypnotize you...or put you to sleep. I think the popularity of this album shows that people will line up and listen to anything these days, even an album where almost all of the songs sound the same.

Seriously, this is one of the worst rock albums I own. The lyrics are so overdone and \\"tragic\\" that you'd swear you're burning in hell. I can't believe the reviews this album is getting, \\"oh my God Creed is awesome I love Creed they are the best ever...\\" Their first album was much better, period. How 'bout their lame videos too. Everything this band does now is cookie-cutter. Definitely the 'N Sync of rock music. Go buy yourself an STP or Pearl Jam CD to find out what real bands can do. 4 1/2 stars? Ridiculous. Try again fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is wrong with you people?","review":"I don't know what is wrong with everyone, but I was reading the reviews, and all most all of them are negative. If you don't like Creed, then don't write a review! I have had this album ever since it came out, and love it. They give a positive message, with out all the cussing other bands use. The latest single, With Arms Wide Open, is a beautiful song written about his little son. Every song has a good meaning to it. For those of you who can't see that..

I don't see how so many people can like Creed. Personally, I think they're one giant bore. Their songs are soooo long and they keep on repeating the same things over, and over, and over, and over, and...well, you get the point. (Kinda like the Engergiser Bunny, huh?!) Their songs \\"Higher\\" and \\"With Arms Wide Open\\" are overplayed on the radio and because of that, they got very annoying. You can't even understand half of what they are saying because the hard-core music drowns out their voices. Creed is just as boring and stupid as 'N SYNC. Hmmmm...does Creed and 'N SYNC run in the same category? Looks that way! Both are annoying, boring, and just plain stupid. Don't buy this album; it's a total waste of money and your time.

Consequently I bought Human Clay based on the buzz and hearing a few cuts on the radio. I also bought a classic, Springsteen's Born to Run. Played back to back, I can only say that if Creed is today's Rock and Roll, I'll take the classics like Springsteen any time. Creed is so dreary and lacking in excitement, I could barely play the whole disk. I kept hoping for some change in tempo or tone as cut by cut went by. It didn't happen. Human Clay's next playing will be in the CD exchange, I should be able to pick up a few classics for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpraised? Times Ten!","review":"I am a big fan of My Own Prison, which I thought was one of the better CD's to hit the mainstream in quite some time when it burst out. Human Clay, however, just seems like a conscious attempt to turn the attention they earned into a cash machine. It obviously worked, as Human Clay has sold over 10 million copies. I think there are decent tracks here, but I honestly can't find anything that holds up to my favorite tracks from My Own Prison (the album ending pair, \\"What's This Life For?\\" and \\"One\\"). I don't understand how a song like \\"With Arms Wide Open\\" can get so much praise. It's a decent track, but trying to believe that it's better than, say, \\"jimmy\\" by Tool just leaves me confused with the state of music. It may not be in a state of complete dysfunction, but it seems somehow hijacked. Which, appropriately, is basically how I feel about Creed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faceless man? More like faceless band","review":"After listening to their generic debut, I somehow hoped this album will mark an improvement over My Own Prison, and forge their own unique sound. Well, no such luck. The songs in this album are pretty much the same to their first one. I'm sure the grunge-loving kids will lap this album up, even if this sound has been done a heck of a lot better by those early Seattle bands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"An absolutely unbelievably bad CD. I was extremely disappointed. The only song with any pop resonance whatsoever is Higher. Word of mouth will have this one plummetting from its No. 1 perch in no time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creed = 90s grunge ripoff, nothing original here","review":"With Human Clay, as well as in my own prison, Creed seems content with sounding exactly the same as pearl jam, alice in chains, soundgarden etc. Creed is living in the past and even if it had been released say in 1994, you would still find nothing original in this band. If you like Creed's songs, why settle for a mediocre generic substitute when you can have the real thing. Go out and buy Pearl Jam's TEN, Alice in Chain's DIRT, Soundgarden's SUPERUNKNOWN, or even Stone Temple Pilot's CORE and you'll find that Creed seems to borrow everything and improve on nothing. Eddie Vedder et al have moved on passed grunge, even if it is not making them any money because grunge is dead, now Creed, please die too"},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE: Christain band trying to be Pearl Jam","review":"I made the most unfortunate mistake of purchasing this bands first album. There is VERY little originality in any of this band's compositions. They go to great lengths to rip off Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice In Chains and other grunge act's sound. To make matters even worse, they try to convey their right-wing religious convictions in nearly every song. Their lead singer trys really hard to pull off an Eddie Vedder imitation. Unless you're into so called \\"Christian Rock\\" I would stay away from this band and all their albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've heard worse.","review":"But only from boy-bands.Creed's overwrought, awkward, poorly crafted lyrics and uninspired melodies are in full force on this album. Slickly processed, commercialized garbage is still garbage, folks.Sure, they're popular. So are American cheese, backyard wrestling, and heroin. The fact that they're popular doesn't mean they have any intrinsic value."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least they're consistant....","review":"Ah Creed. To think that when I heard their first album I thought they had potential. They might have, but that all ended with Human Clay. I owned this cd for a little while, and I must admit, sometimes I really enjoyed listening to it. However, one thing stuck out to me like nothing else - all the songs are the EXACT same. They're the same tempo (I swear they used a metronome on the same tempo for the whole dang cd), the same structure, and the list goes on. It gets to the point where you might as well put one track from the album on repeat and you're not missing anything. Amazon chose an excellent word: redundant. Seriously, there are SO many other, better bands out there if people would just make the effort to find them. Unfortunately, that would require effort, and heaven forbid we do anything on our own. I'll get off my soapbox now, but hopefully this was helpful to anyone who was thinking of wasting away precious money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Human Clay? try Human WASTE.","review":"\\"Never Die\\", \\"With Arms Wide Open\\" and \\"Higher\\" are the ONLY good songs on this CD. I can't imagine owning this CD and was glad that I only borrowed it from my cousin. Ugh! Terrible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is ok, but I think My Own Prison is better.","review":"I loved Creed's My Own Prison album. The day this album came out, I bought it. The 1st song \\"Are You Ready\\" is the perfect song to start of with to begin the cd. Then the 2nd song \\"What If\\", is probably the best song on the album. But the rest of it doesn't sound incredible like the songs on My Own Prison did. They are pretty good like \\"Higher\\" is also a great song, but it just doesn't flow that nicely. You might have to listen to this a few times to like it, but overall its a cd that you should buy if you liked any Creed songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"gets old quickly","review":"I got this album soon after it first came out. It was interesting for a while. However, after a while the music just got bland. It seem that the band really did not put all to much into the album. My own prison was good because Strapp put a lot of heartfelt emotion into the album but Human Clay shows how success can spoil a band. Stick with my own prison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant Lyrics","review":"I bought this because I liked \\"My Own Prison\\" plus I had heard \\"Higher\\" released on radio. When I heard \\"With Arms Wide Open\\" it really hit me because my wife and I just had a baby girl. She fills my life with so much joy! I hope and pray she greets the world with Arms Wide Open. Excellant CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a true rock band finally!","review":"this is album is amazing call them Hurled Ham wanna be-s christin rock neah, they are great their lyrics have a great meaning to them their only problem is Scot Stapp sing more clearly then it would be purrfect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly the worst disgrace to alternative music ever","review":"This album is pathetic. The music sounds old and uninspired, the lyrics are the worst string of cliches I have seen this year...and the VOCALS. Don't get me started.I really tried to like this band. But this music is just so fake. Couple that with the fact that Mark Tremonti did an interview and openly bashed the bands Creed rips off (Nirvana, Pearl Jam) and going so far as to say Scott Stapp barely sounds like Eddie Vedder...it's all too much. I don't only dislike this band...I *hate* it. I LOATHE this cheap excuse for grunge.And you can go ahead and click this review was not helpful. It's not that I'm trying to put down fans of this sound...I just want to say, if you like Creed's sound, and it's new to you...check out bands like Stone Temple Pilots, Alice In Chains and Pearl Jam. Those bands are Creed with better music, lyrics, singers and most of all...they have real emotion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious, derivitive crap from a fad band","review":"How many more bands do we need that sound EXACTLY like early Pearl Jam? We've already had Candlebox, Seven Mary Three, The Nixons, Silverchair, etc. The only difference here is that these guys seem to think this is some real important stuff they're doing. Crappy, crappy, crappy. Oh well, they will be forgotten in 5 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad.","review":"I don't like Creed at all. So it comes as no surprise that I can hardly stand this album. This whole band just appears to me as a pale imitation of Pearl Jam.Where Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder writes earnest lyrics that translate to universal experience and get the emotion's he's trying to express across flawlessly, the lyrics written by Scott Stapp of Creed just come off sounding either completely fabricated or very pretentious, like he's making an endless sales pitch for his spirituality.Overall, this album just reminds me of better music I could be listening to. Don't waste your money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally original...for a knock-off band.","review":"How can you say that this band is totally original? How can you say it's PARTIALLY original? These guys probably started a Pearl Jam fan club in their church. Maybe when writing an album praising God is more important than scraping up some originality...too bad there seems to be no artful way to combine the two."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's nothing worse","review":"This is, by far, the worst band I have ever heard. Creed is bad enough when you listen without making references, but when you consider that everything they record is a ripoff of one thing or another the whole experience becomes doubly horrible (if this is at all possible). I can't believe that anyone actually listens to this nauseating crap. Creed is comparable in musical value to fingernails on a chalkboard (no offense meant toward the chalkboard). Whoever signed these morons to a label should be institutionalized. If there is an ounce of mercy in the world, Creed will mysteriously disappear from the face of the earth, never to record another note."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WAS DISSAPOINTED...","review":"this album was very dissapointing... i bought it think it was gonna be as good as the first... i was VERY wrong. this album was below scum.i didn't even get past thie 5th song... there is only 1 good song... \\"what if\\". i will be forever mad at myself for buy this \\"less than an album\\"......... trust me.. it stinks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"derivative trash","review":"it's surprising and depressing that so many of the prior reviewers of this album rate it so highly. i listened to this album at a used cd store and am grateful i did so because it saved me from wasting my money. the sanctimonious posturing, both physically and lyrically, of their lead singer is so contrived and comical that i think them to be another in a long and boring line of those who so completely lack their own originality that they must copy those who came before- those who, incidentally, did a much better job at creating worthwhile music. i would only recommend this to someone i disliked intensely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two great songs wrapped around a bunch of filler","review":"I do like Creed, though many people have endlessly dissed them. Though the Pearl Jam, Alice In Chains and Stone Temple Pilots comparisons are obviously there, I do feel that the band has potential to created their own sound. Their first album, My Own Prison, dealt with Scott Stapp's childhood and adolescence in a highly religious family; the album contained a number of good songs. Their third and best CD, Weathered, shows maturity and range, much like the 1990's version of Metallica. Now comes the second and worst of the three albums, Human Clay. This album is downright unlistenable, with the exception of two songs, the singles Higher and With Arms Wide Open(GREAT bass work on both songs by Brian Marshall). For their next album, I hope they decide to take it to the next level, and not stay in mediocrity. Peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"the fan club","review":"formerly never one to join even the Mickey Mouse Club , I am estatic about the popularity the creed music is getting for local air time here in Virginia Beach ,VA. so the fine print in the cd case , along with the gracious credits , also contains the web site , CREEDnet.COM , and the fanclub membership address for merchandise : P o Box 2 0 3 4 6 Tallahassee , FL 32316-0346 I 've been so impressed with the conotations of these lyrics for \\" my own prison,\\" that it would be a crime to leave \\" human Clay\\" out of the collection Thanks , and Hang in there !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Sensual","review":"I think Creed really blew off the charts with their hit song \\"With Arms wide open\\", everytime I hear that song I get chills. They have such a unique way of expressing their lyrics. For an alternative song it has alot of sensuality to it and it is one of those hits where you can kick back with your guy or girl and just chillout and get close, which is not easy to do with alternative tracks. I give Creed 5 stars on this one they really show their talent in alot of ways. SO GET OUT AND BY THIS CD, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creed doesn't do anything new, but still a good album","review":"I haven't heard Creed's first album to compare it with this one, but if I compare it to other album's of this type of music, I have to say that Creed isn't doing anything new. However, that doesn't mean it isn't a good example of it's type. I still listen to \\"Higher\\" almost everyday. The song just puts me in a good mood! However, none of the other songs really grab me the way that \\"Higher\\" does. The album is definitely worth buying, but I see it more as a good one for right now, not one that will stand the test of time like Pearl Jam's Ten, for example. Speaking of Pearl Jam, you will either really like this album because they sound similar to Pearl Jam or you will hate it because you think it is a rip off of Pearl Jam. I debated between 3 or 4 stars. If \\"Higher\\" wasn't on here I would have given it 3 stars, but because of \\"Higher\\" I gave it 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Sad, You Know","review":"Forgettable.

Not with this album. Trade in material in 3 months at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creed at its Worst","review":"I disliked this album almost instantly.There are a few strong points. \\"Beautiful\\" and \\"Say I\\" pack a back-to-back punch early in the CD, and \\"Faceless Man,\\" although long, adds something as well. The rest of the album is overly cliched (if you can't see this in \\"Higher,\\" then don't bother reading my review). \\"Higher\\" I consider the worst song on the CD; its nothing but pure unadulterated cheese. \\"With Arms Wide Open\\" isn't great either, but at least its about his kid, so he gets a little pass - but there's much better out there. \\"What If\\" also fails to deliver any impact, and the rest of the album is no better.Creed is a hit-or-miss band. They've released some great songs and some real bad ones. And most of those bad ones show up on \\"Human Clay.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Creed's third album title.......Creed - Ignorant Hobo Clowns","review":"SERIOUSLY FOLKS...DON'T BUY THIS CD!!! I cannot stress it enough. First off, they have already sold practically 10 million 'Human Clay' albums. Secondly, there is absolutely nothing innovative about their tunes. Nearly every track on the cd begins with an 8-count guitar jingle then ignorantly and so conceivably they'll follow with garbled rock noises with Scott's ailing and bellowing voices of meaningless lyrics. I seriously consider Britney Spears's lyrics much more intricate and complex then that of Creed. Bottom line: Yes, Creed is a great band...a great band to throw rocks at. If you are in search of a great band and you are completely sick of the regeneration in music today...... Listen to Third Eye Blind music....It's a remedy for a lost cause."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uck! Music that preaches is not good music!","review":"Creed is a Christian Pearl Jam. I don't know if it's a bad coincidence that the singer's voice sounds like Eddie Vedder (well, maybe Eddie Vedder on crack, or Eddie Vedder after he converted to some crazy Southern snake charmer sect) but it irratates me immensely.Each song on this album is like something you'd hear at the dentist's office. The lyrics are worse than a Dr. Laura monologue! And like other bands, most of the reasons the group did so well is that chicks dig the members. Good looks get the benjamins rollin', baby.Bad album!

I have now purchased their second album, Human Clay and I love it. Their songs are written with so much emotion and pain and they really move me. My favorite tracks are With Arms Wide Open and Wash Away Those Years these tracks along with all of them take you on an emotional journey that is spiritual and wondeful.

They're not exactly what I'd classify as \\"hard rock\\" either... it seems they're just one of many bands with throaty vocals that's popping up in the pop music limelight lately. The CD ain't the greatest I've heard ever, but it ain't the worst either. The real test of how great they are (or not) is if they survive the next five to ten years- and if their music keeps evolving... the mark of any good band is the sound doesn't remain stagnant and changes with the times... and from similarity of songs on their two CD's out, I'm seriously wondering if they will survive..."},{"rating":"2","title":"~Grunge is not dead and this album proves it!","review":"When I first heard \\"Higher\\" on the radio, I'll be honest, I thought it was a new Pearl Jam song.

My favorite songs are What If, Beautiful, Never Die, With Arms Wide Open, and Higher. All the songs are good and melodic, loud but soft metal. The only flaw is that Scott's voice can get annoying.I was flipping channels one night and stumbled on The My VH1 Music Awards on VH1. They had just announced that Creed had won the Welcome To The Big Time Award. That's not true. Creed has been selling records since 1997 with their also great album, \\"My Own Prison\\". I would buy this if you are a fan of anything but rap or hip hop, because it is far from that. From the love crying ballads such as With Arms Wide Open to the loud songs such as What If, this album was truly made of \\"Masterpice Clay\\".

I will admit that some of the songs are pretty good. They'd be fair compared to anything off of \\"ten\\", but with today's music seen, their actually pretty good. However, these guys really need to develop their own sound. There is no originality here at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant","review":"I want to begin by saying this CD is REDUNDANT. The songs all blend together and are all downcast grumblings about how horrible life is and how we are all damned. It's really too bad, considering their strong first outing, and also considering that the single \\"Higher\\" is a great song. There are only one or two other good songs on this CD, one of them being the powerful \\"Wash Away Those Years\\". The listener can discern the extra money that went into production, but the songs are simply not that great. More time between CDs would have been a good remedy. Shame on Creed for pandering to the flavor of the month music trend today popularized by MTV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bringing God Back","review":"I just went to the Creed concert last night and for anyone who claims that Creed is not a Chrisitan band then maybe they can explain why Scott Stapp stood up and said \\"There is only one way, God's Way\\" They are Christian and thank God Almighty!"},{"rating":"1","title":"heard this before somwhere!!","review":"i liked them better when they were called PEARL JAM!!!!!!!!! GET YOUR OWN SOUND BOYS! 10 YEARS TOO LATE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Glob Of Festering Goo","review":"Creed is pretentious, humourless, derivative waste product diverted from a Chernobyl sewage treatement plant. Do yourself a favor - find another band with their own sound and ideas.Creed = Pearl Jam for toddlers."},{"rating":"1","title":"fruitopia","review":"this has got to be the most insipid, boring, uninspired, and trite music i have ever had the misfortune to endure. creed does acclomplish what they sought out to do...make money off of mediocre ballad music which infiltrates the top of the charts like a malignant tumor. i see no distinction between this and countless other manufactured grunge bands riding the hype kurt cobain generated, and the rest of the year 2000's pack of drivel ( nickelback, saliva, default, seether, etc...). not to sound pretentious, but you'de be better off buying a brick and smashing it against your head, because sooner or later, you'll want to."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you thought Creed was awsome before........","review":".....Listen to them now. This CD blows my mind.Creed's Human Clay album picks up right where \\"My Own Prison\\" left off without missing a chord. I love it and am very satisfied. If you like their first album then Human Clay won't dissapoint you.Tell me if you like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great effort from a great band!","review":"After listening to this album the first way through i wasn't all that impressed, but a couple spins of the CD later i was hooked. \\"Beautiful\\" is one of the best songs I've heard in awhile. \\"Say I\\" and \\"What If\\" are also very strong tracks. Although the rest of the album is good, it's not quite as catchy as MoP. This is not a bad thing at all though; Creed is maturing and I'm sure they will be making albums for years to come. The only problem is that they will always be referred to as a Soundgarden/Pearl Jam/Alice in Chains hybrid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid!","review":"Creed didn't mess with the succes of My Own Prison. The new cd doesn't deviate from the style of their debut at all. For Creed, this is a very good quality because their distinctiveness is their sound. While it doesn't have the \\"immediate impact songs\\" like MoP did. This cd is better listening through and through. MoP had songs (in the middle) that were a little weak, but Human Clay doesn't have a bad song on it. Tracks that stand out the most to me include, \\"Arms Wide Open\\" , \\"Faceless Man\\", and \\"Higher\\". It's good to see a hard rock band that doesn't sing about pain or anarchy. I hope Creed makes MANY more CD's!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Know Everything About Everything","review":"I know everything about this style of music and about this band and about this album. I own all their albums, and all the albums of this style of music, and all the albums ever made. Heck, I own albums that weren't ever made. So when I tell you that this album is good, I'm not talking like some new twit on the block. I've been listening this band before you were ever born, before they ever recorded their first album, before they even thought of recording their first album. I saw these guys in concert so many times, and no one else has ever seen them that many times, so when I say \\"great.\\" I mean \\"great\\" like a profession and not some casual listener like you out there. Hey, I know. You don't know nothin.' You're stupid, and stupid people like you should listen to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't see anything special on this cd...","review":"There is simply nothing special on this cd. The music here lacks lots of things. It is very simple and uninspired. Don't get me wrong, I've heard lots of music that is simple yet great. But this one lacks the spirit. It might sound very good to you the first time you listen to it, but eventually you will see that it just gets boring instead of getting deeper. The lyrics are alright, and some are very thoughtfully and emotionally written like Inside Us All. But overall I think the only reason for Creed to get here is commercialisation. There is nothing more to their \\"success\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good music but not very original","review":"The music here is really good for what it is, but the thing is that its not very original sounding. Creed sound JUST like Pearl Jam, and Pearl Jam is a lot better. This is basically 90's alternative music which has been a little played out. If you want new rock i suggest Static x or Incubus. Any of you kids who like this stuff should definently get Ten by Pearl Jam. That one is a classic"},{"rating":"1","title":"MY MOUTHS NOT OPEN","review":"this is a horrible band. scott staff cant sing. the muisc is ok. i cant think of anything good to say about them so i will leave it at that"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CD!","review":"This is now my favorite CD. The first songs I'd heard from Creed were What If and Higher...I wasn't sure if I would like the other songs on the CD, but this is the only one that I can listen to from start to finish and love every song. It's a great CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome back real music","review":"With the rebirth of rock and the hopefull death of boy bands and these modern day lolita singers, Creed breathes a breath of fresh air which has not been smelled for a while. With the Pumpkins over, Oasis on the outs, and Pearl Jam seemingly declining in popularity, Creed has slowly taken the riegns and with Human Clay I don't think they are going to let go any time soon. This is best album of the 90's and in 2000, this is as good as it gets. Rock here and pop is dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Top CD's of 1999","review":"Alot of good music was released in 1999. Creed was the band that really gave the edge over most this year. I personally didn't know much about Creed before hearing the now classic tune Higher. If you're looking for a hip, edgy CD with extrememly deep lyrics, this is the one to buy. This CD is full of variety whether its the high energized What If, the imagination of Beautiful or the deep message of With Arms Wide Open. Some messages are religious but put in the energy such bands like Limp Bizkit. This CD shocked me it must be my favourite cd and they have become my favourite band. Buy this CD you'll be impressed"},{"rating":"2","title":"If anything else... get the CD for track number 8","review":"\\"With Arms Wide Open\\" is such a beautiful song. Scott wrote this around the time his wife gave birth... What a beautiful, thoughtful way to show a child you care... Oh... and the rest of the CD is amazing, too. If you liked Creed's \\"My Own Prison\\" or have been so lucky to see them live, you know how talented these guys are. This is a MUST have for your CD collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing But Billiance!","review":"Creed has definitely touched my soul with their lyrics. They are so inspiring and attempt to bring hope for what can, at times, seem like a cruel world in which we live. With Arm Wide Open, Are You Ready?, What If?, Higher. These are songs with profound words to them.And how could I not mention the head moving/ear pounding guitar chords that come from their songs. This definitely is a band with a special gift/talent. And are puting it to work not only for their own benefit, but for that of The Faceless Man as well..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is complete crap!","review":"I have liked Creed in the past, yet after this album I hate them forever! I threw it straight in my kitty litter box as soon as I heard it. Too bad they lost all of their talent and are just anothing scrounging band trying to get thier 15 minutes of fame. If you are considering buying this Cd, trust me DONT!! Go buy something that has some real music on it- like Manson!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A View of an Italian Crime Novel","review":"It is refreshing to read a book written with insights into another country's legal system.

The other lure books are great, don't get me wrong, I have them all...but Lewis took the chance and did the book no one else wanted to do. All those other authors treat the more modern lures like stepkids, even at shows they are just now getting into the displays and out of the tackle boxes.Of course, now the value will go up on all my lures once everyone buys this book.There aren't as many prices in the book as I had hoped but if you really read the book, he gives you plenty of aid here on what things are worth.

I have never played a guitar that plays so flawlessly. Vibratos play smoothly, good soloing acoustic, also rich sounding chords. The only two problems I have had are the starter strings were rusted and broke in a week, and also, the tuner preamp is very confusing at the start.

It takes me on the average twice as long to translate with this book than when I borrow the text that I should be working off of.

It has a \\"low battery\\" light and should be just the thing to help me avoid charging my batteries pre-maturely and bringing on the dreaded memory effect.

I loved his writing style and honestly couldn't put the book down. I found the book interesting from the first page until the last page and loved Jake's honesty and the way the characters played off each other. It is amazing how Jake took a SLAM DUNK prosecution case and evolved it the way he did. I can't wait to read the other 6 books in the series now . . .

Three months later it started leaking air and was useless. Amazon was great and sent me a replacement chair in 2 days. Two months later the replacement chair is no longer holding air. My daughter is 25lbs and just shy of 2 years old. She doesn't use the chair on a daily basis and when she does use it she sits and watches tv. She doesn't jump on it, no older kids have every used it. There is no reason why this chair should be deflating on its own. It seems to be defective by design and I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't stay inflated, difficult to sit in","review":"I purchased this chair before Christmas for less than half of retail and thought I was getting a good deal. I should have read the reviews more closely.My daughter was 18mo at Christmas, and she had a hard time sitting in the chair. It sloped forward and made it difficult for her to sit in the seat without sliding out. We tried letting some air out in hopes that would help, but it didn't.After just a couple days, we began noticing the chair deflating. We couldn't find the leak. I was going to use it to hold her dolls, but with it deflating, it won't work for that either.Spend your money on something else -- this chair isn't worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Chair is horrible and no where in the description does it say inflatable!!!","review":"I got this chair for my little granddaughter. I was so disappointed to see it come in a flat box because I didnt know it was inflatable. Once we got it inflated she tried it and it scared her half to death.

However, it is NOT for someone just beginning to learn the Spanish language. It does not go into detail on basic information or words in Spanish, but offers a practical review of basic Spanish grammar and conjugations. That being said, I had 3 semsters of Spanish in college (almost 8 years ago), and felt that it gave me enough review, as well as greatly added to my Spanish vocabulary."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Bueno","review":"What an overpriced disappointment.

Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Concert, but...","review":"I'd rate the concert portrayed here as very good for it's day. I don't know of other legitimate video releases that cover this period; therefore it does have worth to longtime Kinks fans. I do enjoy the show, weird camera angles and all. The original recording was probably very good; I'd love to see a better copy of it.Now, on to THIS DVD. It is terribly out of sync, which is a HUGE distraction.This can't be sanctioned by the band. There is no mention of any of their usual record or video labels. There are ZERO liner notes or credits. I suppose it's in public domain by now.SO... since the Kinks likely get nothing from us purchasing this poorly reproduced video, I'd suggest you save your money and download the thing from youtube in identical quality. If this were only avilable here, I'd be forced to give it a higher rating, but as I said; get it elswhere...And if you run into Ray Davis, ask him to put out some quality material from this era.

I actually thought at times that he was Orson. Really great story and not what you expect which is a very nice surprise. Of course Zac Efron will please the young audience with his charm and good looks but McKay really does steal the show...just like Orson Wells did in real life. Great movie and should have been a huge hit...don't miss seeing this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound Bites","review":"The movie quality was fine, but the sound didn't match the actor's mouth movements.

Something is just missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"wtf","review":"This price is wrong, right? $969.00.I understand that there are 2 unreleased versions of the movie. Perhaps this is one of them. In one version Welles eats the entire cast 40 minutes into the movie. The other, I understand, has Zac totally nude throughout the movies. Still not worth the price. I hope you all understand hyperbole."},{"rating":"1","title":"I sat through it","review":"I watched this only because I liked the actors. If you like over the top acting and actors acting like actors then watch this. It's got some cute parts, but for the most part it was boring.

I give this a star only because it's got Claire Danes in it and I'm a fan, other then that I would not have given it a star at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Brow and Uninspired","review":"After the first 15 minutes of this movie, you're left wondering if there is a likable character in it. The low brow sex references are appallingly juvenile. If you are the type of person who can't stop watching until you know if the play opens on Thursday or not, you'll love this movie. If, however, you demand substance and depth in a film, this is one to pass on. If you're only going to watch this because you're a Claire Danes fan, watch Temple Grandin instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"good charlotte rocks","review":"i think the young and the hopeless totally rocks.goodcharlotte has made another awsome cd"},{"rating":"2","title":"posted a retail review","review":"If you like good music and original thought, I suggest you go and Buy Good Charlotte's 'The Young and the Hopeless'.It has a great punk sound with meaningful lyrics.They are four intelligent young men with something to say, which is not commonly found in music today.I think it's their best Cd to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Charlotte","review":"The only word to describe this c.d is awesome.

The only people that should listen to this (well if it were up to me they would be arrested for crimes against music, and no one would be allowed to listen to this ) are teeny boppers.This kind of garbage should not sell so well, let alone they shouldn't be signed by any record label.

The one thing that a band needs to make a decent album is creativity and overall talent, and this band lacks both of those things.

If you are a fan of simple plan I would recomend this album to you because it sounds similar to it.

If you do like punk, I would pick up Slick Shoes, they are awesome"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Crap","review":"I cannot believe that people like this band. Maybe if your cheesy and don't even know what punk is then listen to GC. GC is more like soft rock in a sense. No yelling, no good guitar, just a crap filled cd.

Sure they look punk and act punk, but their music doesn't refelct it in the least. I give it a 1/2 star. So if you want to listen to sell outs then buy GC's albums. Everyone knows who GC is. Thats not the sense with real punk bands. Other bands are more underground, no one knows much about them. Really, please take my advice, GC just isn't punk.

Buy this CD, youll be happy, I guarentee!"},{"rating":"1","title":"When will it end????","review":"I've said this before and I will surely say it again many more times: Good Charlotte are filthy, unholy, disgusting pigs that serve no purpose of being on this Earth. Their fans are evil spirits of the underworld, who are ALSO filthy, unholy, and disgusting.Send me hate mail if you wish....\\"wALdOrF rEpReZeNt!\\"The irony is delicious...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alright, alright....","review":"I will have to say this about Good Charlotte (aka \\"GC\\"): They ARE punk...just not in the traditional sense. They are \\"MTV-trash/processed\\" punk...like the ludicrously pathetic Avril Lavigne, Simple Plan, and, well, just about any other \\"musical\\" acts that appear on MTV. The songs may sound good, but if you look past their goth clothes, distorted guitars, and the lead singer's almost mechanized voice (why they still left it whiny and annoying is lost on me) and strip Good Charlotte down to the basics, their songs are nothing but pathetic rhymes and standard chord progressions. I can honestly say that (as a guitar player myself) I could write better songs with deeper meanings than Good Charlotte. It's not that hard.PLEASE don't buy into MTV's web of wannabes...for the sake of the rest of us, if not yourself as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"buy this record!","review":"ok, im so sick of everyone saying sh*t about good charlotte. they are just doing wat they love to do. some people even bought this record when they hate good charlotte. wat the f*ck is wrong with you? if you dont like the band then its probaly best u dont waste your money on thier CD. if u dont like them then stop wasting your time writing mean reviews about them. its just a waste of time. if you dont like them then u dont. u dont have to tell the whole world, beacuse half the world probaly doesnt even care. good charlotte are one of the best bands out there and if u got a problem with that cry me a river, build me a bridge, and get over it. i recomend that you buy this record. it is really good, and you shouldnt care what other people think about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You are a joke","review":"Well, lets begin. This CD is a joke just like anyone who buys it is. It doesnt matter if its punk or not( and yes its not punk), because its horrible. Its poppy, made for Mtv music. By the way all of you guys who think anyone can scream, go ahead and try it. And no linkin park is not a hardcore band, their screaming is pretty weak, and they too are made for Mtv. Try listening to real hardcore bands to hear screaming( Atreyu, From Autumn to Ashes, or even screamo bands like A static Lullaby and Thursday). Who really cares if this CD is punk or not, its just bad music. The lyrics are poppy and catchy with no real substance, and the music is equal to other mtv bands like sum41."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say posers?","review":"Good Charlotte sucks, if you think you like punk you should listen to good bands like Thrice. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"?","review":"If you guys don't like GC then why the hell are you here? This is for people who actually do like them and want to buy their cd not read a bunch of sh*t that you people think. Cause honestly I know people don't give a sh*t what you people think. Get a life. and for you people that say they aren't talented I'd like to see you write and play your own songs *almost* 365 days a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont bother unless...","review":"ok. first of all good charlotte is not that great. i didnt buy the cd i just heard it at my girl friends house. honestly i don't know why she has it. this is just one of the many bands who's look does not fit their music. they look like hadcord punks but they are one of the most poopiest bands i know. i belive they are lyriclly chanlenged. this mainly shows in \\"girls and boys\\" The only reason i give it two stars is because there are only bout 3 good songs on it. If you like pop bands go ahead and buy it but if your not dont bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's the big deal?","review":"I'm a Good Charlotte fan and I have been for a few years now. I don't care that they're aren't \\"punk\\". Why do so many people have a problem with that? They are just doing what they love to do. Sure, they may dress a little more punkish than their music is, but what's wrong with that? That's how they like to dress. And yes, there is a difference between them and NSYNC. They write their own music and play their own instruments. I love this cd and I can't wait until they record another one. I've also seen them live twice and they are really amazing. You should buy this cd and not worry about what's punk and what's not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly Uncreative","review":"What ever happened to good guitarists? I'd much prefer to Zeppelin, Hendrix, Guns N Roses, or someone who knows how to make a decent song. My first problem is, all their songs sound so similar! It's like they're following a formula. Throw in a different song to mix it up a bit, please!! And the songs are just so simple. Somewhere out there, Clapton and Page are waiting to hear more than two or three chords. Honestly, singing to a few simple chord takes very little talent. Now, I admit, there are a few songs, (such as Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous) that actually are pretty catchy. Not great or anything, like White Room or Free Bird, but good enough to move this up to a two stars. I don't care for their singer's voice that much. The bassist isn't bad, but just playing roots or the melody isn't that good, either. Nice drumming, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Punk-Pop Masters","review":"Good Charlotte is the absolute best punk-pop band ever, and this CD just makes it even clearer. Even my dad liked it!The first song, \\"A New Beginning,\\" is really weird, but \\"The Anthem,\\" \\"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous,\\" and \\"Wondering\\" make up for the \\"A New Beginning.\\" This is one of the few CDs where the songs don't get worse after the fourth song. In fact, my favorite song is at the end, \\"Young and the Hopeless.\\"All in all, this CD is worth your 12 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Charlotte is more like it","review":"Oh boy, oh boy! Another bland MTV-friendly poppy \\"yo-yo-we're-sooo-punk-dawg\\" album for your little sister to \\"rock out\\" to on the bus! Spare me. Hey, I admit I like some pop-punk as long as it's catchy (IE: Blink 182, Simple Plan, the Ataris), but this isn't even remotely memorable. This album makes rich preppy chearleaders think they're punk rock. This should not continue. The fact that the one \\"guy\\" is wearing a Casualties shirt is just plain flat out sacrilege. Seriously, everybody, just buy the entire Green Day collection, and I guarantee you'll be MUUUUCH happier.If you like this album, than the title describes you quite well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rap punk?!??! Say it aint so!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"These geeks should have also been in the grouping of all the other mall punk bands, but deserved a smidge more attention for subjecting us to their \\"rock show\\" on mtv... strangely enough, a show that had nothing rock n' roll about it whatsoever. Way to go dudes, talking about Nofx in between playing Disturbed videos lit our world on fire. 11 year olds in Nebrahoma are hanging onto every word these morons are saying, thus sealing their cute and cuddly mall punk destinies. These clowns make Sum 41 look like Black Flag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah, like this...","review":"Ok, this is just what i think. I think this CD is awesome! I know it's not punk, but i dont care. And i've heard them play live, and they are great! Joel CAN sing, the drummer CAN play drumms, and the rest is awesome at the guitars. I mean, everyone who says that they cant sing and play, have you ever been on a gig? Or at least seen a live video-clip? I dont think you have, becouse these guys are rockin' the boat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hey","review":"Alright, so you're considering buying a Good Charlotte album, are you? That is completely you're business and if you want to buy it go ahead. I'm not going to go on and on about how they are not really \\"punk\\" beacuase that's pretty damn pretentious. However I am going to offer you some alternatives to it, that it my opinion, are much, much better. You should consider getting an album (or two) by: Circle Jerks, Black Flag, The Clash, Operation Ivy, Anti-Flag, The Ramones, The Damned, Dead Kennedys, Crass, Stiff Little Fingers, Rancid, Tiger Army, AFI, Misfits, Nekromantix...and much, much more. So anyway I hope that if you haven't heard of these bands (obviously you've heard of The Clash and The Ramones)you check them out and enjoy them."},{"rating":"2","title":"omg u r soo true","review":"omg i read what the person from Agoura Hills said about this cd and thats exactly what i think every timei listen to it i'm not saying this is a bad cd, i happent o be a fan but those guys need to think about there lyrics more"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too bad there's only 5 stars available...","review":"OMG I love this CD.

You can't get any more wanna-beish or poseurish than this. Song after song is boy band punk poseur crap. I'm not sure who would like this besides half brain morons with no ears. Can't you all see that they're a boy band in disguise, I mean they probably don't even really play the instruments. I'm thirteen and my band can make ten times better music than these guys.

I can't beleive that all of these brainwashed MTV lovers thought that this was such a great cd. The vocalist whines about his life and so many challenges we have to go through...blah blah blah. He doesn't even sound like he ever should have been a singer with his wannabe screams. If you listen to the drums they do not even sound real. They sound electric. Poser punks like Good Charlotte should not be allowed to dress like they do. They look like they copied Rancid's look in their dumb video \\"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.\\" If you wanna listen to REAL punk go buy some NOFX, Agnostic Front, and Rancid cds. DOWN WITH POSERS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely terrible","review":"When reviewers said that none of the band members knew how to play an instrument, it was true. And sadly, it still is. It is so typical of the mainstream media to churn out worthless, meaningless pop-punk garbage simply to make a buck or two off of airheaded teenagers who simply buy an album because it is popular/the band members are \\"hot\\"/accepted by everyone/takes no intelligence to listen to/etc... I find it funny when Good Charlotte fans say something to the degree of: \\"Don't hate them just because the bands you like aren't popular and they are.\\" What a load of bovine excrement. Being popular never has anything to do with talent. As I can recall, Bumblefoot has no Platinum albums. Does that make them untalented? Of course not. Then wake up and start listening to music with substance and value. \\"Boys like girls but girls like cars and money.\\" That's deep. Listen to some Dream Theater."},{"rating":"1","title":"VOMIT","review":"This cd makes gives me the runs and makes me vomit at the same time it's so bad. This band should be fined by the FCC because their music is so bad it's OBSCENE to listen to.

You guys make me sick. VOMIT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the scum of punk (if you can give it such a compliment)","review":"This is why people say punk is dead, because of sell out turds like good charlotte. I don't think these guys ever were punk, but having that word in their genre is a crying shame. If your gonna do punk, do it right. The Adicts, the Casualties, dead kennedys, these are the bands that make punk proud. Hell, even rancid, which is a recent unfortunate sell out, is better than this imitation rock, i can't even call it punk anymore. This band will die just like all those other punk wannabes, so stick with the adicts, dead kennedys, and casualties, theyve been around for 30 years and are still going strong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best.....it's aight tho....","review":"If you want the best of GC, czech out their earlier stuff. This CD tho, is what proves that Good Charlotte has majorly sold out. I give this CD 2 stars for 'Hold On', because it is a beautiful song, and the vid is very touching. But other than that it's so...blah!!! i prefer Simple Plan's \\"No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls 10x to this. Same with \\"Sing The Sorrow\\" by AFI. czech those 2 out!!! You'll love them far better than this over-rated crappola!!!!~*~Matt~*~"},{"rating":"1","title":"A CD to burn not buy","review":"Sadly disappointing. After friends had gone on about this CD for a while I saw it in MVC and bought it on impulse. Unfortunately, although I do like \\"anthem\\" and \\"wondering\\" quite a lot, after hearing the many similiar songs a few times and still not 'getting into' the CD, I decided that perhaps my hard-earned cash shouldn't have been parted with.The vocals aren't brilliant, there's nothing really original about the lyrics or music. A mediocre CD. As an introduction to punk (like the CDs people seem to have bought with this, Sum 41, New Found Glory, Avril) it is a good choice, or for parties perhaps, but for those more experienced listeners, this is really a CD to burn not buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Charlotte ROCKS!","review":"GC isn't just punk, like some ppl think. They're kinda punk, kinda rock, and kinda alternative. And in response to the person who said they sounded like NSync- I DON'T THINK SO!... There is no way that NSync could write such good songs. And they aren't just complaining about high school. They're just telling you the facts of what happened to them. I think that ppl who say their complaining have never been an outsider. It's tough, I know from personal experience. When ppl ignore you or think you're wierd and won't talk to you, you want to get your emotions out somehow. I started writing songs, and alot of them came out really bad, but that was one of the only ways I could get my feelings out. GCs songs are something like that. (The Anthem, Little Things, My Old Man) You shouldn't judge this band by wether they're punk or not. Listen to their songs and judge them on that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a great CD","review":"Not a lot of fuss, but just a solid CD with a lot of great songs -- tunes and lyrics alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music, great variety","review":"this is really great cd, definitely my favorite. the songs are inspiring and there is a lot of variety - no two songs sound the same. from emotionless to the anthem, and wondering -- soo good. i love all the songs and can listen to the whole thing w/o skipping a track. good charlotte's old cd is a bit different from this one, but equally good. its not full on punk rock, but this music doens't need a label. whatever it is its great."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AGAIN!!","review":"IF I COULD I WOULD GIVE THIS ALBUM(IF YOU COULD CALL IT ONE) NEGATIVE STARS!!

Punk died a long time ago. Good Charlotte are pretty much the NSYNC of the post punk era. C'mon punk was never ever supposed to be anything like this. If you are \\"punk\\" nowadays you are trying to create a new sound not rehash some old formula to the pop masses. Get real. Go buy a record by the Adolescents, the Germs, Black Flag \\"Jealous Again\\", Agent Orange, D.I., 45 Grave, early T.S.O.L., the Circle Jerks, ect. That was punk. they sold about 500 hundred records and played serious dives. Not like the Good Charlotte \\"cash in punks\\". Punk is definitely dead. They should even pretend otherwise. If anything this is a new genre \\"Pop-Punk\\". C'mon good charlotte, Halloween is over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Worst thing i have ever heard. GC is putting the nail in punks coffin. They are terrible pop band ruining music. This is the exact same thing as Avril,NFG,(both horrible)and many others.

I hope this pop-punk thing will fade fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fall out boy lover WHY?","review":"I just have to rag on fall out boy lover for saying that if you want to listen to heavy music listen to good charlotte is she on dope or something i mean come on. Now to this album in a short review i will just say that it sux and no more or i might go insane because i hate this band and just about all other emo with a passion. listen to led zeplin or alice in chains if you want good music and if you do compare that to this and see if you still like these posers that have no clue how to do anything obviosly. listen to the guitar. jerry cantrell(alice in chains) would make this look like stuff that a five year old kid who doesnt even know what a guitar is could play."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"It's just great.

I mean they're decked out in their Hot Topic gear, so they must be \\"punk\\". All they do is piss and moan about their problems and what is eevn sadder, is the fact that this type of music appeals to people. This type of music comepletely and utterly distorts what \\"punk\\" music is. Unless \\"punk\\" music is about being rich, making more money, being on MTV, and turning kids into \\"punk\\" poseurs by promoting Hot Topic, this is nothing close to \\"punk\\".

Yet they sing songs like \\"Lifestyles of the rich and famous,\\" which criticizes rich people. A little contradicting...It's like Avril Lavigne dressing \\"punk\\" in the video where she sings the really, really, really soft song, \\"I'm with you.\\" It doesn't matter really... if you like the music, listen to it. I just think this is another example of a band that has changed its music in order to get more money. Their first CD was decent- this one is just pop so more young kids will listen.

The guitarists and drummer in this band have no talent whatsoever, and the whiny lyrics will get on your nerves quickly. Rock and roll needs something new, not the same band over and over with different people like all these pop bands. If you want real music listen to CKY, or if you want good punk music listen to anti-flag or some old blink 182 cd's. steer clear or this terrible album."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring....","review":"THEY ARE NOT POSERS BECUZ IN ONE OF THERE SONGS IT SAYS I DON'T WANNA BE LIKE YOU AND THAT IS WHY THEY LOOK DIFFERENT. SOME OF THE OTHER SONGS TALK ABOUT THERE DAD AND HOW HE LEFT THEM.-some other reviewerThat is definitely one of the most ineffective arguments i've ever heard. People can say anything, but they don't have to mean it. I gave this album one star because I really don't like the music. FIrst of all, its quite repetitive. Most of the songs sound similar except a few of the softer ones. I listened to this album because I heard it was good and I thought that \\"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous\\" was pretty good. But when I listened to the album, all I found were a bunch of boring songs with mundane whiny lyrics, simplistic song structures and bad musicianship. That is my opinion on this album. If you like Simple Plan and the like you would probably enjoy this album throughly. But if you consider yourself a true punk then this CD would quite possibly make you angry."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened?!","review":"two words for this cd... IT SUCKS! there are a few good songs on there such as Hold On, which i do love, but the rest seems like good charlotte is just trying to get a new fan base and totally forgetting about the true fans in the process. it's all about album sales, so go ahead and jump on the good charlotte band wagon if you want, but this cd is mediocre at best, and i personally think it sucks! the first one rocked, but not this one. try writing better music next time and you might be able to keep fans, but you'd lose all your 14 year old girls that love you so much... boohoo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"This album is horrid. First of all, is has the worst and most vulgar rhymes that anyone could of thought imaginable. The fact that they are rich and famous makes that song nothing more then a hypocritical statement. As far as I see it, this is the new age of pop. This is pop, gone a slight darker. Marilyn Manson is someone who I would advise all of you teeny-poppers to look into. Hehe, I read how you hate being called that and say you aren't, so I'm going to say it again. Teenyboppers, hehe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lifestyles of the future broke kids","review":"Trust me! You really dont wanna support this piece of crap. Every songs sound the same. They sing about the same old highschool is horrible stuff. It really couldnt get any sadder when i saw gc on tv and i see girls age of 10-12 dying their hair blue or green just to look cool and feel like they deserve to be credited as \\"punk\\". So anyone gotta gun so i can shoot these wankers?"},{"rating":"1","title":"About as far from punk as you can get","review":"Okay, I'll just come out and say it: These guys suck. Good Charlotte is the definition of the term sell-out. This is the album for posers who want to look like they're rockers. If you like it fine, I'm not one to judge, but this doesn't belong in the punk rock section. It's more suited to be proudly displayed next to Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears. The only people this is good for are 12-year-old girls and Abercrombie salesmen."},{"rating":"1","title":"All this is good for is a coaster","review":"I don't have the words to describe the awfulness of good charlotte. I don't give a damn about any of that \\"they aren't punk bull\\" because that doesn't matter. They are just a very untalented band. If 4 people picked up an instrument for the first time and played for a year, they would be able to write better songs and lyrics then these a$$holes. Its not too hard to write songs that will relate to depressed teens, but if you're gonna do it, why not write some actual intelligent lyrics. A monkey could write more intellgent lyrics about its love for bananas. While Britney Spears is the cancer of the music industry, Good Charlotte is the gonorrhea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't call them punk!","review":"This CD is garbage. How can you call them punk? They are just about as close to punk rock as *NSYNC. Do any of you stupid teeny-boppers even know what punk rock is? Do you really think that being on TRL every single day is going against the trend? Have any of you idiots buying this CD ever heard any actually punk bands? And no, Blink-182 and Green Day aren't punk either. This album is seriously pathetic and the fact that it is categorized as punk is just shameful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's Have An Online Vote!","review":"Hey guys! Let's have an online vote!If you like Good Charlotte, please hit the \\"not helpful\\" button. If you, like me, think that they represent everything souless and wrong about rock music and punk today and should be systematically removed like any bacteria or roach, please vote \\"helpful\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"God dude what a pointless mainstream punk act","review":"In listening to this Good Charlotte album, another reviewer's remark really rang clear for me, especially after seeing the Good Charlotte heartfelt video on MTV. Like an immense pile of other acts out there, these idiots have convinced themselves, we've come up with something clever! We are so good, look at all the passion and power in our music! It is such a discusting fallacy. Good Charlotte is a watered down punk version of an already watered down Blink 182. I assure you of one thing kids, and you marketing guy responsible for this giant heap of crappy music, the time is coming when people will take a stand against horrible mainstream acts like Good Charlotte."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"I find it ironic in Bad Charlotte's \\"Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous\\" that they talk about the famous people complaining, when they're the ones complaining. It's like this whole pot-in-the-kettle thing.In the song \\"Say Anything\\" the lyrics are \\"Don't say a word / I know you feel the same / Just give me a sign / Say anything Say anything.\\" It doesn't make sense to me why you would say \\"don't say a word,\\" and then command, \\"say anything!\\"I guess these days you don't need to have good grammar or possess common sense to get into the music industry.This so-called 'punk' garbage won't quit polluting the airwaves. Punk music must die, or the old punk music should come back. When will this end?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not punk","review":"Don't let MTV and Z100 fool you. This is not punk, its not even close. If you want to find out what punk truely is then go no further than these three exellent bands - The Ramones, The Clash, and The Sex Pistols. They godfathers of punk and when you compare, this does not even come close"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Charlotte + MTV= Sellouts","review":"This is probably one of the worst CD's ever. I always knew they weren't extremely talented, and I used to like them a little bit. They have sold out big time. The moment I really started to hate them was when I heard preppy girls talking about them. They are going to their concert! If i had a chance, I would kick all the preppies that like good charlotte right in the face. Good Charlotte should be ashamed of themselves. They are the epitimy of selling out."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEFINATELY not punk, mediocre whining at best","review":"I don't understand how anyone can call this band punk. Even if you like the band, I don't know how you can call it punk. This is whiny soft alternative at best. This is definately the most over-rated band of the year. Think about bands like Black Flag and The Misfits and then think about this band and other bands of this type. It is pop with electric guitar is all it is. The singer whines out of his nose throughout the album as most pop artists do. There were only two songs on this that I could tolerate and that was \\"Lifestyles...\\" and \\"Girls and Boys\\". If you want modern day REAL punk, go look for a Thrice or an AFI album and let all the TRL posers grab this one. And for the record, their first release is even worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"You people are ridiculous. You call this punk music? I can tell you one thing, they dont play real punk or any real music for that matter on TRL. You are all just following a new trend in which you think it is cool to act hardcore because that is the direction that MTV is taking. I am sick of reading reviews by 12 year olds about albums like this saying how they are truly punk music and its great to get away from Nsync, Britney Spears, etc. You teenie boppers are getting to a point that is unbearable and your insidious comments such as those below are just a reflection of how ignorant you truly are. Perhaps you enjoy this cd, thats fine, but please do not try to tell me and others that this is the \\"hardcore\\" music that has changed your lives and made you trade in all of your britney spears cds. And please dont be mad at my review, you will like a new group and/or music type by next month anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's try this...","review":"If you think Good Charlotte sucks ass and bands like The Ramones, The Sex Pistols, and The Misfits(Danzig) are awesome click \\"yes\\".If you think Good Charlotte is \\"da freekin bestest pank band eva!!!!!\\" and you think The Ramones, The Sex Pistols, and The Misfits(Danzig) suck click \\"no\\".I wonder what this will turn out like..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try!","review":"Sorry, everyone... THIS IS NOT PUNK, in EVERY definition of the word. This is 'NSync with louder guitars and a few references to diluted teen angst in their trite and ridiculous lyrics.To call this punk is to call a hair metal band 'aggressive.' It is an insult to punk, and music in general.See, children, punk is about going against the mainstream, and being yourself, and wanting to change the world somehow. Take the Sex Pistols' dream of anarchy, the Clash's ideas for social reform, and expressing individuality. What GC is doing is complaining about high school, probably long after they graduated, and foolishly think that wearing a mohawk and getting their lip pierced makes up for it. These guys also hosted TRl for a week... but back to the music....The music itself is, again, like NSync with loud guitars, no lyrical value, irritating vocals, and it is like nails on a chalkboard. Don't buy into this 'pop punk' trend because you are not getting the full effect of punk with these guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Get It","review":"Is this a Blink 182 cover band or is this Good Charlotte?

The sequel to their first album, Good Charlotte, this album is way better. Their hits are: The Anthem, Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous, Girls & Boys, Hold On. My personal faves of the album are Riot Girl, Young & the Hopeless, and The Story of My Old Man. Their are a few crappy songs on here but its still a good buy. If you like bands like Simple Plan, MxPx, and Yellowcard, you'll like this CD. Btw, I don't consider this a alt. rock CD, I'd rather call it pop rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Goodness of Good Charlotte","review":"Good Charlotte has out done their last CD.

I highly recommend this CD for anyone who loves rockin out."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD CHARLOTTE ROCKS!!!","review":"Good Charlotte's new CD The Young and the Hopeless is one of the best CD's I've ever heard! Every song was written perfectly. Benji and Joel really do have a lot of talent, and you can tell that they've grown up a lot since their first album. Songs like Hold On, Movin On, and Anthem are really positive, and send out a good message. And their songs are great to play on guitar.. ahh I just have so many good things to say about Good Charlotte. It's obvious that Good Charlotte's gonna be around for quite a while. So keep buyin their albums and keep representin GC!

I don't really like any of them. I got their first cd 1,000,000 years ago and I loved it. I know every word from every song... that's how mayn times I've listened to it. I'm not one of those weird kids that reads the lyrics in that litte booklet thing. Anyways, Good Charlotte changed their style so the mtv crowd would listen to their music. I was disappointed. There's about one song that's like their old ones and that's great but the stupid songs like Boys and Girls and Riot Girl are just pathetic. I wouldn't recommend this cd to anyone unless you're one of those kids that buys a cd cuz the guys on it are 'oh so hot'. Yeah that's about all I have to say.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD","review":"Look all you haters, they are a hardworking band that writes melodic rock music. They may not be advanced or difficult, but they write good songs, that are actually pretty unique. You cant go out there and find anyboy who has the unique harmony in the two singers voice, and find me a hit that has the same chords and rhythm as this cd. Its a very ecclectic album. There are some lame radio songs like girls and boys and the anthem. But after that there are good songs. From the Ramone based sound of LIfestyles of the RIch and Famous, to the Social distortion sound of Day that i die. To THE USED scream-o sound of BLoody valentine. They have an unbelievable ballad in \\"Emotionless\\" where they talk about a very personal thing in their dad leaving them, and the rest of a CD is a fun laid back CD to listen. Not quite as good as their first CD but still it's an archive CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"God Bless You, Good Charlotte!","review":"My friend tried to commit suicide, and while he was bleeding to death, he was watching mtv, and the video for \\"Hold On\\" was playing, and he was like \\"yeah\\" and after he was done rocking out he got all inspired and called for an ambulance.

Thank you so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Album ROCKS!","review":"I can't get enough of this record. GC covers so many subjects in their songs, each one unique. They have such style and edge! My favourite song on the album is Hold on."},{"rating":"2","title":"GC rocks!!","review":"I first heard of Good Charlotte through a friend and thought she was mad to like them but when she played the cd to me I became hooked! They are completly honest and the music is straight from the heart. Some of their music is funny such as Girls and boys and Riot girl and some are serious such as Hold on. People write them of as a crap band because they are punks but to me that is cool as its them being honest as to how they feel and this is reflected in their music. It is truely inspiring and makes me rock each time I hear it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major label punk is an oxymoron","review":"I was forced to listen to this while on a car ride with a friend, and although it wasn't the worst thing I've ever heard, I can certainly understand why there are well over a hundred of these CDs for sale under the used catagory...it's because it stinks! I can't believe anyone would classify this as 'punk', it's simply trendy commercial crap. Today - the hot new trend, tomorrow - in the used CD bin for $1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hypocritical moron music for the masses.","review":"\\"Do you really wanna be like them, do you really wanna be another trend\\"........this brilliantly deep lyric (sarcasm, for the stupid) taken from \\"The Anthem\\" is about as about as hypocritical as you can get. Guess what people, POP PUNK IS A TREND. And by being \\"pop-punk\\" you are \\"being like them\\" and participating in \\"another trend\\". The rest of the lyrics are about as trite and stupid as can be, and the music requires no talent whatsoever. Why do cd's like these need bad reviews? Because its atrocious how this kind of music is so popular and gets so much praise from people, and talented hardworking artists struggle in the music industry. Make sure to vote \\"no\\" if you think this is the \\"BEST CD EVAR!!1!1!!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS THE GREATEST CD EVER!!!!!!!!","review":"If you like punk music, then you will definitly love the new Good Charlotte cd, \\"The Young And The Hopeless.\\" It has 14 tracks that deal with real life situation. I loved this cd. First, it's very emotional. Second, it's funny. Third, Benji, Joel, Paul, and Billy know what it's like to be a teenager, like most of us. They don't just sing to make money, they know what they're talking about. Most of you peopl have already heard \\"Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous.\\" This is a great song. If u like that one, then you'll luv \\"The Anthem.\\" It's a great song for anybody who doesn't wanna follow the rules or fit in. There's \\"Riot Girl\\", which is a fun song about a punk gurl. But, Good Charlotte has an emotional side, too. The song,\\"Emotionless\\"is about Benji & Joel's father that left them. \\"Emotioless\\" is a very good song. So, if you liked anything that I've said about the cd, go and buy Good Charlotte's \\"The Young and the Hopeless\\"!! C ya at \\"the show\\"!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"how could anyone like them???","review":"Maybe I would begin to respect them if they didn't cry and complain about them same old thing in every song! bo hoo I dont fit in or even worse they complain about people who complain. that just makes to much sense doesn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rich and Famous, but Hopeless","review":"This is the ultiamte manufactured record. Maybe they used to be a punk band, but not now. They've got the look, but not the sound. It's just bad pop music, although don't be fooled too much by Girls and Boys, most of the tracks are gutiar driven, but then so are Bryan Adams and Genesis and no one calls them punk. It just goes to show how image-obsessed some people are. Take your heads out of the MTV sand, please.If you want cathcy, intellegent, guitar-driven pop, go for Fountains Of Wayne, Ash, Bowling For Soup or Weezer. If you want bands with real venom and fight about them, try System Of A Down, Pitchshifter, Tool or Rage Against the Machine, all of whom are infinately more capable and exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"thank u 'Kelly M Moning'","review":"i was sick and tired of seeing people giving this good charlotte stuff 4 or 5 stars.

You can't help but sing, even if you aren't a fan of punk music. I bought this album and had it a full 2 days before my mother stole it from me. So, when you buy this CD, lock it up so no one steals it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best cd ever!!!! :-)","review":"Good Charlotte's the young and the hopeless is 1 of the best cds i have ever owned. as a semi-new punk rock (NOT POP) band, they provide meaningfull, punk like lyrics without the ecxplict label keeping it out of the stereos of 13yr old like myself. \\"the new beginning\\", an intro track, is one of the best sk8ing tracks i have ever heard, and \\"girls and boys\\" is has an interesting, 80s like tune. with modern lyrics. over all this is a great album for any age from 9-16 and beyond!"},{"rating":"2","title":"it's good.","review":"GC's new album is good, & great. great tunes to all the songs.it's not really worth all 5 stars because i think it could have done alot better. but all in all great album.

Almost all the songs are worthwhile listening to and my favorites are:Riot GirlYoung and the HopelessThe AnthemDay That I Dieand Bloody ValentineI swear, this CD has some of the best songs you'll hear. Wondering is really catchy an you'll be humming it all day and Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous is also something you have to sing along to everytime you hear it.

Anyone who calls thisd \\"punk\\" either has IQ of 15 or that he's 8 years old. This is just pop. Basically The Backstreet Boys with guitars. \\"Punk\\" is The Clash, Sex Pistols, MC5, Black Flag and Pennywise.The worst songs on this album: ALL OF THEM!!Listen to real music (...), like Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, Sepultura, Slayer, Children of Bodom, Metallica (god, even the new stuff is better than this trash!), Megadeth, Led Zeppelin, Judas Priest and Pantera.Death to Good Charlotte!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GC is at it once again!","review":"Good Charlotte Rocks...and they've proved this once again with their new cd \\"The Young and The Hopeless.\\" The group is amazing on this album, as they are on others, but add much more of a emotional touch to this effort as opposed to others.

They are pop/punk, and the persons in the band are definately not punk, they just dress like that because they think that their clothes is what makes them punk.

Buying this cd is a total waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Charlotte-Young and the Hopeless","review":"Out of the two cd's I think this one has more meaning about it.

The lyrics are so plain and stupid, that a child's nursery rhymes are more deep and actually worth listening to."},{"rating":"2","title":"No sophomore slump here","review":"Good Charlottes new album just rocks. They keep the same sound as their debut album, but they add more to the album. The Young and the Hopeless has one of the best intros to a cd I have heard in a while. But what I really like about these guys is the message they send in their music. They basically say to be yourself and follow your heart, not what other people say. They did that and look where they are now. I would reccomend this cd to anyone who ejoys pop punk, or any rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"there was no zero stars option","review":"this cd shows a prime example of everything wrong with music. the songs have no meaning, and are all of the same basic, 3 minute, radio friendly structure. their members dress up as if they're real punks, then give us weak garbage that is family friendly. if you're 12 years old, or have the IQ of a 12-year-old, you'll buy this album. otherwise, go burn your 15 bucks. you'll have a better time doing that than listening to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Album SUCKS!!!!","review":"I HATE this album and I hate Good Charlotte. Whoever said they could sing must have been tone deaf. The songs are nothing but teeny-bopper pop disguised a 'rock'. Don't waste your money on this bull-ish.I'd have given it zero stars, but unfortunately, that's not an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"You are all being brainwashed.","review":"Holy Friggen Crap!!! This is probably the worst album ever. Not only do they consider it pop-punk when its as unpunk as possible, but hundreds of kids are buying into this whole \\"punk fashion\\" thing and I'M SICK OF IT! How much crap do punks need. The media looks at us as a threat, so they create a band that will make us follow their order. Message to all Good Charlotte fans: YOU ARE ALL POSERS! YOU WILL NEVER BE PUNKS! I DON'T CARE WHAT MTV AND ALL THOSE F**KING MEDIA JUNKIES SAY. BUY A VIRUS ALBUM AND THEN WE'LL TALK!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap CD","review":"This album absolutely sucks. Whoever said that the leader singer could actually sing must have been deaf or something. The songs on the cd are pointless, shallow, and dull. This album is full of teeny-bopper pop songs disguised as rock.Don't waste your money on this garbage, cuz that's where it belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD REVIEWS NOT BASHING","review":"OMG!

INSTEAD I SEE ALL THESE LITTLE BABIES COMPLAING ABOUT HOW NON PUNK GC IS. FRANKLY I DONT CARE! I CAME HERE TO DECIDE WHETHER I WANTED THE CD OR NOT,NOT HOW THEY'RE SELL OUTS AND CAN'T SING OR HOW MUCH THEY SUCK. YOU PEOPLE HAVE NO HEART. JUST B/C YOU DONT LIKE DOESNT MEAN EVERYONE ELSE HAS TO HATE IT. THEIR FANS HAVE FEELINGS 2! HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT IF PEOPLE JUST KEEP BASHING AGAINST THE MUSICIANS YOU LIKE?

If you don't have the CD you should go out and buy it!! It has something for everyone!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing CD","review":"Good Charlotte's new CD is one of the best I've heard in a long time. Good Charlotte has an amazing way with words and an incredible talent to make awesome harmonies and melodies for their music. Personally, my favorite song on \\"The Young and the Hopeless\\" is the title song, \\"Young and Hopeless\\". The lyrics can almost perfectly describe my life. Good Charlotte is able to create songs that can really relate to their audience. All in all, this CD is amazing and I recommend it to anyone who loves music, whether they enjoy punk, hardcore, ska, or even pop, you will love this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new favorite :D","review":"I bought this cd a week ago, and i LIVES in my cd player!

Good Charlotte so rock! They are lyke so cute and stuff with their spiky hair, tattoos, and guitars. They are lyke so badass people! I lyke used to lyke listen to nsync and stuff and now i dont because lyke all my friends listen to punk like Good Charlotte because they're on trl! Oh ma god benji is so cute like a teddy bear. If you dont lyke have this album lyke get it ok! They sing about girls and boys, thats like soooo punk!What you have just seen above is an example of Good Charlotte's fans. This band is a joke. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"*sigh*","review":"Well, I have to say that I am saddened by this album. GC is relying way to much on the way people lable each other to market their music. I've seen way to many \\"punk\\" , \\"preppies\\" and \\"posers\\" in these reviews. When GC first came out, they were normal people. Yes, Benji had his tatoos and such, but nothing was nearly as milked as it is now. Now, bands like NFG and GC rely to much on the whole \\"punk\\" look and \\"lifestyle\\"(no pun intended). No one seems to see that the music that they all play isn't \\"punk\\", it's just \\"rock n roll\\". Power chords and a nice drumbeat with a little acoustic ballad or so. And if you like it, more power to you, but I see it as way to generic. If you like music that is catchy and kind of repetative, with some meaningful lyrics, then go for it. If you want something with a little more originality and some very thought provoking lyrics, then go for Radiohead - The Bends, or At the Drive-In - Relationship of Command. And Green Day is always good."},{"rating":"1","title":"zero stars","review":"First off, I want to say I have a very open mind about music. I don't criticize bands just because I don't like a certain type of music, or merely because I don't think it's \\"cool\\".However, Good Charlotte is one of most annoyingly cliched bands I have ever heard. I used to think Blink 182 was horrible once \\"Enema\\" came out. Let me set things straight:Blink is to GC what Bad Religion is to Blink.Just look at what GC is trying to do to \\"punk\\" (which I guess is meaningless now anyway). Died, spiked, hair; piercings; angry faces; weak, trite, bubble-gum candy-coated pop. It seriously makes me want to vomit all over my stereo and press \\"play\\" instead of listening to GC.They say they're not in it for the money? What's with the image, the videos, the overplay on the radio?GC is nothing but a fat, bald corporate CEO's scheme to shake the money out of lonely, troubled, and, dare I say, ignorant pre-teens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Charlotte has outdone themselves with this one!","review":"This cd is worth everyone's money, without a doubt. It's my favorite cd, and there just aren't enough songs on it! You can easily listen to it all the way through, and if offers up punk on a string... GC at their very best! Benji and Joel's music and lyrics let you know how they feel and what they think and make you wanna sing along. They're voices are so awesome together, you can't go wrong with them. Good Charlotte has the most potential of any punk band on the scene now. Buy this cd, and their first one and I know you will agree 100%-- GC rocks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"This is absolutely awful just horrible music the worst band ever. They are such sell outs they think gthey are punk i cant even begin to describe how bad this band is im so mad that people actaully consider this music LISTEN to it its a bubble gum sugar coated hardcore brittny spears with tattoos and piercings. BAd charlotte is what they should be named they are just God awful"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost As Fun As Getting My [fingers] Caught In A Car Door","review":"And I stress \\"almost\\". I despise emo already, but why do bands feel the need to PRETEND to be emo. I don't like bands in the vein as Finch or Thursday, but I would take their records over this mindless piece of trash in a heartbeat. Good Charlotte is just the same wannbe punks ...that try to put out music to make a \\"Hey look at us, we are different!\\" type of appearence. Basically, the only people who like this record are 12 year old girls and people who want to be the noncoformist but still watch MTV to find out what their next favorite band is going to be. I despise this album. I mean, if you are going to pick a band that is played on MTV pick up The Used or Cold but not this. This is what music has degenerated to. If I have to hear another song about skateboarding, high school angst, or breaking up with a girl ... Please make them stop playin \\"music\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Box Set of Young & The Hopeless","review":"This CD is sweet! The extra tracks are the best. I highly recommend this CD. U must get it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Punk is dead. Long live punk.","review":"Punk is dead. These guys didn't kill it but they sure make it roll over in it's grave. Unfortunately, it died before a lot of this band's members and fans were even born. And for all of you kids who think punk is Blink 182 and Green Day, I feel sorry for you. This stuff is so bubblegum and candy coated it gives me a toothache. Go back and pick an Exploited, Black Flag, Stooges, or a Minor Threat album. The roots of punk will expose this album for what it is. This band's only saving grace is that punk has been dead for so long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moving on...","review":"I borrowed this CD from a friend strictly out of curiosity. I also decided I should actually listen to their music instead of forming my opinions based solely on their (ridiculous) appearance. I had only heard two songs on The Young and Hopeless (\\"Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous\\" and \\"The Anthem\\"). And after listening to the CD in its entirety I wished I had never put it into my CD player. Sometimes bands/musicians (if we can even call them that) try a little too hard to replicate and mimic a certain sound -- Good Charlotte is definitely one of them. Their songs are rip-offs of better songs by better bands. Their lyrics are juvenile and lack depth. For example I found \\"Riot Girl\\" particularly, well, stupid. Why would anyone mention two washed up pop stars in their lyrics, especially when calming to be a punk band? This band is not original, innovative or talented and they'll be gone before you know it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One word for ya: Awesome!","review":"This CD is great! Every song is awesome. Definetly an album to add to anybody's collection. Well, to sum up all I want to say in one sentence- \\"If you like GC's single, 'The Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous,' then you'll LOVE their new album!!\\" So... what are you waiting for?! GO BUY IT!! =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Young and Hopeless","review":"Good Charlotter has amazed us once again with this great new CD, The Young and Hopeless. As most of you know, a track from their CD, Lifestyles of the Rich and the Famous, has already made it to numder 1 on TRL. And by the way things are looking, it will stay there for a while.In my opinion, this cd is great. Benji opens the CD with a great piece about how they dont want to be famous, but they do it for good music. \\"Hold On\\", \\"Emotionless\\", and \\"The Day I Die\\", to me, are some of the best songs on the CD. But you will have to figure it out for yourself what songs you like the best, and get this awesome CD. If you like punk/rock, you will love this CD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Charlotte is awful music","review":"I have to say that good charlotte is one of the worst of recent bands.THESE GUYS ARE JUST ANOTHER LOUSY BOY BAND WITH INSTRUMENTS.This is full of horrible music with crappy lyrics.If you give this lousy cd five stars,you have a big time problem.BUY IT AND YOU ARE A LOSER.AVOID AT ALL COSTS.STICK TO CLASSIC ROCK BANDS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their only good cd...and I don't normally like punk...","review":"I liked this cd. It put out a bunch of singles, the best of which is the title track. I hate most punk rock, including the rest of these guys' cds. This one was special. All the songs are generally about this kid's family getting destroyed, which gets old after a while, but they have some really good melodies on here. I give it a listen once in a while when I'm not slammin my head to Metallica and such. It's a good change of pace, I would probably recommend that metal fans buy it used instead of new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh here we go....","review":"Okay...people. Let me just get this though to you. GOOD CHARLOTTE IS NOT...I REPEAT NOT PUNK. Most of you think they are...but you are decived by these \\"pretty\\" boys. Just because they don't dress the same as other people, doesn't mean their punk. Punk is an attitude...not a dress code. I want you to do this if you don't belive me, listen to their lyrics...and picture a boy band singing. I think you'll understand then. But if you like them, then hey,like them. But please don't classify them as punk rock. Punk rock bands are bands like The Sex Pistols, The Ramones, The New York dolls, The Damned...etc. And the reason you don't hear about them is..because they fought agesnt being popular and agenst the goverment..and agenst a lot of the pop music we see today. Now that's the punk attitude."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This album is a terribile ..., it is not punk.

So i definitely loved the new CD and can't wait for the next one to come out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to the music GC listens to...","review":"I used to listen to mainstream music such as the first Good Charlotte CD, Blink 182, and Offspring because that was the only punk music I knew of. Then my friends introduced me to other bands that I had never heard of that I liked much much more than anything I had previously listened to. It was then that I learned that the best music you will not hear on the radio or on MTV, but is something that you have to search for.Good Charlotte is absolutley talentless and you will get sick of this CD within days because every song sounds the same. The guitar chords are repetative, and the music emotionless with lyrics my sister could write. I will have to admit, if you watch their music videos, they all wear T-shirts of very good bands such as Catch-22 and the Used.Do yourself a favor and check out these bands: Thursday, A Static Lullaby, Alkaline Trio, Sublime, Taking Back Sunday, My Chemical Romance and the Get Up Kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"This stuff is the problem with the music world!","review":"This stuff is horrible!!! These guys are not good and I don't understand why people like them so much. This is just more stuff used to brainwash stupid teenage girls. These guys have horrible lyrics, instruments, singers, and everything else. Why can't this be like the 70's,80's, or early 90's when rock or metal music was actually good? This is just pop with rhytmn guitars and drummer who only hits the snare once in awhile. Don't buy this, save your money for something good!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wow-ultimate posers","review":"I can't believe people really give into this....I think it's ridiculous seeing them in their videos looking like they could be singing hard punk stuff, instead I hear POP. They're nothing more than an image that for some reason most teenage girls buy...I don't know, maybe it's because they're ignorant? It wouldn't be so bad if they weren't such POSERS..but they are.

I have listened to it two or three times now and I can already tell you that I will probably never put it in my CD player again. It's that bad!

First of all, this IS NOT PUNK, it is pop music and anyone who thinks this is punk is just a poser. I bet most people who like this album don't even like real punk. If you really want to get into punk music stay away from bands like Good Charlotte, Simple Plan, Get Up Kids and all that Emo crap. If you want to listen to real punk try Black Flag, the Stooges, Sepultura, Rollins Band and Flogging Mollys. Good Charlotte just sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"huh?","review":"this type of music makes me sad. i could go to a side stage grab an acoustic guitar, or hell, do acapella and have better music then these guys. Why? because these guys are ruining punk music - they wouldnt bother me half as much if people understood this wasnt punk and that it is just nsync with guitars and some more tattoos. if somehow anyone of you who likes good charlotte actually grow up - try out some real punk like pennywise or nofx. this is crap"},{"rating":"2","title":"GC ROCKS!!!","review":"Ok My cousin baught me this cd for christams and its been the best present i have ever gotten.

Why then does this album add up to such an unsatisfying listen?. Well Jim it all comes down to the old chesnut of song stucture. Formulaic would be positive praise for this album, you will yearn for the journey but Good Charlotte won't even let you outside. Why then is it so hard to give up on these guys?. Chemistry, plain and simple. These guys were born to play together much like Tool and The Sisters of Mercy in different genres.

None of the Blackids and most of the white kids hated this stuff but he kept on playing the junk. It is about partying and other Bull $hit like that. There was only one good song on here and the lyrics were lame to. These guys make repetative music without no substance at all or no great instrumentalist. Even thought I am a strait guy girls that Joel Madden dude is not hot but instead he is a huge poser. I do like Blink 182 but most of this type of this music is junk.

But they delivered one of the best albums I have ever heard, and now with their second album then do it all over again, even better. The songs on Young and the Hopeless tell people that they don't have to fit in with the crowd and you can be yourself. They also sing songs that deal with suicide, and family problems. Nowadays the only songs we hear are about love, sex, and partying. It's great that they go into deeper problems and help their fans deal with the pain. \\"Emotionless\\" is one of my favorite songs because they sing what I wish I could say to my own father. This CD rocks, and everyone must buy it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Charlotte","review":"Good Charlotte have come a long way since their first self tilted album. The Young and The Hopeless album is the best CD i own at the moment, the best ill ever own!

If you like it and enjoy it, good for you, but it is NOT the most talented band at all, not even close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the first . . .","review":"Basically, this CD is pop. Good Charlotte has gone from being semi-rockish to pop. The only difference between Good Charlotte and the Backstreet Boys is that GC makes their own music (minus the drums because their drummer quit) and they write their own lyrics. If you thought this album would be harder and faster than their first one, it's not. The rock songs stop after track 3. The rest of the songs are mostly about Benji and Joel's dad leaving. \\"The Young and The Hopeless\\" should be dedicated to their dad because he's mentioned in a lot of the songs. I'm sorry to say that Good Charlotte is now an MTV pop band being played on TRL too many times. My advice: buy it if you're like a die-hard fan, but forget it if you liked their old stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"another great cd from gc","review":"this cd is excellent. like their first, only a little more mainstream. but does anyone else realize that \\"lifestyles\\" is about over-paid famous people, but the band isn't doing too badly themselves? i totally think they deserve it, but it's a little contradictory. and the whole trl thing just pisses me off, but hey, punk-rock is \\"in\\", so what do we expect....anyway, the cd is great, strong lyrics, great riffs, all around awesome! my favorites are \\"emotionless\\" and \\"riot girl\\". if you don't have it already, for god's sake, buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanna be punkers","review":"Good Charolette is the Blink182 of 2002.

Lifestyles of the rich and famous, WOW good charolette is rich and famous, maybee we should rob them, you think, its not like no one knew who they were before this album came out,and at the time they were rich and famous, so they should shove it. i mean these guys should try singing about new stuff, like in boys and girls they just steroetype people, maybe they should take their opinions that are so cliche and cram em.

If you must."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying, derivative posturing by a sub-par band","review":"Did anyone else notice that their song Girls and Boys is a total rip-off of Blur's song Girls & Boys?

I think they look dark punk or gangster punk maybe a little goth but who cares? People go through hard times in their life and on this record they talk about murder, about benji and joel's father who abandoned them when young. They had a different style on thir last album image and sound. i think got darker just like a kid might decide to get darker. thier music tlaks about some hard issues and also some love songs. they are pop punk but let's not talk about what music's not about- image."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tripe","review":"This is pure, recycled tripe.

The writing is not intelligent (say, like a Saves the Day) or the songs catchy (say, like a MEST).There's nothing spectacular about it. \\"The Young and Hopeless\\" falls short on every attempt (much like the previous album) and ever song is predictable (like emotionless). Don't buy this. Buy real \\"emotional\\" music, like a Modest Mouse, or Built to Spill, but this might be too intelligent for your average Good Charlotte fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"this deserves negative 20,000,000,000,000,000,000.... stars","review":"Wow, i hate posers was right...

I've never hated a band this much since Hanson came out. This isn't punk, it's crap. Lyrics are extremely weak with repetative guitar melodies, fast but terrible drumming and thin slow bass playing. Terrible, just buy Nirvana, The Sex Pistols and\\\\or Blink 182 CD's.PS: Nirvana is only responsible for bringing punk into the mainstream, not creating it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Still Isn't Punk","review":"Can someone PLEASE take this out of the punk section?

If you are tired of listening to stupid... rock songs and want to listen to some good punk rock then go out and buy this cd you wont regret it. This is one of the best cd's out there. If you liked the old cd than you'll love this one, its just as good, or even better. I really can't decide what song is the best they're all really awesome. and if this aint enough this cd like the old has special feature's so you get some extra bonus things that you can't get without your cd. So now go out to the nearest cd place and get yourself the young & the hopeless and tell your friends how great it is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best of the best","review":"all i can say is that if you buy GC's \\"The Young and the Hopeless\\" it is worth every penny and more. i bought this album the day it came out and i can't stop listening to it! on a personal level Good Charlotte went from being an unknown band to one of my favorites...i had seen the twins on \\"All Things Rock\\" and i was skeptical to hear their new single (since i had never even heard of the band before the show). then i heard \\"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous\\" and i knew i had to get their albums. i was totally blown away and thoroughly impressed by their musicality. these are 4 very talented young men and i have to admit that i'm completely addicted to their new CD, and i think everyone else should be too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"RAWK ON BOyS!","review":"Good Charlotte rawks the house.

They have come so far and totally deserve all the success with this albumn. it really speaks on a more personal level to their fans. The Young and the Hopeless is an albumn almost everyone can relate to at one point in their life. They have shown how they have grown older and wiser.

To start with my favorite, Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous, it's great! They really stick it up with the song the music video fits the song perfectly with the rich people coming into court to complain, yet they lose to Good Charlotte who arrived bound in chains. This band is awesome. ... Just because Good Charlotte is different from the other punk-pop bands does not mean they have to be run down.

It's a little bit of a change from the last album, but the guys are still as great as ever. The songs about the twins' dad help you to get to know the guys even more.

When good charlotte debuted their first album several hours ago, they were very good raw talent. They toured with various major bands and got them selfes well known and now that they came out with a second cd now everyone has been waiting for its a wonderful addition to their collection. This Cd seems to be very personal in the lifes of Joel and Benji Madden. They are great writers and have alot of emotions drawn into their songs. The music itself is very couragious, it stands out and is origanal. Im looking forward to their next release even more than this one.Peace,Eric"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Great","review":"I loved this CD so much!!!!!!!

Leave it alone and rock out to some REAL punk like Dead Kennedys or Iggy, Minor Threat, Fear or even the Ramones (which, sad to say, have become WAY TOO COMMERCIALIZED). All these bands that try to say they're so PUNK need to get a clue. Punk died when Reagan left office. Get over it and find something more productive to do with your time. Though some would argue that labels like Hellcat and the like are producing punk, well, maybe so, but in this day and age the cause has all but died. Punk fizzled out into the post-hardcore elements that still exist somewhat with bands like Fugazi, Jawbox and Slint. Don't know who these bands are? Well then, punk-a-roos, check them out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Charlotte rocks!!!","review":"If it's possible Good Charlotte has outdone their last album... I'm addicted to The Young and the Hopeless. I listen to it everywhere and there's not a bad song on the CD. Their songs are those kind where it gets stuck in your head and you walk around with a goofy grin on your face cuz you finally have an awesome song stuck in your head. My favorite songs have to be \\"The Anthem\\", \\"Say anything\\" and \\"Movin' On\\". Don't miss out on this awesome CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the good old days","review":"Remember the good ol' days when you were the only kid on your block sportin' the GC goods? well, those days are as far gone as Aaron. But, thats ok, because their sophomore release showcases their pop-punk best! With The Young and the Hopeless, Good Charlotte not only proves that they are a mainstream commodity, but that the radio stations love em! so what if that almost completely contradicts everything they have stood for in the past? Just go out and buy their new cd and be happy that you can now \\"fit in\\" with the punk rock kiddies in your high school.suggested listening:A New Found Glory, Midtown, The Starting Line, or any other \\"on-the-verge-of-being-on-heavy-rotation-on-mtv\\" pop-punk band"},{"rating":"1","title":"its not THAT bad","review":"there are some good songs but the songs that arent good make me want to throw things."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD CHARLOTTE SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"PEOPLE WHO THINK THIS IS TRUE PUNK.WELL ITS NOT!

I think this CD however has put them on the map as one of the great groups of our time. My favorite tracks on the album are, The Anthem, Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous, Riot Girl, Say Anything, and The Young and the Hopeless. They have a punk style but a lot of their songs have a lot more meaning than normal punk songs. The song Say Anything is a great song about love and trying to keep the love of your life. Listening to this song helped me get through a tough time I was having with a girl..Thank you GC....anyways buy this cd, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, children...","review":"I used to like this crap.

You can save a tiny bit of mankind by NOT supporting bands like this. So, if you want to know what IS punk, buy Sex Pistols. The Ramones. Or, for softer stuff, maybe a bit of Flogging Molly. If you want to know what's bad pop, buy Jojo. If you want to know what's the most ghastly filth in the world, buy Good Charlotte. Oh, and while you're at it, buy some Avril Lavigne too.

It has some traces of punk, but it just isn't punk. What is these days? Just because this isn't punk doesn't mean that it's not a hell of a great CD. Every track shows emotion, clever lyrics (except for the first one), and is just a good song. Every song has something people can relate to. That to me is a sign of great music. I believe real music knows no genre. Real music is about showing your feelings and telling the world what you feel. That is what Good Charlotte does with this CD. And for those of you who gave sucky reviews to this CD...this band is laughing all the way to the bank, because they've already sold a lot of these CDs. At my high school, if you say the words The Ramones people say \\"Who?\\", which is seriously sad. While this CD isn't punk, Good Charlotte is just about as good, to me, as The Ramones. I reccommend it for everyone who wants to hear something good."},{"rating":"1","title":"you call this punk","review":"i cant believe people call this \\"punk\\" i hate this band and the posers who listen to them. maybe i wouldnt hate them as bad if they didnt dress the way they did. and call themselves rebels"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst CD to get major play in years","review":"While I haven't heard all of the album, this is the worst band I've heard in a long, long time. No questions asked. Sadly, I cannot give this pre-packaged, worthless music (and I use the word loosely) a ZERO, which it wholely deserves.

Anyone who's even considering this CD has no real taste for good music, and is probably mildly retarded. Actually I take that back even a retarded person wouldn't allow themselves to be subjected to listening to this crap.

Their music really doesn't deserved to be listened to. Sure, Benji and co. are trying their best. But, they have enough money already, and their music is not what Americans deserve.Their music may be catchy. And if you like it, okay, I can't do anything about it.

It was a torch passed by disenchanted youth rebelling against the status quo superficiality of the mainstream. Punk was the anti-theme of self cencorship and compromising ideals for sales. Of course this only lasted until big business record execs smelled profit, and thus began the saturation of the industry. By the time Good Charlotte arrived, modern billboards were not as focused on image and the almighty bottom line. From tatooed tears, to eyeliner, piercings, and \\"black so we must be gothic clothing\\", there is no low too deep for these \\"guys\\" to make a buck. They've single handedly discredited the punk genre, and their remarkable success means record companies will be spinning of reproductions for the next 10 years. \\"Girls will laugh at boys when they're not funny?\\".

Honestly, this cd lacks any kind of musical depth. The singers voice is so whiney that it is iritating.I saw these guys at the Warped tour a couple years back and they sucked. I guess that why they would rather host TRL than play a live show. These guys cant sing or play guitar or do anything but go on tv and advertise their album.

And why, when i go into a music store, is this title in the METAL section? It should really be under the POP section. So theres one song on here that could fall into the SKATER ROCK category (the anthem) but that that's it. and the lyrics are kinda puny too (i'm beggining to think these dudes stole the lyrics from The Backstreet Boys or something...But on the other hand when i so these guys in concert they were sorta heavyier and more rocky then on CD.So if you want METAL, don't buy this buy SLIPKNOT or something.

I can't beleive that people have accused of hating on emo because I ahte Good Charlotte and Simple Plan. Real emo is Brand New, Taking Back Sunday, Finch, and the like.

The Young and the Hopeless leaves Billy, Paul, Joel, and Benji certainly not hopeless that this cd will make through another day! It is definitely different from their first, but different for the better. Unlike the first album, this one is more mellow and has even more depth to the lyrics. If GC kept the exact same sound for every album they produce, then they would get old fast, but since they have thrown in a new unique style, the cd is exciting. It's a cd where you may not like it the first day because it's a different sound, but after you listen to it a few times through it hardly leaves your cd player.

The funny thing is though, while RIAA reported a drop in sales over the last couple of years, indie labels reported a significant increase.Kids, there is so much great music lying outside of MTV and your local major radio station that it really isn't hard to find at all.

This is just another no-talent pretty boy band that the mainstream spewed out and MTV made everyone think was great. Blink182, Good Charlotte, New Found Glory, Simple Plan.. this is all sh*t music.

It had nothing to it. I don't agree with people when they mindlessly bash this group just because they are popular, If they weren't half as many people wouldn't hate them as they do now.

Go back to the garbage heap you came from and stop polluting our brains with your mindless dribble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't they used to be called green day???","review":"Wow another pop/punk band that MTV help to create damn you MTV!!!! Like bands like this beofre like green day eventually they will just fade away but everybody in my town listens to this garbage!!! to many punk posers i guess. They write 50% of there songs and people brag about that! PATHETIC! i call them backstreet boys with guitars cause thats all they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this sh*t?","review":"I agree with all u people who gave this 1 star, Good charlotte are possibly the worst band i have ever heard in my entire life. those sad people saying this is 'the greatest album in years' need to listen to some proper music, not watch Mtv all day. Try Nirvana or System of a down or someone, in fact try any band other than this one. And ive gotta say, the worst thing about this band are the actual bandmembers, do they think they look cool? Whatever music you like, even if its rubbish like Blink 182, don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deffidently Young and Hopeless","review":"The cd title says it all. The songs on the cd come out of the work of a young and hopeless \\"punk\\" group. The fact that this product is sold under the image of a punk group is funny to me as no true punk group would ever be number one on TRL, where Pop Reigns King. This is just backstreet boys, with a rock beat. Now i'll give credit where credit is due and this is where they get their one star they can play instruments so.... they have some musical talent. Very little though as almost every song sounds alike, with a pop upbeat and happy go lucky choruses. So if you like what you hear on the radio go ahead and get it, but if you can't stand this artist like me then don't buy it run in the opisite direction. I recomend looking at evanscenes new release it's really good you've probably heard the song \\"bring me to life\\" from the daredevil movie. They are an up-and-coming artist to look out for."},{"rating":"1","title":"????Good???Charlotte?????","review":"First of all, what kind of name is \\"GOOD CHARLOTTE\\"? Who is Charlotte? One of ther mommies? Their music is not that great,they have probably never have had a music lesson in their lives because none of their drums or guitars correspond or sound good playing together. Their isn't even a tune to their music (I have sat down with my sister who is a Good Charlotte fan,to help me interpret what they are saying. All it is,is screaming and yelling and banging on drums and occasionally a guitar solo) They all dress in black and they look satanic.The only good song they have is \\" The rich and famous\\" and that only sounds half-good.dont waste your money on this stupid Cd put Your monny to good use.invest it,save it for College,a retirment,or just go buy a beer."},{"rating":"2","title":"They may not be talented but they write excellent lyrics","review":"Good Charlotte isnt the most musically talented group out there, in fact I dont even like this kind of music at all, but the meanings of their songs are very powerful. Just knowing that the song \\"Hold On\\" will save lives just touches my heart. The song \\"The Anthem\\" has a great message as well. And Good Charlotte could care less if they're punk or not, there just trying to deliver great messages and catchy songs all you people who love unheard of bands please stop bashing all of these bands because I know that Good Charlotte isnt punk music but you should respect them for what there doing and trying to get people to be themselves and to live a good life. And also you guys seem to be biased towards bands that are popular by hating them, there are awesome bands that are popular and nont popular out there it just depends. Respect Good Charlotte for who they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"my Synopsis","review":"In the pop/punk scene originally created by the likes of Blink 182 and Sum 41 emerges a band from Astoria called Good Charlotte. Unlike their pop/puk predecessors like New FOund GLory, and Blink 182, Good Charlotte is nothing original at all. Good Charlotte seems like pop with a little punk in it as apposed to punk with a little pop in it.Although their are some highpoints like \\"Wondering\\" and \\"Emotionless\\" most of the songs seem like songs that were written in twelve minutes just to have enough songs for an album.However, the highpoint of the album is the over-exposed \\"The Anthem\\" because it is truly an anthem. It is an anthem for girls that would have been listening to N'Sync to listen to this. It is an anthem for teenie-boppers to monotonously call themselves \\"punk\\" and say \\"I hate preps\\" constantly. Although I find this movement annoying, I must applaud Good Charlotte for creating such a movement."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Band SUX!!","review":"Good Charlotte arent true punk at all they are just a bunch of poser wanna be's. They delve into rap all the time and even have turntables, all u kids out there that spew all that about this being the *real* stuff, you have no idea. U want some REAL punk rock check out the sex pistols, black flag, the dead kennedys, and social distortion. The only bands working now days that are real punk are Powerman 5000 and the Hives so check yourself b4 u go spewing forth about a band and an album that are posing."},{"rating":"1","title":"No.","review":"This past school year, I witnessed something miraculous. A large portion of my peers wearing eye makeup, chains, and torn-to-hell green cargo pants. The words Good Charlotte or simply GC written were on their binders, and sometimes their clothes. They say that they are \\"rebelling\\". Rebelling against what? They called themselves \\"punks\\". No. They ride home on their mountain bikes to their middle-class four bedroom house and eat cookies and milk. They are not punks or rebels. They are lost children looking for a way to fit in. When Good Charlotte appeared they all decided to jump on the \\"pop-punk\\" bandwagon. Its desperately sad that they couldn't find anything else. Now they listen to this CD, this hopeless garbage, every day on the bus ride home completely oblivious to the many wonderfully talented musicians that exist in our world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Crap","review":"My Generation is of X...

I thought I would like their sound. I buy the CD and every other song is horrible. It was extremely disapointing for me. I expected some good punk, but what I found was a group who was basically a combination of soft Blink 182 and n'Sync. Sure, every 13 year old girl will love this...but as a self respecting collegiate, I can never listen to this CD again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Charlotte...more like Best Charlotte","review":"Good Charlotte is the best band since Cryptopsy.

Those were the only good songs on the whole albu, and I don't even like those anymore this sucked so bad. how can ou call this punk rock. A little band I know called Sum 41 is punk rock, listen to them, not this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rich, Famous, Young, and Hopeless","review":"This is just too much. And people think Good Charlotte is punk?! No, they are not. They are pop-rock, posers. Wannabe-Punkers, whaddever you want to call them. How can anyone like this? Folks, this is not music. If you want some punk, go somewhere else. This is pop, and this is horrible. If you're looking for some corny, lovesick music, this is for you. I am sorry if I seem rude, but it's the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Power pop at its best and least","review":"Good Charlotte is the 2003 version of REO Speedwagon, Kansas and the other '80s groups that always let a power chord drwon out asny sense of originality. I'm not the mid teens to early 20s age group that this is aimed at but I do listen to Radiohead and others and perhaps that is the problem.Good Charlotte is like a stick of gum with powerful flavor on first bite, but sooner rather than later the flavor is gone. The lyrics vary from teenage rant to misogomy to hold on, we've been there things will get better, to my Dad drinks too much. . . you get the point.What is lacking here is texture, originality, not talent. What they do they do well, it's just what they do looses flavor to quickly for my tastes."},{"rating":"1","title":"this Is PUNK?????","review":"oh my god . this is what you people call punk? this aint punk. thi is the kind of band that can see all their videos on nickelodeon. this is pop!! if this is called PUNK then the PUNK music that i knew is dead. this $#!t is a disgrace to punk music. these guys arent fast, punk, cool, loud, punk, cuz they are stupid pop dudes. an exect impression of simpole plan. This is serious. if this is today's PUNK what happenened to the real Punk music. You fans of GC make me sick"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is so \\"Punk Rock!\\"","review":"I bought this album as an attempt to ditch the rap and pop music i was brought up with and introduce myself to something better. Unfortunatly my purchase was misguided. Good Charlotte, especially on this CD, is an over-produced \\"punk\\" band differing from pop stars only because of the use of real instruments and a whiney voice.So I end with this advice: If you like pop-punk [music] this would be the CD of choice, but if you are looking for something original, look somewhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kinda fresh...","review":"I'm tired of whiny critics like the one below. Get over yourself. You're not cool because you're a \\"purist,\\" it just makes you look uninformed and unintelligent. With that in mind, Good Charlotte takes a stab at people like the negative reviewer below with The Young and the Hopeless.As this isn't my preferred genre of music, forgive me if my review/critique isn't complete. Basically, if you're tired of the typical stereotyping and three-chord crap that's ruling the radios these days, you might find Good Charlotte to your liking.By far, The Anthem and Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous are the best tracks on this album, which doesn't mean that the song wasn't good before the fans made it so, just that the record company knew a good song when they heard one.If you need something fresh and different, grab it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It may not be 'punk', but that doesn't make it bad!","review":"Ignore the punk purists telling you that this CD is pop, its not punk, its just trash. OK, so it may not be pure punk, but that doesn't make it bad. It is better than most pop music, with good tunes and catchy lyrics. This is a really good CD, no matter what catagorey you place it in."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked their last CD better..","review":"I considered myself a Good Charlotte fan when their last CD came out, the songs were pretty good and no one else seemed to really know who they were. All that changed when they hit it big on MTV..now I have nothing against popular bands, but if I hear\\"lifestyles of the rich and famous\\" one more time I'm going to go crazy. A friend bought me this CD, I played it maybe twice the whole way through, why would I want to listen to GC songs when I hear them constantly on the radio and MTV? Maybe it was the fact that GC is being shoved down my throat or perhaps I find the way their attitudes have totally changed in the interviews that they've become these cocky jackasses now..but I no longer consider myself a Good Charlotte fan. As far as this CD goes, save yourself some money and just turn on the radio they're bound to be played in another 5 minutes anyway.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depends on your interests...I don't like it","review":"If you like pop punk (read: stuff you find all over MTV), then this is for you. Personally, I don't like that stuff. My interests are more metal/nu-metal, but I do listen to punk, and this is not punk, its pseudo-punk, which does have its place but should not be confused with real punk. Once again, if you haven't listened to it, I recommend you preview 1 song, any one. It doesn't really matter which one...they all sound the same anyway. And to all you guys who DO like that stuff you choose to call by the wrong name, congratulations. You've succeeded in rewarding the bands that put the record label's fat contract before their own creativity (or lack of it). But out of sympathy I'll grant you an extra star.One last thing: These guys cannot play live. They aren't together as a stage act at all. The worst bands at my school are better instrumentalists than Good Charlotte."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh please!","review":"With the exception of bands such as Incubus, Dave Matthews Band, Radiohead, and Days of the New, modern music is going down the Chatahoochi River. This is one of the worst efforts by any band I have ever heard. There is nothing special about the content of this album. The songwriting has as much depth as a bathtub. They're just doing something that has already been done before. All these little high school bands are nothing but an ego trip talent show that you can't wait to end. Good Charlotte is probably the second worst popular band when it comes to this. We need more adults like Neil Young out there showing this young'uns how to run things. Albums like these make me happy to know I'm about to graduate to keep from walking the halls with these fools.

This is the CD that has basically created a cult-like following through the music industry today.First off, these guys aren't punk, real punk is The Ramones, The Misfits, and The Sex Pistols.Second, this is garbage. The band has no real talent. Their drummer sounds like he has no idea what he's doing, the guitar is boring simple and uncomplicated. And the singer sounds like he has something wretched up his butt.Don't buy this, but I will counter reccomend these bands and artists:Iron MaidenJudas PriestBlack SabbathOpethRonnie James Dio(Rainbow, Dio, etc.)Led ZeppelinRed Hot Chili PeppersAC/DCJimi HendrixPink FloydNow those are some classic musicians right there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst band EVER","review":"If i could rate this band lower than a Zero...i would. this isnt music...its just a bunch of posers who cant even play their instruments.they use their \\"punk\\" image to get sales. let me explain something else....if u want to be stupid you can call this garbage \\"punk\\" but punk music is pissed off music......there is nothing pissed off about this stuff...its all this goofy and happy stuff.unfortunatly they got a record deal because lots of people like this \\"new wave mainstream punk\\" but its just not even right to listen to this stuff.by the way...i didnt even buy this CD..im just letting people know not to waste their money."},{"rating":"1","title":"And they say nu-metal is manufactured...haha","review":"Lifesytles of the rich and famous indeed... i'm sure thats what these boys are living no thanks to their little manufactured boy band with guitars.

Not only does it smell...but it takes too...long. If they worked at it, the members of this \\"band\\" could condense the message of all their songs on this CD to one song. There really is no variety to the messages in their songs. The only variation, and it is a slight one at that, is the first single: \\"liefstyles of the rich and the famous\\". God help me if I have to hear that song again. It is one of the most annoying...attempts at being punk coming from a pop band that I have heard in a long time. Consider the chorus: \\"lifestyles of the rich and the famous, always gold-plated, always gold-plated\\". The horrificness of these lyrics speak for themselves.

They are all written by the members of GC, and they are the best songs I've ever heard. The band has alot of talent. And they deserve all the glory they have gotten so far! I suggest you buy this album! It's really good, good I mean GREAT! On this album the song \\"Say Anything\\" is my favourite.

If you ever see them on \\"All Things Rock\\" on MTV they cut on other bands when they are the epitome of all really horrible music. It seems to me that they left all of their \\"Punk\\" heritage behind and became so incredibly poppy that it is hard to determine them from Britney Spears. This is a huge disappointment from there first cd. Also, they have created this new genre of small children that try their very hardest to be gothic and be like them.

However, if you are a little more discerning in your musical taste (i.e. you don't want to be made fun of by your freinds) then you are better of exploring other genres. For example, GC has been labeled \\"Punk\\" by some misguided souls. But if you want to explore punk then stick with Black Flag or Sex Pistols.For cutting edge music quickly emerging from punk roots, then you are better off exploring Gun Bunny or Winnebago Deal. Some of today's good bands are hard to get a hold of in the U.S. but they are well worth the search, and you will get a lot more respect from your friends.

Yeah, we heard it years ago, back when Social Distortion did it and it was called \\"Ball And Chain.\\" And it was better then.Sorry, Good Charlotte.

If this was five years ago it would have received five stars. That being said this album really doesn't hold up. Time is it's enemy. This band is embarassing and weak. However, they were a sign of the times and still have a good melody. I just can't seem to take the band seriously anymore. Times change and for this band they've kinda of went backwards. It makes me really respect bands from the 1960's where the music holds up forty years later whereas this doesn't. I'm not a hater because I own most of their albums. This is by far their best album.

I was not aware just how loud it was when I purchased it, and may not have bought it if I had known. However, the kids absolutely love it, which makes up for the ear-ache it gives everyone else! And I know that the kids will play with it for years to come, unlike other more expensive toys. An ideal present to give your friends' kids, just to see the annoying reaction on the parents' faces when they hear the noise.On the design-side, it looks great, but would have benefited from the \\"walkway\\" on the top of the tunnel being the right height to have allowed ascending and descending take to be laid on it, i.e. like a bridge. It is about 5mm too low for this, which frustrates the kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice addition to your Brio railway","review":"This tunnel generates one of four sounds when the train passes through or the button on the top is pressed. The sounds are well made. They include an owl sound, train and mine sounds and so forth. I think the playback volume is just right.A nice touch is the steps made on one side of the mountain as well as the small bridge on the top. These features creates a roleplay area for your child to explore with the small Brio men and women you can get in some of the other Brio sets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Versatile, Fun, Heavy Duty and Loud Tunnel","review":"I bought this tunnel to add variety to the railroad I am building for my grandson. He is only 2 so there is a lot he has yet to think of to do with it. He always enjoys watching the trains go through it. And he has even more fun making the little Brio people climb up the path, over the bridge and down into to or up out of it. It seems well made and I think it will hold up well. The only complaint I have (and my wife agrees) has to do with the built in sound effects. When the button is pushed to have the tunnel play one of several railroad related sounds, we have to cover our ears. It is LOUD! Our grandson loves noise. His favorite activity is to push the button... over and over again. It wears us out pretty quickly and we put it away for several days at a time. Over-all it is a fun toy and it should last a long time. I have not found a way to turn it down but I would love to do so, soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome bluegrass!","review":"I picked up this CD on a whim.

Leslie Faber, the girl who was raped in the story, went to my high school. The author of this book really captures what that town was like during the incident. My family and friends were outraged about the comments made on TV, the quotes in the newspapers, etc. Leftkowitz, though, doesn't adequately cover the little things. For example, he makes a big deal about lines from the Beastie Boys, but he called the record \\"Licensed to Chill\\" when it's actually called \\"Licensed to Ill.\\" That can be irritating at times, but overall it is a very, very intriguing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Beginning, Drags to the End","review":"This book was so great. I powered through it and couldn't put it down. It reminded me so much of when I was in High School.I was only disappointed when I got to about the center of the book, when the boys get accused. It kind of dragged on from there with tons of details about everything. Still interesting, but it took a long time to get through all the deatails.In any case, I have already recommended this book to almost all my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately a disappointment","review":"I'm a big fan of true crime books and the glowing reviews of this one made it look enticing. Unfortunately, it's nowhere near as good as the reviews here suggest. It is a promising topic - the gang rape of a retarded girl by a group of moneyed jocks - but it's just not engrossing. The book can't seem to make up its mind what it wants to be - journalism or sociology. So it fails as both. Frankly, it's appallingly edited, and is overlong by several hundred pages (it would have made a good pithy New Yorker article). There's a lot of amateur sociological speculation. The characters are not finely drawn (the author thinks research is a good subsititute). Just when a part gets interesting, more dry pseudo-analysis bogs it down. It is occasionally interesting, and eventually you get the facts of the case. But it's not very well written and is best read if you're interested in the subject rather than fine journalism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Send Lefkowitz to Littleton, CO","review":"Now that we have had another high school tragedy in Littleton, CO, I would like to see Lefkowitz write a book about the culture that prevailed there.

In Our Guys, Lefkowitz proves he can examine the scene, tell the tale intelligently, and make a case for the changes that need to be made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Searingly accurate portrayal of jock worship in this country","review":"This book is a riveting, carefully observed account of a vicious crime and the many efforts to cover it up. And it's the most truthful portrayal of the much-touted \\"family values\\" as you're likely to find. As for Steve Malave of Texas and others like him in these reader reviews, not content to deny the truth, they go out of their way to ridicule it as well (though the faux-legal theorizing and linguistic contortions are amusing).Unfortunately, denying the truth is a happy pastime in the culture of privilege. All the perks that go along with the exaltation of sports--everything from fixed parking tickets to unearned grades in class to assault and rape--are not only tolerated but promoted by millions of parents, teachers, officials, and fans.As excellent and responsible as Lefkowitz's effort is, nothing will change. The worship of \\"our guys\\" all over the country, even in the face of gross criminality, continues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Child rearing values are one focus of this multilayered book","review":"As a child development professor and child therapist, I find Our Guys a fascinating expose of child rearing practices that result in psychopathology in highly valued young men. By delineating the development of these boys from childhood to adolescence, the author notes the special rewards offered boys who are seen as promising, attractive, and entitled by parents, school, and community in contrast to the attitude toward females,people with special needs, and those who do not fit the stereotype of \\" brawn and beauty \\". Since this attitude can be recognized throughout our culture, and even highlighted by popular television series and by the adulation of sports heroes (also forgiven for rape and other acts of violence), parents and educators should read and reflect on the implications such a tragedy highlights when superficial values such as appearance and acheivements in sports supercede moral and character development...Nancy E. Curry, Ph.D"},{"rating":"2","title":"A story that needs to be told","review":"_Our_Guys_ is a book that I have trouble reading. I find it a difficult book to read because the story is so horrifying. Yet I continue to read, because the tale of Leslie Faber, the Glen Ridge boys and the world's reaction should be heard. The book amazes me; the story appals me; it is a call for the American culture to reexamine itself and its attitudes. Lefkowitz has crafted a piece of literature that will shake our nation's confidence and force us to change. I feel the author's bewilderment, disbelief, horror and pain more acutely than I would have thought possible. I am left speechless by the thought that such atrocities exist in our comfortable lives and no one notices. Lefkowitz has left a lasting imprint on me and my view of the nation I am so proud of. _Our_Guys_ is indeed one of the most moving books I have ever opened. Let's have more books by this outstanding author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scholarly, meticulously-researched, account of injustice","review":"Lefkowitz has chosen to not only put a group of coddled, privileged young men up to scrutiny but also the town, Glen Ridge, New Jersey, which created them.

It's a case history of an abominable rape of a mentally defective teenager by a group of high school heroes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is this the real America?","review":"I read this book whilst in the US last year, and I was both shocked and wierdly fascinated. To an outside viewpoint, the depiction of a \\"typical\\" American community is very scary. The complacency and overiding competitiveness that affects every aspect of teenage life (and most of the adult world too), is simply alien to a young British person. But Lefkowitz is extremely convincing in painting a picture not of monsters, but of misguided and poorly-raised kids. My experience of America is nothing like this, but I'm not sure if that would be the case if I lived there full time. Overall an excellent book, highlighting the extremes to which Americans go, in every aspect of life (sport, money, entertainment).

After reading it, I didn't feel any better. Some of the Bible verses she uses doesn't even have anything to do with animals. It's like she's grasping or trying to make it into something else. I grew up in a Southern Baptist church and have enough experience with those people who manipulate the Scripture to fit them. I work with one of these people now and he flat out told me my cat is NOT in heaven, that God doesn't love animals like that.

Her book is extremely well researched at the human level and clearly Divinely Guided at the Spiritual level to help those who need to know that \\"There is Eternal Life for Animals.\\" Niki's research is helpful because it affirms for us all that the opposite of death is not \\"life\\", but rather \\"birth\\". We, humans and animals, enter into this earthly experience for a limited period of time. To be sent here in human or animal form is a great privilage - an experience to be savored and cherished and then released - comforted by the fact that there is more to come. \\"There is Eternal Life for Animals\\" is an inspired and loving work that will lift the pain from many hearts in our world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mood music","review":"One of those albums that noone else has ever heard of,and you love to turn people on to.A little of everything here.Some psychedelia,some thoughtful balladry,and some flat out rockers that cook.Gemini is a favorite.The recently released Quatermass 2,The Long Road,has nothing to do with the original feel(unfortunately)but the added track \\"One Blind Mice\\"is a nice surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"lost classic","review":"This album contains \\"Black Sheep of the Family\\" which was later recorded by Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow on their debut.

Walsh's views are the antidote to the pathology model which highlights deficits and illnesses in families instead of looking to build upon their available resources and strengths. I would recommend the book to any therapist, especially marriage and family counselors. However, don't be surprised by the extremely repetitive nature of the beginning half of the book- I suppose that's what it takes to drive the point home (and it's a crucial point!).

The student protestors who were massacred by the state were a combination of socialists, liberal communists, and even hardline Maoists demanding a return to communism as the state began to really reject it.

This is hands down the worst episode so far in the disappointing Masters of Horror series. There are so many things bad about this film Garris would have to be either stupid or just jaded to think that there is anything redeeming about this film. The casting is horrible, the acting worse, and the story is overdone to the point that its laughable.

Hardly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this dvd","review":"Hands down the worst episode of the Masters Of Horror television show. It's dull, boring, and not scary.

Then why not have a trully terrifying film presented to us. I am tired of watching movies that claim to be horror and are more of a suspense film. This would have been a perfect film for the \\"Twilight Zone\\", but not for \\"Masters of Horror\\". If you are expecting to be scared or are looking for something dark and dreary don't look here. I wouldn't want to waste your time expecting to see anything that resembles horror here. I have been disappointed so far by the \\"Masters of Horror\\" films. I was expecting more and was completly disappointed. If your going to claim to be a master of horror then please present us something that resembles horror at least. Look at the \\"GhostHouse Underground collection\\", or \\"8 films to die for collection\\". These films at least resemble horror films. Not all are great, but at least they are what they claim to be. Horror Movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell Short","review":"This one attempts to be a hefty psycho/charater study piece, but when all is said and done comes up pretty shallow. While I admire Garris for coming up with the Masters of Horror series (which I say overall has been great), I don't think anything he's done makes him a 'Master of Horror.'Chocolate is watchable, and sort of equates to an okay but forgettable Twilght Zone episode. The main character played by Henry Thomas in no way solicits sympathy nor any strong emotional attachment for that matter. The film leaves questions unanswered and offers up little in the way of brain candy, excitement or character development.Certainly one of the weaker installments, but again, if you have the time and desire then know what you're getting into."},{"rating":"2","title":"always spot on advice","review":"I had considered taking a photography class at the local CC but decided to try these DVDs.

To fit so many movies on a few DVDs, they compressed the video data down dramatically. On a large screen, the video is flooded with artifacts, rendering the picture blocky and filled with noise. Plus the transfers themselves still retain the original film noise - these have not been professionally cleaned like the Criterion Collection releases.

Quite unexpectedly, I found myself in tears often while reading it, not out of any particular joy or sorrow, but because it touched my heart so deeply. Universal truths are revealed in its pages, and the author demonstrates how we can walk our talk and be our authentic selves by following our inner guidance. It conveys how living transpersonally does not mean sacrificing anything about the personal. We learn that our personal experiences are actually enhanced and enriched when our focus is on more than the self. This is a must read, as it will take you on a journey of compassion, hope, truth and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost perfect - but I may return it","review":"When I saw that Mikhail Pletnev recorded the Tchaikovsky Concerto #2 in DVD version, there were no second thoughts. I immediately ordered it and couldn't wait for it to arrive. Last night, I put it on and had a major disappointment. Although the sound is nearly perfect and the photography fantastic, in the Concerto the syncing was off! The sound of a crashing chord would be followed a second later by Pletnev's hand coming down on the chord.Perhaps this might not bother other people but I found myself looking away and just listening to his gorgeous playing. On the other hand, I bought a DVD to watch and not a CD to listen. The same problem may have been there in the symphonic works but it wasn't as noticeable as when watching a pianist up close. What a shame - this ruined an otherwise fantastic DVD for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few helpful tidbits, not much else","review":"I originally bought this book because John Doerr was a \\"co-author\\". He only wrote the foreward, a few hundred words at most.Most of the book is filler and anecdotal examples, like \\"a good vc is important, just look at Netscape...\\"The valuation section does does not really even talk about methodology, but gives a list of deals from the VentureOne database.About a quarter of the book is a venture capital directory. This will be moderately useful but there are plenty available on the web.The only real value I got out of the book is the interviews with some good VCs.This book had a lot of potential, but the value could be condensed into ten pages. I was disappointed in that I expected much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hastily put together","review":"This book read like it was put together in a weekend. The writer seemed peculiarly interested in promoting himself, rather than the ideas he was explaining. Lots of hype (anecdotes about quick success, making a splash, etc). Very little on the mechanics of raising money, negotiating with VC's, haggling over valuation...ie, the stuff that you really need to know as an entrepreneur. Overall, a low signal-to-noise ratio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is helpful as a benchmark.","review":"The book promises to explain the in's and out's of getting $'s from VC's. Unfortunately, it falls way short of the mark. It is practically inevitable that any entrepreneur realistically ready to access VC funding will have already come across the information contained in this book. If, on the other hand, you find the information contained in the book helpful you probably are no where near the stage you need to be to access VC funding. Thus, to some extent, the book succeeds in letting its reader know where their entrepreneurial effort stands. As others have suggested, I think much more interesting and relevant insight can be attained by reading internet-business magazines (Red Herring, The Industry Standard, Business 2.0, Upside)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rolodex & personalities of VCs, but nothing in depth","review":"I really wanted to like this book, since the subject needs updated attention. But it reads as if it was rushed to market (some typos, lots of jargon and repetition), contains many many pages of relatively useless charts (here is a list of 'Net companies that might or might not still be around; here is a list of famous VCs; here they are again and again; here is a list of money raised by round...) and little meaningful content (the valuation section -- key for the entrepreneur -- was a major disappointment). The interviews with Mr Harmon's VC friends and entrepreneurs were interesting and revealed a human side -- but nothing that was not already easy to get your hands on via magazines and newspaper articles. Mr Harmon seems like a really nice person as did all of the interviewees -- but know what you are looking for when you order this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to write home about","review":"Despite the name recognition of those who sing the praises of this book (they are all in it) I found it nothing special. It seems more like a vehicle to get Harmon's name in lights now that he has left Internet.com and started his own shop.Alot of dated material and I agree with the other reviewer who indicated that this appeared to be rushed to press.Anyone with an idea or concept that is in a position to get VC funding or attention will already know most of what is in this book.Harmon's expertise lies in his analysis of individual stocks, not in providing an \\"inside look\\" at how to get VC funding. It appears as though it is more a venue for him to drop names, something he has been doing alot of lately.Check it out of the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filler -- and not even much of that","review":"What a disappointment. First, giving John Doerr co-author status (as it appears here at least) is really misleading. Doerr just wrote a two-page introduction, and says nothing there he hasn't said a million times before.But even worse is how lazy and thin the whole thing is. Take away the pages of print-outs of VC address and companies stats (all available on the web for free, BTW) and the softball Q&A sessions cut-and-pasted from Harmon's email and you've got what amounts to a magazine article. And not even a particularily good one at that -- you can get better insights reading the Red Herring for a few issues, or even Business 2.0.The whole thing feels like it was thrown together over a long weekend. Anybody who has a chance with any of the VCs Harmon recommends already knows everything in this book. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must read -- for all the wrong reasons","review":"When historians go dumpster diving through the cultural effluvia of this bizarre period, Zero Gravity will be one the most important books they find. Not because it is good. Au contraire. It is poorly written, leaden with cliches, chock full o' cliches, and generally poorly organized and insipid.So why is this book so important? Because it chronicles in vivid \\"You Can Be Rich Too\\" form the peculiar form of mania that took hold in 1997 and exploded in March of 2000. It turned a dull banker like John Doerr into a billionaire economic tastemaker; it turned a jejeune know-nothing like Steve Harmon into a species of savant.Read it now and beat the year 2051 Ph.D. in economic history candidates. And you won't even have to write a thesis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Gravity offers zero","review":"I give Harmon 100 stars for name-dropping. Unfortunately, this book continues to carry on Steve's tradition of presenting information without any genuine analysis or insight. His blatant self-promoting would even put Matt Drudge to shame. I am glad I borrowed this book from a friend. I would never pay for this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a waste of time!","review":"I am sorry to say this, but there are much, much better books available about this topic. Steve Harmon just spends half of this book using a supposedly-cool lingo to tell you some high-level things you probably read before. The other half consists of long interview sequences with Harmon\`s business friends talking about how much they mutually admire each other. Harmon has not done his homework: Consolidating what he learned and putting it into crisp clear words."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"Absolutely the stupidest book I've ever read.Steve Harmon is very full of himself, and his self-compliments get in the way of writing something useful. It is not written by someone who truly knows about building enduring businesses with value. As a result, it has little of value for people who intend to build those businesses. Its biggest virtue is as a representative text of the attitude and approach to business that got everyone in so much trouble in 1996-2000. It's too bad, because the great book-for-entrepreneurs has yet to be written."},{"rating":"1","title":"yet another bubble is bursting book","review":"Given Harmon's background as an internet economy pundit, I expected a lot more from this book. I've ridden this roller coaster all the way to the top and all the way to the bottom so i was fully expecting to really relate to what was going on in the book. I fell asleep about halfway through and never picked it up again. The Internet Bubble was THE book on this topic in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Starting Template","review":"From the other customer reviews, consensus is that Zero Gravity to be extremely helpful--I'm definitely in that camp. When you find yourself in the middle of the frenetic pace of a start-up, how in the world are you going to avoid the common potholes & blunders, what in the world should you expect? This is an excellent starting point--extremely practical and easy to read. Harmon's list provides the essential resources needed to understand the world of VC's and Angels. Some critics wanted more details and specifics but,there are other books that drill down on the details to venture capital. Harmon's book is properly scoped as a good startpoint for those wanting to start-up their dot.com. It provided me with what I needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money; serious fund seekers go elsewhere","review":"I wanted to get details on term sheets, negotiating tactics, worksheets for calculating valuation, glossary of terms.

This album is a tasty stew of jazz, classical, a little fusion, some new age, some upbeat, and some experimental. If you have been disappointed with new age (too boring), found Kronos Quartet a bit too edgy, like your music to give you new ideas, and want a multi-purpose album for personal listening in all sorts of situations (driving, hiking, chilling), this is it.

The lack of drums is not compensated for by the effete percussion work, and, oh, how the dexterity and edification of Bruninghaus's piano work are missed! The vocals, too, lend the tracks a lightweight and pop-like feel.Prior to purchasing Fluid Rustle, I had spent three weeks being propelled through the nuanced musical wonderland that is Silent Feet, so perhaps my disappointment was inevitable.

There are some decent quotes from highly successful screenplay writers. But, too few. A better reco for a book like that would be 101 Habits of Highly Successful Screenwriters.

This Cd is not for people who watch TRL. When this Cd first came out, and no pop music fans had even heard of P.O.D., I bought it and fell in love with the band. Brown is another one of their solid older CDs, but I like Snuff the Punk the best of them all. It is hard enough to keep you listening, but not not the Static X type of hard thatt is just screaming with little or no instrument talent. P.O.D. is an all-around talented band. Look at the cover and figure out what Snuff the Pynk means and you will understand way they are playing and how it is a lot easier to get hooked on them then another band. They play for the reason for religion and that helps you to get more into their music.

Sorry I can't rate this cd because I don't own it and haven't listened to this cd except for the song samples on the internet, so musically, I don't have a good idea of what this cd sounds like.

Snow's references to biblical tenets and experiences reconciles the fact that intuition is not evil but rather is in fact part of Gods connection to our human/ spiritual being. As a naturally born psychic medium it has been my experience that people mistakenly believe that there are only a few privileged individuals in society (usually only those in the bible) that God bestows with such gifts. Everything else is evil. By using biblical examples Snow buttresses the Christian / metaphysics connection by reminding us that we are all made in the likeness of Divinity/ God. She further impresses upon the reader the use of free will in relation to intuition. This is a must read regardless of beliefs.Karyn Reece-psychic medium and author of upcoming book \\"Bridging the Divide\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"This book saved me.","review":"I don't know what other people think about this book, and I think people will always have different feeling and thoughts about things. It totally depends on how you relate to the book. For myself, this book really touched me. It spoke to me at a time when I had almost given up the search for truth. For me, it has been a healing as no other book has been, on many levels. This is a great book on getting a hold on ones inner self, becoming a connector and getting what you want by connecting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait Until I Set Out My Trash","review":"Psychic Gifts by Tiffany Snow is no more than the eccentric ramblings of an \\"OBSCURE\\" author. This is the worst NDE book I have EVER read. This \\"Doctor\\" makes little to no mention of heaven, what's going on there, and so on. What she does do in this book is attempt to boost her own over inflated ego. An example of that is when I was shopping NDE books on Amazon I purchased this one based on all of the good reviews. Big mistake! Now I have noticed that MOST of the reviews have been posted on the same day (many in one day). Obviously this lady or her family is \\"Tooting\\" her own horn. The only gift this lady has is of a somewhat vivid imagination concerning herself. If you feel you must read it, get it a library. Well, on second hand she is an \\"Obscure\\" author, even though she is a legend in her own mind. So I doubt a library would have it. Maybe you could pick it up at half.com for a buck or two, or wait until I set my trash out."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just thought it was flakey","review":"I read this book and I thought it was a waste of time. First, the author has the irratating habit of using exclamation points at the end of sentences. Second, she doesn't go anywhere with this book. She talks about her experiences, but they are watery and pointless. What is she trying to say? It's all marketing and no substance.Some people may find it helpful, in talk of loneliness and so forth, but it was pointless to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"confusion, confusion, confusion","review":"I bought this book as a recommendation when I purchased another item. The positive reviews are all from people who work for this outfit. Prayer classes, teleconferences, animal healing, hmmm, doesn't this sound like tbn or the bakkers? How quickly we forget? We should be responsible for our own lives instead of giving our power away to such confused folks.Meditate and save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a book for Christians","review":"This is nothing more than a new age book guised with a Christian title.

IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE OLD ONES. Psychic gifts are not Biblical and more to the point are in fact useless against the unspeakable alien intelligence of Cthulhu! Ial Shub-Niggurath! Ms. Snow is combining \\"feel good\\" philosophies, buddying them up with new age tactics and using the word \\"Christian\\" as a marketing tool.If you are a Cthulhist and believe that we are all as hamster pellets to the great and horrible Cthulhu, please don't waste your time on this book. You'd be better off running around screaming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some will love it, some will hate it","review":"Bridging the gap between \\"New Age\\" Christianity and traditional Christianity Tiffany Snow examines what she considers to be gifts of the Holy Spirit. These are supernatural gifts the Spirit makes available to us if we choose to accept and use them. From the basics that most Christians believe, such as healing, to more radical concepts like channeling the Holy Spirit, the book is thought provoking and interesting reading. Some will find \\"Psychic Gifts in the Christian Life\\" revealing and life changing, others will find it blasphemous, most will find it somewhere in between and an interesting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, new concepts, new experiences","review":"Dr. Snow has a unique look on the supernatural world from a \\"birds-eye\\" view of her own personal near-death experience. From this, she came out from a strict religious background to a place of openness and spirituality, and brings the reader along with her like a best friend. Well-written, humorous at times, and light hearted, this author shows how the average person can develop the abilities for healing, finding missing children, etc. There are numerous personal accounts of her doing these things, and doing them well. Since she came into this \\"new life\\" from no previous background involved with the metaphysical, there is very little here that duplicates any other book. I give it a thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best meditation program out there","review":"I used everything from holosync to vantage quest and the Gateway Experience is still the best despite its age.

They contained instructions for out-of-body experiences. This new CD version is not the original Gateway. The CDs containing the OOB instructions have been replaced with those of another man (not Monroe) cooing about \\"finding your purpose.\\" My purpose in buying these was to have a CD set like the cassette set since I no longer have a functioning cassette player. This set has only 6 Waves, not the original 7. It is overpriced and worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I had seen the two quart","review":"I wanted Le Crueset, but could not afford that much money. I bought an Innova 4.5 at the local bimart and enjoyed it. I had bought a used Le ceuset off Ebay , and it was truly worn out.My family really liked the pot and I liked cooking in it, but clean up was a mess.I bought one of these at Bi mart, and I have nothing to complain about, good cookinng on the stove top, easy clean up.I dislike the narrow bottom and wish I had seen the flatter two quart.Beware, the handler is cute, but it gets hot! Too warn the family when it comes out of the oven I put a pot holder on it.Learn to adjust cooking time , turn oven down 25 degrees and be patient.I love these pans for slow roast and braising. They take a liitle longer to warm up, so keep the heat down and be patient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hume is turning in his grave","review":"David Hume is easily my favorite philosopher, so when I read of a \\"humean\\" modern moral philosopher, I jumped on this book. Unfortunately, I was terribly disappointed. When I read Brandt's belief that everyone in society should receive the same income, I could read no more. Hume would have been horrified by such an idea. Hume's moral theory was based on benevolence, but it was based on utility as well. Hume would have had some clue as to the complete disaster to the economy, and the incredible amount of power this would have placed in the federal government's hands. It never ceases to amaze me how naive modern philosophers can be when it comes to basic political economy."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointed","review":"I do not see how this DVD set was rated so high by its viewers. Maybe it is just to much for beginers? (it does say for beginers and intermediates after all)first I should have been more careful with only two real instructors from Israel...thats the first red flag.If this set did not have them it would be pure garbage.Disk 4 seems to be the only \\"good\\" one, with 3 being OK.Most of the videos are filmed in a darkened area, which sucks. The main \\"host\\" Duncan Pattle makes this set hard to watch. He makes little sound effects with his mouth with every punch or kick...after a few doven it gets old, and there must be hundreds of them!I feel some of the material is just watered down by poor instructors like Pattle. Amnon Darsa and Eyal Yanilov are the only ones on the set worth watching.If you are looking for simple yet hard core combatives, pass on this set.

It is a great teaching method, broken down in steps of difficulty, well illustrated and the instructions are very good to follow if you don't have any self defense background. If you do have prior training in any system, this is a very good add on to your experience. Any one with experience can see and analyse the moves and implement it to their workouts.

The quality of instruction and the in depth explanation are excellent. This could easily sell for 3X more than the list price."},{"rating":"1","title":"General, feel good, self-help book","review":"The wisdom expressed in this book is to look inside. If the answers are found within and not without then this is an excellent book. If we are basically good people, and others are basically good then I would recommend this book. However, I believe the answers to the human condition are not this simplistic as I believe the human condition is in more of a moral predicament than this book allows. The answers Smith provides can be summarized as 'be a better person' or maybe 'I'm OK, you're OK, now accept that and live like that'.The fundamental teachings of most world religions go much further than this in terms of offering a powerful solution to a very real and deep problem....that of the corruption of the human heart. Smith seems to soft-pedal the problem in order for his solutions to not appear 'washed-out' or weak. However, in doing so, I think he does a injustice to the reality of the human problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take a Moment to get grounded","review":"Don't let the size fool you.This book packs a punch.I live far away from other Friends at the moment. Often the religious people where I have lived don't believe Quakerism is even a religion, think that we are like the Amish, or worse, they are openly hostile to the ideas of Quakerism. As a result, I often look to this book to feel grounded. The book has that wonderful balance of personal stories and philosophical points. The author doesn't tell long stories because he likes telling long stories about himself.He keeps it simple.Whether you are a Friend, or not. Whether you are religious or not, this book is a grounding book covering ideas like peace simplicity and silence, of which we could all use more. I personally, love this book and am grateful to have it in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm going to buy it","review":"I borrowed this book from my library and now that I have read it I'll definitely buy a copy to keep because it is such a treasure. To me, whether Robert Smith is a Liberal Quaker, as some reviews here have stated, or mainstream, what he has written in this little book spoke to me as Truth. This is Christian thought and living at it's enlightened best."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Wise,' but debatably 'Quaker'","review":"Appreciate the stories told by this author about his life and consider the insights that he has gained from reflection on his experience; but, please, do not base your understanding of Quakerism on his presentation. In spite of the fact that Smith is a lifelong Friend and a former Quaker educator, he quotes George Fox (an important leader in the early Quaker movement) and the Bible inaccurately or out of context several times. In addition, some of Smith's statements about facets of Quaker faith and practice are historically unfounded or ignore the diversity within the Religious Society of Friends today. If you are interested in learning about Quakerism, read Wilmer A. Cooper's book, A Living Faith: An Historical Study of Quaker Beliefs (Friends United Press: 1990). Read Robert Lawrence Smith's book as a book of wisdom written by a Quaker, but not necessarily a Quaker book of wisdom."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great, interesting, sightful book","review":"I am not a quaker, but have been interested in the religion. This book helped me with some of my questions about it. The author talks about his own experience with various parts of the religion, and relates to things like being honest, being there for people, ect. It is a thought-provoking book, as it looks at our world today, and how things have changed. I bought this book sometime last year, and still re-read it today, and have found it extremely interesting and helpful to me. Overall, I would recomend this book for anyone, really."},{"rating":"1","title":"An exercise in self aggrandizement","review":"The story of the US Military Liaison Mission in East Germany is a story that needed telling -- and it still does. Fahey's book is more about his personal travails such as receiving a traffic ticket and wearing a required patch than it is about Mission operations. While Fahey is undoubtedly an excellent Russian linguist, he couldn't be much of an intelligence officer if, as he says, he was detained by the Soviets seven times out of six attempts. He constantly boasts of his photographic memory, but misspells at least two names. He seems intent on degrading other members of the Mission and delights in demonstrating what he perceives to be his intellectual superiority."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland revue","review":"Get Used To It, the 1992 revue written by Tom Wilson Weinberg(Ten Percent Revue) is undeniably well-sung especially in \\"Hymn\\", \\"Friends In High Places\\" performed by Jamie MacKenzie and \\"How We Get The News\\" performed by MacKenzie, Brad Whitaker, Wayne Barker and George Howe. The trouble I have with this show is the lack of variation; so much of it sounds the same! There is a strong gay message which is unfortunately saddled by bland melodies. Sorry, just my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short and to the point","review":"This book is very short. That is a good and a bad thing.It is good because the book strips down the elements of language testing to the bare essentials. Most of the important issues are dealt with, and all are dealt with succinctly and in plain language.It is bad if, as a reader, you are hoping for an in-depth discussion of testing-related issues.I read the book because it was a core text for a course I took as part of an MA Applied Linguistics. Each chapter served as a bare-bones introduction to the topic of the week. It served this purpose well, but it was necessary for my lecturer to supplement each chapter with other readings.The book is a good introduction to language testing in the EFL/ESL environment, and did a good job of structuring the university course that I took. I'd recommend it for both of those purposes."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AS BIG AS IT LOOKS","review":"It says the Fan rotor is like 3.5 X 2 inches.

The diverse stories here are whip-smart, weird, and Imaginative with a capital I. One bad-ass debut collection, Big Lonesome will be beating up and taking the lunch money of lesser collections for years to come. Ruland's genre-twisting genius returns us to the days when reading short stories was fun---Remember? In a book full of innovative characters and circumstances, one highlight is the brilliant title story, a Pynchon-meets-Old-West tale like none you've read before, where even a robot Indian can find love and a mad scientist can try his hand at bounty hunting. I don't know about lonesome, but this collection is big fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate it when the movie turns out to be better than the book","review":"I am totally disappointed in this book. It's really bad when the movie seems to give you more insight than the book on the same subject.

The author did not seem that interested in his subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"lies and half truths","review":"This book was written without true knowledge of the facts and circumstances surrounding the case. It contains suppositions, half truths, misconceptions, and outright lies. The author would not look into other facts we gave her. She relied on interviews of people who had nothing to do with the investigation, but ignored those who were. The movie, Scorn, is even farther from the truth. It does not even come close to portraying an accurate idea of the events. Not even close!

The Science of Shopping\\" which is a must read for everyone involved with retail.\\"Call Of The Mall\\" is also easy to read, though it has far more of Paco Underhill's opinions and far less actual research to back up his conclusions. It examines how Americans use the mall, what it means, why it works when it does and why it often doesn't work at all well.I have the feeling with this book that Paco Underhill has been reading too much of his publicity and now believes he is a witty, entertaining writer. So, in some ways it's a bit of a let down. However, for anyone involved in a management role within shopping centres it's still a \`must read'."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing second book","review":"I very much enjoyed Paco Underhill's first book about shopping, _Why_We_Buy_. Therefore, I was looking forward to this new effort with a great deal of anticipation, most of which was disappointed. Somewhere in this book is approximately one essay worth of interesting material; unfortunately, it's smeared all over a longer book that doesn't really stand up to the material.I really wanted to like this book, but I did not.

His books are filled with useful information and insights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative and Interesting","review":"Having previously read Paco Underhill's \\"Why we buy\\" I was anxious to read \\"Call of the mall\\". Americans spend alot of time and money in shopping malls. Underhill knows why this is and how retailers can increase both of these things.Call of the mall takes you on a journey through an ordinary mall in New Jersey. The book covers everything about a mall that a consumer is influenced by. He starts in the parking lot and ends with high end department stores.The part I enjoyed the most of the section on malls outside of the United States, especially those in Japan. He placed this section in the book perfectly and it is by far the most interesting part.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in retail marketing and consumer behavior."},{"rating":"1","title":"very dry reading. nothing to learn","review":"i expected a lot more from this writer. its just a rambling of a day in the mall. nothing much new to learn for marketers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insider Tour of Malls","review":"Underhill meanders through the mall voicing his observations aloud. It feels like an informal tour, but his knowledge of shoppers and retailers is based on the indepth study that has consumed his adult life.Along the way, he entertains us with descriptions of avid women shoppers, men's discomfort in the mall setting and how teens and seniors interact with malls. The reader gains new insight into his/her own behavior while shopping and in the way the stores lure the buyer.He touches on international malls, as well as the typical American mall. He exposes their flaws, suggests changes, and praises what works.I kept feeling that there must be more to tell, as the effect is of a behind-the-scenes, but not all-the-secrets tour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing followup to \\"Why We Buy\\"","review":"Underhill's Why We Buy was required reading for my marketing class, and after opening it up, I was hooked by his research and insight into buying behaviors. By contrast, I struggled through 70 pages of Call of the Mall before coming across some of the more interesting aspects of what retailers could do differently. Overall the book presents few compelling insights; it almost feels that he used up all his juicy bits for the first book and really had to dig at the bottom of the barrel for this one.Final word: Don't bother..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light and shallow","review":"Underhill has done it again, but what has he done. This is a light read that feels a little too much like being dragged through the mall with a witty uncle. I find his cute asides mildly entertaining, but there is really no meat to his observations. He makes shallow complaints about bad design of malls or stores, but then I kept wondering what malls he visited. Obviously, he's missed the giant ones in Dallas or Atlanta or DC or San Diego which look and feel very different from what he has described. Finally, this book may appeal to retailers, but perhaps that suggests the sorry state of retailing. I mean aren't most people spending their money in either the Targets, Costcos, or Walmarts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy this","review":"Its amazing how crappy this piece of equipment is.

After a few trips to the dealership, I decided this would quickly pay for itself... it did!If you need just a basic scanner, this is it. I think the only difference to the next model up, is the next model is battery powered to keep the code onscreen when it is unplugged from the OBD connector. To save the extra money, I can easily write down the code(s), if needed, on a piece of paper (grin)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Useful Device","review":"I am not a professional mechanic but have found this tool very easy to use and understand.More importantly though, this thing has already saved me several hundred dollars in repairs and diagnostics costs.

Because his cars were all new, he only had a chance to use it one or twice. I ended up borrowing it a couple times, as did some others in my family. The last time I borrowed it about 6 months ago, it didn't work. Now, granted, it probably spent a year in his garage doing nothing, but shouldn't it still work? And word to the wise, 2 years ago I paid $75 for it so wait for a sale. I contacted Actron to see if they offer any sort of repair or service and I hope that they are reasonable about that.But when it did work, I really liked the item and recommended it to countless friends and family. Now that it is not functioning, I have to go to Advance Auto or AutoZone to scan, but luckily there is no short supply of them.

A young, happy prince lives inside the castle walls, never knowing the struggles of his subjects until his death. After his death a gold statue with ruby eyes and other jewels in his sword is erected in his honor in the middle of town. The spirit of the young prince lives on in the statue and he despairs over the sadness of his people until he befriends a young swallow. He convinces the swallow to wait to fly south for the winter and to instead help him to help his subjects by taking the jewels embedded in the statue to various desperately poor people. After the jewels are all gone he instructs the swallow to strip him of his gold and distribute it among the people until there is nothing left but an ugly statue. The end brings tears to any eye.

I have tried other vegan or at least \\"not tested on animals\\" mascaras, and they were clumpy and performed poorly. This one goes on clump-free and lengthens my eyelashes (it doesn't thicken them, but my eyelashes are just right). The black color is not too harsh (I had found that when buying drugstore mascara, the \\"very black\\" ones were too dark; I always had to buy \\"soft black\\"--this is equivalent). My coloring is fair skin, green eyes, and either dark reddish brown or deep red hair (my natural hair color, not that I've seen in in twenty years, is something like dark ash blonde, but my eyelashes aren't light). Worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"Premium eyeshadow - goes on smoothly and stays on all day without getting cakey.

It stays on much better than Organic Wear 100% Natural Origin Mascara, and when it does get wet, it doesn't sting my eyes like other natural mascaras. I don't find that it clumps up, but then again I don't try to put six layers of mascara on, either.I also really like that it has very minimal ingredients, and EWG seems to think it's the least poisonous mascara out there (as of 2013), so that's a win. Oh, and there's a really cute mirror on the bottle, which I think is a pretty great little feature. I'll definitely purchase this again in the future, at least until I find a mascara that is even more natural."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice every day masacara","review":"A mascara that goes on smooth and never flakes.

It is OK - goes on easy, doesn't clump; but it doesn't really look like you are wearing mascara and adds zero volume or length. It made my eyelashes separated and more defined, but that's about it. I had to use four coats to make it even look like I was wearing mascara (I usually use one coat of a Stila mascara).So in summary - its good if you just want definition and a natural product, as long as you don't care about volume or length."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh, may as well go without mascara","review":"I suppose most \\"natural\\" mascaras won't work as well as the chemical laden stuff, but this is a real waste of $11.

The plot was slow, and the characters were developed poorly. I agree that it was a bit thought provoking, but there wasn't too much to think about, its no Ghost in the Shell in this aspect.Also, the animation is a bit dated, which would be ok if the series lived up to the standards of films such as Castle of Caglistro, but it doesn't.

Nothing happens to move the plot forward, and there's no tangible antagonist. The few action scenes there are are decent, but they do nothing for the story. The big finale consists of a girl trying not fall out of her mech--how lame is that? There's so much talking, and nothing ever happens. The sequel to this movie has philisophical content in the discussions, so at least there was SOME reason to listen to the dialogue. In this movie, you have to listen to two hours of crap to find out some guy is pissed at Tokyo. It doesn't matter at all, and there's no reason to care. Movies like Akira and Ghost in the Shell have slow spots as well, but they are short, and animated in such a way that they remain interesting. Not to mention the fact that their discussions have a POINT. If you want to watch a giant mech movie, watch Evangelion or wait for Gasaraki to come out in the US.

This has really helped keep the picture looking wonderful and in my home that is not easy. I do not smoke but I have a lot of dog hair and since I now have only evaporative cooling the amount of dust that comes in during the summer is impossible to control. I can't stop things that would harm these beautiful canvas photos that mean so much more to me than any painting by a stranger ever could so they need to be protected from everything that I possibly can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I use this on both matte fine art papers and photo paper, and it performs as promised.

This filled my garage and another room in the house with a very visible mist and hung in the air for quite awhile. It has a strong toxic smell and even with a mask I am left with a bad taste. Not sure how many coating I need to use but my picture now looks mottled as in the spray did not go on even. To be fair I was trying to coat a photo on canvas that was about 34\\" x 46\\". I have been using another product that I have to roll on and is a bit of a hassle but I don't feel like I'm breathing in toxins like using this.It says the area you spray in needs to be well ventilated.

Though I don't like the elder versions of these dolls as much, Baby Yasmin is great for your little daughter to play with.

But at the end in the last chapter he states that he doesn't believe they exist. I did read about some facts that I didn't know or didn't remember. No mention was made of the Roswell New Mexico crash landing in 1947. I would not recommend this book because it was written by someone who states that he does not believe UFO's exist. There are many other much better books out there on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"This book is a great read for anybody interested in UFO's or anything related. I love how old and weathered my copy felt; it looks pretty sweet sitting on the book case.

I personally think that this season could have been a little better. I do enjoy some of the episodes, but not all of them. The rest of the seasons I can't get enough of, but Season One I've only watched once. If you're thinking about buying this season on DVD, I would recommend you buy Season Two, Season Three, and skip Season One. I personally think Metalocalypse is the best animated T.V.

Just watch it and see if you like it. Some people will be turned off by the gore, I think it's funny.

I won't bother to list them all as another reviewer has already done that but this DVD set is definitely worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute waste!","review":"This is a refreshingly original show using a genre of music that is often ignored and cast into the darkness because it is \\"evil\\". It's got a lot of promise to be something great. So why is my rating so low? I'm rating the DVD not the show. When I heard of the show's release on DVD, I was excited because I was sure the show, unlike on Cartoon Network, would be uncensored on DVD which is a standard practice nowadays for shows that use strong profanity and violence. To my disgust, it's presented just like on TV!That pick squeal guitar noise sounding in place of every profane word is fine on TV but not on DVD! Sorry, Williams Street, but censorship is a travesty; no money for you, ever. And I heard it's the same with the season 2 DVD except for the Easter eggs and special features so I disapprove of it as well! Maybe they'll get the message for the season 3 DVD set which will inevitably come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"More ran-dumb Adult Swim nothingness","review":"Well, fans want this stuff and Cartoon Net keeps dishin' it up: more random \\"comedy\\" with limited Web-type animation. I'm floored that people can't see this stuff for what it is: a bunch of guys sitting around a microphone freeballing it, then someone turns it into a cartoon. This takes talent? At least the early days of Adult Swim actually had some cleverness and unexpected laughs. But this type of thing is, sadly, about the ONLY kind of cartoon that is popular these days. Guys: you KNOW you could do this at home, right? And post it online? And become the Next Big Thing? Yeah. Do us all a favor and try something else. Sooooooooo sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely Worth The Buy!","review":"This dvd is deffinately worth buying, I had originally downloaded all of the episodes and hadnt really even considered shelling out the money for the dvd, but when i saw just how many special features were included with the DVD i knew that I had to get it. All of the menus and segways between all of the menus are all done very very well, i was honestly very surprised with all of the time and effort that went into creating this masterpiece. This is deffinately a must have for any fan of metal, and even more so, any fan of the show, this dvd is amazing and i already cant wait for the second season on dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rating is about picture issues, not about show.","review":"The episodes on this set are great. This is a great show. I love it. Five stars.If you have a standard TV, you will have no problem with this set. If you have an HDTV, this is a frustrating DVD set. This is a 1:85 show. The show itself is shaped like your HDTV. It should fit the area of your screen exactly. Instead, your DVD player will either stretch it lengthwise with black bars on the top and bottom or it will have black on all four sides depending on your DVD player's settings. You can probably make your TV or DVD player zoom or stretch to make the picture fit your HDTV, but that's not how it should be.Perhaps they figured that the type of people who like Metalocalypse are broke metalhead idiots who can't afford nice TVs. Perhaps they're mostly justified in thinking that, but I'm still mad.Special features are underwhelming. No commentaries or behind-the-scenes. Fake interviews with the band are mildly funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"The OTHER Rock Music","review":"I don't like screaming as a \\"musical\\" style. So I didn't care for the music at all.

I shouldn't really have to say more but I'd love to anyway. I was channel surfing one night and came across the best show Adult Swim has to offer, and changed the channel. It was halfway through the episode and I didn't know what was going on. Later, a buddy of mine told me to watch it. We watched Dethwater and I was hooked. This show is great for any fan Metal fan or not. Now I have introduced to a lot of my friends. Even ones that can't stand heavy metal, and they can attest to the greatness of this show. Five friggin stars. Anyone, who's already a fan of Adult Swim shows, should have no problem getting quickly attached to this show.

I opened one of them. Right from the box it was very good. I labeled some black plastic items and then stored it tightly closed as advised on the carton (tip down). I opened the same marker 2 weeks after the first 20 seconds of usage and could hardly write a single letter. I don't know how many seconds would have the pen lasted on first usage.Now I am prepared and saved the second one for a single use."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"The idiots who designed this made it with no clip on the cap, which I need to carry it in my pocket.Probably designed in a third world country where they don't have pockets in what few clothes they own.It doesn't say where the product was actually made. About half of the package is in some foreign language, not English.Now I know not to buy Newell Rubbermaid products (who makes Sharpies)."},{"rating":"1","title":"When they work they work well...but they do not work","review":"With two of them, you would suppose that just maybe...one would work if the other is used a bit and peters out. That is not the case. They really are pretty much a single usage item. The vivid color remains for a very short duration...and it is virtually impossible to use them on anything but craft papers...such as for a poster touch up. If you try to mark anything that is at all porous...it goes dry. If you try to write on a hard surface, better get it correct fast, as it soon stops writing all together...and no amount of shaking, or waiting for it to revive, will make the slightest difference. Once it has made its' single line...it is all done functioning. Not only are they extremely short lived, but the quality of the lines it writes, also decrease with time...until there is a barely noticeable line at all. Not exactly a high quality product. Save your money. Generally I like my sharpies..but hate these...as they simply do not work at all well."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice silver color","review":"bought these to write the letters on my keyboard that somehow got scraped off the keys. the ink looks nice on the keyboard but the ink will get removed very quickly when you type so it does not work on a keyboard key. i might try to put nail polish on top of the ink to see if that protects the ink from fading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent twin to compliment the classic black markers","review":"These are just like the black markers you normally find in stores, except with a greyish-silver ink.

I found it on a discount bin in Wal-Mart. I didn't really know who he was. I was young when he was coaching. I wish I could watch him when he was coaching. He seems incredibly wise, much more than any other coach. Through his examples, several practical leadership and team work lesson and expounded upon. You don't really need to be a fan of college basketball, or sports, to enjoy and glean some wisdom from this man. I am not much of a fan of basketball, but this book made it much more interesting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I use this book in my professional development workshops!","review":"My husband introduced me to this book. He is a huge Carolina basketball fan, but as he read the book, he realized the business perspective would be helpful to me. He began reading passages here and there from the book out loud to me. It only took a few passages for me to realize I had to read the entire book. Now, I take the book to every training class I lead and use some passage as an example to what we discuss in training. The business perspective is insightful, however, the most helpful part of the book is Dean Smith's sports perspective. Everyone can understand and appreciate a sports perspective when they may not be able to relate to a business perspective. This book makes it easy to get a point across to everyone in the class.I highly recommend this book for sports fans, Caorlina fans, Dean Smith fans, as well as entrepreneurs and business owners."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dean Smith Way!...","review":"Dean Smith is a great leader. He has won hundreds of games over the years and has accumulated many trophies that prove his worth as a coach. Great! I got that out of the way.The Carolina Way should have been called the Dean Smith way. I believe that he would have been successful in almost any profession. He didn't try to win basketball games. He mastered the process that led to winning.There are many coaches understand basketball X's and O's. Unlike Dean, some successful coaches walk around like they invented the basketball. The difference between Dean Smith and most coaches is his focus on working hard, working smart, and working together. Mastering these traits will help you become successful not matter what you do in life.Who said nice guys always finish last?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a tough book to put down","review":"I'm biased because I'm a basketball fan, a Tar Heel fan, and a big admirer of Dean Smith, but this is one of the 2 or 3 best books I've read in the past 10 years. The entertainment value of the book is very high, especially if you love the game of basketball. Additionally, There are valuable lessons in leadership for coaches to be learned in this book, regardless of the sport one coaches. One of the primary goals of the book is to take Coach Smith's philosophies as they apply to basketball teams and, with the help of Dr. Gerald Bell, with whom he co-wrote the book, to transfer them to business \\"teams\\" for leaders in business. Most of those principles are easy to transfer, but some of them can be a bit of a stretch. Regardless, it's a great book. I give it the highest recommendations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best carbide sharpener for axes!","review":"I have several of these from different vendors - this is the only one that will fit the wider blades of an axe.

In the end if your looking for the best pod album then check out Sattelite, because brown doesn't deliver."},{"rating":"2","title":"P.O.D At It's Best","review":"Contrary to what others have said about this album, I hold that this is their most unique and creative. Let me start off by saying that this record is pretty indy. It dosen't have all the extra production effects of \\"Southtown\\" or \\"Satellite\\", but it does make up for it in it's innovative approach. Every song is done with a passion and intensity. Sonny make's your heart bleed on tracks like \\"Full Color\\" which is about his mother dying. Wuv and Traa demonstrate why they have one of the best ryhtm sections in heavy music as they chug along like a tank on speed. \\"Visions\\" and \\"Selah\\" are two of the best songs P.O.D.'s ever made. If you were let down by \\"Payable On Death\\" go old school and buy the record that made P.O.D. an underground establishment."},{"rating":"2","title":"EASILY THE BEST P.O.D.

The orginal brown had a raw feel to it. A real Feel. This was done by some hacky producers who felt the old one didn't sound as good as the new one. The orginal version of Selah is one the best Hardcore/Rapcore songs ever. The oginal vocal was rough and mixed into the music. The new one sounds like a computer processor.

SELAH is definitely their best video!! sonny is so in your face with the video! But this cd is just packed with true hard rock and hip hop that harkens back to the G-thang days!! my fave songs are Know me, selah, visions, punks rock(I WANT MY FRENCH FRIES!!), breathe babylon(the beginning guitar riffing almost sounds like fear factory), brown, preach, full color, and live and die!! the messages are just excellent, can't describe the messages off hand, but i just love the raw hardcore sound in the music!! and Sonny's rapping is amazing and so not Uncool!!! he's dope yo! if your a POD fan or a rap/rock fan you MUST OWN THIS CD!!

Actually when I say based, I actually mean Loosely based/influenced by. I remember seeing TSF in the theatre as a kid, & thinking it was kinda cheesy. I'll pick it up 'cause I'm curious to see it as an adult. They also produced an (awful/inaccurate) TV movie not long after List was caught, after being on the lam for about 17 years. List was played by actor Robert Blake, ironically. David Caruso (CSI ?) played chief Moran who actually hired me in my law enforcement career. I read recently that the producers of the original film were surprised at how close some of their scenes/story lines, came to pass when List was finally apprehended long after the film was released.

Terry O'Quinn (unknown at the time) gives a chilling and comical performance as the title character in this low budget, but effective chiller. The movie score is like a bad 80's TV movie and the acting is a little stiff at times, but overall this film is very entertaining and quick paced. The blood and gore are dialed back a bit, but it is handled well and is effective. Overall this is a decent horror thriller from the time period and is a lot of fun, especially watching O'Quinn in his unnerving and cheesey performance as \\"The Stepfather! ......remember \\"Father Knows Best\\"!The DVD has a nice clean transfer and there is a commentary and a new feature-ette with some of the cast including Jill Schoelen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice to have on Blu Ray","review":"Not bad on Blu ray for a 1987 movie.

The white lion in the film was real and not CG which was also cool. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is because of two reasons. One, the narater has such a strong Afracan accent that I can't understand a word he says without putting the DVD subtitles on. Two, they could have added a little bit more of a plot.

His letters are passionate in their admiration and merciless in their scorn and never anything less than fascinating. It is never far from reach and Ican and do turn to any page at any time and\\"The Proud Highway\\" NEVER fails to be at once thought provoking, entertaining, amusing and inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply awesome!","review":"This is a must for every wannabe author. This is not simply for the diehard HST fan. The author speaks to everybody but for those born before 1964 it is particularly poignant, a real coming-of-age story. If this had been fiction, it would not have been published because it would have simply been too outrageous to accept. I'm sure in this case 90% of it is true, but only HST would know for sure -- and even he probably forgets much of it. (If you can remember the 1960's, you weren't there.)The softback copy has a great feel and look to it, the paper and the font.

They are all wildly original, fearless, brilliant, and (above all) LOL funny. Proud Highway is a fascinating read because it shows the evolution of HST's genius, from teenager through his maturation as a writer. You can see from the razor sharp, revealing letters the trials, tribulations, sacrifice, and hard work that transformed Thompson into the legendary, \\"gonzo\\" journalist he was. Despite his talent and humor, years of fear and loathing must have finally gotten to him. Rest in peace, Raoul Duke.

Instead, I found a story so boring and so convoluted with unnecessary backtracking that I found I could skip pages and not miss a beat on the main story line.The final epic battle is so vague and muddied up that I'm still not clear on what happened.

From her father, Rae inherited the power of transmutation, which comes in very handy once she has been kidnapped by a gang of vampires. The vampires that kidnap Rae bring her to a vampire named Constantine as \\"dinner\\". Constantine is their prisoner as well. Rae and Constantine form an unlikely bond to break free from their captors and overcome the darkness that haunts them both.I really enjoyed \\"Sunshine\\" but I was still very let-down by it. I had been wanting to read this novel for quite some time and then when I finally did, I was disappointed. There was entirely too much monologue and virtually not action. McKinley tended to be a bit too wordy at times. I have heard that as the chief complaint of others who have read this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be 1/2 as long","review":"The book has many interesting concepts, but would be much more enjoyable if it was 1/2 as long.

The book itself was almost perfect, with realistic characters and a vampire who isn't straight out of an Anne Rice novel, all beautiful and perfect. The relationships between the characters are human, flawed, and real. And leave you wanting to know more about the people involved.While McKinley does leave a lot of room open for a sequel, and leaves a lot of strings untied, i find that rather refreshing as that's how things are in reality. Things don't end on rosey clouds with the reader knowing everything.The book left me starving for more, but satisfied in ways that most books don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my favorite book","review":"It is saying something, for a reader to call any book their favorite... but here it is. This is the book you can read a hundred times over, till the corners are smooth and all color is worn away. This is the book you loan out so many times you have several copies.McKinley can write, really write. In that way that makes you mash your teeth and sometimes curse at her slow pace in which she writes new books.I have such appreciation for her style, because she lets the reader think and imagine. Novel concepts for many current published authors.Her characters are human and flawed in ways that make them perfect...even if they need sunshine or blood.I don't like science fiction, fantasy, ect... books.I love a great story written well, that has the elements of magic, myth and lore.No book ever recommned has ever come close to this.\\"Pretty much perfect\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"5+ stars","review":"I usually re-read this book every two years or so.

I am hoping this is the start of a series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Sunshine, but not much else","review":"Disappointing is how I would phrase it. A rather rambling and disjointed tale of vampires in a futuristic world that you only get glimpses of from the ongoing chatter of the main character. There is no prologe to tell you how the world got that way, or why vampires and goblins abound in this vaguely outlined world. While the idea of the storyline has potential merrit, I found myself feeling slightly confused and left dangling by the ending. Not anywhere near to Robin's usual standard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough Con!","review":"Over all...The book was okay. After reading some reviews, I thought this was going to be the next great vampire book. Eegad! It had it's moments to be great and then those moments fizzled out. I felt that there were too many darn cinnamon rolls and not enough Constantine! I might as well have read the rundown on Bubba's (Forest Gump) shrimp recipes. A little more interaction with her new Vampire \\"friend\\" would have kicked this story up a notch or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"When a heroine just can't stop talking","review":"Robin McKinley is among my favorite authors. Sunshine, however, just isn't at the level of McKinley's previous books. The irritating heroine kept talking, on and on and on. And not just talking - angst-ridden talking. While parts of the story were gripping, too often I wanted to scream at the heroine to shut up. But I continued to read, because there seemed to be such an accummulation of rich stories behind the talking. Unfortunately, few of the stories were ever resolved.Despite these flaws, I was engrossed in the book (enough to want to scream at the heroine, after all). I would definitely read a sequel, if only to discover more of Sunshine's family (although the bakery could be bombed with my blessing), more of Constantine's story, who on earth their great enemy was, and more of the stories behind the secondary characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"I now know what it feels like to have blue balls","review":"In this volume McKinley crafts an amazing world, slowly immersing us into this original creation of hers with all sorts of mind-blowing reveals happening in the last fifth of the book. It's a true masterpiece of a first book in a series...But there is no series.The book just ends.I feel like McKinley had an acute onset of performance anxiety which prevented her from continuing this epic story in a fantastical world with all these fascinating characters, and that ruins the entire book for me. She's adamant on her website that there will be no continuation and she's tired of people asking for that, and she has a ban on anyone continuing the story on their own. I can understand not wanting fanfiction written, but it almost feels as though McKinley is being a spoiled five year old who grabs all her toys and announces she's going home.Don't bother reading this book, it'll just leave you feeling unfulfilled and cranky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much talk, not enough action","review":"This book seemed promising. It got right to the action in the begining and it was suspenseful. But once that bit of the story was over with, it slowed way down. About two hundred pages were filled with pointless yapping and I had to force myself to keep reading by thinking ok, it's going to get interesting soon. Alright, any time now. My hopes were in vain. The climax was way too short and the evil character that Rae was trying to protect herself against was beaten quickly and easily. I didn't even know the main character's name for the first half of the book. Waste of time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not typical","review":"I don't read much vampire lit in general - I picked this up because it was McKinley, and because it looked like a new direction for her.Once I started reading I didn't want to put it down. The book's world is enough like ours to be recognizable but is obviously futuristic. Sunshine is young, doesn't know herself very well yet, and has so far had a pretty narrow and sheltered life focused entirely on the family business. As she's drawn into the world of \\"Others\\" (vampires among them) she begins to see that people are much more complex than might appear from the surface, including herself.It might be a more adult-oriented book but the coming-of-age theme is predominant. Sunshine learns a lot about herself, but at the end of the book still has a lot to discover about the people around her. I felt like the ending was left open for a sequel, which I'd gladly read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stick with it","review":"This is my first Robin McKinley novel. The story is great. Unfortunately you have to wade through a lot of peripheral stuff (for lack of a better word) to get to the story. However, the story is worth the work. I will probably pick up other Robin McKinley books and continue to push on to the great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spartan!","review":"I've always loved the way Robin McKinley writes, and this book was lots of fun. It's very different, in style and setting, from her other books, and it's enjoyable to watch a writer develop. I liked the characters and the story, and the new slang she invented, and it's fun to guess at the resolution of the loose ends she -- quite deliberately -- left hanging. Will there be a sequel? That'd be nice, but she doesn't usually write them. That's not bad, it means the reader gets to use his imagination too."},{"rating":"1","title":"exasperated","review":"I couldn't even finish this book! This first part had me. I liked the way the story was going. It was different from others in this same genre. After that forget it. Not a lot of action. Just a lot of Sunshine's thoughts. On and on and on. I really did try to like it. I kept thinking it was going to DO something. It didn't. The story has potential. It just needs to be edited better. Take out all the details that have nothing to do with the story.I can not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"i hate it","review":"where to being... this book was so bad overall the character sunshine drove me crazy with all her whining and denial i hate weak willed people in my books. Even more then that i love a little back story but this was too much and the writing style was too much for me i guess i can truthful say that this book has made me hate first person. the people who read this book and loved it must have read a different one then me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever...","review":"I've never read this author before, but I have read a lot of vampire fiction. And while she is a better author that Anne Rice, this book didn't sweep me off my feet like I hoped it might. Too much plot, too many character and no sympathy for anyone.There is some good stuff here. Alternate universe detail, interesting magic that felt like reality, and I really, really want one of those cinnamon rolls. But in the end, too frustrating to want to own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ramblings","review":"This could have been a good short story. 80% was filler and ramblings. If you like this type of book read jeanine frost halfway to the grave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Slow Read","review":"It was okay but for me it had way too much detail. I was so confused sometimes about what sunshine was talking about or who was talking for that matter. Also, I didn't finish the book. That is very unusual for me because I always finish the book I am reading unless it is just not interesting. I would have to say this book just wasn't holding my interest. I am sure this author is awesome but this book was nothing like I expected. It was too slow and not very exciting. For a very good vampire read, try Charlaine Harris's series. Those books are awesome. I can't wait until the next one comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Departure from the Norm","review":"Even for die-hard McKinley fans, this is a book you either love or hate. We're all used to her great fantasy books and her retold fairy tales, which is why this venture into sci-fi seems so...drastic.I wasn't so sure at first that I would like Sunshine, but I quickly found that I couldn't put it down. The story draws you in, and her quirky characters and unique style adds to it. True, \\"Beauty and the Vampire\\" has been done before, but never quite like this. This vampire isn't bad-boy or sexy, at least not in the traditional way. This romance isn't anything out of fairy tales, that's for sure.So yes, it takes some getting used to. But if you've read McKinley before you'll recognize her style, and of course, her uniqueness. In the end I was left wanting more, and that's a sure sign of a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Chocolate (and not really a vampire book)","review":"I should say from the start that I do believe Robin McKinley could rewrite the dictionary and it would be interesting, so I'm biased. I have good reason to be biased. McKinley's skills as a storyteller, as a writer, as a voice for her characters and her worlds is unparallelled.Sunshine is not a book about vampires. They are there and they are central to the story, but the book is so much more than that. The best part of the book is that afore mentioned voice. I am not usually a fan of first person storytelling, but Sunshine is full of wry wit and a self-deprecatingly quirky combination of realism, independence, and fancy. I applaud the author for going in a new (if slightly Buffyesque) direction.This book obviously isn't to everyone's taste, but the writing is still superb and I highly recommend it.If it helps, my personal list of Robin McKinley favourites is: The Hero & the Crown, The Blue Sword, Deerskin, and now in 4th place -- Sunshine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting at first, but then torture to finish","review":"I really loved the beginning of this book--the introduction to the vampires and Sunshine's special gift. But then the book got bogged down in endless repetition about making cinnamon rolls and how the main character just wanted a normal life. I got bored with Sunshine's self-pity and interior angst, which received far too much attention from the author. Storylines that were interesting to me (her father's family, her boyfriend's true nature) received scant exploration after the first 1/3 of the book. It took me three weeks to finish this book because of my boredom, but I kept slogging through, hoping it would get better. It didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly disappointed by my favorite author","review":"I loved parts of this book - when Sunshine first uses her powers, descriptions of the members of SOF, etc. - but parts made me grind my teeth. McKinley puts her readers through pages and pages of inner-monologue-type stuff from Sunshine, and goes on about her baked goods, and generally just...goes on. Perhaps McKinley's editor is becoming a little too lenient. This book should have been about half its length, and McKinley should have spent a little less time tracing the workings of Sunshine's brain and a little more on characters that fall flat (I'm thinking of Mel and Con). I don't regret reading it, because I'll walk a mile for Robin McKinley any day, but I am praying that her next book is better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but enough about the cinnamon rolls already!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. As a long time lover of vampire ficton I found the story very original and engaging. Rae is a strong and resourceful heroine and Con (her vampire friend, lover, protector, etc.) is fascinating. My only problem with the book was, as several other reviewers mentioned, the constant, annoying, irritating, endless repetition of the fact that Rae makes cinnamon rolls. Sometimes it got so bad I wanted to throw the book across the room but the great story kept me from using it as a projectile. Looking forward to more, hopefully cinnamon roll-less, novels from Robin McKinley."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of McKinley's best","review":"Being an avid McKinley fan, I expected this book to be as good as it is. Considerably darker than her other novels, but infused with light throughout. I enjoyed the sexual parts too. Not at all disturbing or weird; rather, spontaneous and HOT... made me wish for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robin McKinley = great author","review":"I love all her books. Bought this one for my sister, but may \\"borrow\\" it the way a friend \\"borrowed\\" mine a year or so back"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Typically a Vampire Fan","review":"I've never been a fan of vampire stories. And I was, admittedly, a little disappointed by the climax of this one--it was a little bit too much of what I was expecting, with not enough surprise or suspense. I felt that perhaps the loose ends could have been tied together more tightly. However, the likeable characters and the well-crafted storytelling made the book well worth my while, and perhaps a second read."},{"rating":"1","title":"ick...","review":"I picked up this book because I loved Robin McKinley's other books. However, this one was a disappointment. I got into it a little after the veeeeery tedious beginning where the narrator, Rae, talks about her coffee house for what felt like forever. After that it got a bit more exciting, but never really caught my attention. I kept waiting for the action to turn, but it never did. There was a final \\"battle\\" but it felt rather anticlimactic. However, I did like the setting, with all the description of the Voodoo Wars and the Others like Weres and Vampires, which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of just 1. All in all, rather disappointing though. I could barely finish it, and that hardly ever happens. My advice: read one of McKinley's other books like \\"The Blue Sword\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"I agree with the other reviewers in that this book rambled far too much with the heroine's inner monologue. I had to start skipping paragraphs then pages otherwise I would have stopped reading the book entirely. The plot is good, but the author does not do a good job at fleshing out the plot and there are entirely too many loose ends. I've never read any of her other books so cannot compare."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Mrs. McKinley... usually","review":"The idea was interesting, even though the \\"Look Inside\\" first pages were confusing, so I rented it from my local library. After all, how bad could it be? It was by Robin McKinley, after all. Ummm, let's just say, it wasn't worth borrowing? I couldn't really get into the book (much less, through it completely), much of Sunshine's inner monologue was babble and irritating after a while, and I don't know: I got the whole Buffy-Angel vibe, but Con was really not giving me a romantic vibe here. Just... be prepared and DO NOT judge Mrs. McKinley on this book! Try another- ANY other of her books- and you'll love them. Just hide this one.Btw: this review refers to the first edition copy of this book, hardback version. Is there much difference?"},{"rating":"1","title":"One random thought after another...","review":"I have read other books by Robin McKinley and enjoyed them very much but her writing style does take some getting used to. So at first I thought that my frustration was that I haven't read one of her books in a while and just needed to keep reading, but this book was so random. Sunshine is an interesting concept but the author rambles on and on and on about meaningless topics that really have nothing to do with anything! I kept finding myself thinking \\"what have I missed?\\" Well...Nothing she is just talking about random stuff again that hasnt been explained! UGH, Frustrating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldnt agree more with reviewer Tracy","review":"Look below for reviewer Tracy's review. I couldnt have agreed with her more. Sorry for the lack of originality but really, the book was tedious to the extreme."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed to say the least","review":"Sorry to say that I was very disappointed in this book... I really wanted to like it and by the end felt I had wasted my time. This could have been an amazing story but I feel it lacked the connection i so like to make with characters. Sunshine annoyed me to be quite honest and I found myself skimming though parts.I would not recommend buying try to find a copy at the local library if you are thinking about purchasing..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it, but...","review":"There were moments I didn't expect. I've been a fan for some time. Hero and the Crown was one of the first real fantasy books I had foisted upon me by a friend and sucked me into the genre. I've read most of her stuff and was surprised when I ran across this in the library. Had to bring it home and read it. For the most part, i really enjoyed it, but I was surprised at how graphic some of the sexual bits were. I had not been expecting that based on my other readings. And, while, sure, they are pretty tame compared to a lot of books out there, you might want to be warned before adding this one to your child's reading list.That said, I was left wanting a few questions answered that weren't, so perhaps it was left open for a sequel and maybe one day we'll get those answers."},{"rating":"2","title":"McKinley at Her Finest","review":"Wonderful book, perfectly written with characters you grow to care about. My only complaint is that it ends. For a bit of an older crowd than many of Mckinleys Novels but an amazing fantasy and it does not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"Wow, wow, wow.McKinley is a great writer, and some of her stuff is fantastic, but this is easily her masterpiece.Sunshine is an humble baker, a genius with chocolate and flour. She lives in a world ravaged by war - a war fought against the inhuman \`others'. The others are demons, werewolves, and especially vampires. These others stalk through the novel, teasingly out of sight, haunting the pages with their almost-presence. It's pure gold.Anyway, Sunshine gets into a spot of bother with the local insanely evil vampire gang, and this colours the rest of her actions in the novel. Without trying to spoil it to much, Constantine the Vampire is written with sympathetic skill, but you never ever forget the fact that he's an enemy who's happily drink the human race dry as a bone if he could do so safely.Read this book. It's absolutely FANTASIC. You'll never so much as think about Antia Blake ever again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such A Great Book","review":"This book explores not only what \\"could be\\" if wild magic existed in the world, but also human nature to try to accept the unacceptable and adapt. I was enthralled by this book from page one until the very end and keep it in my permanent bookshelf that never gets loaned out to friends but I do suggest that my friends buy it. If you read this book and really liked it, I recommend finding a copy of Stephenie Meyer's \\"Twilight\\" and her sequel \\"New Moon\\" that comes out in September."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly on of the most boring books I have finished","review":"Oh this book was a looong drawwwwwn out durge. There is so much babble and useless detail. Robin McKinley has a wonderful fan following but she let them down on this book. The only reason that I finished this book was because I was hoping that she was going to some how make it work. My devotion to the author got in the way of my common sense. I did like the Vampire Con. But isnt it sad when your best character and the draw of your book is dead?

But either way, lordy in a bucket. 'Sunshine', though the idea behind the storyline was intriguing, was mind-blowingly slow and the climax was, at best, nonexistant. The characters were not well developed, the writing skill overall was nothing if not elementary, the concepts were just too far fetched to even be mildly interesting, and I honestly don't give a crap about how many dollars are in a 'blink' or when money assumed the title of an unconscious bodily function. If you've read this book, I'm truly sorry... but if you haven't yet, heed my word! Spare yourself from this painstakingly boring read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Road to Nothing","review":"This book had great potential. I ate up every word of it even despite some of the cheesiness, but then at the end... Nothing. Absolutely nothing. The book felt entirely unfinished. There were so very many loose ends left that I was certain I just needed to go out and find the sequel, but there was no sequel even on the drawing table. If you want a complete novel, look somewhere else. I REFUSE to recommend this book to anyone, anyone at all.

(May contain Spoilers)","review":"I'm a huge fan of Robin McKinley, I love her books especially \\"Beauty\\" and \\"RoseDaughter\\". I thought Sunshine was going to be fun and very romantic but it turns out to be a joke. Sunshine is the worst heroine I ever read about. She complains and talks too much! The plot and the story guide is very weak. I hate having to read several long pages about Sunshine's personal life and blah blah stuff. Where's the action? Nope, just some stupid gurile girl stuff. If you are looking for a real Girl/Vampire romances, don't buy this book!!! Oh, and the vampire guy Con, he's not hansome but a smelly vampire. Oops!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Robin McKinley's worst book.","review":"I have read all of Robin McKinley's books and this is the absolute worst. I have enjoyed most of her books and while I found this book to be as readable as the others I found the content to be very offensive. The main character can't seem to keep her clothes on and jumps between lovers like they are the flavor of the day. Also, the reader is left hanging at the end of the book. It is almost like Robin got tired of writing and just decided to put down her pen without connecting the lose ends. The main character in this book should be named something besides Sunshine (Buffy perhaps?) since she is as evil the vampires she battles against."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left me wanting cinnamon rolls!","review":"The more I read this book, the more I loved it. Actually, I've read this story twice and am left wanting more. Sunshine is a reluctant character struggling to survive at life as so many people do in their 20's. It's a great story with a unique view of the vampire and witch myths. I hope there's another to follow with these unforgettable characters!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh okay","review":"Robin Mickinley's novel about vampire is alright at best. I have read her other workn and have been greatly impressed with them. As for Sunshine eh it was alright, i guess. The concept of vampires is interesting and I was surprised at times. Mostly the story was borring. A book about vampires, and it was borning, that's a little rough. I skimmed through page after page of useless details and never ending back story. It was interesting enough to read but only to see how everything works out at the end. But the part I was holding out for. the ending was terrible. I finished the book feeling confused and unresolved. I was simply unimpressed. If your want to get your kicks with a vampire read Dracula instead, this was just unsatisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointed.","review":"The story idea was good, and could have been made into a fantastic tale. I felt a little dropped into the middle of Sunshine's world. There was very little explanation of a back story, or of the characters. Basically the book was full of holes. I kept finding myself re-reading parts thinking that I must have missed something because she just wonders off in the story. I would like to have seen a little more commitment to the relationship between Sunshine and Con. It's almost like she was toying with an idea but couldn't make up her mind how she really wanted it to go. It was basically an interesting read, but wouldn't read more than once.Sunshine"},{"rating":"2","title":"a unique and wonderful book","review":"This story is described in other reviews.

I read \\"Sunshine\\" all in one sitting; I will admit it captures the attention. I was not totally impressed with it...it just didn't compare to previous favorites (\\"The Blue Sword\\", etc.) My particular peeve with this book was the lack of ending...I mean, what happens? Did she and Con become romantically linked? who was Mel REALLY? where did the grandmother go? was mom partblood or what? WHAT HAPPENED?!? That ruined it for me. I like the end of a book to be all wrapped up so that I can close the book with a nice, fat, contented, sigh...not the case here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promise unfulfilled","review":"Though I generally love Robin McKinley, I fear this novel didn't live up to my expectations. As far as adult-type novels go, McKinley's Deerskin did a much better job of exploring some of the darker themes behind maturity and independence and growth. While Sunshine had to its advantage an interesting world to explore and the potential for interesting characters (especially in both Mel and Con), it failed to fully develop either its characters, setting, or plot. One cannot help but think how much better this book could have been ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"This book was booooring. It could have been so good but McKinley spent too much time prattling on about useless information.

Don't waste your time , I almost didn't finish this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I brought this book based on several recommendations. I admit that I didn't read much of it before I gave up - only the first 30 pages - so perhaps I am not the most reliable of reviewers, but this book was so much of a letdown for me that I could not stomach another word (or mention of the dreaded \\"cinammon rolls\\").My issue with it was that the narrative felt rambling and disorganized. In a scene where the main character has her first meeting with the vampires, the narrative gets so wrapped up in her talking about the past that I could barely follow what was going on. At a pivotal scene such as this, I expected much better writing. Since the author failed to deliver, I felt it not worth my time or effort to keep on reading. Getting even this far in the book was a struggle and a chore for me. I was bored and did not feel any interest for the main character and her obsession with baking. The other characters felt like filler, and the world as a whole was difficult to visualize."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many questions went unanswered","review":"I really thought I would like Sunshine, it had so much potential. But the story was erratic with no real ending. I found it was not a satisfying read at all. I had a hard time trying to finish it because it was slow and boring.

Simply put, I loved this book and hope for a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rich taste of . . . cinnamon and blood","review":"I have read many fictional and nonfictional (folklore) stories on vampires and vampirism. I found this to be a wonderful book to read. McKinley's writing is always lush and captivating. She doesn't just write one action sequence after another; she writes of the world in which the action takes place and where consequences are complicated. The pace tends to be a bit slower than most modern reads, but my feeling is why rush a good thing. I know that McKinley doesn't tend to do sequels, but I really hope she is planning one or more for this novel because I want to know more about Sunshine, Con, Mel, Sunshine's Grandmother, her mother, and almost everyone else who was providing Sunshine with her \\"moral/spititual\\" support."},{"rating":"2","title":"different and wow .","review":"completely unexpexted. i have definitely had trouble putting it down. not for everyone. read some reviews, come to your own conclusions and pick it up if it sounds like it appeals to you. not your average vampire/werewolf/demon book. has tons more substance and literary wit than most with similar subject mattee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this Book but left wondering","review":"I love this book. Sunshine's voice is one that I can relate to and I think many will might agree they can relate to her too. Her whole shaking in her boots, confusion over how to express her emotions and her lack of communication with those around her, when it's really not easy- These are all great traits of this books. McKinley has her own way of telling a story and does involve lots of character inflections (See Beauty by her). Perhaps a little longer then desired for some but personally it is one of the things that I love about this book.I hope you enjoy this unique version of \`Beauty and the Vampire plus a handsome motorcycle prince and maybe wizard' tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relish this one","review":"I normally devour books about vampires.

But then, I have a running commentary in my head as well. I found it interesting and funny how her mind would run sometimes and really loved the tone. Sunshine probably isn't for everyone, but, it really is nice to see Robin McKinley writing with different styles. I always like what she writes and I've no intention of telling her how to do it. Except to maybe write faster. My husband describes her books like \\"crack\\". : )"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for those who want explanation or closure","review":"Everything is left hanging at the end.

McKinley works with words and atmosphere, allowing the narrative voice to develop almost as a character on its own.You aren't going to see huge clusters of quotation marks dotting the pages - McKinley is interested in the inner life of her characters, and what interests her is what is going to appear in the novels.And this novel is a lovely balance of character, plot, and Dickensian description."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty near perfect","review":"I am an avid reader and author of adult and children's fantasy and sci fi books. This is one of McKinley's best, and that is saying a lot. It is just about perfect. If you hate the Eclipse series, and you aren't into mindless bodice rippers with a vampire thrown in for non-originality, you should really LIKE this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"not your typical vampire novel","review":"If you've read other McKinley novels, I'm sure you've realized that she doesn't take the normal turn with any of them. Sunshine is another type of twist where we take a post-apocalyptic world and set loose fantasy creatures and magic usually hiding from normal sight. Only here, they're a part of every day life...if not quite fully accepted. It's the vampires though that are always a little off, a little out of the ordinary. If you're taken by them, you are pretty much dead. Until Sunshine.While it takes a while to get to the meat of the story, the background information and everything leading up to it is important. And once you get to it, you can't put this down. For those needing a touch of dark fantasy and needing a break from the violence usually so popular in them, pick this up. It has battles, but not too graphic; love but not too bodice-ripping; and a plot with enough twists to keep you enthralled"},{"rating":"1","title":"Burdened with excessive inner monologue","review":"I really wanted to like this book. The storyline was interesting and the character development was fine. I didn't even have a problem with the first person narrative as some readers do. The problem I do have is the rambling inner monologue that is simply never ending! I am halfway through the book and am now so frustrated by the monologue that I just can't bring myself to finish reading it.Also, the author's use of analogies and similies is all over the map and mostly nonsensical. I spent so much time attempting to figure out the point she was trying to make. After a while I realized that my mind started wandering while I was reading the endless monologues so I figured there was no point in reading any further.Sadly, this book had promise but I will not be coming back for seconds."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE!!!!","review":"This cd \\"Fix it Jesus\\" is not the cd I thought it to be.

Since the same illustrator actually did the cover, it seems like a very unfortunate editorial decision to not create a full color picture book! When I first received \\"The Tree of Life\\", I actually thought there had been some sort of printing error. The unfortunate blue-purple color reminds me of old mimeograph sheets.

I have enjoyed those two a lot (especially 'N Sync), so ZOEgirl has been an awesome addition to my collection!These three beautiful girls have amazing voices. Every song on this album, they wrote/co-wrote and I find that extremely impressive as well.Stand-out tracks include \\"I Believe,\\" \\"Stop Right There,\\" \\"No You,\\" among many others. For fans of the awesome sound of 'N Sync or other pop groups like STEPS, songs you would enjoy are \\"I Believe,\\" \\"Suddenly,\\" and \\"Upside Down.\\"All in all, this album is one of the best in my collection.

Try, for instance, Rachel Lampa, or Aurora.Maybe I just don't like girl bands as much as I don't like boy bands (I prefer 1 person to sing pop and/or r&b instead of a group).Technically thats what this is: a modern girlband. Less hip/hop and more of a light bubblegum pop. A toned down , Christian \\"backstreet girls\\".I don't like it, if this is your style - go for it.

The program was great, although, I have the same critique that I remember reading. The male and the female speakers frequently pronounce words quite differently, and in close promimity to a lesson to pronounce it a different way. Also, it seems at times that they spend an inordinate amount of time on simple phrases, and gloss over some more difficult ones.

He's definitely my favorite author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I rarely write reviews but this book left me shaking my head. I enjoyed the initial set up with Rena and her husband. The romantic/spiritual subplot seemed contrived and disconnected to the basic plot, until the end of course when the God guy saves the day...with a couple of 30 minute sessions.I was hoping that Alex would begin to sense something was wrong and she would be forced to reevaluate her biases. But no luck.As I approached the final 10 pages of the book, with no twist in sight, I began to smell an overly simplistic, rushed conclusion...and that's what I got. Oh well. I did enjoy The List."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too manipulative for me","review":"Rena's plan to achieve security by killing her rich young husband Baxter is foiled by his survival, even though he is comatose. So she tries to win lawyer Alex to her side in the fight to pull the plug on Baxter and make her a rich widow.I barely made it halfway through this book before giving up. Although Whitlow tries to make Rena a sympathetic character by exposing her life as an abused child, she still comes across as a self-obsessed manipulator. Her determination to kill Baxter off was intolerable, and her ability to exploit Alex's assumption that the woman is always the innocent victim showed how even a brilliant woman can be stupid.

It took me a couple of chapters to get into the book (but they are included below, so why not get those out of the way now, haha) but once I did, I couldn't put it down! There were twists and turns that I wasn't able to figure out where it was going to take me, which is not usually the case. In most other books I have read, I knew exactly where the author was taking me, and it was quite different here. This book hits on two of my favorite things, law and medicine, medical law if you will.

However, Lindale does now have that knowledge, the audience however does. The book is a page turner. One keeps expecting the cat to be let out of the bag. The book flowed well and the depth of the characters made you imagine them in your head.

The tale centers on the evolution of a southern laywer and her quest for a life she can claim on her own terms. Through the twists and tangles of the big law firm life, she comes into contact with an emotionally disturbed woman who will change her future plans and all she had worked for.One character has spent her life on the surface, looking for the answers to life in her work, while the other has lived in the dark, frightening place of anger and survival. In the middle is the story of family and the complexity of love and money.Robert Whitlow has woven this tale so tightly that it takes more than one book to pick the threads apart. He grabs his reader in the first chapter with an amazing plot twist before you can settle into your easy chair. He has certainly earned his reputation as the \\"John Grisham of the Christian market\\" (Publishers Weekly)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just What I Needed","review":"This is the first Robert Whitlow book that I have read. I'm so pleased. The spiritual tidbits that were just for me at the time I needed them were amazing. I had to keep going back to read them.

It was the first time I have ever heard anyone describe it. The whole paragraph was beautiful and became holy.The plot is great. Another 4 1/2 hours of sleep night because I could not put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping till the last page","review":"Robert Whitlow has written maybe his best book. The plot thickens from the first page, and, indeed, is still thick on the last.The characters are believable and genuine, and the twists and turns in their relationships sometimes are not at all predictable.The number of major characters is limited so the story is easy to keep up with, but the one major character is not obvious until the last line of the last page.A great story with an unmistakable Christian message woven into the fabric.

I won't say more about that. What impressed me is the sustained elegance and tension in depicting the conflict between those Irishmen wanting to serve in the war, as loyal subjects to the crown, and those whose anti-English passions were aroused by the Easter 1916 rebellion. In short, this book is Ireland's great WWI novel. I can't imagine it's being outdone.

She always sold-out the club. Even in one of New York's worst blizzards the people were lined up around the block. In a recent profile on Miss Lee for NPR radio her daughter Nicki remembered \\"... the city was shut down. We didn't think anyone would be there, but they came on foot, on sleds, by horse drawn carriage!\\". Such was the drawing power of Peggy Lee. This CD captures her at her \\"live\\" best! Every song is a gem. Highlights include: \\"Moments Like This\\", \\"But Beautiful\\", \\"I Got A Man Now\\" (a lesson in how to really SWING!) and of course \\"FEVER!\\". My personal favorite is \\"I Love Being Here With You\\" ... Peggy wrote the lyrics and it was her opening number for many years. This CD is a MUST HAVE.

I live in SoCal and have experience with the Monterey Formation and other time contemporaneous formations. This book is nothing less than the biography of a rock formation and the most thorough book I've seen written about one rock formation. This book is not for the casual browser. If you haven't had at least Geo 101, stay away. My main complaint is with the price. I know this book has a limited audience and the company is probably charging what the market will bear, but how about a bigger break on the paperback edition.

The only minor thing that bothers me about this single is the live version of \\"Bringin' on the Heartbreak.\\" It doesn't seem to me like it is actually a live performance -- just the album version of the song with audience noises blended in. But, nonetheless, the song is still superb.I recommend buying this single for the remix of \\"Through The Rain\\" and also purchasing \\"Charmbracelet.\\" Two great buys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"This is not one of her best CD singles. Reason? Well, generally Mariah re-records all her remixes, and the Hex Hector/Quayle remix of TTR is just a background covering her voice. It sounds very \\"cheesy\\", unlike her previous club remixes, such as \\"My All\\", \\"Always Be My Baby\\", and Heartbreaker\\". The third track is a live version of \\"Brigin' On the Heartbreak\\". ...but what would have really been worth the money is some good remixes of a maxi single of TTR like her previous singles in the past.

I think that the reason for this is that Joyce's work is, indeed, so rich and allusory that a full-length treatment like this is demanded. Ulysses is to the novel what Jorge Borges's short stories are to that literary art form.By the way, 12 years ago I took a college course on Joyce and spent seven weeks of the twelve-week semester on Ulysses alone. Believe me, that wasn't nearly enough time. Yet, the presense of a knowledgeable mentor was invaluable in understanding this wonderful novel.Stuart is the next best thing to having such a person nearby, but be forewarned--you will still need all of your analytical skills. Ulysses is a complete education, and as such entails a lifetime journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth My Time","review":"Note: Sorry, people, I mistakenly thought I was reviewing the novel itself, not a study of the novel. Read my review anyway, as you will be interested in my opinion of the novel. Thank you.I had been wanting to read this classic for years. Finally I began it, read 100 pages, and put it down. My impression: the character's internal monologue, which comprised the first 100 pages, at least, was a thing where the character was responding to the world around him with all of these smart and clever thoughts, with many literary allusions. It amounted to Joyce showing off--saying, look at how smart I am, look at how interesting my character's mind is. Wow! Aren't you impressed? It didn't captivate me, it just became annoying. This is a sacred cow of literature, it feels good to go against the grain and dislike it. Others feel they are supposed to like this book because it is considered great.

I was expecting something that we could plug in that would have a cooling element of some nature. All this does is spin the bottle over ice. Then, you have to clean it up when it is done and dry it out. What a pain. It is very clunky when spinning a bottle of wine too. Makes a lot of noise.

The tale is gripping, the protagonist engaging, and the wordiness comic enough to keep most readers entertained.My only gripe is the lack of attention to detail. It is obvious that the work was completed over time, and Dumas forgot some of the things he'd already written, inserting them again at a later point but completely out of their original context (for example, the promotion in Ch.28). Things of this nature pop up throughout the novel, and unfortunately draw the reader OUT of the world in which they are, until then, successfully immersed.Gripes aside, however, the novel is a definite classic and will forever remain, I am sure, one of my favourite pieces of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute rubbish","review":"I can hardly think of a worse book than this. It is extremely dated and the pace is turgid. More importantly to my mind, it was written by a man who fancied himself a historian, and in this and his \\"non-fiction\\" work he systematically and quite maliciously set about to trash the reputations of Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu. Unfortunately the fiction format helped him to reach a wide audience.

The Bantock-esque envelopes hidden throughout the book hold no surprises; only meaningless messages than cannot be considered enigmatic or beautiful by any stretch of the imagination.

Of all the other great tenor saxophonists around at his time, there are better ones who had far better saxophone tones: Coleman Hawkins, Ben Webster, Budd Johnson to name a few. These players had a warm sound. Young's tone was very weak and feeble sounding. He also didn't have that many good melodic ideas. His music simply does nothing for me.This is my honest assessment of him. It is only an opinion and should be taken as one. Nobody likes the same jazz musicians.

Also got to ride the very same Reisenrad where Lime and Cotten met.The \\"extras\\" on the DVD explain how digital technology was able to clean up the original film and shows many of these scenes. A truly great film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic!","review":"Graham Greene is the master. The movie was good enough, but the story is even better. Thrillers of this depth and complexity are virtually non-existant anymore. It was great to revisit this classic. The narration by Martin Jarvis is professionally rendered with Mr. Jarvis never once sounding as if he's reading a script or trying to perform a one-act play. Instead, he sounds every bit the weary, cynical, but very proper British policeman recounting a strange but true tale in post-war Vienna. Few narrators are this good. He really enhanced an already-crackling story."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"this is one of my favorite movies and i'm glad it's out on blu-ray. it has a great plot line (although a little complicated), really witty dialogue, and a great cast. if you are a robert downey jr. or val kilmer fan, i highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Commentarty","review":"The commentary, where the director and actors talk over the movie, in the extras, is better than the movie, and had me laughing out loud. Val Kilmer is a riot ! The movie isn't bad, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"kiss kiss bang bang","review":"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is the directorial debut of screenwriter Shane Black( of Lethal Weapon fame). A magical blending of noir, comedy, and action!Great image, strong detail on this HD DVD. Day and night scenes show strength of contrast. Colors are very bright, vivid, richly saturated and the image offers attractive flesh tones. The audio mix is pretty tight, with a surprising amount of surround effects for such a dialogue-heavy film.Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is definitely one of my favorite HD DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the funniest movies I've ever seen","review":"Downy Jr. before he was famous. Unique and rather amazing. It's ridiculously dirty and hilarious in a rather unique sort of way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry...but I was not amused","review":"As much as I want to jump on the bangwagon and praise how clever this movie is and wow look how they poke fun of all the action/thriller sterotypes...but I'm not too aware of many action thriller with gay private eyes and mumbling narrators. Silly me, I was actually trying to make sense of the story I was watching...which truley turned out to be a waste of time. Why? Because the movie audience has no idea about this mystery crimer writer that everyone in this movie holds in such high regard. And when the whole story unfolds-it does absolutely nothing for me. Downey and Monaghan have absolutely no chemistry. And Gay Perry made no sense to me-unless he was just there to solely feed the audience the plot. I laughed maybe once and then afterward forgot the joke I found amusing. Overall, it might be up your alley...it just wasn't up mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great cast - dissapointing movie","review":"I expected great things from this film considering the cast. I, however, was very disappointed; In fact I didn't watch it all the way through. I found the plot and style far too affected for my taste. This could have been a very funny movie, but the screenplay got in the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Clever By Half","review":"I love both Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer but I don't have a lot of positive things to say about this movie. I found it too talky and its plot was not believable. It was really hard for me to suspend my disbelief while watching it. None of the characters were endearing and it was a challenge to care about what happened to them. Also, in real life, there would be no chemistry between Downey's character and the female lead, Ms. Monaghan. Her history and the reprehensible manner in which she treats him would preclude his devotion (unless he was a complete masochist). Further, and to my disappointment as I'm an extremely politically incorrect person, I found all the gay jokes about Kilmer's Perry obtuse. I really don't think anyone cares about that stuff much in this day and age. Overall, the interactions are too clever by half, and Downey's narration is a bore. Most of what's supposed to be funny...is not--a waste of time in my view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged","review":"This DVD was rated to be in excellent condition, but the cover was badly damaged and almost unreadable. Avoid this seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang","review":"I really like both Actors in this movie, that's why I bought it...BUT the story line...NO COULD NOT AND WOULD NOT WATCH...QUIT AFTER 10-15 MIN."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anxious mess","review":"It is easy to appreciate that Shane Black has made some of the classic action genre movies and was playing off that in KKBB. However, I found myself pretty much hating the manic tone, the sheer stupidity of the characters, and the constant breaking of the narrative to speak directly at the audience. One reviewer stated Black threw everything but the kitchen sink in and that hits the mark perfectly. It was a contrived plot that forced serendipity where it shouldn't occur.Val Kilmer's character was under used, forcing the audience to spend far too much time with the least interesting member of the cast. Some people might like this movie as I can tell from the reviews, but to me, I found myself fast forwarding through sections that were painful to watch.Watch LA Confidential, The usual Suspects or Snatch if you want a hard hitting mystery/drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gay detective and an actor, say no more!","review":"Very slickly produced big budget crime movie that oozeswith a knowingly quirky style.Some cool acting from Downey, Kilmer. Quite funny in parts with witty one-liners.The final half of movie becomes disappointley conventional and the movie ends up feeling a little too smug for its own good.It's a hollow but then again fun ride, what more do you want?A DVD worth a spin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor","review":"didnt like movie, dragged on and on, not enough action, just was not what i expected, would not recamend movie to anybody"},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD","review":"Excellent movie, comedy with wit. Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer are excellent together. Michelle Monaghan steals every scene she is in, an oscar worthy performance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First-rate...something","review":"Shane Black (Lethal Weapon, Last Boy Scout) is one of the smartest writers in the action genre, and in this, his debut as a director, he knocks it out of the park. It's the perfect example of what you might call post-post-modernism: thoroughly aware of what it is (silly intrigue-laden romantic buddy thriller), and kidding about it, but in the end it turns out to be a pretty effective example.But I digress. Robert Downey Jr. is very well used, Val Kilmer is a great foil, Michelle Monaghan is the heart-melting love interest, and the photography, for a low-budget film, is luscious. I expect to be watching Kiss Kiss Bang Bang many more times just for the pleasure of spending more hours in the company of these characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Funny (w/some Black Humor thrown in)","review":"Outstanding flick! Hilarious, fast-paced, roller-coaster ride of a whodunnit. Great story that keeps you guessing! Downey, Kilmer and Monaghan are TERRIFIC!On a \\"Day of Reckoning\\" note: Different people like different things. Whether you do, or whether you don't, like a movie, GIVE your opinion and tell us why. Fine. But don't be delusional enough to believe you have the authority to include, in your review, that anybody who disagrees with your opinion is an idiot--I'm talking to you, California one-star from 11 Nov 06. Anyone who does what you did is just being a douche bag. And that's not me judging--I'm stating a fact. Don't waste time gettin' mad--just be cool and remember nobody has a monopoly on wisdom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh, Sexy Bang Bang","review":"Shane Black best work since the Lethal Weapons, this very slick tale of a small time robber Harry(Robert Downey Jr) who has no idea what his getting himself into trys to pass himself off as actor. Who some how gets himself involed in a murder investigation.This is where Gay Perry(Val Kilmer)a private eye comes into picture. Harry and Perry team up to investigate this usually Mystery that twists back and forward leaving you with laughter and so more Original jokes that will keep you laughing even more.This movie is very fresh and exremtly injoyable, the two main characters Val Kilmer and Robert Downey Jr are brillantly played off each other just like Riggs and Murtaugh.Also its good to see good roles going to good actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang Chuckle Chuckle","review":"As a complete sucker for all things hardboiled and noir (my patron saint is Raymond Chandler), I was probably the perfect audience for KISS KISS BANG BANG, a humorous pastiche of the pulpy detective tales and film noir classics of yesteryear.Self-referential to the nth degree, the storyline of KISS KISS is ridiculously spotty, but it's such good fun, I hate to quibble with any of it. It's an enjoyable, intelligent movie. Still, it must be pointed out that having Michelle Monaghan play Robert Downey's high school contemporary was just plain dumb. He's 11 years her senior... and he's seen a lot of hard road. That aside, the witty tweaks and nods with the genre's formula are more than enough to compensate for this misstep. Nicely done!SIDELIGHT: Thank goodness that Johnny Knoxville of JACKASS fame was replaced by Downey in the lead role. Robert had his character's clueless, wounded persona down, and served as a great foil for the unexpectedly funny Val Kilmer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than I expected!","review":"You know when you see a movie and you have little expectations for it? Well I was pleasantly surprised by Kiss, Kiss Bang, Bang. Val Kilmer was so witty and I was glad to see him honing his comedic timing again. I like his brooding roles but I felt like his comedy had been overlooked for many years and this was the perfect venue to get him back into it. Robert Downey Jr. is also very funny and endearing and I forgot what a great actor he is. If you like either actor, you'll love this film. Great plot, suspenseful, funny and thought provoking. I thought the part of Harmony could've been cast by someone better but Michelle Monaghan was adequate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Down-ey by law","review":"Although this movie commits the usually worst sin in Hollywood filmmaking (voiceover narration) thanks to the abilities of Robert Downey and the writer to poke fun at that technique, it works.Definitely a convoluted plot that you really need to just forget worrying about figuring out and just follow the violent fun. Val Kilmer is classic as a wise cracking smartass gay (yes, you heard that right) P.I. but every character commands the screen either dead or alive.The whole update on the film noir genre also works thanks to its ability to integrate a wide world of El Lay landscape from Hollywood parties, MacArthur's Park, a mental hospital (reminiscent a bit of the old folks' home in \\"Chinatown\\"), hotel rooftop pools and the ubiquitous roads and freeways of the county.Having said all this, I would rate this more a rental than a purchase given the DVD has lousy extras--just the usual commentary track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's just get to the point!","review":"I don't want to waste too much of your time, so I am going to give it to you short and sweet. \\"Kiss,Kiss,Bang,Bang\\" is a crime noir/buddy comedy that is much better than I expected it to be going in. Val Kilmer and Robert Downey Jr. have a great chemistry, and the director Shane Black, guides the movie with tongue firmly in cheek. The entire supporting cast is very good as well. This movie has a little bit of everything and it has undeniable style. If your on the fence about purchasing this one, I ask you to go ahead and take the risk. This is a movie that even if you are a little biased going in, it has a way of bringing you back around on it's side by the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"Watched this over the holidays and loved this movie. Wasn't sure what this movie was going to be about but I was pleasantly surprised. My 21 year old son told me to buy this because he thought it was great. Robert Downey jr. is excellent and funny but Val Kilmer stole the show in this movie. Highly recommend. These two need to do another movie together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, Love, This Film!!!","review":"This is a great movie. If you are looking for a dynamite flick that takes the classic crime noir genre and modernizes it with a dash of a gay Val Kilmer...then this is definately the film for you. It starts with a bang and keeps you laughing until the end. It's one of those rare films where you thank the DVD gods for the pause button so that you can laugh without missing anything. Don't waste your money renting this. You will want to see it againa and again. Buy now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pee-your-pants-laughing fun","review":"You'll pee your pants laughing. It's one of the most hilarious movies I've ever seen. Although the plot involves a string of murders, they are lighthearted and funny (if murder could ever be funny) in a twisted sort of way. Val Kilmar and Robert Downey Jr. have excellent rapport together, and Michelle Monihan is credible as the out-of-reach dream girl (with a twist).Don't watch this movie with your tween! Although there are no heavy sex scenes, the setting is the debauchery of Los Angeles and there's quite a bit of casual nudity (sometimes perverted). Send the kids to bed early and try not to wake them up snorting diet coke through your nose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gay Perry!","review":"I thought that this movie was really funny. It wasn't the greatest movie ever made but for a comedy it was smart, unpredictable and different. This is something that is a rarity these days as most comedies are stupid and confuse vulgarity and shock for humor. Robert Downey and Val Kilmer as Gay Perry are both excellent choices for their roles and do a very good job. The dialouge is smart, quick and funny.I recommend this movie highly. Check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining","review":"I really liked this movie. The comic chemestry between the two male leads is excellent, the script is witty and intelligent and I found myself pleasantly amused and engaged throughout. A film noir with a very ironic take on Hollywood with an angle interesting enough to make it into possible cult material. Did I say that I liked how the two male leads interacted with each other? Who knew that Val Kilmer could be so subtly funny and sarcastic. And I loved the very ironic narration and how the movie is divided up into chapters, like the comic books from which it is inspired. An intelligent commedy that does not take itself too seriously. With so many so called comedies made today that fail to amuse, this one is a keeper. Have fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the point?","review":"This movie made no sense to me. It was boring after the opening scene.Not sure what the plot was. Some girl rehooks up with Robert Downey Jr., there are car chases, people get shot and killed, there are trashy Hollywood chicks at parties.Only saving grace to this film was Val Kilmer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad","review":"I purchased this movie after reading the positive reviews on Amazon. All I can say is that I wish I had watched the movie that they saw. This movie is terrible. Robert Downing Jr not only wasn't funny but talked constantly. The plot was confusing and the characters unlikeable. This movie tries too hard to be \\"west coast Hollywood cool\\" and ends up being shallow and a little offensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over the Hill Gang","review":"It would be nice if every actor could age gracefully, like Sean Connery. But time is not always that kind and in this movie we have a collection of actors who just look awful compared to our memories of 30 years ago. If we had never seen them when they were young, it probably wouldn't bother us that this or that character looks burnt-out or bloated or bald. But since we do remember what they used to look like, it is hard to not be distracted from the story by thinking how awful they look now."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title should have read: Missed, Missed.

Enough already...I'm throwing this piece of movie doo-doo in the garbage pale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible movie","review":"I thought this was going to be a great movie. I love Robert Downey Junior and Val Kilmer. The first scene really caught my attention, then it went completely downhill from there. I understood what was going on, but I thought the plot was kind of dull and silly. Detective lessons? I mean, come on. I just felt like it was a little too unbelievable. I had to turn it off at the end because it just dragged on so long and I was falling asleep. Maybe I missed some sweet ending that would have made the whole thing worthwhile, but it wasn't worth it at that point."},{"rating":"1","title":"An exceptionally bad movie","review":"This movie features trashy, unlikeable characters, juvenile jokes, sophomoric dialog, lots of t&a, an unbelievable plotline and little else. It is one of those movies where you keep checking your watch and wondering when it will be over. A waste of the talents of Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer.

Director of cinematography: Michael Barrett."},{"rating":"1","title":"For The Love Of God, Don't Do it!","review":"What can I say but everything you know is wrong. How many paid shills are on this board raving about this boxoffice flop? The reason Kiss Kiss Bang Bang flopped is because the movie stinks with a captiol S.

You also need to patiently try this for at least 20 times (say in 1-2 months) before you will appreciate the real benefits.

The pacing is excellent, and the backdrop of the story--a university campus that takes on more and more of a menacing feeling as the book progresses--is excellently done and unsettling at the same time.I particularly liked the character of Breeze, and what happens with Kristin near the end of the book. The scenes in the tunnel system underneath the campus with Kristin being pursued in the dark by two bloodthirsty thugs were enough to give one nightmares, but it was great suspense.Overall, a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Game","review":"Love this game.
