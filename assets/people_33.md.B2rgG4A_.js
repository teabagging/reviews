All three of these (YES EVEN THE 17-85), absolutely exceeded the 24-105 in contrast and sharpness. The 24-105 was not even close to the other three. All were shot at F5.6 at about 75-80mm. The 24-105 looked like a $100 lens compared to the other three!That copy is on it's way back to Amazon. I'm hoping that it was just one of those infamous 'bad copies'.COMMENTS added 08May2006: I received my second copy of the 24-105.

I haven't even looked at my kit lens since. Fantastic! The pictures have so much more contrast, and so much sharper. Now I fully understand why my new lens (24-105mm) cost more than my camera kit (body & lens). If you are unsure on purchasing, let me just tell you, I am a newbie hobbyist photographer and I love it. Just be prepared, it's noticeably heavier than the kit lens, or even the 55-250 IS EF-S lens. After hiking Glacier National Park with it, I will never let it go. Hope this helps your decision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice lens","review":"I am a professional portrait and wedding photographer and recently purchased this lens.

I was told \\"an adjustment of the circuit board was incorrect causing the focus to operate incorrectly\\"I received my lens back and, $290 later, got the same poor images: not sharp, almost hazy.I sent it back again and it was returned with the following comment: ��lens assembly line did not operate correctly causing the focus to operate improperly��.Either it wasn��t fixed the first time or the product is flawed by multiple recurrent structural problems.Canon would not replace the lens.Would not buy again and extremely disappointed with Canon customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best lens in many ways","review":"Besides its image quality, build quality and the IS feature, the best thing I like is its wide range. I don't need to carry my 17-40 and 70-200 in many cases, and even if I do, I don't need to switch lens that often.However, if I don't plan to go full frame in near future, maybe I will buy the new 17-55 f2.8Anyway, it is a great product if it fits your needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has its Pros and Cons","review":"This lens has been my go-to lens for nearly 3 years now. It is a great out door lens or whenever you have plenty of light. The 24mm on a 5D full censor makes for great wide shots. Don't be fooled by it's f4.0 when shooting video however. I have found that it produces an awful video image at f4.0 and will NEVER look in focus no matter what you do. The lowest you can go is f5.6 to get a clear image. Very disappointing. The sooner you learn that the less work you destroy the minute you capture it. I wouldn't pay the money for it again knowing what I know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great all-around lens!","review":"This is a great walk-around lens. I mainly shoot landscape and portraits.

At 24 mm the vignetting (darker corners) is very noticeable. The lens is also quite soft outside the center of the photo. The vignetting improves as the zoom increase, but the softness improves only marginally.The build quality and feel of this lens is great, but none of those thing matters if the photographic quality of the lens is not up to par. The quality of this lens was so poor that I suspect it was defective. The lens has been returned and I am looking forward to receiving an exchange.

I initially thought it was normal behavior of the lens but I compared it to my 18-55mm (kit lens) and other USM lenses. It literally takes up to 20 seconds at times to focus because of how slow it is. It doesn't matter whether it is in good or poor light situations, it is always the same.Unfortunately I no longer live in the USA and now have no way of returning it to the vendor. How sad..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Walk Around Lens","review":"I have a Canon EOS 60D and was looking for 1 lens to do most of my casual photography. This was the lens recommended to me by a photographer who works for the Guggenheim. The lens is non- bulky and light. It works very well for short and long distance zoom photography although very long zooms may not be possible. It takes short distance photos very well and the output is clear. Only things that are negative thus far are that it can be slow when trying to take several quick shots and it may not take very good pictures in low light."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful lens","review":"Amazing quality for an affordable price (still not cheap tho). This lens takes great quality photos and is my daytime/outdoor performer. Although I don't think the IS is equal to 1 f-stop when it comes to low light situations but it sure is very helpful at these high f-stop numbers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic lens","review":"This lens was a huge step up in image and build quality over my previous 'walk around' lens (17-85).The pros/cons of the 24-105 have been discussed extensivey and often by people that are more capable of using equipment of this caliber to it's potential. Therefore, I'll keep this review extremely short.I love everything about this lens. If I were forced to complain about something it would be that it's not a 2.8. I have fast glass if I need it. The range, features and overall quality of the 24-105 will keep me very happy for quite a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lens!","review":"As far as I'm concerned, this is the best walkaround lens for a Canon camera. The range is good, price is ok considering the quality of the lens. I've owned this for almost two years now and it's been on my camera 90% of the time, travelling across Europe, the United States and Brazil. It's rock solid, great images and great IS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great walk around zoom","review":"I have tried a few different walk around zooms. I had the EF-S 17-85 IS, then I tried the Tamron 17-50mm (non-VC version) f/2.8 to get a fast zoom. After realizing the range of this lens did not suit me (well over half my shots were at 50mm and still cropped.) Finally I picked up the 24-105L. Yes, I wish it was an f/2.8 lens. But in decent light or with some fill flash, this thing is fantastic. Great sharpness. Great color. Focuses well. I have mistaken shots from this for some of my primes at times. It's a great range. I liked it on my 7D, and I like it even more on full frame. The only thing to keep in mind on a crop body is that 24mm is not that wide. On full frame, 24mm is plenty wide. If the range fits and f/4 works for your needs, this lens will not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent image quality","review":"This lens is great. It covers a great range, and is very sharp. I was also surprised at how good it was with color transmission. Image stabilization is very effective. It is F4 so don't expect to use it in low light without a flash or other light source."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great walk around on 5D","review":"I am not a pro and only comment as a hobbyist. It's an L lens, with the L build quality, contrast, color, clarity, AF, consistency and reliability. Don't expect it to beat the primes though. It's still a zoom. Of the three f4.0 L zoom from Canon, I found the 70-200/f.4 to be the best. I got the non IS version for its price and light weight and the top notch IQ. This 24-105 sits in the middle as far as IQ goes. And it has a very effective IS feature that is extremely helpful in real world use. I didn't notice any drain on my batteries. It's the best walk around day light lens on 5D for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome lens","review":"This lens is a must-have for any wedding/event photographer. With the L glass, you don't need to worry about sharpness. With a slower speed (f/4) than the 24-70, Canon has put in an image stabilizer to help with the lower lighting situations, although my experience has been that my 24-70L 2.8 outperforms this lens in low light situations. My dream lens would be this lens in a f2.8. But I love the added focal length and if I had to choose just one lens to buy, I'd go with this one beacaue I feel it's the most versitle."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bulky, detachable snapshooter lens with an \\"L\\" on the side","review":"This lens is considerably less sharp and less contrasty than my other zoom lenses (16-35mm mkii and 70-200mm mkii). At the 105mm end of the range it is as if you have a bit of vaseline on the front of the lens. Some reviewers have excused this because the lens is a wide ratio zoom. I don't buy that because a 28-300L that I have borrowed is way sharper than this lens and over a much wider zoom ratio.I wouldn't recommend this lens unless you are getting it as part of a kit, where it adds only $700 or so to the overall price. That way when you are disappointed you have a chance to unload it on craigslist for approximately what you have paid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Out - $284 to fix. My 24-105L Malfunctioned After 1 Yr Warranty expired.","review":"While I'm satisfied with the lens performance when it worked. Before you buy, take into account the lens only has a 1 year warranty. Nikon in contrast offer a 5 yr US warranty. I thought any imperfections in a lens would be caught within 1 year, and that the chances of a lens failing after a year was very low. I was mistaken.A few weeks ago the lens malfunctioned with my 7D giving me an ERR 01 code (just as my kid finished a cross country race). I cleaned the contacts on lens and camera (about 3 times) per the user manual for an Err 01, but the error kept on occurring intermittently freezing the camera. Adding to the mystery, the lens works fine with my old XT. I have sent the lens into Canon's factory service per their direction and have been quoted $284 to repair it. It's unfortunate Canon don't stand by their products as Nikon does - especially their heralded, expensive quality \\"L\\" lenses!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW what a lens.....","review":"I have the 24-70 F2.8 lens and just purchased the 24-105 F4 lens.

I have been using my 24-70 2.8L for much of the shots along with doing the formals. I have experienced some backfocusing issues with my 24-70 and heard this lens did as well if not better. Plus the longer focal reach was a factor.The lens has performed well and has forced the 24-70 to sleep in my bag most of the time now. Moving from 2.8 to a f4 is not really an issue as I have several other lenses- prime/zoom -that open to 1.4 when I need it. The IS helps to shoot lower speeds anyway recovering a few stops. This lens also does great for the 'rings' shots-very crisp.Nice lens. It has become my MAIN lens of choice. I would reccomend this one to anyone serious about their photography."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new favorite lens","review":"This is a great lens. I have a 20D and it instantly became my favorite lens because of the quality, size, reach, and of course IS! I don't think my 24-70L will get much use anymore. I also have a 17-40L that I will use for wider shots, but the 24-105 will definitely be on my camera most of the time. The IS is great and is very quiet and effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"After 3 years of using a Tamron 28-75mm, I finally bought the 24-105L for its wider range and build / image quality.Every good thing that's been said about this lens is true, so I won't bother repeating it. I'd like to rate this lens 4.5 stars, but that is obviously not a choice. The zoom ring is a little stiff - being able to adjust would be nice. And I find myself missing the larger aperture of the Tamron.Other pros compared to Tamron 24-75:The difference in FOV between 24mm and 28mm is actually pretty noticeable, to my surprise.Build quality, even the hood. The hood for the Tamron is stiff and takes some force to attach / detach. The Canon hood goes on effortlessly, and the interior is lined with a black velvety material.Cons:There seems to be a fair amount of distortion at 24mm.Price, of course.Would I buy it knowing what I did? I guess so. I'm still not sure if I made the right choice in not picking up the 24-70mm instead. But IS is very nice to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"White Box Product even though not specified!!!","review":"I weighed the pros and cons of purchasing the cheaper \\"white box\\" but after reading various web pages about what comes in the white box, I decided to play it safe for the extra $150.

So, I can say that I am now satisfied. As far as the lens, I am upping this to five stars for now since I have not heard anything bad about this lens.

All I have to say is that the quality of my pictures went from one to 100. The kit lens 15-85 is an ok lens. The Canon 24-105mm f/4 USM Lens produces very sharp images. If you really know how to use light you don't need the extra 2.8 aperture. I've taken very soft and clear portraits already and this is the lens that will stay on my camera unless I want to do some serious Macro with my Canon Macro 100mm L USM Lens or some really tight portraits. If you're struggle ling between the 24-105 and the 24-70, just get the 105. You will have the extra zoom and the IS and that is a big plus.

Yes, the lens is sturdy and it has a nice feel. It also adds an extra 2 pounds on my camera.

Imagine sitting on a bus for four hours listening to the \\"micro-machine guy\\" rattle through places where people have seen ghosts. Very little story telling actually took place on the tour. Basically, we'd drive past a store stuck between a subway and dunkin donuts and he'd say, \\"so and so died here...now it's haunted,\\" and that would be it. He even had to nerve to tell us that his last bus driver quit because he saw a ghost, and that was the end of that story.

For someone who is suppose to be an expert in the field, only makes you wonder where he got the information. To my knowledge its all legneds & lore in the book and no actual research. The tours he gives is basically a bar hopping event, makes you wonder why they see spirits. I couldn't find him to ask a question at one of the off the bus stops, maybe he is also a ghost.

I found it used at a local cd store and it really got me into Italian movies. Now that I watch it again after seeing a lot of these movies it still remains one of my favorites. Ruggero Deodato has a style like no other directer, his use of music, editing and camera work are amazing and his movies always seem to have that documentary feel to them, its like a mixture of \\"Jacopetti\\"&\\"Prosperi\\"and \\"Lucio Fulci\\" movies. As for the animal violence, I am against cruelty to animals but feel it was needed to make this movie what it is, absolutely horrifying."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"I stopped this film half way through and put it in the bin.There is no excuse for such animal cruelty being passed off as entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome musician","review":"I really enjoyed this video so much !

The story line is great--very heatwarming, but the best part of the book is the illustrations. Transparent sheets are inserted every other page so that when you turn them one way, you see the inside of a building, and when you turn them back, you see only the outside of the same building. I remember spending many happy hours flipping back and forth, imagining the lives of the many characters drawn on each page. This is an excellent book to let your imagination run away with. It is so good, I remeber it vividly even though I am all grown up now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous book for children's imaginations","review":"Like the previous reviewer, I too grew up with this book and cherished it.

I've been very satified so far with that product. Although I have used other video editing programs in the past (Media Studio Pro), there were still some things that I was not familiar with in the Pinnacle program. I ordered the training DVD at the same time as the program and am very glad that I did. Paul Holtz is able to describe and show exactly how to perform certain skills using the program. I found him to be clear and concise in his narrations.The DVD was most helpful when I just needed to go back and quickly find out how to do something versus digging thru the program \\"help\\" or referrring back to the manual.

There wasn't much to do there so we went to a lot of movies. We had no idea what to expect from this film; but I have to tell you, it really got to me; and I have never stopped thinking about it all these years later. It's a very poignant story revolving around an issue that is still, unfortunately, very much alive and well in this country: fat unacceptance. The main character is an overweight woman looking for love, friendship, and acceptance in the Big Apple. She finds it all, or so she thinks; only to have her dreams dashed in a very cruel way. But in the end she overcomes her pain, and learns to love and accept herself the way she is; a wonderful person no matter what her size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish more video's were like this","review":"Trusty Spot provides lots of entertainment for my kids.

The film fits into almost every suspense cliche I can think of; the most prominant being the stale story of the pretty girl who marries the fat,unattractive man for his money, then finds a young stud who helps plot and execute his murder.The twists are tired and easy to predict, and while the camera work is skilled & occasionally quite fun to watch, it doesn't make up for the plodding storyline and silly theatrics.And could someone please tell me why everyone is speaking in French except for Rod Steiger, whose mouth is moving over words in English, yet dubbed and subtittled in French?If you're looking for quality suspense, keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little explanation and overly complex code","review":"This book is more of a \\"learn by example\\" book; it gives you code and shows you how the project was built.

Its just to complex for no reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the Ultimate Sports Fan","review":"When they announced they were doing these 30 for 30s, the expectation surrounding the documentaries were high. They met the expectation and exceeded them. Being a fan of almost any sports, these looks into various situations and stories are fascinating and entertaining. It is obvious that each of the directors are passionate about their subjects and this shines through each documenary. I know that when most people hear the term documentary, they expect something boring like they are going to sit through a high school chemistry tutorial, but this is hardly the case.

Shame on them!","review":"You get what you pay for. Paying a low price for a 3-CD set may appear like a bargain for original artist recordings, but don't let that term fool you. These are not the original recordings. Although the label states that these are new stereo recordings by the original artists, most of the songs sound like they were done with studio background music, using synthesizers instead of real brass, keyboards, or strings. The only two songs worth this investment are Precious and Few by Climax and Show and Tell by Al Wilson, which are original released recordings. The Grass Roots, Hamilton, Joe, Frank & Reynolds and even B.J. Thomas never sounded so bad. I can't believe these artists would release, or allow to be released, recordings this poor. It's too bad that you can't return opened CD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't Get Fooled Again","review":"I'm very disappointed with this album. I should have known it was too good to be true.

I recently bought a copy because it was the only one that I could find by the author at that time. They are no longer available in librarys.

Even though it was not possible to find employment on a ship, I was the first woman diesel mechanic employed by a well-known marine diesel repair station in Seattle. I learned integrity, courage and a love of reading and learning from Tod Moran and Captain Jarvis.

Due to being Colored Blind, I couldnt be a Deck Officer or Engineer, so I became a Radio Officer \\"Sparks\\", after my time in the Coast Guard. I served on one Freighter and then worked at a shore station. When I reported to the SS Asean Promoter/S6EF be a Radio Officer in Mobile, Al. I arrived at Midnight, and felt like I was in a Howard Pease book. We sailed at 5:30 a.m. bound for Sept Isles, Quebec, I was 24 and was thinking of the numerous books by H. Pease I had read.

However, this book did absolutely nothing to add to my knowledge on the subject or even inspire me to read more about the themes within the book itself. I was extremely disappointed with the editor and his lack of understanding and attention to true detail. Perhaps the better title of this book would be, \\"Myths and Legends of U.S. Labor in the 20th Century.\\" This is certainly not a history text of any kind. If I wanted to read radical fiction, I could have read a \\"Star Trek\\" book or something like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vaguely Intertesting book, horrible editing","review":"I am a historian and find this topic to be extremly fascinating and important in US history. However, this book came up EXTREMELY short. The topic was poorly covered and the book was an extremly boreing read, even for a nonfiction history study.

In order to steam 1 garment I spent 20 minutes and still was not finished with it.After reading the instructions carefully and battling with this machine for 4 hours, I decide to give up. I have the following questions for the manufacturer:1. Who designed this steamer and did that person actually test it?2.

But that's not the funny part!The plastic cover, which is supposed to fit over the blank space created by a smaller stereo in a big space, did not even fit the space in THEIR OWN FRAME! It should just snap in, but even if it had fit (it was too large) there was no way to secure it! The guy said I'd have to file it down to make it fit so, while I'm enjoying the sound of my stereo very much, there's an ugly open hole right above it!

See what happens when Duck and Henry pull The Flying Kipper, and when Percy pushes some freight cars in to Bulstrode the Barge and what else happens.The story stops are; Henry and the Elephant; You Can't Win; Special Attraction; Passengers and Polish; The Gallant Old Engine; Fish; and the Music Video \\"Really Useful Engine\\".This is a good video. I know yuo'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome home Rhenas","review":"We all know that Rhenas had gone to the works to be mended and we had seen some little performances by him but we really didn't know him. In this tape he finally comes home. And if any true Thomas fans remember when Henry got stuck in the tunnel (First Tape) then Henry and the Elephant is the right episode for you. Also by Henry another Flying Kipper episode. Both these sequel episodes are good but they don't match the real ones. Alsp a flashback from the time of Stuart and Falcon unearths a little more from the past of Duke. Overall the episodes on this tape are really good and this is a good buy.The episodes on this video are Henry and the Elephant,You Can't Win, Special Attraction,Passengers and Polish, The Gallant Old Engine, Fish, and the crummy music video Really Useful Engine"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting!","review":"Ordered this book to replace a copy that my daughter had.

This approach results in an interesting and vivid portrait of Babb's beliefs about health and healing. The book shows how her life history provides a context for these beliefs, and it's an interesting way to study folk medicine. To gain a more complete understanding of Babb's beliefs and practices, it would be very helpful to check out additional studies of traditional healers and the place of alternative/complementary health practices within an individual's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice.","review":"This is a very nice faucet. It is well made and works great. Installation was straight forward although the very large flat nuts for securing the handles can be tricky to tighten if you have limited room like I did. If you are replacing the sink at the same time, installing this faucet first would probably make it a lot easier.The lever part of the handle is removable, but I didn't figure that out until I was done. It might help speed up installation knowing you can adjust, although only in certain amounts.Included in the box is a matching very nice pop-up drain assembly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kohler Faucet","review":"We love the look of the faucet.

The audiences are enthusiastic, the performer responds. Listen to Blaze's Blues. What a show, with Townes rip-snortin drunk playing the acoustic like a bulldozer.Every song on this album is fantastic, it's an album that you can listen to from start to finish. Townes definitely deserves accolades like artists including Bob Dylan, Frank Black, and <insert your fav songwriter here>. The songs are often dark.Take the song Marie, about a man down on his luck, no job, and kicked out of the homeless shelter. But he's got his Marie. And she's got his son, inside of her. And then Marie is dead. He leaves her beside the railroad tracks, and knows Marie would understand that he has to be on his way.I can't recommend this album enough.

It was one of three hats that I brought along and this was the only one she would leave on.

Though the \\"i play\\" brim was wider and more adjustable, I think my little one thought it to be TOO intrusive, while the poplin was wide enough to protect her from the sun without making her so aware of it's presence on her head. And as a cherry on top, it looked SUPER cute and went with just about everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good material, but not enough sun coverage","review":"My daughter is 7 months old. Her head is on the bigger side and has plump cheeks.

Their mother died when Pearl was very young. While Pearl is still having trouble dealing with the death of her mother, their father deals with it by avoiding talking about her, and Delia dives into ballet. Her new teacher is very strict and warns all her girls about being fat. While Delia gets better at dance, she also starts to starve herself and does nothing but dance. Pearl meanwhile withdraws from her family becoming rebellious and failing school. This story is as much about dance as it is about the survival of a broken family. This is a very good book that slightly older children will enjoy and even learn from. I recommend it to all who like books about ballet, dealing with family issues and growing into an adult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uh one and uh two!","review":"I have been following the LW history threads and this is consistent with all the good material that is out there on LW,his music and his band."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like it - I really did!","review":"I purchased this item on sale and was so excited.

Around the world, it had become a distant memory. Through the energetic, youthful, and well written songs that lie on this collection, it lead to the growth around the world of all the current sub-genres across the Heavy Metal spectrum over the last 10 years. The bands themselves, well... except 3 ( Def Lepard, Iron Maiden & Saxon) all disappeared in the blink of an eye. Today, many people listen to Metallica, however, they like many other bands of recent memory would not be here without these bands efforts.

Well done James!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the purpose of this book?","review":"Much of my reaction to this book has already been anticipated by other reviewers. In short, I can't figure out why this book was written. It lacks the thoroughness of White's very good book, Is the Mormon My Brother?, and so is useless to the apologist. On the other hand, it's too detailed in many places to be accessible to the average pew-sitter. It seems as if Mr. White couldn't decide what audience he was trying to reach. The sad result is an awkward amalgamation of breezy explanation and in-depth exegesis.There are far better books explaining and defending the Trinity out there - both for scholars and lay alike. Spend your money on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"Based on Mr. White's earlier work \\"King James Only...\\" and his web site, I was expecting a rather detailed, logical, and all encompassing look at a defense of the Trinity.

You may know the law, but without the ability to express it in the expected format in an organized manner at warp speed, you will find many doors closed to you forever.

He also fails to fully explain his main thesis (\\"objectivity of the covenant\\"), and eventually he just devolves into arrogant sectarianism (while acting like he's taking the \\"high road\\"). The early chapters seem well-written, but the later chapters are filled with confusing sound-bites -- didn't the publisher's editor read the whole book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Right-Wing Evangelist Propaganda","review":"As a devout Christian, I must say that this is by far the worst book I have ever read about ANYTHING!

So I was elated when I heard about this new trio that was doing jazz-rock fusion. I went and bought this CD expecting great things from these newcomers.Unfortunately, while the concept is great, the problem is that these musicians suck. Horribly. No, I'm not joking. Their playing demonstrates a complete lack of depth. I've heard high school level musicians that sound better than this. They can't improvise, the harmonizations are ridiculously flat (and it sounds more like through incompetence rather than actual artistic intent), and technically they barely demonstrate their ability to actually play. In short, these players are just very, very bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is what it is","review":"A lot of folks seem to be really upset that this is called a jazz album, and yet it doesn't mesh with their definition of \\"jazz\\". With over 30 years of musical performances under my belt, it never ceases to amaze me how much people can get hung up on labels. I could fit it into several categories. Jazz definitely. Rock, probably. Fusion, probably not. Disco (Heart of Glass)? possibly, but not likely.Fact is, this is an album that demonstrates some wonderfully inventive playing. Their technique may not have a glossy polished finish on it, but it's not lacking.Straining to come up with an analogy, I'd liken this album to a solid Ford F150 pickup truck. Some people won't like it cause they prefer Chevy. Others will complain that it doesn't have leather seats and a genuine wood veneer instrument panel. But it's great at what it sets out to do.

One of the most creative jazz albums I've heard in awhile. The rock crossover angle seems to be being pushed with this one (it was in the pop section in the record store). While the Aphex Twin, Blondie, and Nirvana covers are lovely it's still definitely coming from a jazz musician's perspective to me, albeit with an ear toward rock raucousness and without a trace of cheese. Still, I hope it gets them that indie rock crossover recognition, as they're much better musicians than a lot of the post-rock or what have you crowd. Dave King remains one of the best drummers out there, even if his playing here isn't quite as crazy as with Happy Apple or the first Bad Plus record."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bad Plus","review":"The Bad Plus are most famous as the jazz power-trio that covers Nirvana. On \\"These Are the Vistas\\" they not only play \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" and covers of Blondie and Aphex Twin, but they have enough originality and guts to make the songs actually work in the piano trio context. Their originals borrow as much from rock as from jazz and while repeated listenings fail to unearth many subtleties, this album announces another possible direction for jazz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knocked my socks off","review":"I'm a musician in the NYC area and really got a kick out of the Bad Plus on CD. Their sound is energetic, even driving, yet finessed at the same time. You can hear this on the brush and brush-like parts from the drummer, played at fast tempos, and the runs up and down the keyboard on Heart of Glass. The Bad Plus make listening to jazz fun, yet at the same time the band shows the woodsheeding discipline it takes to sound truly inspiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"To try hard and then fail; The Bad Plus.","review":"I saw the Bad plus in 2004 on the North sea jazz festival.Why i decided to watch them was the positive reviews of the band. But that all suddenly changed that evening. \\"Woodstock\\" an other reviewer on this site, explains it very clearly: The band has high ideals but lack in technique. And that wouldn t be a problem if you decided to play a nice popsong but if you dicide to experiment with Jazz you have to be good in playing th piano. The errors they made playing that evening were Bad and there was no plus at all.

Arrangers Conrad Praetzel and Robert Powell use a few electronic \\"beats,\\" although many tunes seem more ambient or even world music-ish. It's certainly a novel approach to the material, reverential yet strikingly innovative. The opening tracks, particularly those featuring vocals by Bay Area honkytonker Tom Armstrong, are pretty cool, though the second half of the album seems to meander and lose focus. Still, this album opens up some really interesting possibilities for a new approach to this old-fashioned American music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed customer","review":"I was expecting more because of the history on these tapes/DVD's.

Five tales are told, beginning with a dead, rich father coming back to life for his birthday cake (yes, you read that right), a simplistic farmer finding a strange meteorite, an insanely jealous husband taking vengeance on his cheating wife and her lover only to get it back to him, a mistreated husband discovering a box containing a monster which he unleashes on his drunken wife, and a man with a severe cockroach problem. Featuring Adrienne Barbeau, Hal Holbrook, Ed Harris, Leslie Nielsen, Ted Danson, and even King himself, plus great gore and makeup effects by the always excellent Tom Savini; Creepshow is a real treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine tribute to the E.C.

The whole production faithfully recreates the feel and look of those old EC Comics that were all the rage is the 1950's. The all-star cast does a fine job portraying the luckless inhabitants of the old-school tales and the effective (although sometimes laughable) effects are brought to life by Tom Savini. Co-writen by Stephen King (who also has a starring role) this film serves dual purposes as an effective piece of horror and a great piece of nostalgia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu Ray Rip Off!!!!!!!!!","review":"Unbelievable!!!!

Gaines' EC Comics line of books. Romero tries very hard to film the shorts in both the style of the horror comics, and the comic format in general, using vivid lighting, split screens and panel formatting, as well as coaxing overdramatic acting from the cast. As campy as the film may feel, it's all intentional, and in homage to it's influences. I wouldn't go so far as to consider it comedy, though King and the cast do a wonderful job of injecting a health bit of sardonic humor into the mix, yet another quality of the film's influential roots. Watch for out of character roles for Ted Danson and Leslie Nielsen, and a starring role for Stephen King himself, campy and covered in moss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie ever!!!!!!","review":"this movie has the best stories, best actors, and best horror musical score ive ever heard.

I feel like I was cheated by the cover, title and the [garbage] lines written in front an back of the cover. If you're looking for intelligent horror comedy, featuring different kinds of morals, look elsewhere, better yet, go watch Tales From The Crypt.

Once that presentation is over the viewer gets to see a couple of the comics in reality. Some of them are actually quite good and some I just didn't care about. The first one was a pretty creepy ghost story called \\"Fathers Day\\" which was less then good(Ed Harris had a role in it). The second was more of a funny screwball piece about a farmer that finds a meteorite and if I'm not mistaken the farmer is played by Stephen King. After that we get to see Leslie Nielsen and Ted Danson and a couple of more actors playing around in something that is less then good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage.","review":"The old EC Comics were filled with gruesome tales, it is true, but they usually contained at least the kernel of a brilliant ida and were pulled off with excellent writing, artwork, and dialogue. What we have with Creepshow The Movie is absolutely the lamest, juvenile, and superficial adaptation of that genuine artistry into an atrocity of a film. It's as though Romeo and King think that by employing simple gimmicky devices they can get away with absolutely horrid acting and utterly debauched violence. It's a sad, depressing film that defames the excellent work of the original EC artists. Nothing more to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateur","review":"By today's standards, this movie doesn't hold up. The quality is amateur. The acting is atrocious.

I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It'll Creep Up on You","review":"This DVD is dated but nevertheless quite enjoyable at times. Divided into 5 stories, the sum of this movie is not as good as some of its parts. The first sketch, \\"Father's Day\\" is pure camp and sometimes gruesome but it works. Things go downhill with the second and third sketches - but the fourth, with Hal Halbrook, Fritz Weaver, and a hilarious Adrienne Barbeau is great fun. The final sketch, \\"They'll Creep Up On You\\" is my personal favorite. E.G. Marshall is perfect as a hateful, pompous millionaire who loathes people and bugs. If you picture Donald Trump as Upson Pratt, screaming at the 911 Operator that he is being overrun by bugs, the scene is even funnier. Sadly, the DVD is devoid of any extras."},{"rating":"1","title":"Which came first, Creepshow or Tales from the Crypt?","review":"Five short stories that come from a boy's haunted comic book, which are all are ridiculous and boring.

Back when it was made, Creepshow was a serious happening. The world's bestselling horror writer and the respected and fiercely independent director of two icons of horror cinema [Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead] had joined forces to make a horror movie. Needless to say, more than a few stars were willing to take a trip out to The Burg for the honor of getting rubbed out by zombies, crate monsters, weeds, or cockroaches. King's script (his best in my opinion) is simplistic as a comic should be and Romero's direction is highly stylized (great care was taken to give the sets a simplistic look, as if they could be drawn instead of photographed), thus making Creepshow one of that last truly great anthology horror movies. No fan of King, Romero, or horror movies should be without a copy. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very stylish Horror film!","review":"Creepshow is a Horror film,that is broken down into five different stories.The format is kind of like the tv show Tales from the Crypt.If you enjoy these type of horror films you'll be sure to enjoy Creepshow.If you're afraid of cockroaches beware of the final story.This isn't a bad horror film for children that like horror movies,there's no sex or nudity,and the language isn't too bad until the last story."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 of 5","review":"Stephen King is in this show.

BAD buy.","review":"Do NOT buy this bag. I bought this bag and within a month the zipper on the top flap came right off. The bottom 4 plastic pieces that are there for protection started pulling away from the bag causing the bottom to rip less than two months after I got this bag. The top flaps leather is ripping after two months. This is NOT leather and if it is than its really bad leather.Of the two clips that come down from the top flap and attach to the bag, there is one that comes apart right after I put on the bag.This back pack will not last more than a Semester. If you want a leather back pack then you will have to spend money for it. A Nylon back pack is by far better than this. I don't usually say something is bad if it is OK but I wrote this review because I think the public needs to know that this is NOT a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute","review":"This belly button ring didn't glow as much as I thought it would, but the orange color looked good anyway.

It goes out of its way to be \\"dramatic,\\" but really, it's just a good story of some of the things modern Egyptian archaelogy is interested in finding out- For example, there seems to be convincing proof that the people who built the pyramids were not slaves, but modern work gangs who were taken care of very well. There seems to be good evidence that these gangs were taken care of when they were hurt plus were fed well. If things like this interest you, then by all means, get this dvd!

If I had the time or inclination (or analytical skills) to breakdown why exactly the drawings are so unbelievably funny I probably still wouldn't bother because I'd run the risk of ruining that moment when I see a Tim Kreider picture of Dick Cheney cringing or Condolezza Rice flashing the President's staff and I haven't even read the joke yet but I'm already in hysterics over the way it's drawn. There's just nobody in the world--not Steve Brodner or Oliphant or Ben Sargent or anyone--who wrings as much laughter out of his expressions and linework. It gets even better.

I am going to keep the item because I ordered it for a huge research project, but I recommend that Amazon move this product to another listing with a more clear description. This and the hardcover book are NOT the same title. Also, the most recent paperback was the seventh edition, where the hardcover is the eighth.The text itself is an industrial publication, and a bit hard to navigate with appendices in the middle of the book, and the photos are grainy black and whites. For almost a hundred dollars, even for a paperback this should be a better quality publication."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sticker Shock","review":"Two thumbs down. The book is just okay. No worse -- but certainly no better -- than similar, very basic books on the subject. The drawback here is the price. It's ridiculously expensive. Part of the school textbook racket, I guess.

I found the Nilson/Donelson text to be a great source of knowledge for me. It was very informative as to what each different novel offered to young adults and the controversy surrounding it. The authors were very descriptive with the information of each novel and author. The text was also helpful in providing me with ideas to use in my classroom of young adults as far as discussion of the issues that each novel dealt with.

Many would fault the author's penchant for the rare and expensive guns and components discussed, arguing that for most of us these beautiful tools are out of reach. On the other hand, the subject is about fine rifles designed for dangerous game, and the author does a great job explaining his perspective and making strong arguments in favor of these perfect rifles that are also in many cases 'works of art'. Every subject generates a plethora of opinions, and many may not agree with the author - I happen to concur with his views and therefore found this work to be the epitome of usable and facinating information relating to this subject. Can we all afford a fine English double? No, but neither can most of us afford an Aston Martin and we can still drool and dream over it. A great book. Only minor criticism is that some points are repeated."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this book","review":"I really like this book. Its the one I keep coming back to.

The Christmas episode itself seems like only a child would enjoy it (and probably a young adult that saw the special when it originally aired in the late 90's). The animation and plot is laughably simple and ridiculous.As for the 3 Sonic Underground episodes, they're terrible. Children might be confused by the sudden change of characters and plot when the Christmas special ends and the Underground episodes begin. Underground is a completely different series in which Sonic has a brother and sister and is on a quest to find their mother. The animation consists of moddy dark colors, the plot itself is a little dark (very much so for a children's cartoon) and in each episode Sonic and his siblings sing a terrible song that makes Barney seem like Pavarotti.If you're buying for kids, it may be a decent DVD.

It was an interesting read that kept me turning the pages waiting for the next attack, but by the end I had a strong feeling of disappointment. I can ignore the overly preachy message and laughable inconsistencies as long as there are some good and frequent attacks. Unfortunately there's only one first-hand animal attack (two sequences are just aftermaths) and one by a patch of possessed sand.

I ordered a box of 200 and although the package was reasonable, 15 cases were broken inside the packaging box when I received it.

All cases arrived undamaged (which is rare from most sellers) so I would definitely order these again from this seller. I've ordered these cases from various sellers in the past and usually you get 10-20 that are broken so I'm very happy with this purchase.

I bought them to make Christmas CDs for friends, co-workers, people at church, etc. It was still a good price for how many discs I got, but it's hard to recommend a product in which 15 percent of the discs were essentially unusable.

Unfortunately, this purchase was also initially shipped to the wrong post office, and once it finally did arrive, neither the shipping box nor the cases were in the best of condition--I probably lost about 50 of the 200 cases, due to various breakage.

Contrary to some of the other reviews here, I feel the characters are flat, with the exception of the young princess. While Gibson is able to weave three separate plots and bring them together at the end of his novel, I was expecting something similar here. I am considering donating my copy of The Bones Of Time to the library. Perhaps someone else will enjoy it better than I. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A generic time-travel story (but in Hawaii!)","review":"This book takes over a hundred pages before it even gets to the concept of time travel. Nobody does anything really interesting. Clones, yes. Nanotech, yes. Super-string theory, yes. They're dropped into the story like 'tech' filler in Star Trek by someone who spent lots of time reading through all of the latest hot concepts and wants to make sure they don't miss a one. I was very relieved to finish the book, because then I knew I wasn't missing something and the reviews on the back really were clueless.On the other hand, it's probably a great book if you've never read real science fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bones of Time - a very favorable impression","review":"I picked this book up because it was 20% off; I'd never heard of it or Ms. Goonan. It was a great find. Ms. Goonan is current on all of the cutting edge science - cloning, genetic manipulation, nanotech, and even the cutting edge super-string theory of physics, which implies the possibility of time travel. All of this could be incredibly boring, though, but Ms. Goonan hangs it all on a great plot populated by some memorable characters. The novel is set in Hawaii. Some of the characters are native Hawaiians, and members of the underground Homeland Movement; another is the Japanese daughter of the founder of Interspace, an organization with the lofty goal of settling the stars, but as corrupt and underhanded as any modern organization. The way all of these elements are tied together is really incredible. You'll have to read it to see for yourself"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This book should have been a short story. I picked it up sight unseen, based on the strength of her short fiction. The first major red flag was that the book was covered with praise for her previous book but there was nothing about this book on the jacket. No blurbs, no teaser, nothing. About a third of the way into the book it was clear why. This book is over-written, confusing, and boring.

I was greatly disappointed as soon as I picked it up out of the box. The bracelet feels cheap and light, as does the bezel and case. The pushers for the chrono... at first I thought it was broken because it wouldn't reset. Then I realized that you have to give the lower button an unusually HARD push for it to function, much harder than the top button and obviously not to spec for this watch.

I was heartbroken to hear that Gallifrey was destroyed at the end and with it the Doctor's complete history. I mean when will the Doctor's memory return? What if he accidentally runs into one of his old friends and the Doctor doesn't recognize or remember him/her. They're feelings would be hurt, deeply I might add. I mean it, this isn't right at all.

The author immersed himself in private letters, official hearings, and newspaper editorials from the era. The result of this research is a compelling picture of a sleazy and violent episode in American history, when Republican politicians launched a war to boost their prospects in the 1898 midterm elections. The book is timelier than ever after 9/11, since imperialism has come back into vogue in the guise of anti-terrorism -- anyone who has illusions about America's \\"innocence\\" today should read Miller's accounts of atrocities and racism circa 1900.I gave the book four stars instead of five only because the narrative is based almost exclusively on U.S. sources.

So, when I saw that the marvellous Angela Hewitt had recorded them, I bought the CD.Now this will not go down well with purists, because Jean-Philippe Rameau wrote them for the harpsichord, a very different instrument from the modern piano. However, Ms Hewitt does her usual great job, playing with all the virtuosity, sensibility and feeling that typifies her art. The pieces, while not being what one could really call \\"great music\\", are, by turns, bright, lively, contemplative - and all thoroughly enjoyable.

Then I talked my coworker into buying a pasta roller so I could teach her to make pasta, and she didn't have a KitchenAid, so I helped her get this pasta roller... OMG it works so much better than the KitchenAid attachment!

I rolled out strips that were just too long and getting them from the machine to the drying rack in one peice was quite a challenge. Next time I'll cut the strips to about 12\\" before cutting. In addition to this machine, I bought the Marcato Atlas Pasta Drying Rack and hung the strips on it to dry for just a bit before cooking. Without the rack I woould have really been in trouble. (After cutting, the pasta wants to rejoin and it was important to get the strips separated before too much time had passed.) My recipe came from a book called, \\"Making Artisan Pasta\\". It was very helpful for a beginner and the basic recipe is very good.

The handle used for the various rolling and cutting functions does not lock into place. It continually moves out of position or falls out altogether.The clamp mechanism for securing the machine to a counter is far, far too large a mouth to clamp to any of my counters or kitchen island, even at maximum closure, so the machine, heavy though it is, wobbles around and moves out of position, so I have to use one hand to try to hold it, feed the dough in and keep moving it back into place.When it cuts, it does an ok job, but, after today, my hand is so sore from fighting with this darn thing, I'm chucking it and looking for something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Quality Pasta Roller","review":"My father bought this for me several years ago.

I'm currently looking for a machine with either real brass bushings or ball bearings.

The hardest part of making the pasta is actually getting the dough the right consistency, which has nothing to do with the machine.

The key to making things run smoothly is keeping the dough sufficiently floured so as not to stick. I just run it through six time on the \\"0\\" (wide) setting, folding the dough each time. Then progressively down to the desired thinness. \\"7\\" is adequate for not too thin fettuccini. If you send it though the cutter with sufficient flour, it can pile up without sticking together if you don't pile it too high. It stays firmly attached to the counter.

The author literally brushes this off by saying, don't worry about the formulas, they're just there for reference.

Usually, these texts are not easily available to non-specialists. As a general reader, one may gain access --thanks to Uzdavinys-- to the essential teachings of Platonists and Neo-Platonists. But the main merit of this book is that it clearly demonstrates that Platonism used to be much more than a mere philosophy, in the modern and reductive sense of the term. Platonism was a spiritual way leading to the One. This is most often missed by academics who flatten Platonic and Neo-Platonic teachings down to the level of rational dialectics. In light of this book we understand how Platonism could be integratred into the Jewish, Christian and Muslim intellectual traditions in a way in which no secular or rationalistic philosophy can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cooler in concept than in execution","review":"While I remain a big fan of Romero's zombie films and of the man himself, but Bruiser doesn't have the same impact of his earlier movies.

Jason Flemyng is very good in this movie but the pore man just cant do it alone. The movie also has a very amazing cameo by The Misfits which is awesome.

All this stress, and the fact that he is a nice guy eventually takes it's toll as his face is literally erased. He became nothing, a no body.At this point he tries to regain his identity by taking out those wh wronged him. Despite the premise that it turns into a typical psycho or slasher flick he only targets three people, those who wronged him.

He wants a wife who sees more in him than his looks, so he draws up a list of requirements for his ideal bride. He wants his bride to be of the merchant class and definitely not the aristocracy; therefore he asks his merchant tenants to introduce him to suitable young women. When he meets Lady Nola Grenvale, pandemonium breaks lose.This is an absolutely delightful book. I laughed out loud frequently at the absurd situations and the secondary characters. Ms. St.George has created wonderfully witty dialogue. I highly recommend this book to lift your spirits and will look forward to reading the next book about Gabriel's friend the Duke of St.Fell."},{"rating":"2","title":"In content and form, this reference book shines!","review":"Pages was great when originaly itroduced.

But unless you think just like Steve Jobs, Pages isn't very intuitive, at least for me, particularly since I was used to Microsoft Word's menus and formats. This book provided a great introduction to Pages. It walks you through a number of projects, shows you how to use many of the features, and gives you the tools to ferret out more features on your own. My only complaint is that this is a slim book and doesn't cover everything that Pages can do. That would require a book three or even four times as big. Still, it covers about 95% of what I really need to know. Bottom line: a VERY worthwhile book, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"great investment","review":"More than made my money back with this kit.

Also, mustle diagrams not on same page as functional details, I heard this was corrected in 11th edition, finally the neuro section is poor, lacks diagrams, however, this book is not advertizing itself as a neuro book so thats not unexpected, netters neuro atlas is great, overall worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"book","review":"This was a good book so many examples on how they brake the human body down so you can learn and understand so much better I rcommened it to anyone and amazon was quick at getting thos booked shipped to me with in the period of time I need it"},{"rating":"1","title":"gooses review","review":"Reading this book is like reading a dictionary.

When you open the book up and look through it it appears similar to an eeencyclopedia because of all the pictures but that is far from the truth. Now to be fair anatomy by defonition is just listing definitions but the book could have done a better job describing where everything is in relation to other structures in the body.

That's when for me the story stopped being about the BCR and started being about a slightly tilted mirror image of myself.

I thought this book was supposed to be about this woman's love for BCR's - more like the love of her self centered bratty self. Way to go Leslie for saying the things you said to her. One thing that really jolted me was how she seemed to relish in putting them down when their popularity started to die down a little. They were NOT a one hit wonder.

Barzini graduated from Columbia U., and it shows in his command of the English language.

It offers tips on how to boost your own confidence as a homeschooling parent, and even what to do in an \\"emergency\\" when you have suddenly withdrawn your child from a school setting.

This, as well as most of the others, have been a disappointment. I hardly ever refer to them now. They weren't all that helpful at all. Her books (including this one) lack \\"meat\\" and are way too vague. I suppose it's a good, VERY basic, rather shallow introduction. But that's about it. The main thing that I did not appreciate about the author is her heavy unschooling bias. Not everyone is into unschooling. To the new homeschooler, that can be a real turn-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Demon - Music That You Wanna Hear","review":"Demon goes from making excellent house to making mediocre hip-hop and R&B. An unfortunate slide. And despite trying to be make himself stand out, with the soundboy rock of \\"In the Park\\" or the dark groove of \\"Slave for a Night\\" or the digital-indie of \\"Freaky\\" or \\"Temperature is Rising,\\" the results are uniformly bleh. Awa tries her best by blasting out her vocals where necessary, but when the actual music is subpar, it doesn't do much. The best track, though, is the crazed carnival of \\"All We Got Is Us,\\" which shows more thought and more innovation. The rest? Don't really need to hear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"La vida es sue?a","review":"La concepci��n de \\"la vida es como un sue?o\\" es muy antigua: existen referencias en el pensamiento hind��, en la m��stica persa, en la moral budista, as�� como en la tradici��n judeo-cristiana y en la filosof��a griega.

Outstanding from many books in the market of empty slogans, hallow jargons and weak propositions, the author discussed in simple but intelligent words, (and always in Q&A, key point formats that help readers to grasp and remember), how to perform outstandingly in the workplace by adopting an integrated approach through personal improvement in time, stress, health and relationship management. Well backed by his M.D. expertise, he explained well in our daily language the important connection between our physical and mental conditions, and had smoothly put forward means of positively influencing our mental conditions through physiological activities, like actively controlling what you eat and how you sit and sleep.In short, this is a highly valuable book that any person that strives for better career and life performance shouldnt miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"the author of this book is a genius","review":"After doing the tests in the booklets, the real test was a piece of cake for me.

The guidance counselor in our school says 2C test is like a math contest and it counts better than the 1C test. I am very confident that a student who has time to do all the tests in this book will score perfectly at the real test.

I am so disappointed that he has been exposed to these negative images, and hope he soon forgets.Tainting his mind with dark images of things he doesn't need to know or worry about: robbers and MONSTERS (!?) (after i spent months teaching him monsters aren't real)...and owls (Owls are amazing and wonderful animals that are actually afraid of humans)...and the mom is violent too - punching the robbers into oblivion. and strange - calling her son a bag of bones.its ultimately a vehicle to instill such a strong sense of fear that the child is forced to grasp to the concept of God without ever fully understanding the nature of LOVE.Shameful. This one is going away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scarey book for kids","review":"I think this is a terrible book. At one point it says she loves his back, bones in a sack. What? That sounds terrible.

Since I don't like wasting things I tried using it even though I was uncomfortable with the origin of the product (Ahava is made from natural resources from the Occupied West Bank by an Israeli business located in an illegal settlement). After using it once or twice I decided the quality was mediocre.

The smell, the richness, the creaminess - it's the perfect, ideal balance between heavy and light and it is PERFECT as a night moisturizer. I love it and my skin has been very happy with it. Note I do not wear it during the day because no sunscreen. Eventually, I finished my TJmaxx jar and had to buy more but they stopped carrying it so I came to the next best place.

If Cartoon Network pay money to redub sound effects on present airings (some of which are in their OAR) then I would have assumed that Warner would also produced an anamorphic widescreen DVD with a 5.1 track.Stick to the TV airings.

I love Jeff Daniels and think that he is a talented actor. I am also a fan of up and coming Julian McMahon. All I can say is that their talent is wasted. If you wanted a David Lynch ..., don't waste your time - why not go to the master himself and rent Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks and Mulholland Drive. As for horror, the Evil Dead series is by far the best in low budget fun, Bruce Campbell's lopped off hand by far excedes the inchworm effect of Daniel's finger.

The plot had potential to be interesting, but just ended up more confusing than frightening and the ending was one of the absolute worst I've seen in a VERY long time. If nothing else, I would have liked to have seen them tie up all the loose ends in the end of the movie, but you get nothing.To get to the point, this movie isn't worth the time or the money involved in watching it.

It's pretty much Armstrong giving it his all, and his supporting orchestras and smaller groups are OK by me. RCA did a very good job remastering this material (using the Cedar process)--it sounds remarkably bright and clear.

RHCP manages to pull off yet another unique cd, balanced with the upbeat and funky ''This is the place'' and ''Throw away your television'', and the slower ''Venice Queen'', ''Dosed'' and ''I could die for you'' that add that melancolic, yet beautifull ring to the album. No need to say Flea's bass riffs are purely excellent, as he stands one of the best bassist of his generation. The guitar's harmonics and catchy rythms are great, though it's not the leading instrument, its takes you away with breathtaking solos. The instruments mix perfectly with Kiedis' melodic vocals, that support the strong lyrics. One of the best tracks on the album, Minor Thing, kicks off with a solid intro and almost rap-sung lyrics. Beautifull. The 16-track album is a masterpiece, a must-have in your RHCP collection.Personal favourite: Can't Stop"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the intensity?","review":"Man, what happened to the Chili peppers?

Do yourself a favor and buy this CD now!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"By The Way good","review":"I have always loved the chili peppers albums, their early albums sound like they look live. they're amazing and i love them. their newest cd, By The Way, is completely different from anything they've done, or anything I've heard from anyone else recently. And I totally love it!! beautiful songs, I think the thing that makes it stand out so much in my head is the remarkably beautiful backing vocals and harmonies. buy this album and listen to it with and OPEN MIND, especially if you were an old chili peppers fan and only like fast pop-bass funk punk rock with crazy lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece, with the chili peppers abandoning their roots","review":"Boy, I've been really looking forward to this album for months, so I was so happy when I could finally buy this today. The first track \\"By The Way\\" is a great way to start the album with the slapping bass of flea and the passionate lyrics of Anthony Keidis with a mix of singing and rap like a lot of past chili peppers songs. The rest of the album, though is more passionate and toned down a bit since Californication, with practically Anthony only singing, and not rapping. In conclusion, if you only like the rap/funk songs be wary of buying this, if not get this album, because it's a masterpiece in which there isn't a bad song on the album, resulting in a potential album of the year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peppers kidnapped, replaced by Train!","review":"Sure, this is a nice album, but where did the Chili Peppers go? You know, the guys that defined funk for the 80's and 90's. This is an artsy, pleasant album with little to no evidence of the funk power of the Peppers (except three tracks: By The Way, Throw Away Your Television, and Can't Stop). If your idea of good Peppers tunes include strings, latin rhythms, keyboards, and Beach Boys harmonies, by this CD. If you want something even moderately uptempo, burn the aforementioned songs and add them to Californication. First HUGE new release disappointment of the year for me..."},{"rating":"1","title":"by the way, this album is horrible","review":"as a long time fan of RHCP, I waited in great anticipation for this new release. upon first listen, I couldn't believe what they've turned into. By the Way is a regurgitation of their old sappy ballads (such as Under the Bridge) mixed with a few spacey sound effects. it's like the RHCP strapped on knee and elbow pads, buckled on a helmet, and took a bunch of prescription ibuprofen before jumping into the mosh pit of album writing. the music is weak, not at all unique, and the lyrics are horrible. please, do not spend your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"its [stinks]","review":"I am a huge fan of the chili peppers. I like almost all of their music. I only like 3 songs on this cd, the rest are terrible. The tracks are all lifeless and sorry attemps for singles. Compared to Britney Spears, Britney spears tops em. Do not waste you're money. Trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The downfall of chili peppers,","review":"I cant believe that this terrible and boring album is from the guys who made an absolute masterpiece three years ago called Californication which is their best record yet. Avoid this and do yourself a favor. Buy Californication."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"I'd give it six stars if i could. A great follow up to Californication with more mellow, classic rock (chili peppers style) songs. The four really pulled through and produced a album worthy of a second consecutive \\"Album of the year\\". Accoustic, yet dynamic music from song one to sixteen. Some even have a bit of a classical undertone to the untoppable Chili Peppers talent for songwriting and rocking. A great disc to put in and just push play without having to skip around avoiding the worse songs. You won't find any on here. If you liked Californication, you'll love this even more. The kind of CD i'd buy another copy of just in case i lost one or scratched it (god forbid)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peppers soft side is not as fun.","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love this album. It has great musicianship in it. BUT! it is too soft, cmon The Peppers make great rock songs, why are they wasting so much time on ballads. BSSM and Californician had a perfect mixture of rock and ballad. While I love \\"Midnight\\", \\"Can't Stop\\", \\"Dosed\\", \\"On Mercury\\" and of course the title track which is the only rock song on the album. \\"By the Way\\" is the only thing other then maybe OLP, Incubus, Weezer, and System OTD worth listening to on the radio now. Red Hot Chili Peppers still are a great band to listen to and continue to produce Grammy worthy albums, his album is sensational, but it just isn't BSSM and Californiacation. I guess I just don't blame them. I recommend this album to people who truely do love music and not what is popular, cause this album doesn't have very many radio freindly songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the Chili Peppers","review":"I heard this album and immediately fell in love with it. Its true that this album is a very different and melodic venture, far different from any of the other GREAT albums the peppers have made so far. But it is still has Anthony's amazing vocals, Flea is not as noticiable, but his presence is felt throughout the album. John's return to the band feels even more solidified on this effort than in Californication. Any true Peppers fan will truely enjoy this CD. ps The Zypher Song is one of my favorites, even though it is on the radio 5 or 6 times an hour. Go get this one, you wont be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing versitility","review":"This albumn shows of the amazing maturity that the Chili Peppers have achieved in the past few years. Every song on it deserves to be a hit. The tracks are well organized, and the entire albumn creates a musical experience.If you've heard \\"By The Way\\" on the radio, think of it as an overature to the entire CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"this cd is way too boring and soft rock for the founders modern punk rock. their old stuff is way better, the only good track was \\"by the way\\" which sadly was over-played by radio stations, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bright star burning out,","review":"This album seems to confirm that the Chili Peppers went supernova with BloodSugarSexMagik, and have continued to burn out ever since. Unless they can get back to the down and dirty funk, and explore that region of music again, be prepared for disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"funk? yeah right!","review":"this cd is freakin' slow and boring, its perfect to put a baby to sleep. why! why! anthony did you have to change your style of music you bum! i liked you better with long blonde hair and funkier u fool!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad,in comparison to their other material..","review":"Evolution?...i sincerly hope this is not their way of evolving asa band.Im sorry,but this is really bad, in my opinion.I did not like Californication and this is much worse. I kind of liked One Hot Minute...but once again...no thank you. Their best and last decent album was Blood Sugar Sex Magic.Hate to say this, but unless you want more of the last 2 albums, but worse...dont pick this up.It just seems like a waste of great talent to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOLD OUT","review":"this is absolutely the worst chili peppers album ever! where's the funk?? also, anthony should not be TRYING to sing. do what u do best anthony. angry agro rap. this cd is for 50 year old housewives to listen to. can u say sell out????"},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same (that's not a good thing)","review":"This album is a lot like \\"Californication\\" in that it has a lot of mellow songs. But even Californication had some rockin songs like All around the World and Easily. Frankly, this album makes me go to sleep. I can't wait to see what their live shows end up looking like. The only song people can mosh to is By the Way. Then for the rest of the concert RHCP will have a stadium full of sleeping people.That's my story and I'm stickin to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Their worst.","review":"Tepid. Insipid. Uninspired. These are just a few of the adjectives that could describe this CD. Only the title track is worth a repeat listening. The rest is vile tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"The decline continues.","review":"The decline of a once powerful, compelling and funky band continues. This stuff is just a hair above Celine Dion. If this album were any good, it would still be a top 10 Amazon seller. I guess word spread quickly that it...um...well, uh...stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pussification","review":"The follow up album to Californication would have been better titled Pussification. I started listening the the RHCP with Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magic and fell in love with there hard hitting, funky sound. Californication was a slight departure from this, but I still found myself liking the album. It had a good mix of songs. \\"By the Way\\" has good songs on it however, they are all pretty slow, at least by their standards. One of the best things about the RHCP is Flea's base playing and on this cd he doesn't get a chance to let loose. I don't think they should just keep turning out the same tunes, but why go so soft! In conclusion, it is a good cd but not a very good RHCP cd, if you know what I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to any other","review":"This certainly is the worst Chili Peppers record EVER, I'm only givin' 2 stars because of By The Way, a good song among such terrible music. Where is Flea's amazing bass lines, John's solos which stick into you head for weeks and that funky style that only the RHCP had? You know what ? Try Californication, Blood Sugar Sex Magic, One hot Minute or Mother's Milk and you shall have fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Views","review":"I believe that this is by far the best album of their careers so far. Every track has the potential to be a number one hit. It also has more than the average number of tracks for an album. The lyrics and overall tunes are just mind-blowing, signalling their intentions to stay at the top of the music world for a very long time to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just different","review":"First and foremost, this album is just so much different from the earlier peppers albums. BSSM and BTW are so different from each other. The Chilis have a kind of matured sound, but at the same time in my mind it is a bit bland compared to Californication and Blood Sugar Sex Magik. If you haven't previously been a great fan of the Chili Peppers, you may yet like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"peppers are trying new directions","review":"i must admit when i first heard this cd i had to say, where did the chilipeppers go? there was no hard funk anywhere on this cd like everyone is used to. well i listened to it a few times and after a while some of the songs really started to jump out at me. then i realized that this cd was going in a whole different direction than any other previous cds. i have to hand it to rhcp, they made a cd for themselves and not for thier fans. you can tell they worked long and hard to make each song sound like nothing you've never heard before. some people will be able to follow them there, but most people won't. if you like the older stuff like mother's milk or blood sugar sex and magic you won't like this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just wasn't excited","review":"I was excited to hear a new album was on the way. Then the local clear channel affiliate started pumping out pre-release tracks and, I got less excited. I bought it anyway. What happened to the rythm section? A drum machine could have done the work. The vocals are nice, but without any rythm to pump the lyrics up, the album falls flat for me. I see people referring to Under The Bridge, but that song, while a ballad, had some fire to it. This entire album just noodles along with some clever phrases and angst. I'll pull it out again in a week or two and try it out again, but I think this album goes in the \\"failed experiment\\" pile."},{"rating":"2","title":"not RHCP's best work, but still solid","review":"\\"Don't Forget Me,\\" and \\"Dosed\\" are stand out tracks and \\"Carbon\\" and \\"Warm Tape\\" stink up the record. All in all..it's good..but it lacks the RAW, EDGY, EXCITING, flavor of their other records. I suggest listening this CD very loud, dancing to it, and singing along. It also helps me fall asleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Red Hot Chili Peppers Greatest CDs","review":"When i heard this new album i LOVED it, it is FANTASTIC! You are hearing this from a #1 Red Hot Chili Peppers fan. This is diffenitly one of there best albums, along with Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Trust me, this is a GREAT album that any person that even some what likes the Red Hot Chili Peppers will LOVE.i recommend this album to anyone! i say that this album is DREAMING! but i know i won't have to worry about any of you disliking THIS Red Hot Chili Peppers album, or ANY of the Red Hot Chili Peppers albums!They are the #1 band in the entire world!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Follow-Up!","review":"RHCP has done it again.....this album is great infact more than great........how do they do it?..i'm simply amazed by RHCP. Still gettin things done after all this years. All the tracks are superb...plus their arrangements are fantastic. The album kicks-off with the hugely popular 'By the Way', then the rest is history! Trust me get his album, you will not regret it at all, escpecailly all you RHCP fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"red hot chili peppers review","review":"i really like this cd. i also liked all the songs my favorites are:bye the way, zepher song,cant stop,on mercury, uneversily speaking,this is the place,dont forget me and minor thing. you will love this cd! it wont be a waist of your money! the vocals sound really great to! its the best cd i own BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not their Best!!!","review":"This is a great band that is looking for a new direction, they can't make funk records every album.

I got this cd the first day it came out, but i wasn't disapointed,i just thought it could have been better. overall there are good songs such as Can't Stop, Dosed, By the Way and Cabron. If your in for a change in the Red Hot Chili Peppers, get the cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The best pop CD of the decade????\\" Hardly.","review":"This CD makes an excellent frisbee. I suggest using it exclusively for that purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"|4.5| Wow... at last.","review":"The first time I heard Queens of the Stone Age, I said to myself: \\"cool, finally an original band on mtv.\\" I didn't really care much for them until I actually heard their whole cd, and I can tell you I was not only surprised, but blown away. Not only does this album bring back an old school sound to the radio that we have not heard in a long time, but it is also briliantly crafted and concieved. Everything about it is worth mentioning, from the brilliant vocal work, great guitaring, the powerful and loud bass sound, and the excellent drumming from Dave Grohl (originally of Nirvana). I cannot stress enough how important it is that you buy this cd if your a rock fan. For you people that listen to too much Linkin Park or Disturbed, this album just may surprise you and change your perspective on rock music. Thank god for Queens of the Stone Age. Big thumbs up.Best tracks: \\"Song for the Dead\\", \\"Go with the flow\\" and everything else :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Steady slip from \\"Sex\\" is absolutely right","review":"If you've read my reviews along with this one for \\"By the Way\\" by the Chili Peppers, then you know I have a major problem with the music industry. In listening to \\"By the Way\\" by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, it dawned on me that the artists are more to blame than the music industry for this type of slop. With no other career options or any type of creative inspiration, The Chili Peppers release \\"By the Way\\" which is a horrible, market driven piece of crap that doesn't have anything in common with the work they did early 80's to 1991, lets be honest anything after Blood Sugar Sex Magik is a farse. Its a sad state of affairs that with so much money and so much music prowess The Peppers put out crappy, unimaginative music like \\"By the Way\\" instead of tutoring the talent that is to come. We are all doomed and aparently these idiots only care about their money. Welcome to LA I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the real Red Hot Chili Peppers??","review":"Ok, this is a joke. Very funny. Now where's the real new RHCP CD??There's not one good song on this CD, it's all terrible mainstream stuff. These guys are apparently getting old and bored.Don't waste your money on this one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's with all these glowing reviews???","review":"Really, it shocks me that so many people can have such a dodgy taste in music. It shocks me that this was the album to propel RHCP into global superstardom. Its an album of half-baked, limp pop-rock tunes, nothing more. Glimpses of the RHCP that produced classics like BSSM and Californication are few and far between, but can be gleamed from the brilliant intro to Can't Stop, (goes kinda downhill with that overly poppy chorus), and Don't Forget Me, (a proper move forward for RHCP). Unfortunately, it seems many people like their 'rock' diluted. By the Way, This is the Place, Universally Speaking and Minor Thing are all utterly devoid of the elements of random brilliance that made RHCP such a great band a few years back. If you're just getting into the RHCP, you should leave this one to the side and pick up BSSM. From there you'll discover the rest. Heres hoping Stadium Arcadium can salvage some of the RHCP of old..."},{"rating":"2","title":"By The Way is better than you think!","review":"Music is just like movie sequals. The first will never be topped and with the follow-up you don't want a complete clone of the first but you want it to be just as good if not better. With By The Way you get that. It's just as good as anything they've ever done and has topped the album before it, Californication. Most people hate the fact that movie sequals these days are unoriginal and the same as the last and want something new and different. Too bad the mainstream music world is totally the opposite and wants their music to be the same as the last and will give up on it if it's not.Go buy By the Way and enjoy it for what it is...a classic album by the worlds best band!"},{"rating":"1","title":"70% MAINSTREAM 25%TOO SLOW and 5% RHCP","review":"I can't believe, that anyone who liked Blood Sugar Sex Magic or older albums of RHCP can identify with By the Way at all.All the great bass lines, drum grooves and guitar excesses have been taken away and are replaced by mellow, minimalistic songs...I am still a big fan of RHCP, but I would never go to a concert of this tour...I can't help it, but this album sounds like as if they lost a bet or something..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither Red nor Hot!","review":"Boring boring boring album. What happened? I'm a fan. I've seen them play tiny, sweaty clubs and huge stadiums. But I'm tired of the sad, slow, listless tracks. Serioulsy. I can't be the only one. These guys used to be funky. They used to rock. They used to have an attitude. They were wild. Now they're tired. I don't want pretty music coming from my chili peppers. Where's the funk? Where's the big sound? Sure, they can \\"grow up\\" but do it with some energy for crying out loud. The next album better be produced by George Clinton again, or at least have a horn section! Please! Get out of this phase! I need something to bug out to on my house boat! Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Musical Valium","review":"If you are looking for an album to make you sleep then look no more. I'm sorry I paid full price for this album. Except for the title track there is not much of the RHCP left, if any. The offical reviews i.e. Rolling Stone rate this better than Californication. I would like to know what universe the reviewers are living on because it sure isn't this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelieveable Music!","review":"I have been a RHCP fan since 1991. It's torture waiting each time for them to relese a new album, but the wait for \\"By the Way\\" was so worth it. I didn't think it was possible to match the amazing sounds of Californication, but they've done it. I love this cd; it has not left my cd player since its release last year. I agree that you must have this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Californication Hangover Album","review":"Some pretty good work here but the tone and energy are down from the previous album, the classic, Californication. Still, some great beats that grow on you...a sign of a good album. No filler here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Californiacation","review":"I'd give this album 4.5 stars, because it isn't perfect. Almost no albums are. This album tends to lean towards being less funky than the last. It's softer, but i like it better. or me californiacation was too much. I love tracks one through eight. especially dosed. But one song i hate is cabron. basically i just love john frusciante's guitar playing. every note he hits even if it's as simple as two in a solo is just perfect. you need this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only for the song \\"Don't Forget Me\\"","review":"As a long time RHCP fan I have always appreciated their changing and evolving style. Interestingly many of Anthony's lyrics that I thought didn't mean anything and were just there to rhyme, were revealed to have great meaning after reading his book.Anyway, a heap of great songs on the album and John's guitar playing is awesome. Whenever I need an epic track to lift me up I put on \\"Don't Forget Me\\" so loud the windows rattle, incredible base line and the guitar breaks are inspired. \\"I'm the blood stain on your shirt sleve\\" \\"I'm the rainbow in your jail cell\\".No they aren't still doing what they were doing 20 years ago, thankfully."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"whoa...that was wierd/.../ahhh\\"","review":"These were the mottos for this cd...I was looking forward to some RCHP...but this doesn't even sound like it....I really really liked Californication....because it was melodic and had crazy solos....well this doesn't have anything...it's just all melody....I mean I like Melody...but not this kind of boring melody...Melody is a must in the music world...but RHCP never need this much melody to be a [great] band before.John Fruciante's solos have gone out the door on this cd....maybe that's why i'm so dissapointed....I mean, there are solos on this cd...but most of his solos have been replaced by wierd electronic effects.Contrary to what the Spin Magazine article said...Flea is not himself. He has replaced himself with a bassist that just follows the guitarist riffs...Hopefully I just didn't make a lot of RHCP fans not want to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best but still really good","review":"this chili pepper album is deffintetly not their best, however it still show the ultimate talant that these guys can still display after 20 some years of making records and the music may be getting a bit on the soft side but it's original and creative.

Now, I don't know that if it's because I'm getting older (as they are too) but my tastes have changed throughtout the years. I like the more mellow stuff now and enjoy more meaningful music than I used to when I was younger. Maybe that's why I fully enjoyed this album. It's nice to see that the guys aren't still acting like they're 20 years old. I think they would be a joke if they tried. Instead, they've done something here that's really beautiful and meaningful to them. I think that shows in every track on this cd. What also shows on every track is John Frusciante's amazing talent and contribution. You hear and feel him of every song.It's kind of a surprise and kind of not. Somehow, it feels like Californication was just leading up to this.I think there's only one song that I could do without. But out of 16 tracks that's not bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch..","review":"The Red Hot Chili Peppers are trying too hard to make melodies, listen to the stronger Blood Sugar Sex Magik instead, or possibly Mothers' Milk.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzzz.......","review":"Yet another collection of boring lullabies from the Red Hot Chili Peppers.Ever since the release of \\"One Hot Minute\\" the Chili Peppers have been in a musical funk, and ironically, funk is one of the things that has been missing from their latest musical offerings... along with energy and style.If you are a longtime RHCP fan, don't let the high ratings fool you into buying this digital thorazine drip. I can almost guarantee that the people who are giving this cd high ratings had never heard of the Red Hot Chili Peppers until \\"Under the Bridge\\" became a hit... so they probably don't have a clue as to what a REAL Chili Pepper cd should sound like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steady Slip from Sex","review":"Man o man...anyone that claims this is the best of the Chili Peppers is NOT a Chili Peppers fan. The basslines are transparent, the vocals are...well let's just say Anthony needs to go back to rapping his bad@$$ funk rhymes, not singing about wind. The Zephyr Song is arguably the worst track RHCP has ever produced, with its intensely poppy chorus. And riddle me this...why isn't the opening lick played on the bass?!? RCHP is not, at least in my eyes, a pop alternative band. They're a hardcore funk-jam band, and this shows but a feint shadow of that. Blood Sugar Sex Magic is still the way to go, and anything before Californication, for that matter...which did have its moments, but definitely of declining quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"An opertunity Wasted","review":"This album could of been great following the old rap hip hop rock style but instead they come up with a pop album the only thing close to rap and rock are Miner Thing and Can't stop the other tracks will make you scream!All the tracks are kinda the same the vocalist uses the same tones of voice on every track which gets soo boring.To be fair when i got the album i did think it was alright but this just a 1 hour wonder so i can only give this album a 2 star!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So much for RHCP","review":"Lost in the fact that this is the band's most eclectic and adventurous work to date is the fact that they simply aren't a rock band anymore. The band's strong suits used to be the power-funk basslines of Flea, with Kiedis bellowing out largely meaningless lyrics. Aside from the title track and the goofy \\"Can't Stop\\", those traits are essentially absent. If that meant Frusciante would get to steal the show with his riffs, a la Californication, even he sounds comatose on this one. It's an album of monotone pop ballads and the occasional diversion. Two of the latter, Cabron and On Mercury, are entirely listenable, but RHCP has earned the right to have great things expected of them. This record fails to deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great album if your an old peppers fan","review":"I can't even give this album 2 stars as much as I love the Chili Peppers. They have lost their hard-rock\\\\punk\\\\funk inspired edge. I know they are older now and need to change musically but I can't seem to know how anyone can enjoy listening to some of this material. It makes garage bands look good. Californication was pretty mellow but this album is a real sleeper. The new mellow Peppers are not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing song writing combined with amazing music","review":"You absolutely don't have to be a long time RHCP fan to like this album. From beginning to end this album sounds like the Beach Boys later albums but mixed with a little alternative funk. There's just so much going on with the music, it's hard to notice the background vocals because they fit in so perfectly.The song crafting by John Frusciante shows why he is so highly regarded as a solo artist.They show that they can tackle any kind of music on this one. \\"By the Way\\" mixes the bands past with the present. \\"Dosed\\" has a chorus that sneaks up on you and is hard to stop listening to. \\"Can't Stop\\" has one the best intro riffs I've ever heard. \\"Zephyr Song\\" pulls away from some of the darker feeling songs on the album that set great moods.So even if you've only heard one of the song's from this album on the radio or from a friend absolutely make sure that you buy it, you won't be able to stop listening to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Chili Peppers best work EVER","review":"Let me start by saying what a great album. This cd has everything! From slower ballad type songs, which are awesome, to louder rock type songs like Minor Thing, this cd has it.The cd starts with the title song By the Way, which starts slow and swings to fast guitars and powerful lyrics. The song Universally Speaking comes next, and that is a very great song. To be honest I enjoyed every song on this cd in one way or another.My favorite songs on this cd are: Dosed, I Could Die For You, Midnight, Tear, and Venice Queen is great. I have listened to this entire cd at least 20 times.If you have an open mind, and don't just enjoy the Red Hot Chili Peppers Funk-Rap then you should enjoy this. I definitely enjoyed this cd and hope you will as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't look to it as a regular hard-rock chili peppers album","review":"This is a great album, but I must warn all of the Chili Peppers fans out there who have yet to pick up this album. It is much more refined, and not as hard and wayward as some of their other music. And, (Horrors) they have horns on many songs. Think Rush, and add a bit of Chicago. What you have is By the Way. This is a very good album, but it is different to say the least. Borrow before you buy. I know many people who love this album more than any other Chili Peppers album, but I do know those who think that the 16 bucks would be better spent on beer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hotter Than Ever - Chill with the Chili Peppers!!","review":"From the opening track, BY THE WAY, to the hauntingly melodies of VENICE QUEEN, the Chili Peppers continue their musical evolution with even more eclectic cutting edge tunes. Simply put, this is a great album from a band that only seems to get better and tighter as the years go by.Building on the success and ambiance of Californication, By the Way is another notch in the increasing belt of the peppers. Check out the Zephyr Song, Throw Away Your Television especially.The whole album is great and looks to debut at #1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible album-- mellower than usual, but just as amazing!","review":"Kiedis, Flea, Frusciante and Smith have definitely slowed things down a bit for this album. Just as Californication was much mellower than Blood Sugar Sex Magik, this album has found the Peppers in a more contemplative songwriting state than past works. However, don't let that turn you off. This album is amazing!My favorite songs include the title track, Dosed, the Zephyr Song and I Could Die for You. The collection works great as a concept album of bittersweet lullabies and stripped down, introspective rockers. The only thing that seems to be missing is the great Flea. His bass playing on By the Way is fantastic and melodic, but this album lacks the mindblowing funk-rock bass lines that stood out on BSSM and Californication.Overall impression: BUY THIS ALBUM NOW!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Follow-Up to \\"Californication\\"","review":"There's no denying, in my opinion, that \\"Californication\\" was a wonderful album by RHCP. Basically all of the songs were all excellent and there really were no bad songs. \\"By the Way\\" is also a wonderful album by RHCP's Anthony Kiedis, Flea, John Frusciante, and Chad Smith. While \\"By the Way\\" sounds like typical RHCP, I think Kiedis and crew sound better than normal, which isn't to say that they didn't sound good before. Also, RHCP have taken advantage of some interesting audio effects and string/orchestral backgrounds on some of the songs. As always, the drums, guitars, and lyrics are all played/written beautifully. My favorites on this album are \\"By the Way,\\" \\"This is the Place,\\" \\"Dosed,\\" \\"The Zephyr Song,\\" and \\"Throw Away Your Television.\\" Overall, it's an awesome RHCP album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy it used if you have to have it","review":"Rarely in my music purchases does a CD get listened to once and get placed immediately in the \\"Sell to used record store\\" pile.If you really want this CD to make your collection complete, wait a few weeks. You'll find more copies of this CD for sale than the Rolling Stones \\"Bridges to Babylon\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great effort","review":"I never really liked the Chili Peppers. However, after hearing their single \\"By the Way\\" on the radio, I decided that i would buy the cd. The album starts off with a bang with by the way and only gets better after that. All of their songs are powerful and positive and truley have a meaning in the world today.Another standout part of this album is the bassist Flea. I always knew he had talent, but after hearing this cd, I realize he is quite possibly hte most talented bassist in the music world today. That is a hard title to earn, considering he has to contend with the bassist of System of a Down and the bassist of Linkin Park, Phoenix. Flea plays his bass as a true emotional instrument than a jackhammer that makes loud noise. His riffs are matched by no one in the industry today and are the best part of this album. Buy it now, even if just for the sick riffs of Flea!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer Bomb for The Peps","review":"In the past the Peppers actually understood how to play music. Now i think a monkey with a screwdriver and a hacksaw could produce sounds that would rivil with this alBUM. I also thought it lacked the hardness that the past albums had which was great. Now i am dissapointed though because i bought this CD on [amazon.com}.... I coulda bought a beattles CD or a new baseball Hat or something. In conclusion i would vote this a 2 out of 5 stars and the only reason i give it a 2 instead of a 1 is because the ... thing does make a pretty good frissbe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love at first Listen!","review":"This is my favorite recording of RHCP's. The best word I can use to describe it is sweet. The record is introspective, mellow, melodic, and beautiful. Less punk/funk but that's no loss in my opinion. They are proving themselves as skilled, seasoned music makers. Nearly every song on this cd is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good music, but...","review":"I like this cd. The music is really good. But the only thing that would make this cd better is lyrics that make sese. I mean what the heck does \\"I'm a rainbow in your jail cell all the memories of everything you've ever smelled\\" mean? On the other hand I like how the Chili Peppers are sort of branching out...This is a good cd. buy it eventhough the lyrics are weird."},{"rating":"2","title":"took me a few listens, but it's really a treasure.","review":"yes the chili peppers have toned down a bit, but that doesn't mean they sold out or went pop, no, they extended in to a more scar tissue sound and pulled it off quite well. this album lacks songs like By The Way, but that song is already so played out, so I'm glad. try it out, it's catchy and slower than past rhcp efforts, but that doesn't mean it should be skipped over!"},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful!","review":"\\"By The Way\\" is a gorgeous CD. The Chilis are more mellow than in the past, but then again they are older and more mature than they were in the past.

You may notice that several people have recommended it \\"instead of\\" By the Way. These people are a phenomenon within fans of the Chili Peppers who won't stop talking about that album. The Chili Peppers have grown as musicians and as people since making that album and you people need to catch up. Californication was melodic and complex. By the Way is a further test of the limits of music and the lyrics are more interesting than anything Anthony has come up with before. To all of you people who refer to the \\"lost greatness\\" of the Chili's and Blood Sugar Sex Magik, YOU ARE ALLOWED TO OWN MORE THAN ONE ALBUM. PLEASE BUY THIS AND CALIFORNICATION AND SHUT UP."},{"rating":"2","title":"... Blood Sugar Sex Magik was released a decade ago","review":"I see to many people comparing \\"By The Way\\" to BSSM. The two are a whole decade apart. That means that the Peppers are a whole ten years older, have experienced ten more years,and maybe have found some different influences. Sure for 1991-1992 BSSM was great. It gave a slap to the face of all the pop and hair metal, just like other great bands of the time. If you expected guys in their mid to late 30's still making songs like \\"Suck My Kiss\\" or \\"Sir Psycho Sex\\", then you are fooling yourself. Anyways back to the best album of 2002. Every song on this album fells like it should be on here. \\"By The Way\\" and \\"Can't Stop\\" are reminders of what it is like to be in your twenties, while the rest of the album fells and sounds like mature adults making great music. This album is just more then 16 songs, this album is a work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I am totally impressed with this album! I was a little concerned about buying it after Californication came out. But this album is quality. Almost every song from start to finish could be released. It was definitely not just thrown together. The best song by far is number 7. That one alone is worth the price of the CD! You definitely need to get this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great finish to a great book","review":"Yeah, so this record was the last one I picked up (with the exception of Stadium Arcadium) as a result of reading the Anthony Kiedis autobiography 'Scar Tissue'. I actually started my little Chili Peppers kick about halfway through the book, and listened through the albums (starting with the original 1984 self-titled release and then into the excellent 'Mother's Milk') as the band was writing and recording them in the story. It DEFINITELY added a new dynamic to each of them, and this particular record is the one the band is working on at the end of the book. I have been listening to 'By the Way' for many weeks following my completion of the book, and actually have enjoyed this one the most. No disrespect to the others -they are all great, but this album is just 'sticking'. I highly recommend this record, and for a deeper appreciation for the entire Red Hot Chili Peppers catalog, the book to go along with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a red hot review of a red hot album!(well almost)","review":"With their new cd, \\"By the Way\\", the chili peppers have toned down their sound, delivering album that is sometimes beautiful, often wonderful, but also occasionally \\"lame\\"(for lack of a better word\\"On the wonderful/beautiful side, songs like \\"the zephyr song\\" \\"I could die for you\\" and \\"dosed\\" come through as standout tracks, but unfortunately other songs (\\"Universally speaking\\", \\"on mercury\\") don't elicit anything more then yawns. Even with all the slow music on this cd though, the peppers can still rock and roll as several of their harder songs are awesome. (\\"Minor thing\\", \\"By the way\\" etc.) Overall, this new peppers album really shows off the bands musical talent and showcases a wide variety of their abilities. Other then a few clunkers, this cd(16 songs too!) delivers the goods. Check it out"},{"rating":"2","title":"lovely....","review":"I must say this is one of the greater CD's RHCP has done. They've added a lot to their music, and it is impossible to categorize this song. They've got upbeat songs like \\"The Zephyr Song\\", while also adding a new sound and approach to songs like \\"On Mercury\\". You can still hear the funk-rock roots they're famous for on \\"Throw Away Your Television\\". You can tell they've really expanded their musical influences and have a very open-minded approach to this album. I must say, this is another great album from RHCP."},{"rating":"2","title":"people dont know what theyre talking about","review":"this cd rocks. its better than californication, because it varies from uplifting old funky stuff to the californication style. the zephyr song is great, excellent work on the guitar by john. \\"this is the place\\" rocks, and the basswork by flea is insane, particularly on that track.

It's kind of odd to think that this is the same band that released the loud, dirty, and forgettable \\"One Hot Minute\\" just seven years before. The music and vocals all seem so sophisticated. This is truly a great piece of music. However, you may be somewhat turned off if you (like me) enjoyed the older music, with Flea's awesome slap bass or Keidis's (occassionally uninterpritable as they were) naughty rhymes. I still enjoy and appreciate this album, but it just doesn't reach me like the old stuff. Honestly, though, there isn't a poorly-done song on here, even though I really can't stand \\"On Mercury.\\" Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I in another dimension?","review":"I want my money back! RHCP ripped me off! I'll describe this CD in two words and one sound: Weak, boring and ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ. What happened to your instruments guys? Don't get me wrong, I've liked every RHCP CD to date even One Hot Minute, but after struggling to listen to this CD 3 times, I had to play Californication just to get the bad taste out of my mouth. Gone are the great guitar parts and good drum playing; in are the bad lyrics and sleepy uninspired music. I hope the RHCP take an about face for their next CD and get back to some better writing - I don't expect hard funk, just good song writing with some inspiration to it. I expected more after waiting 3 years. What a bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only \\"One Hot Minute\\" is worse.","review":"Highlights from this album are ONLY \\"On Mercury,\\" \\"Can't Stop,\\" and \\"The Zephyr Song\\". Most disappointing follow-up album EVER. Only the \\"One Hot Minute\\" album is worse in the RHCP catalog. Read Kiedis' autobiography- Flea almost left the band because this album sucked so INCREDIBLY bad. If you want solid RHCP, check out Freaky Styley, Mother's Milk, Blood Sugar Sex Magic, Californication, or Stadium Arcadium. Anyone who equates By The Way with ANY of these albums or somehow thinks it is pffffff (HA!) better than any of these albums is a complete Idiot and ought to be dragged out into the street and shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"RHCP Maturation","review":"It is important for all the hardcore 1980's fans to know that the red hot chili peppers needed to change once slovak died. When John came, they overtook a much more mellow sound. It is almost as if they are a different band using the same name. But, when people say there is nothing of their old roots in this album, just listen to Can't Sop and By The Way. Both of these songs are NON-BALLADS, and both contain the rap rock element of their past. The reason why i give this four stars is that I DO agree with past reviewers saying that Anthony tries to rhyme far to many lines. There needs to be more funk as well. But there are still memorable songs on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars!","review":"Red Hot Chili Peppers are great!

I've been a big fan of RHCP since Blood Sugar Sex Magik, but this album just bored me. I haven't even been able to force myself to listen to it--I'll probably wind up selling it, and I *rarely* sell a disc, much less a RHCP disc. My advice: don't bother with this one. I even like One Hot Minute more than this disc, by a long shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"arguably their best","review":"Wow, I think this album demonstrates that these guys have really matured, so to speak, musically not only because it seems to have the widest range of appeal and emotional depth but also because, with the help of Frusciante's back-up vocals and some lovey-dove lyrics, Kiedis explores their so-called feminine side to the fullest singing songs like \\"Dosed.\\" But it's the music itself rather than the lyrics that are their strong point, and the music is lush and colorful. I love it. My faves: \\"Venice Queen\\" and \\"Dosed,\\" but they're all good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hello","review":"Hello I am the first person to review this album, it is good and unique, more mellow, and is full of well thought out music.GoodbyeCAH"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Just got the CD and still absorbing the music.

I would like to see the Chili Peppers get album of the year again as they did in '99 for \\"Californication\\". I am really getting tired of all of this pop music ... that infest the radio these days. \\"By the Way\\" is a very mellow CD and I don't think I've ever heard Anthony's voice sound so good.

With each release I am ecstatic at the quality and originality of funk, jazz, rock, and rap they are ale to fuse into classic hits. However, this time I am extremely disappointed at their decision to go with much slower songs and drop the heavy funk that built their popularity for years. Other than the title track, the cd might be good for those long road trips to put the kids to sleep. This album is definitely NOT what you would expect from the band after all these years."},{"rating":"2","title":"They've done it again","review":"Long time fans of the Red Hot Chili Peppers might disagree, but once again the long surviving band has put out yet another more than solid album that has become a smash hit. From the opening title track on, it is clear that this is a more subdued sound for the band, but we are left with a more melodic flow with RHCPs' trademark sound. \\"Universally Speaking\\" is a standout track with Anthony Kiedis paying homage to his hometown, while the mournfully catchy \\"Don't Forget Me\\" is music to the ears to even casual fans of the band. Other standout tracks include \\"Can't Stop\\", \\"I Could Die for You\\", \\"Throw Away Your Television\\", \\"On Mercury\\", and \\"Minor Thing\\"; but a few songs such as \\"Cabron\\" and \\"The Zephyr Song\\" tend to grate on the nerves.

Personally, I liked the carefree, non-sensical lyrics the Peppers churned out in the 80's and early 90's. The \\"maturity\\" (read: OLD) they hinted at in Californication songs like Porcelain is in full force here and it bores the hell out of me. The album might be considered good if it were by a band like Nickelback, but in comparison to the Peppers' other works, I consider the album a disappointment and won't be leaving it my CD player. If this is the direction the guys want to go, you can count this fan out.

They aren't as hardcore or energized these days as they were before. But what can I say, the chili peppers aren't studio artists, they belong on the stage. They resemble some Pink Floyd influences throughout the album, but still keep their original sound. Flea and John's interplay is the most sweet music i have ever heard. Chad backs off playing too much to keep the songs nice. Anthony shows how versatile his vocals can be. John's vocals are also beautiful, Flea, well, his vocals sound good when he harmonizes with John. All these 16 tracks are good enough to be released as singles. My personal favorites are By The Way, Can't Stop, Minor Thing, and Venice Queen. Hey, the chili peppers aren't done yet, like Anthony said: \\"I think this is just the beggining.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Albums [stinks]","review":"The only good song is By the Way this albums is way to soft for me i liked californication cause it seemed like they were having fun and rocking out but this time it seems like they are like all mellow and not really rock at all i dont really like it. sorry guys its not worth buying because if you're like me u like the rock red hot chili peppers and not the soft mellow red hot chili peppers."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm far from a bona fide RCHP fan, but . . .","review":". . .I like this album. By the Way seems to be a collection of similar songs--often the same chord progressions and minor keys--but each song maintains a separate thought organized separately. I sincerely appreciate the production on this album and I describe it as my Album of Summer 2002. Californication remains a genius album giving way to this decent follow-up. I appreciate this album also because the songs display lyrical, deep and not overly punky and obnoxious proof of RCHP's musicality. When compared to my normal listening collection of Faithless, Everything But the Girl and other electronic music, RCHPeppers hold my interest. Nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Chili Peps impress once again","review":"These guys are incapable of making bad (and for that matter, mediocre) albums. You know it. I know it. So go get this.

Go pick up this gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing follow-up","review":"\\"By The Way\\" is a wonderful CD by the stunning Red Hot Chili Peppers. The title track is catchy and was an instant radio hit, and the other songs are equally rockin'. \\"The Zephyr Song\\" has a great beat, and it's just as catchy as \\"Throw Away Your Television.\\" A lot of the songs are soft rock, but \\"Cabron\\" is a cool Spanish-sounding song that mixes up the variety of tracks.

I'm bitter becasue as a kid I remember that the Chili Peppers were that out of control messed up brand of punk-soul fusion that made everything seem better through it's magical filter. Uplift Mofo, Freaky Style and the S/T where amazing displayes of energy and soul. Part of me wishes that \\"Under The Bridge\\" was never written. It seems like ever since they have slipped further and further downhill. There are enough crappy pop-punk-jazzhop albums out there without the Chili Peppers recording something like \\"By the Way\\", Unlike the above mentioned albums that I still listen to 10 years later, this newest instalment is instantly forgettable.

By the Way definitely continues this trend, but unfortunately the quality of songwriting is nowhere near as strong as it was on Californication.

The single \\"by the way\\" is the best song on the cd and might mislead the unknowing buyer. This is not RHCP as i liked them most. If you are into more \\"MTV-ish\\" like music you might like it.

By the way, where's Chad? By the way, where's Flea? By the way, what were you thinking, Rick Ruben? By the way, where's the boundary pushing? Maybe that's it, they are pushing the boundaries by not pushing the boundaries. I hope this is not their last album and they redeem themselves with another - quickly! If you liked Freaky Styley, Mother's Milk, Blood Sugar Sex Magic, Californication don't bother. If you like the GooGoo Dolls, however, have a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"By the way exactly....","review":"By the Way, this is very good. Damn......... the chili peps are the bomb and they have several good albums, but i'd have to say this is my favorite because they seem to be in their musical prime. Though the album tends to fade towards the end, they have some EXCELLENT songs on here. They've laid it down sweet and sexy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some of the weakest material of their career.","review":"Ignore all the self-delusional folks giving this CD five stars. It's not even close to worthy of 5 stars. There's a handful of decent tunes on it. The rest is filler, some of it quite poor. Save your money and pick up one of their earlier works. They're much more fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album","review":"This cd is absolutely great. A pure masterpiece in every sense of the word. Possibly the best cd I own. Some klunkers sprinkled throughout it like Don't Forget Me and Midnight, but overall this is one of the most enjoyable albums I've heard recently. By The Way and The Zephyr Song only scratch the surface on how good this album truly is. From one song to the next this album just keeps on getting better and better. From the music to the vocals, everything is in top form on this one. A rare gem among albums that truly deserves a place in your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"As much as i wish it weren't true, it's definitely a let down. I absolutely hated it at first, searching desperately for funk in any shape or form, but it grows on you if you're persistent and listen to it a lot. And i mean a lot. If you're not a fan, check out ANY of their other albums - Californication, One Hot Minute, Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Mother's Milk, and Uplift Mofo Party Plan, which are all among the GREATEST albums of all time. Hopefully they'll rediscover that which has made them the greatest band on earth in the near future. But if you're a fan i say go for it, you'll find something you'll appreciate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, But Doesn't Match At All Up With Californication","review":"This is a great CD overall. It has a lot of songs that will become some of your favorites quickly. Definetely a Five Star album. However, I think that it is more of a 4.5. Why? It just doesn't quite live up to Californication, but that's what happens with great albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new band, really","review":"When a band has released a lot of records, and you wonder if the new one is up to snuff, here's the litmus test: pretend it was the first release of a new group. How does this album stand up? It's the best thing out there now. Let's not worry about what genre it's in -- is there anybody else out there composing, arranging, playing and producing their music with such raw conviction, with such true artistic soul? No.On the quibble side, there are some lesser songs, and with the possible exception of the title track, the songs look more to the past than the future.But let's credit the band for pushing their own boundaries. Hopefully, you're not doing the same things with your life you were doing 10 or 20 years ago, so don't wish such a fate on the people we turn to for creative inspiration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all useful","review":"I purchased this book to learn about how to prune my fruit trees. While I have an upright peach, this book tells how to train a peach tree as an espalier. Even those directions were not as good as the ones in The Complete Book of Topiary by Barbara Gallup and Deborah Reich. I also have an upright apple tree. He only talks about how to prune a bush apple. I have never heard of a bush apple. The book costs $9.95 and would cost $3.99 plus postage to return."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I saw that the author of this book was a fellow fan of Patricia Veryan on some site or other, and that she listed her as one of her influences. So I was looking forward to reading this, and her previous book, The Ideal Bride. Unfortunately, this book didn't live up to it's promise.For one thing, it might as well be taking place in modern times, since there's nothing \\"Regency\\" about it other than the fact that the author tells us it is set then. Arabella acts nothing like a Regency girl would behave, and St Fell is just...annoying. The plot is shallow, the minor characters are more interesting than the main ones, and there's no real climax to the story, just a lot of confusion. Overall, that's the impression I was left with--confusion. Heavily edited, this might be a decent book, but as is, it isn't worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great music, horrible voice","review":"As the previous reviewer points out, the choice of music is fantastic, and would be a lovely program. Ms. Pryde, though, ought not sing until she works out her vocal problems, of which there are many. The straight tone, often landing south of the pitch, is absolutely frightful. It smacks of serious vocal pathology. I also question the genre-style of attempting chest voice to such high registers wherein the voice cannot sustain it properly. Proper coaching and editing could have elminated the poor pitch issues (the ascending tones of the Schwartz comes to mind), but the vocal problems overshadow it all. Ms. Leon's piano is lovely, and very sensitive, but alas, poorly matched in Ms. Pryde."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift for Big Band Lovers","review":"This was purchased as a gift, but I should have kept one for myself.

Well, i guess he preferred to eat them since they digest easier than veggies. He says enzymes can be preserved at any desired low temperature without loss, which i didn't know. He also says that the sprays and pesticides are retained in the fiber, not the juice! He says a lot of good things about raw goats milk, and apple cider vinegar. Also says that the sea & ocean are full of minerals, so you should take sea-salt, kelp, and dulse. And if you wanna eat flesh, choose fish! And take a look in the ailments list, he lists nymphomania!

At the time it was produced, I believe as a television program, Menuhin was a strong presence in Great Britain and his remarkable life was fairly well known. Mr. Palmer's work would seem to color his life with some disturbing psychological issues. One problem with the film is that Mr. Menuhin is continually being interrupted and cut-off. He can barely get a word in. Meanwhile discontented family members are interviewed at length and offer fairly negative views of Yehudi Menuhin's character. If this is the only place to learn about Yehudi Menuhin it would be a one-sided view. His rich life and accomplishments can be learned in his autobiography and a biography by Humphrey Burton. While this film is an interesting contrast to the full biographies, it would appear to be a distorted view if taken alone. Yes, and I'd love to have heard more music as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this","review":"When I bought this DVD, I thought I was buying a video of Menuhin playing the violin, but what I got was a story about Menuhin as a person and not a very good documentary at that.

They must be really desperate to make the exaggerated claims about this album being so heavy. The only good track on it, that actually sounds like a Ministry song, is the title track \\"Animosity\\" which is excellent. The rest of the album is rubbish and hardly what I expected from Ministry. Most of it doesn't even sound like Ministry. A complete disappointment - and that is coming from a die-hard Ministry fan. This album is so uniquely weak, it is even giving me second thoughts about seeing them live in concert this Spring in San Francisco."},{"rating":"1","title":"not thier worst but far from thier best","review":"this is a pretty mediocre, id give it a pass and get land of rape n honey or paslm 69 or filth pig. if you have all those. save your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing lasts forever","review":"I think Animositisomina was just a little more of the same thing, if that makes any sence. In prior records ( cds nowdays ) there was a definate and distinct variation in style and theme. The Mind and Psalm 69 have unforgetable tracks like Burning inside, Thieves, New World Order, and Jesus Built my Hotrod (featuring lyrics provided by Butthole Surphers).unfortunatly, I was dissapointed with the lack of actual SOUND in this disk. I like to have at least a 60/40 mix of sound to noise in music. all and all, i just didn't like the lyrics, progression, or the lack of real message/theme continuity. Sorry folks, I think that they have come a long way from the '80's electronica hits, like Halloween, but somethings just need to fade out gracfully, so we can remember the glory and never have to think of \\"the crappy later music.\\" take a bow and exit stage left."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Album.","review":"This is a good album which is surprisingly underrated by most critics.

I thought Filthpig and Dark Side Of The Spoon both totally sucked (well, Filthpig did have its moments, like the brilliant \\"Reload\\"). I wasn't going to bother with this one until I started hearing good things about it and how Al's recent sobriety played a huge role in the album's sound. So I took a chance and I'm glad I did. This album has SONGS. Gone is the Ministry formula of, \\"Here's a cool riff, let's play it for five minutes while Al screams over it\\". They haven't put this much effort into songwriting in years and the results are incredible.

They still don't have that crazy shreding of their guitar and does sound like grumpy old men or the heavy drums. But in a sense the album does rock and Ministry fans should take notice that this is one of their better albums, not the best, but better. If they can regroup with the ol' Ministry bunch like W.

The quality of the halogen illumination is great, especially for reading. But the construction of this lamp is disappointing. The shape of the base and the location of the switch on the base requires a sideways push to actuate. But the lack of weight in the base and the slickness of the plastic on its bottom means that it scoots away when the switch is pushed, when on a smooth surface such as a wood table. I had to buy thick rubber pads to stick on the bottom to solve the problem. Also the flexible gooseneck is lighter weight than on my previous Tensors and feels a bit flimsy. And the chrome flashing on the reflector started to bubble up once the lamp was turned on.

The rest of the material definitely lived up to what I had already heard. Now I usually hate country music, but I always appreciated the way Johnny Cash could tell his tales. The man is a legend, and deservedly so, but along come these guys to take his song to higher levels. \\"Can't Make Love\\" is the equal of \\"Ring of Fire\\", and either alone would be enough to get your money's worth here, but you get both and the other great original music.

He seems more intent on placing his writers into a bogus hierarchy than actually appreciating them. Many of his judgements are simply wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tragic edition","review":"Stick with the second edition. This one has been revised for political correctness in the name of inclusion. The second edition spotlighted the Great Conversation of Western Literature, a written tradition of ideas discussed throughout the ages by top minds. Not because they were from a particular place or race, but because they had the preceding books in common. This is what sets Western Civilization apart, the continual evaluation of the same elemental ideas of existence. The current edition has turned this wonderful work into a list of \\"good books\\" by tacking in works that have much to offer, but were not in on the conversation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it, except for the sexism","review":"I really, really enjoyed this book but I was disappointed when one of the authors decided to mention that George Eliot's face resembled a horse, or when he said that she was a \\"strong-minded lady,\\" especially when he did not feel compelled to make those kinds of observations about any of the many male authors included in the book. Despite those complaints - and a few other similarly unsettling moments - excellent read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lost Treasure Resurfaces!","review":"Originally released in 1977, and never given the proper, if any, airplay. American Tears new line up included Craig Brooks on guitar and vocals along with founding member Mark Mangold to produce an album that should have topped the rock charts. Brooks' cutting guitar and powerful vocals helped shape \\"Powerhouse\\" into an album that equalled such acts as Boston, or Thin Lizzy. Even the tender ballad \\"Promise to be Free\\" smacks of commercial success. Perhaps with this reissue, some record executive \\"genius\\" might just give it the chance it deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing contents","review":"I was drawn to this book because someone said they learned a lot from it even though he had a bichon already (like me). What I learned that was new was almost nil (and I haven't read a lot). Besides, the whole second half of the book is the annoying \\"doggie boiler-plate\\" info that seemingly gets plopped into all these kinds of books, and is written to be generic for all dog types. What I really want is a book all about bichons, and one that goes beyond confirming that they are great, smart, sensitive, loveable and loving dogs (which they most certainly are!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good First Bichon Book","review":"This book has a lot of great information on Bichons. Unfortunately the last few chapters about health, nutrition, and training were abouut dogs in general and not focused on the specific needs of a Bichon Frise."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Red Book for Revolutionaries","review":"\\"The Che Handbook\\" is the coffee table book version of the Argentinian revolutionary's life. Gareth Jenkins and Hilda Bario have big,colorful pictures showing Che Guevara's impact on pop culture along with authentic photographs from his life. Che Guevara is depicted as a revolutionary, a lover, a son, a glorified secular Christ-figure. Che Guevara preaches idealism, an end to poverty, a socialist revolution.\\"The Che Handbook\\" glosses over Guevara's atrocities. He is widely quoted and idolized by progressives, despite his heinous acts. Che Guevara attacked the \\"bourgeoisie\\",despite the fact he lived as one. His revolutionaries slaved while he drank his yerba mate and took numerous lovers. He persecuted artists, though artists now glorify him. Che persecuted religious people, but now he's been canonized by celebrities.\\"The Che Handbook\\" turns the tyrannical terrorist into a secular saint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Character Studies Abound","review":"I found this book a wonderful change from the usual racing plot stories with no real character analysis. It rolled gently into the story like the highlands of Scotland where it is set, gaining momentum as it went. Rather than being a blood and thunder type of book, as one might expect of the early 19th century, it delved into the real thoughts and experiences of the people involved. MacLean's writing style is full of similies and methaphors that flow easily one after another and moves the story ahead by painting a complete picture of the landscapes, village living, poverty and hardship. Her writing style was flowing and full of beauty, even as the story itself was of a very difficult time for her characters. I really enjoyed it very much. It reminded me of the writing of Willa Cather."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want old Kolestral!","review":"Why did you get rid of success?

It is comprehensive and objective."},{"rating":"1","title":"So far, so shallow","review":"I was excited to read this book, but I'm having second thoughts after reaching the 2nd chapter. It has quite a few passages like: \\"New Granada was different from Spain, not just in its topography and population makeup but in its economic functions and structure and its way of life\\". This obviousness doesn't make for an insightful analysis that would differentiate the book from an account of chronological events. As there's a lot more to be found about Colombia's peculiar history in the 20th century and how it shaped its contemporary society, politics and economy, I can only hope the superficial tone of the book does not make me drop it while still in the 19th century. Hoping I can provide a better feedback - and a more positive one - shortly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing packaging..........","review":"The box with the martini glasses arrived promptly.

I would recommend this product to anyone that wants the wonderful Retro look."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tour de Force.","review":"There are only two books that I enjoyed more than this one: The Elegant Universe and A Brief History of Time.

If you want science delivered on a tasty platter, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing.","review":"I can understand why a few readers below did not like the book: it is likely to offend the extremely religious.

It was I believe the most enlightening book I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I am a big fan of this book. It is my \\"science bible.\\" Each day I read a few pages. I am learning so much about nature, chemistry, living creatures, geology, dinosaurs, earth, planets, stars, physics, evolution, biology, cosmology, etc.. I feel much more knowledgeable than before I began reading this book. It has had a great impact on me, even changing the way I view many things. Everybody should have this type of knowledge. Unfortunately, most science courses in school do not provide it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor way to present science","review":"I suppose that by writing a book about science in the style of the Bible, the anonymous authors hope to reach readers who would not ordinarily pick up a book about science. However, they end up presenting science as revealed truth which it most certainly is not. The authors even go so far as to claim that \\"like religon, science has its 'priests'\\". While there are many famous scientists that are considered to be authorities, even Nobel laureates like Linus Pauling have to continue to earn their credibility. While this book presents a great deal of scientific facts, it fails to present the essential features of science that make science successful. These features are not easily described in this Biblical form.It would be nice if the publishers would reveal who the authors actually are."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only book I couldn't finish this year!","review":"Pedantic. That is the one word which best describes this work. There are many sources where you can find more lucid explanations of these concepts where you won't have to wade through the old testament sentence structure. It is not a bible and it does no justice to Einstein."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enlightening book.","review":"The Skeptical Inquirer: The Magazine of Science and Reason recently described \\"The Bible According to Einstein\\" as an epic work. I agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evidence of Science Becoming Ironic?","review":"This book provide a good overview of the relatively contemporary state of 'the scientific worldview' through the 'grand narrative' suggested when various scientific theories are patched together. The great story is built up from the smaller stories arising out of various scientific disciplines. The literary craft shown in the biblical style of the writing makes the book entertaining, enjoyable, and perhaps witty. Yet the most striking characteristic of the book is its effect of revealing the irony of the very idea of a 'scientific narrative of the world'. Whether intended or not, the book can be read as demonstrating the irony which occurs when one is presented with the stories of science for adoption as a world-view or grand narrative: the book helps create self-consciousness regarding the artificial character of scientific theory."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Popular Science Book I've Seen!!","review":"I can hardly imagine a worse way to present science than this book! It reads just like the Bible, and it suggests that the difference between science and religon is just which book is regarded as the authority: this book, the Christian Bible, or some other religious screed.Science is successful precisely because it does not rely upon authority figures as a guide to the ultimate truth. Scientific theories only come to be regarded as true after they've survived the determined attempts of many scientists to prove that they are wrong. This is the reason why science works, and this fundamental point is undermined by this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Religion Music","review":"This is religion music for a religion you don't belong to, pure hate, devil worship, small bright shiny and banal, the dry teeth of the smiling haters, clicking little commonplace souvenir objects together in their pockets, in a land of gently rolling hills overinfested with oddly small merry-go-rounds.

I bought this after hearing one remix track by T. Corp., always a risk, but the quality and design of the packaging was a tactile stimulus incentive to purchase (I was in an actual record store, and not in your house using your computer).

I only really like 2 songs which were Omid(Hope) and All that we Perceive. There were a few others which were decent to listen to, but nothing other than those two that were memorable. For a CD to get more than a 3 from me, it has to come with something that is pretty memorable. This effort provides nothing of the sort. It does have a lot of influences from other cultures, but they must have taken the bad instead of the good. This CD isn't much to write home about let alone to someone else. Don't waste your time...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising sleeve, reassuring music","review":"I was unable to listen to the CD until several hours after purchasing it, so my first impressions of the album came from the sleeve and liner. Gone are the amusing, faux-espionage photos. In their place: social commentary. About thirty pages of striking photos ranging from Iraqi refugee camps to Rwanda to the DC's Metro. The packaging is cool.So the sleeve had me nervous that the sounds would be drastically different, but the album is distinctly Thievery. The instruments and the way they're used are familiar. That doesn't imply that the album's unintelligent or a mere repeat of previous work. It's just that I'd read some reviews suggesting a different sound. If you like MC or Sounds from, this will probably also please you. It was great to settle back with a drink and a book and enjoy an hour of quality Thieving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting World fusion sound","review":"Nice use of various reggae, arabesque music and horns with electronica beats.

Always lurking, though, was the question of where the sound would go next., how it would evolve. The answer for Thievery Corp is: nowhere special. Richest Man in Bablylon, like Toca's dissapointing new disc, Dehli 9, sounds like their earlier work, sans the inspiration that made albums like Thievery's 1999 disc *Abductions and Reconstructions* and Tosca's *Opera* classics.My guess is that a year from now people who buy this disc will find they're back to listening to older Thievery, having traded *Richest Man* in at a used bin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for basics","review":"I love these books.

They were self-indulgent performances much involved the performers' emotions. Turning a love song into a tortured lament may be excellent for self expression but it has very little to do with the music. I suggest the performers listen to it and leave the rest of us alone.If you don't know Harold Arlen's music and just listened to this CD, you might conclude that he has nothing to offer. In fact, he is one of the most wonderful of songwriters. I would suggest a wonderful collection called \\"Harold Arlen Centenial Celebration 100\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT TRIBUTE","review":"This disc is worth it just for the Shannon Mcnally and David Johanson cuts.

I love Arlen's music, and I was really looking forward to hearing about his life. Well, my first inkling that something was wrong was when the singer (Rufus Wainwright, I found out later) comes out and starts to mangle \\"Paper Moon.\\" My GOD, it was bad. I winced every time he opened his mouth. So I figured he was just an anomaly, and continued to watch. But the next singer was equally as bad, and I kept thinking, there are TONS of great cabaret singers and Broadway singers out there; why weren't they used? When the third singer I heard sounded just as bad, I turned off the show in disgust. I can just imagine what the rest of the CD sounds like.

These talented literary sister's story is an amazing, touching, even inspiring story of our early pioneering women who faced unbelivible hardship in an unforgiving enviorment of the backwoods with only the hap hazard support (at least in finacial terms) of their husbands.

I have spent several years looking for the right running shoe; my knees and ankles immediately tell me if a shoe is wrong for me, and I know it is time to buy new shoes when my knees begin to hurt in a worn-out pair of shoes. This is probably due to a tendency to under-pronate, so I prefer cushioned shoes. The Saucony Grid Triumph 3 is by far the best shoe I have tried - the cushioning is great, the fit is perfect (I have wider feet and short toes), and the quality is what I have come to expect from Saucony. I am far overdue on a new pair - 6 months has been the average lasting time for most of my shoes, I'm running on almost 10 months with these - and no knee pain yet!

Everything about it shouts quality, from the haunting zither music, the lighting and camera angles and the location shots of Vienna post war. Every frame is truly a Rembrandt especially in the newly restored 50th anniversary edition available from Amazon, but this books tops it all - the story behind the filming of the movie.How Charles Drazin found all the background stories about Karas, Greene, Reed and Welles beats me. It 'wasn't for German gin' and he did 'dig deeper than the grave' (to quote from the film!)If you loved the film, adored the music and had a sneaking admination for Harry Lime, take the Third Man Tour when next in Vienna, but above all get this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heroes of War the Ultimate Dissapointment","review":"The Heroes of war was the ultimate disappointment as well as the 50 Combat Movie Pack.

Whether you call it houserockin', Delta, or Chicago-style blues, the sound on this album is all Magic Slim, and synthesizes everything from country-western to storybook blues to rock & roll. Better yet, the clarity of the recorded sound is wonderful and will have you tapping your feet & growling along with the Magic Man from start to finish. This is right up there with \\"Gravel Road\\" as essential Magic Slim albums from Blind Pig Records."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Jane Eyre tribute","review":"Another reviewer described this book as 'solid' and I would very much endorse that. This is a well-written romance with nicely define characters and it is an enjoyable read. After wondering whether it would descend into a Jane Eyre parody, I found it settled into a kind of tribute to Bronte's 'governess falls in love with gentleman employer' theme. We have another Jane and Edward with many scenes remeniscent of their forebears but the point is not too belaboured. It is not a strict historical Regency, filled with decorous behaviour and drawing room banter, but a good read nevertheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, if not spectacular read","review":"Ms. Pickens has written an enjoyable Regency romp with intelligent, sympathetic characters. Both the hero and heroine are imperfect yet extremely likeable. As the relationship develops, Ms. Pickens demonstrates how the heroine matures and the hero heals past wounds.

Even the previous most bizarre film I had ever seen - Sweet Movie - was blown away by this film in terms of sheer weirdness and discontinuity.I would go along with the \\"see it on drugs\\" recommendation. I am giving it two stars instead of one because it looks good (love the set in the opening scene), and because I was very impressed with the climbing-the-obelisk scene.

I gave two stars because the criterion commentaries helped me cope with it and try to understand it (but I still am unforgiving about the frogs-so unnecessary).

Surely Amazon have made a typo here. Could they really have gone to the effort of restoring and transferring it to DVD at last only to butcher it into full-screen? Given the visual impact of this movie, it would suffer more than most from this treatment. Don't even bother to watch such a travesty if this is really the case. If it is widescreen, I will change the rating to 5 stars.4/21/07 There doesn't seem to be a way for me to change the number of stars I gave this.

It's kind of like listening to political adversaries shooting their silly barbs at each other during an election time. This is unfortunate because Opus Dei is a very manipulative organization which, because of its immense wealth, influences an increasing number of Church authorities with a fundamentalist kind of conservatism. (Tony Hendra's new book, \\"Father Joe,\\" [2004] has a great word for people like this: \\"cathoholics.\\") I think that if Walsh had written a more dispassionate book, it would have been more effective in making his point: namely, that for all their claim to being model Catholic clergy and lay persons, they use utterly un-Christian methods to achieve their ends within the structure of the Church. With this, I would agree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dense but not very illuminating","review":"Though it is chocked full of supposedly crystal clear evidence of Opus Dei's evil ways, most of the research is plainly outdated and mostly irrelevant. I tried desperately to read this book with an open mind. Yet Walsh's tone becomes shrill bordering on the infantile with certain phrasing, particularly at the end of the book, not at all hiding his deeply personal hatred for Opus Dei. For a man who left the priesthood, it's hardly surprising that he would have an intellectual problem with celibacy amongst lay men and women. A Catholic group getting political when the Jesuit priest Fr. Drinan spent several terms in Congress? I can't help but find astonishing that a man who used to give out the sacraments to the Faithful could examine another Catholic group through such narrow lenses of supposed \\"left\\" and \\"right\\" and could leave almost no material in his \\"investigation\\" to the actual spiritual content of his subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"By combining, you're losing...","review":"While it appears to be a good tool--having a 2-in-1 approach, this book falls short by the very thing it promotes: two books in one.Any time you compromise a work and combine two into one, you won't get the best of both worlds; you get a diminished product that really doesn't meet your needs that much if at all.You are much better off buying a separate dictionary and concordance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Champion \\"Tells\\" His Life Story","review":"Dan Patch was a world-champion natural pacer, who - in the early years of the 20th Century - drew crowds up to 100,000 or more to watch his races against the clock or versus other Standardbreds.The first celebrity sports star endorser to reap unheard of financial rewards, Dan Patch had his name on dozens of products and - at the peak of his popularity - was earning more than $1 million per year.This extremely rare book is the champion's life story, who was \\"assisted\\" by ghost writer Merton E.

In both cases, I felt like the writers were thinking only of themselves rather than of the people they interviewed or the humans of all colors who live in this town.It was so very easy to blame what happened on it being a result of \\"Southern culture,\\" hicks, and good-ole boy mentality. I was outraged by how this writer, and the author of the other book on the subject, portrayed the people they interviewed. It's so easy for a writer (one is from the North, not sure about the other) to enter a situation that is already a horror and simply add a dash of this and a sprinkle of that and come up with the usual a CULTURE of hate.What happened to that poor man is so awful that I leave the room when someone asks my mother about it.

I tried skipping it, but the disk jumped to some point in the middle of warm-up.

I admit that when I was watching this, I kinda was expecting a B movie, and I wasn't expecting to stay on the channel. I became mesmerized by the acting, drama, and issues of the film.

Then it was shown on The History Channel a few years ago and many angry letters were sent to the station including ones from former presidents Ford and Carter.

I am so angry and upset that I am going to make sure that I get my money back by either the seller or my credit card company. Just as it is illegal to sell expired food it should be illegal to sell expired cologne. In my professional opinion it is always best to purchase cologne from department stores. Freshness is key to cologne. When it is fresh it is vibrant and long lasting. A key indicator of when a cologne is old is when it smells like alcohol and it has very poor lasting power.

The music sample clips are mis-leading because the songs \\"Colors of the Wind\\", \\"A Whole New World\\" and \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" all had terrible singers singing along. I don't understand why it is \\"101 Strings Ochestra\\" and then singing for a few of the songs. It feels like there were some singers that loved these songs and just had to sing while the rest are purely instrumental. Those three songs were what made me purchase this CD. Had I known there would be terrible singers singing along to the music, I would not have bought this CD. The music for all of the other songs are really nice though; they are what I was looking for.

From the viewpoint of someone relatively little experience with catamarans, but extensive experience in monohulls, these observations have a ring of truth to them.

It took a couple of listens before I was totally hooked to the overall mood of the album. The album includes a close to perfect four song set that starts with song number five, Dice, and continues with Always, U and This Year. It's almost as if Mr Dybdahl stands in the corner of your living room - or bedroom - while he holds the microphone very close to his mouth and sings a mix of quiet folk and gentle soul. It pays to really to listen to this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thomas Dybdahl is the man...","review":"and I can understand why the public at large can't handle that. His music is so lush, personal, and jumps the genre tags to defy easy classification. They used to call them singer-songwriters, but this generation has no use for the category. I would say he most resembles Astral Weeks era Van Morrison on this album, with some slow jam r&b and string work to boot. That last track is also very similar in sound to Sondre Lerche, the other wunderkind from Norway. Lerche has caught on in large part because his version of chamber pop is more settled in. Dybdahl, on the other hand don't play that way. His music is very emotional and sometimes goes to great lengths to get the listener to feel the undercurrents. As of this writing, I still feel that Dybdahl is the man others wish they could steal from, but they're not talented enough. If he were to tour the states with Ray Lamontaine, that would be amazing, but I'm prepared to be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful box of Jodo!!!","review":"This is the essential Jodorowsky!

I'll say that I have some eclectic tastes and can enjoy a movie that is abstract, artsy or doesn't subscribe to a typical movie format or standard. With that being said, Fando y Lis was a monumental disappointment. I didn't finish watching this movie and to be fair to the dvd set I have not watched the other two movies included. Amateur and pointless are two words that come to mind. I didn't feel like I was being moved in any way, positive or negative. I am not a film maker or student so maybe there were some technical aspects of this film that I would not know to appreciate. Maybe I'll give Holy Mountain a spin and become a believer.

I disliked it early on - but I was determined to see it through. The novel has some wit, some mystery, some cleverness - but oh what an unsatisfying mish-mash.The writing style is skittish - from page one to the finish - so nothing is developed to any extent that you start caring about anything.

He also plays some dixieland, and he doesn't lack in any category of jazz at all. My favorite track on this CD is #6 (New Awlins).

The questions are unique and solutions are OK. There is just one slight issue though, some of the solutions could have been more detailed. The tests are slightly harder than the usual but they provide the student with good training. The author has included a chapter on solving equations and inequalities with TI that accounts for 5 to 10 of the questions in the 2C test; however if this book is used along with the TI book of the same author, it will serve its purpose in a better way.

There was a great let down to find, at the end of the book, that the tactics, trade-offs, and conclusions reached as a result of the Army's study of the new battlefield assault techniques, were never discussed! This isn't about aviators, just an old General reliving a lot of non-combat dreariness he had to contend with. Definately a no-brainer in which the \\"hero's\\" gutter level language distracted, rather than added to the plot - if there even was one."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"General Hospital\\" in Army green","review":"This is a weak series of books, as far as war novels go. They're more like an ongoing soap opera than gritty war drama (think \\"General Hospital\\" as a novel, only set between 1945-1970 and revolving around the Army instead of Port Charles.) The characters are given plenty of time to evolve, and some do (Lowell, in particular.) But it all seems too phony.

I had about 1/2\\" star shape chip, it took more like 6-8 drops of resin in order to be effective for the plunger, it is better to use more than less, otherwise the cracks will not have enough resin. The spillover is easy to wipe off with paper towel. I used CFL black light ($5 from Home Depot) as UV source. Most of the star cracks are completely gone, but the impact site is still there (a dot on the windshield, not too bad). You can buy from Walmart, about the same price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"Some other brands look like they might be easier to use but I've used this one before and it works very good so I'm sticking with it. It's not difficult, but it does require a little reading of instructions and it does take a few minutes. I've used on a few different chips and new spider-cracks. It will stop the spreading of the cracks it seems but it won't make it magically disappear.

There appears to be plenty of extra resin and curing strips in order to make quite a few repairs.It took me approx. 1.5 hours to repair a small chip on my wife's windshield. The damage appears to repaired sufficiently enough to prevent future crack propagation. The damage is still faintly visible. I have had my car's chipped windshield professionally repaired in the past and I feel that the results of using this product is comparable.My only recommendation when using this product is to be generous with the repair resin. The instructions recommend 3-6 drops. When I followed these instructions to the letter I found that a majority of the resin was trapped along the perimeter of the tool. I recommend about 12 drops and make sure to avoid having the droplets touch the side of the chamber."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect a miracle.","review":"Perhaps it was the way my rock chip impacted by windshield, but this product did almost nothing to repair the chip.

I had 7-8 chips on my windshield all very small. I used the suction cup method of 3 of the biggest and it worked fine. As an experiment I tried just using the resin (no suction cup apparatus). I just put a drop of resin in small chips and just covered them with the curing strip and let it sit in the sun for 10mins. It worked perfectly fine. I was surprised and was able to do all 8 or so chips in less than 40mins.One warning, use the resin very sparingly! Unless you have a huge crater 1 drop is more than enough. Also if the resin drops down when you remove the suction cup apparatus, don't worry. Quickly cover it with the curing strip and you wont have to add the extra drop as suggested by the instruction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent results","review":"I was unfortunate to be behind a trailer that had shed something like pea gravel resulting in a couple chips in my windshield.

I have a star crack about 1.25\\" in diameter with the longest crack extending about 3/4 inch from the point of impact. I've read and fallowed the instructions 3 times and after few tries the product did fill in the small spider web like cracks that extend no longer then 1/4\\" from the point of impact but the longer cracks are still there and still visible. The damage does look a little bit better then before the repair but it's definitely nothing like the Before and After picture the manufacturer provides. Honestly I don't really care how it looks as long as it passes the state inspection but I'll find that out in few months.Overall I can only give this product 2 stars, and if you are going to buy this don't expect miracles."},{"rating":"2","title":"fix a windshield","review":"The damage to my windshield was more extensive than the suggested use. There impact mark was actually missing glass and was almost all the way through. The extending cracks were on the inside and outside. This product really helped on the outside cracks.

Great Product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"20% Chance of working","review":"This seems all good in theory and has clearly worked for some people, but not for me.First, only 2 of the 4 suction cups worked. This makes the apparatus much more difficult to use and very uncomfortable on the hands.I had a tiny bullseye type ding, it barely helped that one. I have a larger star crack, and it was useless. It did not penetrate into the cracks. I tried multiple times and consider myself pretty adept at this stuff.

My husband took care of it without even being asked to, and he said it was pretty easy to just follow the instructions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappiontment","review":"This product didn't work at all for me. I had a small chip on my windshield, less than half an inch in size, and I thought this one should be easily repairable using the DIY kits. After reading the reviews, I chose Fix-a-Flat product (had lots of good reviews, and was priced reasonably). It was delivered promptly, everything was included in the package, and it came with detailed instructions, which I followed carefully. Unfortunately, it didn't make the chip any less visible (not to mention disappear). Again, I did read and follow the instructions: cleaned the surfaces thoroughly, centered the applicator, allowed the resin to penetrate and dry as prescribed, got rid of the air bubbles, applied the finishing coat and moved it to direct sun, etc. - no visible improvements at the end. And then I repeated the whole procedure - still to no success. This was not my first DIY project, I've done lots of repairs to my cars - both mechanical and cosmetic, but this one was a total failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Resin works but doesn't repair crack seams well","review":"The resin works ok and does what it's supposed to but the repair device itself doesn't have enough pressure to push the resin into tight crack seams. It would've worked if it was able to push the resin in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked well for me","review":"I'm happy with the results. I had two starburst cracks in my front windshield. One had been there for maybe 3 years, the other added maybe a year and a half ago. After using the kit the older, larger crack is much improved, though still slightly visible. I have to search for the other repaired spot - it's nearly invisible. Only a small chip in the glass remains."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishingly good","review":"This did an astoundingly good job on a star crack with a 1/4 line crack on either side. Far better than I ever imagined or hoped for. Is it completely gone? No, but I'd say it's 95% gone. You really need to look for it now to see it. Usually I find these kind of miracle repair kits tend to be junk but this one really worked."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad at all, maybe even quite good","review":"product was easy to use; directions seemed overwhelming a first, but actually weren't at all. was a very easy process for the chip in my windshield. i needed two applications for the small-ish chip in my windshield, and it doesn't quite 100% conceal it, but it probably could have if i'd done a better job in application. i might still be able to go back and top it off. either way, it totally covers the cracked area and would easily pass inspection - it looks like a tiny abrasion on the windshield now only.i suspect your experience will vary depending exactly on the type/shape of windshield damage, but for a small investment like this, i can't imagine you'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"works well","review":"I don't know if these repairs are permanent. My guess is that it depends strongly on the type and extent of damage. I had a small crack on my windshield that grew to about 2 feet long in 2-3 days. I used this product to fill it in and although it doesn't make it go away 100% it is significantly less noticeable. I have to change the windshield but this made the crack less visible and as far as I can tell it at least slowed the growth giving me some time to go take the car rather than have to rush it to the shop."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't work for me","review":"I followed all the directions carefully, tried it twice, but it had no impact on my crack.

The pressure device did not do anything for my star crack after 3 attempts so I used a lighter on the windshield and the fluid moved into the crack so I thought it would work. I moved the car into the sun and by the time the fluid hardened it had moved out of the crack as well. So I kept trying 3 more times reappling fluid and putting the curing pad on it with the car in the sun over and over. Everytime I would use the lighter on the inside of the window it would fill the crack then after an hour in the sun the fluid was hard but it would keep moving out of the crack. Very frustrating and time consuming. After hours of trying no noticable improvement at all.

But when it came to steps 4 and 5 it mentions that you can reapply the stuff if your bullseye doesn't look filled... i did it anyway just to be sure... but i also left the stuff on my windshield longer than the directions said cause i was also doing other stuff at the same time.. but when i finally scraped off the residue i couldn't find the bullseye anymore... on another note this stuff reminds me of a pleasant smelling vinyl flooring seam sealer, i'm gonna have to try that out on something else"},{"rating":"2","title":"Did WONDERS on my cracked windshield!","review":"It's a little difficult to figure out, but once you get the hang of it, it's easy.

Anthony Keidis was rhyming over rock riffs long before it became fashionable and trendy, and still do it better than most. And speaking of riffs, Flea is a KICK ASS bass player;enough said.

I won't deny that John Frusciante is one to often toss in some tasty licks and that Flea is a technically gifted bassist (if an excruciatingly annoyingly showy one), but it's all overruled by Anthony Kiedis' hideously inept stacatto rapping and his comically atrocious crooning.

First, I got The Hippos album, which brought me great joy (it's a good album and I recommend it highly). THEN, I started listening to this one, and i got real happy. It's a lot like THE HIPPOS album I had just heard, but still brought back soo many great memories. RHCP HAS ruled, DOES rule and WILL ALWAYS rule!

So talented!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best CD's in my Collection","review":"All of their greatest hits plus some other tracks.

This is the song that gave the Chili Peppers their breakthrough in 1989, a dedication to their deceased friend (Hillel Slovak, founding guitarist who died of a heroin overdose in 1988), yet they don't add it. Whatever...\\"Higher Ground\\" and \\"Soul To Squeeze\\" are great songs, but get rid of \\"Parallel Universe\\" or basically anything off of \\"By The Way\\" or \\"Californication.\\" The old stuff is the best. I suggest investing in \\"What Hits?!\\" released in 1992. Better songs, none of this b-s \\"exploring our musical boundaries\\" crap they've been playing lately."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT IN THE WORLD IS THIS?","review":"How in the world can you make a greatest hits and not include your greatest hits??? WHere is KNOCK ME DOWN, ALL AROUND THE WORLD, THE ZEPHRSONG, DONT STOP????? THis Greatest hits has songs on the cd such as UNIVERSALLY SPEAKING that wasn't even released as a single... OTHer than that the songs are great and the new single fortune's faded is classic peppers... BUT if you are really picky about your greatest hits and already have blood,sugar,sex,magic and californication then dont waste your money.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its About Time","review":"This is the first time that a compilation CD of the Red Hot Chili Peppers has been released with a large number of their great songs. What Hits?! is good if you like their early to mid eighties songs, most of which are excluded on this disc. Almost all of their great songs are here including \\"Higher Ground,\\" \\"Under the Bridge,\\" and \\"By the Way.\\" The only disappointing part is that they left off \\"Around the World,\\" which is understandable since it was never a hit single. It is also great that they left off the heavily overplayed \\"Zephyr Song\\" which was played alomst 3-6 times on every rock radio station from September to late December 2002. Still a good hits compilation for the second half of their career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left out some, but great over all","review":"When I first got this CD in December of 2003 I literally played it non stop for most of 2004. I can see why some hardcore fans would be disappointed with the absence of it's more funkier EMI stints (keep in mind even though Higher Ground from the 1989 album Mother's Milk made it on to here it is still a Warner Brothers release so any other songs made during their EMI days would not be on here, you can go to What Hits!? from 1992 for that). I am a hardcore fan, yet I am still not disappointed by this collection. From the raging pounding funk of Give It Away from it's 1991 breakthrough Blood Sugar Sex Magik to their newer funk-punk sound of Fortune Faded and Save The Population, this greatest hits album best displays the diversity in their sound over the years and it goes to show that there is not a better, more creative, and more vibrant band than the everlasting Red Hot Chili Peppers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remember its not best of","review":"People r always saying they missed so many songs on this CD but there wrong. the cover says GREATEST HITS not BEST OF. The were right on for the greatest hits except for the new songs. Anthony, chad, john,(dave for one hot minute), and flea are great musicians and this is all of their major highlight of their careers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD!","review":"OK so maybe they did leave out The Zephyr Song, Around the World, Aeroplane, and Can't Stop, but hey, this is a pretty good CD, especially if you're a newcomer RHCP fan. Myself, I've loved the band ever since I can remember (around 7 years old) and I am a bass player, so Flea is pretty much my idol. He is almost unparalleled as a bass player (except for maybe Les Claypool), and all of the songs on this CD have awesome basslines and are alltogether awesome. I probably should have deducted a point or two for them leaving out the four songs I mentiones at the beginning, but hey, it's an awesome CD, so I'll give it a 5 anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"its chili peppers, so you know its good","review":"however, its not what it could be. its missing some notable songs, including their biggest recent hit Can't Stop. it also has some fairly obscure 'hits' like Universally Speaking. however, it is a great album. although it may seem weird to consider the Red Hot Chili Peppers rock legends, they will be elligible for the rock and roll hall of fame in less than 3 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Big Song Missing","review":"\\"Love Rollercoaster\\" is missing. That was the big \\"Beavis and Butthead Do America\\" hit! And it was a kick ass 'Peppers hit at the time too. I'm a little disappointed so I'll give it a 4. The rest of the album ROCKS!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great cd!","review":"When I heard the chili peppers were coming out with another greatest hits I wasn't sure what to think. I knew they had so many hit songs, and I was afraid they wouldn't put them all on. Even though I love this cd, they missed a lot of great songs that they should have put on.For example:1. Fire2. Knock Me Down3. Power of Equality4. Breaking the Girl5. I Could Have Lied6. Aeroplane7. Warped8. Around the World9. Easily10. Porcelain11. Savior12. Right on Time13. This is the Place14. Dosed15. The Zephyr Song16. Can't Stop17. I Could Die For You18. Midnight19. Tear20. Minor Thing21. Venice QueenI realize these aren't all hit songs, but those are some of my favorite Chili Pepper's songs. I was a bit sad to see that none of those 21 songs were on the cd. However, a few of those songs were on the dvd that came with mine. In conclusion, I liked the cd a lot, but wish they would have added more songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"R.H.C.P.","review":"Great album, great selection of songs for the greatest hits.90% of the songs I like from Red Hot Chili Peppers ate included in this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good stuff, missing lots, HORRID sound quality","review":"I'm not going to into track selection much. You can see the track selection yourself fairly easily. I will say all the songs on this album I enjoy.However, the sound quality is as bad as it gets. It's easily the loudest album I own, and anything that was the chili peppers is flattened out as much as possible. Give It Away is a far, far cry from the original release quality.Do yourself a favor, since RHCP have only released a few albums in the past 15 years, pick those up individually (you'll get 90% of this Greatest Of by picking up their last 3 releases). Then track down the ORIGINAL ISSUES of RHCP's early stuff, they used to care about sound quality and had some really great stuff back in the day. Just don't get fooled by the \\"Remastered\\" editions, they will have hacked sound quality just so it can sound as loud as modern releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is A Band That's In Dier Need Of Some Talent","review":"Red hot chili peppers suck...why waste my time telling you people why.

I found Barrett's style and imagery wonderful.For example, Erasmus, a naturalist, loses his toes andthen compares walking on his shortened feet to the sensationof walking like a deer on hooves.The characters are described so well that they reallycome alive. The science and geography are wonderfullyresearched, and the story is so well told! Weeks laterI still find myself thinking about passages from thisbook. The book is full of beautiful, insightful paragraphsand a story self-discovery (from people of various cultures)that I really enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting story/literary disappointment","review":"The reviews seemed to promise something extraordinary, the theme was of great interest, but the reading was a disappointment from the beginning to the end. As an adventure story it was only modestly gripping (unlike, perhaps, \\"Endurance\\"); as a character study I read all but felt I knew none, their inner lives being only sketchily developed. The book displayed scholarly knowledge, and as a development of time and place it was useful. Altogether though, it was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arctic arrogance and melodrama","review":"After reading other customer and critical reviews I think we need some balance here. I was looking forward to this book and then terribly disappointed when I got into it. What a great idea for a plot! What great research on the setting! What an unbelievable man is Zeke: a devil with a fox on his shoulder. The women tend to be simpletons, so we are left with Erasmus and Ned as the only real people in the book. The plot bogged down in unbelievable detail, and the ending was pure romance novel. Not for me. I am fascinated by writing about the Arctic, but I'll stick with \\"Arctic Dreams.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but not a success","review":"The subject matter of The Voyage of the Narwhal is exceedingly interesting, and Ms. Barrett's meticulous research comes through beautifully during the descriptions of the Arctic wilderness and the historical expeditions that either came before or were going on concurrent with the fictional one of the Narwhal. But unfortunately, the subject cannot overcome the almost amateurish character exposition and the uneven dialogue. Barrett is never comfortable letting a character's actions speak for themselves, instead rushing to bludgeon the reader with thesis statement sentences at the end of nearly every exchange. It's depressing. Also, the last fifty or so pages of the book are something of a train wreck, as the conclusion of the action is a motley assortment of different and equally unsatisfying plotlines contorting together to form an ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Considering the hype, disappointing.","review":"This book has received copious accolades from critical reviews, however, I was disappointed that the writing was so weak. An interesting enough story of a natural historian's recollections of his arctic journey, the story seemed to lose it's emotional charge when the setting returned to Philadelphia. I would have enjoyed more focus on the arctic exploration and interaction with the Esquimaux. I never did bond with the protagonist. Rudy Wiebe's, \\"Discovery of Strangers\\" is a much better read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent writing, gripping atmosphere","review":"This was one of the best modern books I've ever read. I know it's always a matter of taste, but it really surprises me to read other readers' negative reviews. Barrett did an excellent job of revealing the characters, drew me into their conflicts, showed me the Arctic, told me about Victorian naturalists, and kept my interest from beginning to end. If you liked this, read \\"Vindication\\" by Frances Sherwood, a fictionalized life of Mary Woolstonecraft. Also, see the movie, \\"Angels and Insects.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good, Absorbing Read","review":"I enjoyed this book, although I wouldn't put it up there with my \\"read again\\" adventure books. The Author has done a great job creating a work of fiction that is believable and engaging. Normally, I enjoy reading \\"real life\\" accounts, such as Shackelton's \\"Endurance.\\" Despite the fact that this story is not based on actual events it holds up as if it could have been. A nice way to contrast this book is to hold it up to a true favorite. Mine is Irving Stone's \\"The Origin.\\" Barrett's book held my attention as did Stone's, but I will not read it again as I have Stone's, many times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling in More Ways than One","review":"I chose the book because it features a 19th-century arctic sea adventure and its toll on a small crew who have to face its challenges. I was not disappointed. Amidst ship life with its own chain-of-command protocols and other policies/procedures, the crew's battle with the arctic elements was starkly portrayed and interesting. And even more interesting were the relationships, betrayals, and loves along the way. I was really drawn into this narrative. The characters face physical and emotional challenges that make you wonder how you would have fared."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull writing about a fascinating subject!","review":"An extremely intersting subject, I found the descriptive passages about the Narwhal's ice-bound polar expedition rather pallid and colorless. It was very difficult relating to these mid-nineteenth century characters who, more often than not, spoke and thought in uncharacteristic nineteenth century speech. Character developent was not only poor but sloppy. Alexandra, Erasmus' amour propre, turns out to be the most interesting person in the novel but is given very meager development and so comes across as a proto-feminist. Erasmus fails to evoke sympathy; he's such a nerd. Zeke is a villain and a rather empty character at that, despite all his bombast. Even the native polar peoples are portrayed as faceless, good-natured stereotypes. A lost opportunity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many agendas","review":"I love stories about ice and snow and I wanted to love this book, but I was disappointed. The author has crammed in so many political and scholarly agendas that plot and characterization seem like afterthoughts. Not that I disagree with those agendas, or couldn't be convinced, but this could have been done with more subtlety and skill. The stilted style may be an attempt to imitate the exploreres of the period, and sometimes it succeeds, but more often just comes off as bad writing. The bits of history (human and natural), which were the main draw for me, got lost in the unconvincing and blatantly revisionist struggle between Erasmus, 19th-century New Age guy, and ruthless powermonger Zeke. Ho, hum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, but tough reading","review":"I had high expectations of this book and was therefore disappointed. The story seemed to be exciting, but I had too much trouble with ship and navigation jargon to even want to complete the book. I imagine that it was intended for people with more knowledge of ships, navigation tools, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Read a Novel -- Read the Real Thing","review":"As pointed out by others, this novel does a good job giving a reasonably accurate picture of the arctic but does a lousy job of developing characters or an entertaining story line. Given these facts, there is no reason to read this novel. Rather, pick up a book that describes actual arctic explorations and you will get a more detailed and accurate picture of the arctic. Read what Nansen saw and did, read about the Kane expedition (for real), or read a survey of arctic expeditions such as Fergus Fleming's Ninety Degrees North. But don't read this weak story. It has nothing to add."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensuous","review":"Rich, multi-layered and gloriously textured, I found the book completely absorbing. Not for literary lightweights as the complexity of characters and the depth of scientific theory is challenging. I was particularly impressed by the author's insight into the mysticism of the Inuit people. She is at her best when looking out at the world from behind Annie's eyes. Also, a most interesting commentary on bigotry in this era of politically covert bigotry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Frost-Bitten Read","review":"This was one of my favourite novels of 1999. Barrett's impressive research and attention to detail comes through on every single page of this beautifully crafted book. It is not just the story itself that captures your attention, it is the entire presentation that draws you in as well. From the extracts from old scientific works to the line drawings and the prose style, this novel carries you back to the nineteenth century brilliantly. Barrett's story contains great insights into why some men in the nineteenth century were driven to undertake seemingly insane expeditions into the Arctic. Greed, ambition and the potential for fame and acclamation ranked foremost, while the quest for knowledge oftentimes came last.Fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good! Moving and a good read","review":"This book fascinated me because of my non-fiction reading about exploration of the Arctic in the 1800s. The Arctic itself seems to symbolize the loneliness of Erasmus, his frozen interior. His voyage of discovery is the voyage out to the world, after years of a sort of living death.I liked the way Ms. Barrett captured the age-old problem of the egocentric human being trying to dominate and control the environment around him and the people in it. Tragedy, of course, inevitably follows. Public discourse can be shaped by such men, self-serving and thoughtless to the last.The kidnapping and return of the Eskimo boy is a bit farfetched, but satisfying to the reader.A book that makes you think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"Not a bad read, but it pales in comparison to the real thing. I refer to Roland Huntford's \\"The Last Place on Earth,\\" the story of Scott and Amundsen's race to the South Pole. What a story! Truth is indeed stranger than fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the region of Ice","review":"I so wanted to love this novel, and for the first hundred pages or so, I did. Moody and atmospheric,it held the promise of being a stark exploration of the cost of exploration: the cost to the explorers and to those they \\"found.\\" I was hoping this fiction would do what fiction does best, i.e., provide a much needed antidote to our misguided (but cherished) myths of fearless voyagers, etc, most recently and notably celebrated in Stephen Ambrose's fervent\\"history\\" of Lewis and Clark. But I found that, as the Narwhal's voyage founders, so does the novel. The main character turns out to be a sort of 19th century slacker, ultimately redeemed by the love of a good woman, and well, you know the rest. A noble attempt, but ultimately not redeemed by Barrett's haunting prose style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Narwhal Revue","review":"Larry- This is the third time I've written this, hopefully this time it will work. Anyway, I thought the book was too plot driven and had little if any characterization about any minor character. Furthermore, it seemed to be a overly researched book. By that I mean that creativity was lost due to the adherence to facts. And, for being a plotty book, it was too long. The main story should end when they return from the voyage. The remainder from the book from that point on is dull and drag. The best part about the book was its neat cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and Unrealistic. Poorly Researched","review":"Having an interest in arctic exploration and being told I don't read enough fiction I picked this book up with high expectations. I suffered through the character development which could've been over looked if the rest of the story had any substance to it. This book will entertain only those who are ignorant of what is really necessary to undertake such an endeavor. It's obvious the author took the \\"canned approach\\" and only brushed up enough on arctic exploration to hang some thinly disguised window dressing. I'm sorry-this was a major disappointment. I would've given a ZERO RATING, but it wasn't an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barret's on Conrad","review":"What drew me to this book was the blurb that compared the author to Joseph Conrad, specifically this book was compared to Lord Jim. Nothing could be farther from the truth. There's no passion in the pages. Characters are flat and predictable. This story was far beyond the author's ability to tell it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of Character Development","review":"I struggled to finish this book. The characters were not engaging.

It sounds like it was the stuff which couldn't have managed on \\"Blood Sugar...\\" and has been postponed; but it is supposed to be a brand new stuff to compensate these 4 years of waiting! Neither heavy nor funky enough; sounds like an average grunge (!?) and will be soon forgotten. There are only few songs likely to remain - \\"Around The World\\", \\"Scar Tissue\\", \\"Otherside\\", \\"Savior\\" and maybe two more; elsewhere I fell like I'm listening to a band which plays keyboard only. So - don't look for the stuff like \\"Apache Rose Peacock\\" or \\"Warped\\" - you won't find it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of RHCP","review":"This is a terrible album.

If you want real RHCP, listen to their old stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they trying to do? Put us to sleep?","review":"I have been a fan of the Chili Peppers for eight years, and this highly anticipated album was a HUGE letdown for me. The energy and fun, carefree style that was apparent on such spectacular albums such as Bloodsugarsexmagik and Mother's Milk have been exchanged for the same droning and depressing crap that makes up the majority of modern music. I almost liked \\"Around the World\\" and \\"Get on Top,\\" but for the most part, this new album is a total waste. Some people say that the Chili Peppers have grown up, but I say that they've SOLD OUT. But then again, who knows, they might just make up for this in a few years...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great new album from RHCP","review":"This, I think is RHCP's 2nd best album. \\"Around the World\\", \\"Parallel Universe\\", Scar Tissue\\", \\"Otherside\\", \\"Californication\\" and \\"Road Trippin\\" are probably the greatest songs on the album. Fantastic. 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat of a disappointment","review":"I am a hard core RHCP fan and have listened to their previous 2 cds hundreds of times, particularly bssm.

The sound quality is horrendous. More often than not everything was recorded too loud and it distorts. On top of that, the album is half filler material. Out of the first 6 songs, 5 are decent. After that the album pulls a complete 180. The songs just are not good songs. I only listened to the secondf half of the cd twice. The second time was to make sure i hated it as much as the first.

Somewhat nonsence lyrics, but great to listen to, and features a bit of what Flea is capable of on bass. I would have rated this album a 5 star, but I feel that dissing the very state that made them famous was sort of a slap to those who hail from the state and have nothing to do with the \\"Californication\\" they speak of in at least 2 of their songs. Either way, it's good ear candy, and a great album for those road trips. This album works extra good with Kicker Bass systems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vinyl Review","review":"First of all, must say that the album is EXCELLENT and one of my faves by the RHCP. However, the vinyl was incredibly disappointing. The mix was off and not balanced at all. I would've expected more from such an incredible group. If you are looking to add any RCHP to your vinyl collection, I recommend passing on this (unless you want it just for the sake of owning it) and getting Blood Sugar Sex Magik instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"You say hello & then i say I DO","review":"Ohhh man...Classic album up the wazoo! RHCP have evolved greatly since their joke-like beginning, and Californication is one great song after another. \\"Around the World\\" is splendid starter to this amazing masterpiece, and one of the best guitar jams ever. I am oh so glad that John Frusciante came back for the recording and continuous guitar player for the band, because he is one SICK guitarist. Without him, the Red Hots wouldn't be where they are today. All of the singles off this album are excellent, and even the lesser known jams, such as \\"Purple Stain\\", make one want to jump up and dance. I love this album, and can't believe that it came out almost 10 years ago! wow."},{"rating":"2","title":"full of energy","review":"This album is full of energy. This album is so much better than One Hot Minute, but it doesn't reach the lofty heights of Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magik (they'll never be able to top that one). Regardless, this one is a keeper. For some of you, it may take a while to grow on you, but it will grow. Sit back, drink a beer and let it all sink in. Buy it. Enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Chili Peppers are BACK!","review":"One word can describe this CD, awesome. It puts One Hot Minute to shame (which is actually not all that bad). Memories of listening to Blood Sugar Sex Magik are evoked after listening to this CD. All the songs are great and cannot wait to see them in Denver with STP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dream of californication","review":"The Red Hot Chili Peppers are one of the best bands. However, they have grown up a lot, and when I last saw them at the Video Music Awards for MTV (2000 edition) they were sporting mohawks. The best songs on this CD include \\"Around the World\\", \\"Californication\\", and \\"The Otherside\\". If you liked this, check out: KoRn-Issues, Red Hot Chili Peppers-Mother's Milk, Kid Rock-History of Rock, Kid Rock-Devil Without a Cause, Limp Bizkit-Significant Other, Limp Bizkit-Chocolate Starfish & The Hotdog Flavored Water, and Eminem-The Marshall Mathers LP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good effort, so-so recording!","review":"Not being a big RHCP fan, I thought I'd give this one a try. Catchy songs (Scar-tissue and Otherside) certainly catch my attention, however, the recording is sub-par (technically speaking). The mixing is not too hot, nor is the recording, which makes the listening experience not as enjoyable as it could be. Fix that and they get 5 stars from me!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I have no idea why everybody likes this record. It's boring, slightly annoying, and only occasionally rock'n roll. Fans only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from the Peppers' best.","review":"I've loved the Peppers for more than 10 years, and this album is a big disappointment. There are exactly 5 good songs on it: \\"Scar Tissue,\\" \\"Otherside,\\" \\"Californication,\\" \\"This Velvet Glove,\\" and \\"Road Trippin'.\\" The rest are either mediocre (\\"Around the World,\\" \\"Easily\\") or flat-out suck (\\"I Like Dirt,\\" \\"Savior,\\" \\"Right on Time,\\" etc.) The best Chili Peppers albums are Mother's Milk and Uplift Mofo Party Plan. They're just killer. Blood Sugar rounds out their top 3 albums. But even with Frusciante's return, the Peppers drop the ball on this tepid release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exactly 3 good songs...maybe 4","review":"This is one of the weakest Peppers albums (and I have them all). It's a little better than \\"One Hot Minute,\\" but so is just about anything else. The boys sound like they're fakin' the funk. \\"Around the World\\" is a weak ripoff of the superior \\"Power of Equality,\\" and tracks such as \\"I Like Dirt\\" and \\"Porcelain\\" are just half-baked. The best cuts here are \\"Scar Tissue,\\" \\"Californication\\" and \\"This Velvet Glove.\\" The worst are \\"Get On Top,\\" \\"Purple Stain\\" and \\"Right On Time.\\" Everything else is just mediocre. Come on, boys, give us an album worthy of the Chili Pepper name, will ya?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really not very good","review":"I am a huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge Chili Peppers fan, but this latest album just doesn't have it. There are maybe 4 good songs on here, possibly 5. The rest are weak. I love the raw, fiery, passionate Peppers (see Mother's Milk and Uplift Mofo), not the soggy, boring, limp Peppers (which is what we have here). This is SO FAR from their best album it's not even funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yesterday's news, yesterday's music","review":"Don't get me wrong, this is a good band, or used to be.

Anthony gives some funky lyrics and smooth too. Chad is very influential and knows how to drum. I'm a huge fan so buy this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN...","review":"Another album from the always overrated (and musically untalented) Red Hot Chili Peppers. That's all that can be said. Same sound, same irritating pseudo-hip lyrics, all around just the same as any of their other albums. All the popularity of this band is their trendiness (chicks dig Anthony Kiedis) but that's not a reason to buy someone's music. Yes, their radio interviews are extremely amusing, but mundane lyrics (Some of the songs, Kiedis makes unintelligle sounds when he can't think of anything else to sing), and a shot at psychodelic revival can't save this album. If you want the good stuff, listen to Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Now THAT was good."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Was Disappointed","review":"I bought this CD hoping to have another great pepper album.

I don't know if this happens on all the Californication CD's, but on mine there is a lot of extremely annoying static and hissing throughout most of the songs that just ruins them.

There is plenty of good music out there waiting for you. Why settle on drivel like this? Possibly because you will appear so hip and now by being seen with it in your cd rack?

The Peppers were the Bizkit of the 80's. Then they threw out this overproduced album and all the Peppers fans rejoice in drooling praise because its actually quite musical and catchy, something thats been rather lacking in past Peppers albums. Yes, the trendy nudity-loving band makes a purely commercial album and people automatically fall in love, never even stopping to consider the band's \\"integrity\\" because they've just taken it for granted for so long. This is the Pepper's 'Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome back, John","review":"While not the immediate high that Blood Sugar was, this album becomes better and better after each listen. Once \\"Around the World\\" kicks in, you know the Peppers are back...for real this time. Yes, most of the album is mellower than their earlier works, but that doesn't mean it's not really good. Anthony's voice and vocal melodies are better than ever and the band is TIGHT!! If you don't like it the first time through, give it a chance. Not as good as Blood Sugar, or even Freaky Styly, but then again, will anything ever top those albums??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Navarro or Bust","review":"I don't like these guys without Dave Navarro.

Don't get me wrong, I think this cd is great, but only the first 4 songs on it do any justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous - every song is great","review":"I have never bought a RHCP CD before. Every one of the 15 tracks is great. I can't quit listening to it. I think these guys are geniuses. I highly recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop comparing to BSSM","review":"Yes BSSM is a great album and the chili peppers haven't matched it with this one, but still an album as good as BSSM is kind of a once in a lifetime thing. I approached it without this expectation and i thought it was pretty good. Most of the tracks are just ok, but some of my favorite songs are on here like around the world, scar tissue, otherside, californication, get on top,easily, i like dirt, this velvet glove and road trippin."},{"rating":"2","title":"This rocks!","review":"After Navarro ruined the Chili Peppers sound, I didn't think they'd ever find the lost magic.

This might be their best album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Blood Sugar?","review":"this is a great CD...destined to become the best chili peppers album, its not as long as BSSM but a classic nonetheless, and it could have done in a short time span what it took BSSM to do in 17 tracks....awsome"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uggh","review":"I remeber liking this when I bought it, somehow....Nowadays I find it to be irritating CD which for some odd reason everybody likes, I think that came about when I started listening to CD's and records because they had something to give me, the Peppers don't.Nothing on this album has anything that I can relate to, and in fact most of the album is extremley irritating to me. So I can't say stay away allthough I can say I don't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad effects of drug abuse.","review":"Get into rehab--not the studio. They sound very, very tired on this.

Also, they seem to have a real fixation on Mr. Bungle--they keep copying their musical ideas, but far too late."},{"rating":"1","title":"They've lost it!","review":"...this album is so bland and dull that it makes One Hot Minute sound good! Lyrics and vocals on this record are extremely painful to listen to... I want my money back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Melodic and catchy","review":"Although Californication doesn't have the impact of Blood Sugar Sex Magic, it certainly conveys more feeling, emotion, and coherency than One Hot Minute. The songs revolve around a central theme and work perfectly together to create a melodic, catchy, and altogether memorable album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Red Hots have outdone themselves","review":"Just a gorgeous record for anyone who loves music.

Demasiado bueno!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Californication-Red Hot Chili Peppers","review":"The \\"Californication\\" album by the Chili Peppers was by far their best album yet. It is a universal album that will open you up into a new world of music. One of the best things about Californication is that it was the come back album of John Frusiante. After being away from the band for a few years and cleaning his life up after his drug addiction he once again shows off he god-given talent. He has his own style that is unmatched in all senses. With his return the band has become closer, stronger, and more powerful then ever. Now with their follow up album \\"By The Way\\" they are showing the world that they are as strong as ever and \\"Californication\\" will always be a phenomenon in itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"1999: year of the peppers? Nope","review":"As the first person to review this Cd, I have to say, don't pay the extra cash to get this version.

This album did not deliver. The only real good song was the first single \\"Scar Tissue\\". The other songs are very tedious to listen to. They lost a lot of the hardcore funk they used to have which is brought out a bit in \\"Around the World\\", but the song is hardly catchy at all. The other singles \\"Otherside\\" and \\"Californication\\" are very boring and offer nothing to do with the Red Hot Chili Peppers of the past. And Flea, one of the best bass players ever, fails to even show a glimpse of his talent in any song. If you're going to buy a RHCP Cd, get a different one than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of hard earned","review":"What a disappointment after One Hot Minute.

But hey, the radio likes so it can't be that bad ??!!??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good, But Needs a Little Somthing Else","review":"As a 12-year-old kid, I enjoy this CD very much. It includes several of the popular songs that are being played on the radio today, and a lot of the songs on the disc that are not broadcasted on the radio are surprisingly good. But some of the lesser-known songs have a little too much of the group's original funk in them. Despite that little detail, the CD is an overall success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is the Chili Peppers best so far. The vocals are great and the music funky.

In some ways, similar to Blood Sugar Sex Magik, (because they've returned to a familiar funk-rock form on some songs), but also softer and more profound. This band is definately not just a one-hit wonder, and have indeed again proven themselves to be talented musicians.

This in many ways lays the ground work for \\"By The Way\\" and shows off the effectiveness and versatility of this band. In comparison to their previous records I will admit that BSSM is imposssible to beat, but I will say that this goes into new territory that they continue to develop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maturing Chili Peppers","review":"Noticeably more mature work than the masterpiece \\"BloodSugarSexMagik,\\" \\"Californication\\" contains more storytelling and a different kind of message with more complex melodies and more subtle instrumentation.

Californiacation is definitely a good album. The songs are catchy and the lyrics are meaningful (not just random swear words coming out in anger, which is really stupid). I do not give this CD 5 stars, because, honestly, besides the 4 big songs so far (Around The World, Scar Tissue, Otherside, and my personal favorite Californiacation), the songs are not outstanding, however, you can definitely listen to this whole CD the whole way through without skipping past bad songs, because there aren't any. These guys have talent, and if you actually appreciate good music, you will definitely like this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great record, awful production","review":"Californication is a spectacular album.

Brickwalled PoS. 4 star album.","review":"The Loudness War will kill your hi-fi system. This record sounds so awful when pumped in volume it is unlistenable. It's pretty sad it has come to this with music. There are literally no dynamics left on this disc. There is one mastered level of every peak and dip in the waveform meaning zero dynamics and it just gets louder and more obnoxious when you turn the knob. It's really sad people have to listen to this and even more sad record companies think these albums are good for anything but coasters. Even on your ipod this one sounds like complete and utter ****.Some really good tunes by the Peppers but just try pumping this on your 5k system and you will be in tears at how awful it sounds. Sadly all of their albums here on out sound pretty much the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Songs = good, vinyl = terrible","review":"I love the songs as you can hear them on the CD. Beware of listening to the vinyl on a good HiFi rig, however, because it's awful. It's compressed, oversaturated, and just sounds awful.To be honest it's the same as Led Zeppelin on vinyl......love the songs, but the vinyl version either points out how terrible the recordings were made, or some other limitation in the process.Boo to Amazon for not differentiating the medium as the reviews are recorded (I doubt that 875 people reviewed the vinyl version).

The mixing is so supurb that you won't believe it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit of a disappointment - but has some high points","review":"I've never been much of a Chili Peppers fan but I bought this CD because I liked Scar Tissue and the title track (even thought I think people will agree with me that \\"californication\\" was far overplayed on the radio). I was hoping that the rest of the tracks would be as mainstream oriented and well-crafted as these tracks but unfortunately, they aren't quite as catchy. The songs have most of the right elements but don't seem like much effort was put into making them sound as good as they could. Still, Otherside, Parallel Universe, and All Around the World are high points. In all honesty, I don't have much chili peppers experience to base my opinions on so I find it likely that fans would find much more in this album than I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you John Frusciante!","review":"Is there any doubt that John Frusciante is the true heart and soul of RHCP? His guitar work is so masterful and unique. He has a style and a sound that, when you hear it, you know exactly who is playing. Given that, Californication is a true throwback album for RHCP. The songs are heartfelt and the music is top-notch.RHCP were lost in the mid-90's with many would-be lead guitarists. Thank you, John, for centering yourself and this band once again. I look forward to more great RHCP music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chili peppers with the comeback...","review":"Chili Peppers came threw on this one. This cd is real good.

In my opinion all of the songs are worth listening to. I like how they are still incorprating funk and rock together, what a combonation. I saw them in concert before and this was right before they released Californication. They mostly played their new songs, the crowd couldn't really get into it, but now if they played, it would be a frenzie.

Scary isn't it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A natural progression of the rock/funk masters","review":"I think this represents a natural progression of the Peppers. To some this sounds way too mellow, but I think that the passion still burns, its just less obvious. The lyrics and music reflect a more mature band with bigger issues on their mind. Lets face it, we all grow up. I think that they are growing in a positive direction and are more comfortable and confident in their music. The true Peppers fan will appreciate the mood and vibe of these tunes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a studio band...","review":"REd Hot is not able to perform decently live. This is just a studio band. Their live performances are something that defies reasonable explanation. Their performance in ROCK IN RIO III, in RIo de Janeiro, Brazil, in January, 2001 was something so bad that people could not believe. THose who were fans got disappointed at extreme; those who were not, never will think of buying anything from the band again.

Buy this album if you liked different aspects of them over the years and you didn't like all of what you heard. If you liked the funky but hated the speed or if you liked emotions but hated the grunge feel or vice versa buy this cd!!!!! It has everything that (in my mind) encompases a red hot chili peppers cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great New Album","review":"I was waiting for this album for a very long time and I'm happy to say it was well worth the wait. This is there most consistent album and best album, (Although Dave Navarro was a better Guitarist) Anthony has never sound better.

This CD Rocks in a not so friendly rock world."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent recording","review":"I got this disc soon after it was released and I absolutely love it.

Despite a couple of irritating songs (like \\"Get On Top\\"), it's a good mix of mostly upbeat tunes spliced with mature ballads.

It's great work-out music, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dude","review":"I thought that the album was cool, and I like the old Chili Peppers stuff, but the new one is good, too. Very different, reminds me more of Under The Bridge, which is not bad, just different. I think that perhaps they might lose a couple of their hardcore funk fans in the process, but I think it is definetly worth purchasing.Peace"},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless","review":"This is the worst RHCP album by far. Up until One Hot Minute, the Peppers improved with every album. BSSM is an absolute masterpiece, a funk-rock explosion. I have listened to BSSM and Mother's Milk thousands of times. Californication is dull, boring, and shows little musicianship. The songs are grungy sounding and not exciting and driving. This is Chili Peppers at their worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucked","review":"This Cd is like all the others but diffrent words i like the band but they need some new tones"},{"rating":"1","title":"a couple stars for a couple of songs","review":"i hated this cd.i don't really know how else to put it. it can be really insightful at times, like in the title track 'californication', but just plain disguisting in others ('i like dirt' about licking people, 'purple stain' singing about menustration).it seems that even though the chili peppers are one of my favorite bands, their hits do not quite represent their real sound.the song 'scar tissue' sticks out sorely on this cd. and that is supposed to be their huge hit. eventually, it has played itself out for me.to avoid: 'get on top', 'purple stain', 'i like dirt', and 'emit remmus'.of note: 'otherside' (very good, but melancholoy), 'easily', 'around the world', 'californication'.the chili peppers are losing their spice."},{"rating":"1","title":"flea is tight on bass","review":"very boring album and run of the mill.i like maybe a couple of there songs but i'd take fishbone over them on talent alone.cuz aside from flea this group has wack arrangements so-so productions and who told anthony kedis that's singing?"},{"rating":"1","title":"what a letdown!!!","review":"keep thinking that the peppers might be able to go back to their funk roots and recapture the early energy that set them so far apart from the norm--- once again they seem to have missed the point and once again we have to wait for the next album that might be the answer... very dissapointing to be honest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty cool","review":"With all the reviews already written, I can't add too much more except to say that this is probably the Pepper's most consistent CD. Slowing down the tempo and cleaning up some of the language didn't hurt either. My favorites are 'All Around the World', the title track and the trippy 'Road Trippin'. A great CD for old and new fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the RHCP!","review":"Definitely one of the best on my shelf right now. If you like roadtrip songs, you have to buy this cd! Parallel Universe is great- kind of techno-like, but with a great melody. Scar Tissue is a wonderfully written song, but definitely overplayed on the radio, so I'm sick of it right now. Let's see...what else? I was reading some of the other customer reviews for Californication- someone described \\"Otherside\\" as beautiful; I think that's the perfect word. I've heard it so many times, but I'm not sick of it yet! I really like Savior too- it's not as laidback as the other songs, but it's very emotional- it has that something extra that I like in certain songs. Oh, something that might encourage you to buy this cd- I went out yesterday and bought 5 new cds, but I have hardly listened to any of them because I've been listening to Californication. After having it for 2 weeks, I just keep coming back to it. The other cds just don't compare!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chili Peppers reign supreme...","review":"The Red Hot Chili Peppers are definitely a band with a past fit for a made-for-tv movie. They've had their ups and downs, personally and musically. Now, with Californication, they are at the peak of both. An album about past problems, obstacles that have been overcome, and the realization of the talent they are, Californication is what I believe to be their very best. \\"Californication\\" is arguably the best Chili Peppers song ever recorded. The album is a rock and roll roller coaster, flawlessly sliding between fast rocket rides (Around the World, Otherside, Get On Top, & I Like Dirt) to the slower sounds such as Scar Tissue, Californication, & Road Trippin', just to name a few. At their creative peak, one can only hope that the Chili Peppers keep it going..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Weak","review":"Aside from Around the World, Parallel Universe, Scar Tissue, and Californication, this CD has very little to offer. It's just not fun to listen to lyrically and musically after song #6. Sound quality is very poor too. It distorts alot. If you're looking for another BSSM or Mothers Milk type cd, this isn't it. A step down from One Hot Minute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"The Chili's produce another stunning album with the return of guitarest john Frusciante. I like most rock bands from the nineties, such as Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins, Jane's Adiction, sound garden etc...., but the Chili Peppers just leave them standing in the past. Their music is individual, blending raw emotion with funky guitar riffs. And if this isn't enough to sway your views they are made all the more deserving by the death of their first guitarist, Hillel Slovak, and they still mannaged to come back stronger and create some on the most original and inventive music ever.The Red Hot Chili Peppers will always be remembered as one of the most entertaining bands ever, rivaling The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD, but a big change from the past...","review":"This is w/o a doubt one of the best of 1999. Very good lyrics. Every song is catchy amd well-scripted. Its easy to tell a lot of work was put in. A good variety (Californication and Right on Time are a world apart) Yet, I wish younger fans would listen to Blood Sugar Sex Magik, their 1991 release. It's one of the top albums of the 1990's (voted as top) and if you are picking up Californication, pick up BSSM too. Seriousely, it's good, maybe better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album of 1999","review":"Californication was a great album. All kinds of people liked it- long time Chili Peppers fans and pop-radio, as the sales reflected. They won best song of the year for \\"Scar Tissue\\", and wrote a great, meandering album. It starts off strong with \\"Around The World\\", which mixes up the old hip-hop-funk sound the Chilis used to have with the new-age poppy sound that is prelevant on this album. The album is a success. This is a great album, don't take the four star rating wrong. I give it four because it's not as good as other stuff of theirs. In my opinion, Blood Sugar Sex Magik and Mothers Milk deserve 5 stars, Freaky Styley and Californication 4 stars (those are all the Chili albums I own) Good songs here are: Around The World, Scar Tissue, Otherside, Parallel Universe, Road Trippin', and Emit Remmus. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Musicians\\\\","review":"I am not much of a rock fan, but this is definetly a worthy album! \\"Porcelin\\" is just great, and \\"Road Trippin\\" is just as good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"YEAH!!!!! They STILL GOT IT!!!!!!","review":"This album rules, it shows that the Peppers aren't one of those me too bands, it sounds different from everything else...BUY IT NOW!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"spark one and kick back","review":"I've never really been a chili peppers fan. I always kind of liked they're music, but not enough to go out and buy one of their CDs. But after I heard \\"Scar Tissue\\" I had to go pick this one up. I popped it in my truck CD player and was extremely impressed with what I heard. This is a pretty mellow album in comparison to anything else they've done, and that's what's good about it. You can sit back, spark a doob, and just listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"More funky rock n'roll from the Chili Peppers","review":"Another fine album from the Red Hot Chili Peppers. My favourite moments from the album are \\"Scar Tissue\\", \\"Otherside\\" and \\"Californication\\". It misses out on a five star review because I feel it is not as strong an album as the sublime \\"Blood sugar sex magik\\" or it's predecessor \\"One hot minute\\" plus the fact that the word \\"California\\" seems to find it's way into almost every song!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am sorry guys...","review":"I really wasn't too impressed with this cd. The only songs I liked from it were the singles...\\"Scar Tissue,\\" \\"Around The World,\\" \\"The Other Side,\\" and \\"Californication.\\"I am sorry guys, you are a great band, but I didn't enjoy this cd as much as I thought I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication","review":"I feel like a jerk for giving this 4 stars. You know all the praise and I definately feel that \\"Californication\\" and \\"Otherside\\" are some of the greatest the Peppers have done. Although after One Hot Minute and Blood Sugar Sex Magik this isn't such a bad album. Peppers fans should definately buy it. It's not the best they've done but it's good. And that's good enough to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"As stated below, 5 good songs","review":"Well, in the review below it was stated \\"there were 5 good songs, it must be a good CD.\\" Come on! If there's only 5 good songs out of FIFTEEN songs, that means that this band is going WAY downhill as it has been for years. I can't believe the other comment either, \\"I rate a CD as good if it had 3 good songs in it.\\" Oh my! You must have money to spend because I dont buy any CD unless at least 3/4 of the songs are good. Well this goes to show how loyal (and ignorant) fans are. Hope you have a nice day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A CD that I would recomend to anyone....","review":"This cd is awesome. I highly recomend it to anyone that loves the chillipeppers or just loves great music. The lyrics are awesome and really meaningful. Each song is very different and very unique. This isn't a cd that you can ever get sick of. This is an album that contains not just one great hit, but 15. If you are going to spend your money on an album this is a great one."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best of 1999","review":"I was not a HUGE Chili Peppers fan prior to purchasing the CD, but I did like their music. After one listen through, this might have been the best CD I have ever listened too. Four of the first five tracks are filled with energy and there isn't a bad track here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Californication is poetically amazing","review":"I have always liked the Chili Peppers, but now they have heavily impressed me not only as a music lover, but also a poet and a heavy thinker. With such delicious songs like \\"Parellel Universe,\\" \\"Californication,\\" and \\"Otherside,\\" they tickle my poetic pallate like very very few bands do these days. I would say that they have reached a Jim Morrison like quality with their poetic lyrics this time around. That and they're not afraid to say that they like dirt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their RED HOT!!","review":"This is a great work of art. With John back, the Red Hot Chilli Peppers have great songs like OTHERSIDE, SCAR TISSUE, and a soothing riff called ROAD TRIPPIN'. This cd still has some of the hard rocking stuff on it. I always like to fall asleep to the vocals of Anthony Kiedas. The only thing I can tell you is that you have to experience this great cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"You want this one","review":"This is definetly the best record of the year and probably one of the top five that I own. If you think that Scar Tissue and OOtherside are good, then hold on to your socks because I don't think that they are the best on the album. Check out Easily and Californication for incredible lyrics. It is great to see the Peppers back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album, awful mastering.","review":"As the reviewer below pointed out, this CD has absolutely awful mastering. This is one of the worst examples of audio compression on a professionally mastered CD that exists, and it is disgusting. They have tried to make it so loud, that the music exceeds the limits of the CD, and causes clipping and the 'static' sound. I find this CD hard to listen to, which is such a shame because the music itself is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars dropped in the mastering stage","review":"The sound quality of this CD is terrible. Whoever mastered the album onto CD is a completely clueless idiot, it is far too compressed and there is digital clipping galore. Harsh and unlistenable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good music, poor CD","review":"The music is great but the CD sounds like full of static. I have tried it on several high quality reproduction systems with the same result. I don't know if this is a problem of this particular disc or it is just poor production revealed on a high-end stereo system. If I knew, I would not have spend the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fans of \\"Scar Tissue\\" must buy!","review":"Guitarist John Frusciante is back for this release, and while some ignortantly say Dave Navarro was better, the majority will agree that John is the one who just plain \\"belongs\\". I didn't like the new sound of their last album, One Hot Minute, but John's welcome presence is felt in their latest CD. Bittersweet melodies like \\"Scar Tissue\\" (the lyrics are \\"With the birds I share this lonely view\\" for those wondering), \\"Road Trippin'\\", and the FLAWLESS \\"Californication\\" highlight this worthy collection of songs by Kiedis and company. \\"Savior\\" and \\"Easily\\" also stand out. The album's glaring weakness is a few songs that were seemingly slapped in at the last minute. These songs, namely -- \\"I Like Dirt\\", \\"Right on Time\\", \\"Get on Top\\", and maybe some others -- add nothing to the album as a whole and revert back to past releases and leave me thinking, \\"Hasn't this been done?\\" Nonetheless, the RHCP capitalize enough on what works to make this CD worth its dollar amount."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better and Better","review":"The Red Hot Chili Peppers continue to grow musically. The history of the band is amazing as well as their music. Buy this CD and enjoy it time and time again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"John is finally back so we've got this album now!","review":"This album is nothing compared to how I thought it was. Many people like the classic Blood Sugar Sex Majic better than this one. But this is one of my favorite rock albums of 1999. The singles were more of the GREATEST ON THE ALBUM. Then there's great songs like Parallel Universe that have great sounds of all the instruments. It also gets into a different pace than the typical NIN song. Also Easily is more heavy than most of the tracks on Californication. Porcelain is a slow song that is lulliblic. Then the new paces for the next songs I Like Dirt and Emit Remmis. All of the tracks are pretty cool on this album. Worth the money"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of 1999!","review":"This Cd has it all! Soul-songs, bittersweet-songs, and just plain PUNK ROCK SONGS! All tracks are beautiful, but \\"Around the World\\", \\"Otherside\\", and \\"Road Trippin\\" are my favorite on this well thought and perfect album. BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Listening","review":"\`Californication' is easily one of RHCP best albums and even after all these years it still sounds fresh. With Frusciante back in the fold and Rick Rubin producing you knew this was going to be something good and you aren't left disappointed. With amazing tracks like \`Parallel Universe', \`Scar Tissue' the title track \`Californication' and the excellent \`Road Trippin', this album shows the harder and softer side of RHCP and how diverse they can actually be. This album, with \`By The Way', is rarely out of my stereo during the summer and they are the perfect soundtrack to those brighter months. Fun music to put a smile on your face and get you pumped up, what more could you ask for. Well worth a try if you liked their other stuff and a good first place to go if you're new to the band. It deserves all the accolades it gets.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This was my first exposure to the chili peppers and they've been my favrotie band ever since.I adore every song (minus porcelain of course) and consider this album to my theme for high school. I highly recommend it to anyone searching for good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album, but not their best","review":"This is a great album, but their are a few weak tracks about halfway through. If you are new to the Chili's this is a good album to start on. This album is not as good as it's predessor One Hot Minute or successor By The Way. Their best album without a doubt is One Hot Minute, but again, this is a better album to introduce yourself to the band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking a Californiacation","review":"This is a WONDERFUL album of the Red Hot Chili Peppers!

I just love OtherSide!","review":"This is my 1st Pepper's album and hope it's not my last. I bought this on recommendation from my friend and it's fantastic! Around the World is great, so is Scar Tissue and Purple Stain is fun too. Parallel Universe is cool, but my favourite song is DEFINATELY OtherSide. A wicked song with a cool video, Anthony's vocals are fab. Well done, RHCP, you've found a new fan in me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"you can finally throw away one hot minute","review":"first of all, the kid who said that one hot minute was their best cd is retarded... although the band may never live up to the standard set by blood sugar (their \\"angel dust\\" if you will) they put in a damn good effort. every note that john plays is perfect, not like that funk-less navarro, who never should have been in the band in the first place. ok, it is not as upbeat as it could have been, but the junk will do that to you (i.e.\\"porcelan\\", can you say heroin?). but seriously, this record is bomb..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best damn album of the year","review":"I guess RHCP are now officialy a pop-rock band.

The songs just aren't as good as the first half cause they're filler material in my opinion. It sounds almost as if they rushed to finish them. The first half gets 5 stars the socond half only 3. Definitely should be bought though."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the year's best albums","review":"In this modern era of pathetic knock-off \\"alternative\\" rock (Matchbox 20, please...), the Peppers have returned and delivered one of the year's best records. Most of the songs have that \\"Soul to Squeeze\\", \\"Breaking the Girl\\", and \\"Under the Bridge\\" tempo (which, personally, I think is the Peppers at their artistic finest). \\"Scar Tissue\\", \\"Otherside\\", and \\"Californication\\" are some of their best songs ever and they will probably have some crossover mainstream success, but who really cares. What matters is that the band has gotten back to basics. John Frusciante was sorely missed. Loved ya Dave, but you belong in a Led Zeppelin tribute band, or at least with Perry and the rest of the boys in Jane's. This is a very mellow and soulful album. Kick back and relax and feel the vibe, and try to forget about the more embarassing moments of One Hot Minute."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not BSSM, but it's worth getting","review":"I, too, have been waiting for this album for many years. I must say, the slower speed of many (most??) of the songs was a shock, but being able to understand the lyrics, better hear Anthony's beautiful voice, and *really* listen to John's outrageous guitar playing are big plusses (not to discount Flea or Chad - love them, too). I definitely don't regret buying the album, and hope they don't wait this many years for the next one! We've missed you guys - no one compares."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Life Story","review":"I received a signed copy of this book for free after seeing him speak for my high school.

CDs hold 78 minutes of music and, like so many others, this clocks in at about 45 minutes. The albums I grew up with (scratch, pop, skip!) ran 45 or so minutes.

I was half expecting it to be another foray into the same ol' same ol' humdrums of pop music. But, behold, Emma has surprised us all with this little ditty of an album. All of the songs on the album have a distinct '60s feel. It makes one immediately think of Leslie Gore and Nancy Sinatra. The standout track is \\"Maybe\\", an uptempo number about the possiblities of falling in love. Emma's voice on this track, and throughout, is quite strong indeed. The whole track listing is listenable, but I did find the '60s thing gettind old by the end, hence the reason for the 4 stars. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"she is a good spicegirl but not that good solo","review":"emma can sing just not as good this cd is really 80s type of music not really my type of music but i can live withe it cause she can sing good i wish she makes a 2cd in the usa"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try, Baby.","review":"Every single one of the Spice Girls has released a solo album, and every single one has continued to disappoint me. I really wish I could like 'Free Me' and its debut single, but....it just falls short of what I came to expect from the girls. It's typical dance pop with typical lyrics accompanied by a typically skanky video. It's the same old crap. Mildly fun, but massively lacking the innovative pop gems the Spice Girls were able to crank out, like \\"Wannabe\\" and \\"Say You'll Be There\\" and \\"Spice Up Your Life.\\" These girls desperately need to get back together, their solo garbage is just flop after flop. But while they're at it, they really need to drop the attempted R&B sex image seen and heard in their third album, it just doesn't work. The Spice Girls were never sexy, they're dumb fun. I don't like them trying to be sexy, it's almost creepy. They should stick to the radio-friendly goofy pop rock that made them worldwide superstars."},{"rating":"2","title":"looks like there is another spice that is going big.....","review":"emma bunton aka baby spice was not one of my favourites from the spice girls but she definatley changed my mind when i heard this fine album.... the only other spice that hit it big musical wise was mel c. and that was 4 years ago...FREE ME is a great album, her second disc of her solo career...the title track 'free me' is a great ballad. it is totally different from all the ballad that you hear on the radio now... and her hit song 'i'll be there' is a hot joint as well...'tomarrow' and 'something so beautiful' are just instant classics.....if you want to hear something totally different from the spice girls buy this album.... dont be mean and not buy the album jsut because she was a member of that group.... give her a chance....."},{"rating":"2","title":"New discovery because of the Spice Girls reunion tour...","review":"I heard \\"Maybe\\" at the Boston Ma. show and fell in love with it.Just got the cd thru Amazon and haven't stopped listening to it.\\"Feel me\\",\\"Maybe\\",\\"I'll be there\\",\\"Who the hell are you\\",and \\"Some thing so beautiful\\" are my favorites so far.This cd takes me to a swinging 60's London scene everytime I listen to it.Great Cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Emma, baby!","review":"I finally bought this years after it's release & I really like it.

As an experienced/professional VC++ developer, I found this book completely useless as a reference to VC++ .Net. The book claims to cover UI development in VC++ .Net, but I don't think the acronym MFC was mentioned once in the book. I was looking more for something that would cover the new aspects of VC++ with a smooth transistion from 6.0 to .Net. I found myself starting to skip pages, then chapters, trying to find something to make the connection. I started to wonder if the author had ever written a VC++ 6.0 application. After reading a section about UI development that said something to the effect \\"You'd be better off doing this in C#\\", I was almost positive he hadn't. This book would be accurately titled \\".Net Managed C++ Extensions.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Mekong Delta","review":"A great debutalbum and in all one of their best releases in my opinion.I absolutely don't like all the works from Mekong Delta but this one's ok.Solid thrashmetal and not overly progressive.

This heater is incredible and keeps the whole room warm (and I tried several before getting this one.) Not only is it lightweight and very quiet, but in addition to having \\"high\\", \\"low\\" and \\"fan only\\" settings, it also has a thermostat dial, so you can adjust the heat level. The operation is very quiet when turning on and off. The casing stays cool enough to touch, and if it tips over (I knocked it over once), it automatically shuts off. This portable heater is ideal. I bought it to place in my baby twins' room (so their room can be warmer at night than the rest of the house). I feel so good knowing that they are kept warm and comfortable safely. I am going to purchase another one to have on hand to use in other rooms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heat Express Heater Fan Works Great!","review":"I have been using this heater in a small finished basement room, where it's usually very cold! The heater heats up the entire room (not just the space in front of it) very quickly and very comfortably. The controls are great - very easy to adjust the amount of heat being given out. I recommend it, especially for small to medium rooms. I honestly have not used it in a large room yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something else","review":"I've had this chair for 2 months now. It broke after the first month. Contacted KidKraft and customer service was good and sent me replacement parts. However, when the replacement parts arrived, part of the hardware was defective and I could not reassemble the chair. Contacted KidKraft again and they sent a hardware packet... of the wrong parts. I was able to reassemble the chair cobbling together hardware from the broken parts and the new hardware. However, I was forced to remove the defective hardware part and that area remains unsupported with no hardware at all in the chair. I hope that it is okay enough to last through baby's first year. If I had to do over again, I would drive for an hour to buy Amish."},{"rating":"2","title":"First baby rocking chair","review":"This chair is everything that I was hoping for.

Earlier album is instrumental, later album has a woman singing with a wonderful, soulful Israeli voice. Songs are mainly sung in Hebrew, but a few in English. The main guitarist works in a variety of instruments including bagpipes, which relates to the \\"crossroads\\" connotation- obviously the roads stretch as far as Scotland. Kidding aside, the blend of sounds include traditional middle eastern instruments and rhythms fused with modern jazz/rock. They have other albums, but they're hard to find. They have a website at estamusic.

It works great for the home stringer. The drop weight never goes out of calibration so it's always ready to use out of the box. I use it about once a month in the summer and once every two months in the winter. Excellent results every time. Most people will be able to string in about an hour. For me, that's faster than the four trips it takes to drop it off somewhere ( drop off, back home, pick up, back home). It's also been nice to have when I break a string before a scheduled match.

The pumpkins planted in Part #1 have grown up and are harvested in this one. Otto still makes mistakes and goes backwards at high speed - my son's favorite part.

As the author lacks enough knowledge and understanding of the Iranian culture and its sub-cultures, he fails to develop the characters appropriately. For example, he portrays the General as a very religious man. For those who are familiar with pre-revolution Iran, know this well that it would be next to impossible to find a religious high ranking officer (let alone a General). There seems to be too many coincidences. The whole story seems to be more like a white guy's fantasy about going to an exotic place, developing a sexual relationship with a beautiful underage girl and act as her hero, than like a real story. My advice to all of those who would like to cash in on the exotic places such as Iran is, at least, do your homework."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a dream","review":"I started this book one evening and I never stopped reading until I finished it. It reads like a dream, especially the first third or so which is the best. Some other reviewers mentioned prejudices about Iran: Hey! it is about one man and one woman and what happens between them. It reminded me of Ada by Nabokov."},{"rating":"1","title":"Culturally inaccurate","review":"His story is full of cultural inaccuracy. His perceptions are mostly based on the western stereotypes that don't reflect much true knowledge of Persians and the Iranian culture. It lacks character development and his characters are not at all real to an informed reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Prejudices","review":"This book should not be read by anyone more than the author: It is awfully abundant with Western anti-Islamic prejudices about Iranians and Iranian women, from the front cover to the final sentence. My verdict is negative: 1 star is even to generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enormous disappointment","review":"I'm told this book was \\"hailed as a masterpiece in Britain\\" and that it has been compared to Doctor Zhivago, so it sounded like a wonderful reading experience. However, I have to agree with others here who said they found it to be unreadable. Buchan does a poor job of clearly describing much of anything. The prose is disjointed and confusing and the story jumps around in time and location without adequately explaining any one of those times or locations. It is almost unheard of for me to quit reading a book before finishing it, but I gave up on this one very early on because it utterly failed to grab me on any level. There are some truly great works of fiction out there that will capture you and hold you from cover to cover. Unfortunately this is not even close to being one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cover","review":"I have not read this book but I gave it a \\"one\\" because the cover photo shows the attire worn by the women in INDIA rather than in IRAN.Was it choosen because of the \\"persian carpet\\" rather than the\\"Persian bride\\" ??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Walking into a dream","review":"Reading this novel was like walking into a beautiful dream which descends into a nightmare and recovers the dream again at the very end. I don't understand the problems that some people had with it. The plot is a little murky but no more confusing that a host of other books I've read and less so than some. For me the indistinctness of it contributed to It's dream like quality. The writing, especially describing the exotic locations is exquisite and I feel like I've visited all of them. Perhaps its not for the very straightforward plot oriented but for me it was unforgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Achingly beautiful, piercingly brutal","review":"Yes, it's a masterpiece. For once the blurb doesn't lie. If you wish to know what this book is 'about', then read the editiorial reviews. I won't restate the premise and plot here. All I can do is provide one subjective response. It's simply the best book I''ve read all year.A book that with grace and simplicity is full of such tenderness and harshness, dream and reality, ignorance and self-knowledge. It's unsparing, unsentimental, unforgettable, and impossibly moving. Here is a tale of a love and a land, a tale of two cultures, a tale of a boy and a girl that skewers the heart - one that remains like a splinter in the mind. With the book's last sentence I wept for a love found and lost and if it were my own. In immersing one its joy and pain, this book has that rare and remarkable ability to make one feel more alive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fun read","review":"This book was clearly written for academics. It is very dense, and uses needlessly opaque language. I realize that history buffs may find this insightful, but as someone not already familiar with Mexican history, I found this to be irritatingly difficult to unpack. This was assigned reading for a history class I took, and I toiled through every chapter. Mercifully, we were also assignedThe Mexico Reader: History, Culture, Politics (The Latin America Readers), which was WAY more engaging.This was not an enjoyable introduction to Mexico."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome live show","review":"I travelled from Atlanta, GA., to London this month to see Kylie at Wembley Arena. It was the concert of a lifetime. The best show I've ever seen. This double live CD is a great reminder of what an awesome show Kylie puts on. The arrangements of her songs in concert are excellent. The dramatic musical interludes allow for costume changes and it's fun to close your eyes and imagine the visuals on both screen and with her dancers. The Doctor Who tribute during \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\" and \\"Light Years\\" was a blast!!! The middle eastern version of \\"Confide In Me\\" is also excellent.I hope Kylie's next album is a huge success stateside and perhaps Kylie will be motivated to tour hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kylie back!","review":"Incredible album! I love that it's almost seamless, just like her concert...with songs blending into eachother and several medleys. Also great because it has several new songs (\\"White Diamond\\" by the Scissor Sisters and \\"Kids\\" with Bono) It's great to hear her live. Her fans are obviously overwhelmingly happy to have her back, finishing her tour after her battle with breast cancer. I recommend her live concert DVD, \\"Kylie: Showgirl\\" as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this guy ever get published","review":"While the story itself is a good idea, the execution is awful. This author cannot write. The cliches, the awkward sentences, the forced dialogue . . . it took everything I had to finish the book . . . and then return it. I was not going to allow my students to read writing this bad; it goes against EVERYTHING I have been trying to teach them."},{"rating":"1","title":"maybe it's because I hate small town mentality","review":"There's nothing like having a couple of Natural Lights at the local dingy bar and then going home with the chain smoking older woman from work. Yeap, that's life allright, well at least to Tim Temples it is. From the very beginning I could not relate to the character whatsoever. There is the arguement that I am of the different gender, but even with that, Tim seems more like a girl than his love interest, Helena. Throughout the entire novel, none of the characters were fully developed, and seemed to be exact portrayers of small town cliches. You have the baseball-star of a father, the drop-out older brother, the hot/geeky girl next door, drinking buddies, and of course the older woman at work with a huge rack. The author tries to move along the story, and show development, but he is unsuccessful and fumbles at every turn."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delight","review":"I picked up this book on a whim and spent the rest of the day with it. I loved Tim and his brother's fading connection through baseball, and thought the family dynamics were beautifully written. Tim's affair with an older co-worker was nicely portrayed with just the right amount of attraction and regret. I hope we get to meet Tim again when he begins his new life in college."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our favorite story of all times!","review":"This really is for all ages, as I still listen to it every time my daughter does!It is one of our favorites!

It will give you a wealth of information on the topic.Converting to Judaism is not for the timid or half-hearted proselyte. Rabbi Lamm explains the basic facts of what it means to be Jewish, really Jewish. He covers tradition on Jewish birth, death, and everything in between. For covering such an expanse, he does an excellent job of explaining the many facets of Judaism clearly. This book should either solidify your decision to convert or help you realize that you are not ready for the committment (and to have a traditional, binding conversion it IS quite a committment).Overall, this is an informative book on conversion - the best I have read. The many narratives of converts (in their own words), along with all the factual information, provide a great balance. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy, Orthodox Propaganda","review":"Maurice Lamm's book BECOMING A JEW ought to be entitled BECOMING AN ORTHODOX JEW. Lamm's condescending attitude towards non-Orthodox expressions of Judaism is grating and tedious. He presents the spiritual journey undertaken by Reform and Conservative converts as inauthentic. Perhaps it should not surpise anyone that a man who has consistently worked to deny Reform and Conservative converts full political rights in Israel takes such an intolerant view of the non-Orthodox, particularly the non-Orthodox ger. For a more balanced view of conversion, look at Dr. Epstein's book, and Lydia Kukoff's. Avoid BECOMING A JEW at all cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Stop Shop","review":"I've purchased other book about conversion but this book is by far the most inclusive. It includes just about everything you would need or like to know about the Jewish people, regulations regarding conversion, and what life is like following a conversion. There is also a handy section that explains the Holidays.It had indeed been helpful and I think it would be useful to anyone wanting to convert or just know more about the people or the process."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree: it is biased toward Orthodox Judaism","review":"Although the tone of the book is welcoming and reassuring to those who are seeking to learn more about conversion, it became clear to me that the message is that if you are going to convert, you better do it \\"right\\"; that is, to convert to Orthodox Judaism is the only way to be accepted by the religion/community, to \\"prove\\" that your intentions are sincere, and to guarantee that your conversion is universally accepted. The book has great value in describing the whole process of conversion, but readers must understand the bias toward Orthodox Judaism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item received not as pictured - bad customer service","review":"I ordered 2 of these shirts assuming they would be green as pictured - nothing on the web site indicated it would come in another color.

The information on prices and hotels is old. I certainly would like to know that last time the writer actually vistit the country. His observations or opinions of quality of hotels certainly should be questioned. As well, as his ability to judge the communities. It seems like the writer has not been to Costa Rica in a long time. That goodnes we have traveled the country three times, each time with new guide book, this time, just a bad choice.

As far as the sound and musical quality, these guys were total posers and couldn't hold a candle to some of the real \\"Metal\\" bands like Slayer, Venom, King Diamond, etc. And the lyrics are the stuff of zit-faced, date-less, early teen boys with nothing better to do then read their father's Penthouse Letters and imagine up their own little fantasy session. To put a warning on the lyrics is almost a waste. To get an idea string together numerous derogatory names for females, add in a couple nasty swear words and then finish it off with slang descriptions of very lewd sex acts and you have the Mentors. Oh yeah, set it against the backdrop of the worst metal garage band you've ever heard to complete the experience. El Duce, say high to G.G.

No place for the air to go so it push the cloth cover out from under the bunge cord. The 15 holes in the bottom are not sufficient. I do not believe these items were meants to be used together and I have yet to figure out what the leaf collector is supposed to attach to.This total purchase was a complete waste of money!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Springs To Life When You Need It!","review":"So easy to store when not in use, but when you need a bin, it's a snap!I love this, because it never falls over and when you put a bag in it, it stays in place (I secure bag with butterfly clips on windy days).

My wife uses this when she pulls weeds from the flower beds. I have been lining this with a 39 gal. heavy duty lawn bag which is barely big enough to fit over the edge of this container. I wanted to use up my 39 gal. bags before I buy bigger bags. Ideally I need to use a 44 gal. trash bag. This product will occasionally collapse when I pour heavy grass into the opening from my lawn mower bagger.

It's made solidly and works well. The price was reasonable. The straps to close it up could close tighter so it would take up less space when stored.

I have been using a plastic garbage can with some holes drilled in the bottom (lets the bag come out easily) and costs much less.

I also read the reviews of those who gave some very helpful hints on how to tweak things to make it work.The system worked beautifully for me!!!!!! the Garden spring bucket is just the perfect size,very well constructed and light enough to move around the yard .

The tape starts off recaping the Taker's feud with Mankind, LEAVING OUT his Survivor Series debut, his first title reign, his casket matchs with Yokozuna and his match with the pseudo undertaker. The tape then jumps from the 1996 Mankind feud to his feud with Shawn Michaels in 1997, skipping over his title reign, not to mention his performance in the 1997 Royal Rumble and Final Four IYH. Kane's feud to the present is recapped however, and the highlights shown make the matches look a lot better then some of them really were. In all, the footage shown make for an enjoyable viewing, but the tape fails to correctly show the transistions the Undertaker has developed during his 8+ year career in the WWF."},{"rating":"1","title":"Undertaker The Phenom","review":"Slick productions values circa 1998, beyond that its not worth the money unless you are a die hard Undertaker fan, not the best video the WWF as come out with, but in todays world it is a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here comes ... the prince of darkness~!!!","review":"This video is very good whether the video is good or not.

The packaging claimed that there were interviews and other footage that showed a side of the Undertaker never seen before.

My own experiences resonate with MacEowens as I too have walked backwards in time to remember from where I came. We are the ones we have been waiting for and may the Clan awaken globally.Recently I have also read a book that has similiar energy and she too has some very amazing experiences from the days of old.

I called Samsung, and they stated it was a known issue, and they would replace it by sending a new one. The second one had the same problem, and the third as well. Clearly there is an incompatibility with the graphics card, as I've seen comments by some others with the same problem.

It looks like the whole screen is slightly out of focus. After trying to adjust all of the built-in on-screen controls, I installed the drive that came with the monitor, but saw no improvement. And while this monitor supports a variety of resolutions, there are really only two that I have found that work adequately - the remainder of the resolution settings are completely unusable.

No, it's not a problem with my video card, etc. I tried the monitors on another machine with excellent display on its own monitor. Same result -- very poor image and after awhile tired eyes and a headache. I'm sure -- or at least hope -- other Samsung models are better, but avoid this one.

I was very dissapointed when I got it home though. I could only find one screen resolution which gave decent results, and even then the text was blurry on anything but a white background, and it had pink and green ghost images. All of the other screen resolutions gave blurry results. I tried installing the CD which did not make a difference.

So controversial that their regular record company wouldn't put this song on their CD (hence..this release by a different one).Animal is a great tune, one that brings back fond memories of the battle between Rock and the PMRC.Hellion is my next favorite and while the recording isn't the best, it still rocks.

I can't believe this book is so highly reccommended, I think I'll reread The Notebook by Nicolas Sparks, at least he is an author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good cause BAD book","review":"It is difficult to understand that readers gave this book such glowing reviews. I had not read 4 pages before I wondered if it was written by and for a junior high student. After that I radidly scanned the rest of it, hoping to discover something to capture my interest sufficiently to warrant further reading. No such luck. The relationship between the protagonists is so juvenile and unrealistic that it made me despair of the intelligence of anyone who could identify with it. The only redeeming feature of this author's attempt at a literary production was that some of the profits are to go to a worthy cause."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Experience! Share This Gift!","review":"I just had an amazing experience. My husband took the kids this afternoon while I curled up and explored Shade of the Maple. A few hours and many tissues later, I am speechless and breathless. Though I cried, I do not feel sad; I feel hopeful and inspired...and like I have experienced something pure and beautiful, even life-changing. So I am buying copies for my mother, grandmother, mother-in-law, sisters, child's teachers and all my friends. Yes, it's that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"Too descriptive, overly romanticized, and a disappointing story. Only finished it because it was part of a book club. This is the first book I have ever read that I didn't care for at all. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"This stole my heart!","review":"This was an amazing novel. It captured my heart. This is truly a book for women, although I think men would benefit from some of the romantic gestures. I could NOT wait for Anna to make a decision. In fact I was sure I had it all figured out. I loved how she tried to find ways to deal with her heart and tried so hard to come up with the right decision. My heart went out to her. My mouth dropped as the bomb was dropped towards the end. I did not expect the unexpected. From that point on I needed tissue. So much lead up to this point and I couldn't believe it was over. I am so glad I married my soul mate and never had to question my heart!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written","review":"I absolutely recommend this book; it is a beautifully written love story. Something else that gets high marks is the author, Kirk Martin. When I finished the book, I took advantage of the offer to purchase a signed copy of his new book, The gravel drive, from the website listed at the back of the book. The next day I received a personal e-mail thank-you from Kirk, and he engaged me in conversation about the book. I was impressed by his warmth and sincerity, and was quite pleased to have received a personal e-mail from him. He seems as warm and genuine as the characters in his book. For me, Shade of the Maple was a double treat, reading the book and getting to know the author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is all the hype about?","review":"I bought this due to the ratings of other Amazon[.com] readers. After reading it, I am very unclear about what most readers love about this book. I like all types of books (aside from trashy romance novels) which may be why I found the story line to be predictable, flat and unfulfilling. The Author takes great time to paint pictures, but there is very little depth. If you like romance novels, perhaps you may enjoy this one because it has plenty of romance and charm, but very little substance. I'd say spend your time diving deeper into a book that has more layers of significance and meaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing!","review":"A beautiful, idealistic love story in every way. I genuinely enjoyed sinking into each word. It is refreshing to find a novel that is not heavy and dark and filled with every dysfunction imaginable. I didn't have to struggle just to get through each paragraph, and it took me back to more innocent times. On the surface a very light read, but with important messages that linger subtly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kirk Martin Does it Again!","review":"I was drawn into Shade of the Maple from page one and couldn't put it down!! I love the way Kirk Martin paints pictures and makes you feel a part of the scenes. The characters are memorable, and I missed them when I was done reading. Fortunately, I had THE GRAVEL DRIVE waiting by my bed...and I jumped into that immediately. WOW!! This is a rich book that will truly make you see your relationships in a new way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left Speechless!","review":"This was the most amazing book I have ever read! Mr. Martin has such a beautiful gift within himself to write such an incredible novel. I could not explain my emotions to anyone after reading Shade of the Maple. I was left speechless! It is truly something people have to read for themselves to understand all of the emotions that are packed away inside this novel!! It has changed the way I view my relationship with my husband. The love of your life! Wow! I would recommend this book to everyone, and anyone who wants a fresh look at any relationship!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Beautiful!","review":"Shade of the Maple is beautiful in many ways. The story itself is inspiring and captures the depth of love we all long for. Respectful and full of dignity, this story honors the gift of love too many overlook. The author paints his words onto each page - the descriptive way in which he writes draws you into every scene, makes you feel part of the beautiful landscape. A wonderful experience!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really WANTED to like this book .....","review":"I really wanted to like this book but just couldn't. All the incredients were there for a wonderful story, but it fell far short of the mark. I hung in there and read the entire thing (thinking it had to get better) but I was overly optimistic.I LOVE Vermont and have spent time in the geographic locations described. The descriptions of the area were the one redeeming feature. Having been there, it was easy to picture the locale and was fairly well described. My main complaint was the stilted language used in the book when describing how the characters interact. Conversations between them were stiff or overly sugary and painful to read. I think had this been turned into a college comp class the best grade it would have received would have been a \\"C\\".Any comparisons to Nicholas Sparks's work does Mr. Sparks a great disservice. While Mr. Sparks doesn't write great literature that will last through the ages, his books are enjoyable. This one was not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Club Favorite","review":"Our Book Club read Shade of the Maple for our October selection since the author donates proceeds to breast cancer research. We loved this book!! The characters felt like my neighbors and I could identify with Anna's struggles. It is warm and intimate and I love the descriptive writing, makes you feel like you're roaming the Vermont countryside with them. It's a month later and I find myself still thinking about these characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for the really simple-minded","review":"I suggest that if you are buying this book based on these reviews, you take the time to actually read all of them (including the one star reviews). There is a consistent theme here of either \\"I LOVED it\\" or \\"this is simplistic nonsense.\\"I am fully in the simplistic nonsense camp. Maybe you should decide what type of reviewers you are more likely to agree with - romance novel readers or, shall we say, higher-level, quality fiction readers. This book will only satisfy the most immature reader out there. I hate to be mean about it, but it really reads like something an overly starry eyed and ambitious high school freshman girl would write. It's very, very whimpy, and worse than that, very amateurish."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT//DON\\"T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!","review":"Take all of the good reviews and throw them out the window!!!!!!! READ carefully all of the bad reviews and sticky tape them to your computer so you are not tempted to buy this book!!! This man cannot write!!! If you are looking for a good romance read Flowers from the Storm by Kinsale. I am convinced that all of the good reviews on this book are from FOA (friends of author) and I wonder about the editorial reviews (they must be neighborhood book clubs with members who are FOA)!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I've never been moved by enough to write a review, but.....","review":"this book was so bad I had to. Amazon.com rating stars have provided me with many great recommendations over the years but this one was way off. This book was one step above (below, maybe some would say, because there is not even a smidgen of sex) a paperback romance. You just wanted to slap all the characters on the sides of their heads and tell them to \\"get over themselves\\", they were so unrealistic. The story goes nowhere, the characters lives and their goals are so unrealistic, and the decades of years gaps in the the story make you go \\"what the?\\" Skip it...earlier 5 stars must have been submitted by F.O.A. (friends of author :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally unrealistic \\"love\\" story!","review":"I read Shade of the Maple because of the reader reviews here on Amazon.com and was totally disappointed. I found the story to be very shallow. The lead characters had no flaws and were totally unrealistic and, I thought, poorly developed. I just never believed the story. The explanation of the break up was just too simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"What great love story?","review":"I agree that this book was a major disappointment. I didn't feel any great connection, and felt this was not a great love story. I kept waiting for more dialogue, but kept getting more and more description of Vermont! For only 213 pages, this book dragged on and on and I felt it was taking forever to get through. Plus, I just kept waiting for it to get better, and it just never did. I'm still tempted to try his \\"Gravel Drive\\" but this book has made me very leery to try anymore of his novels.--Monica Petersen"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eternal romance","review":"This book will be my latest addition to my personal library. It is the most romantic, yet real, story I've read in a really long time. If you are struggling to find that perfect love, that last forever love, this book will strengthen your resolve to wait for it. I recommend this book to any and everyone. I simply can't wait for his next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book I ever finished","review":"I really disliked this book. This is not my idea of romance or love; it was sticky, sugary sweet. It also has to be one of the most poorly written books I've ever come into contact with. It is full of gratuitous (and eventually, very annoying) sentence fragments, characters flatter than Kansas, and descriptions of everything possible for no apparent reason. Stay away..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it.","review":"Unbelievable. Come on... a love story? Hooey! I bought this book because of the great reviews here. What a disappointment. The characters are not believable and neither are the choices they made. The best part is the descriptive writing about the countryside and the seasons. It's nice that the author donates some proceedes to breast cancer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment!","review":"Shade of the Maple by Kirk Martin was a major let down to say the least. Sappy at best. I did so want to like this book, I have seen the title self-connected to every bestseller on the market today. What a major disappointment for me after all the glowing reviews of this book!I suppose the story has a few doable qualities in all fairness. The characters were believable but sadly (dull). The plot a bit too sappy but doable. I think this writer does have a little talent, but that talent needs time to develop before he can compete with the BIG GUNS in the business. Maybe his next book will work for me. (I gave this two stars instead of one because of the effort it must have taken to write it)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Escape, With Meaning!","review":"Shade of the Maple is an amazing novel. The characters are genuine, the story is fast-moving with surprises and the setting takes your breath away (as does the ending!). A great escape, but with meaning. Just saw on the website that the author's second novel, The Gravel Drive, will be out soon. Can't wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a keeper!","review":"Having read 26 romance novels so far this year, Shade of the Maple was my favorite. Kirk Martin has an incredible way of pulling you into the story; describing each detail to the fullest. You actually see the surroundings in your mind and feel the emotions as if you were actually the characters.When I finished the book, I felt that Mr. Martin really understands the heart and soul of women. This was his first book and I can't imagine how much better he will keep getting as he writes more novels. I can't wait to read Gravel Road.Read this book! You will want to keep it for your collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"I bought this book on recommendation from Amazon readers, and was very disappointed. I wonder if those people have actually READ any other books. As others have stated, the characters are very one-dimensional. They don't have idiosyncrasies. They don't have problems.Also, the language Martin uses is very distracting. Here's an excerpt:\\"Evan Forrester grew up an only child in the picturesque Vermont town of Quechee. Quechee was settled in 1764 by pioneers who established mills along the Ottauquechee River. Evan's great, great grandparents settled in the latter part of the 19th century. The Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees had donned uniforms made from the mills' quality fabric.\\"If this is the type of writing you find interesting, you'll love this book, because there's PLENTY of it. It's a very predictable story and boring reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"sentimental mush","review":"I was so disappointed in this book. If you are into mindless sentiment it might satisfy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shade of the Maple","review":"Well folks, I have no idea who are these kind people that wrote the glowing, gushing reviews of this book. Shade of the Maple is worse than bad--it is offensive in the dire simplicity of its theme as well as peasant use of the language. Do not waste your time and do not encourage Mr. Martin to write again. I have never before felt so compelled to tell those who care to know that this \\"emperor is naked indeed.\\"If I may, however, please allow me to recommend a tremendous book which will move the very depth of your soul: The Glass Palace by Amitav Ghosh. Enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!","review":"The method that Glenn Doman explain in this book is wonderful my baby enjoy his lessons a lot.

Henry and Pell are 2 hamsters who find a sea gull feather. They set out on an adventure to find the sea gull and return the feather. They think that the sea gull needs it to fly. Along the way they encounter some pretty scary creatures. But bravely they continue on the journey! They find the seagull and he's go great ful that he gives them some feathers of their very own!The story line is a little silly.I recommend this book to all animal lovers. There aren't many books that focus on hamsters and this one is really cute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mo' Better Blues Wannabe!!!!!!!","review":"The movie is extremely boring and the blind guy is just plain annoying, Antonio Fargas (Shoop) doesn't make the movie any better.

Other than \\"It's All Over Now,\\" some barely standout tracks on this disc include Filter's \\"The Best Things\\" and Rob Zombie's thoroughly remixed \\"Living Dead Girl.\\" Buy it for Hole..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Time Has Passed","review":"With remixes aplenty in the 16 tracks, the soundtrack series has the feel of the movie trilogy; the franchise has run its course. The film was released straight to DVD and there is a staleness with the music due the majority of the cuts being found in other accessible venues.The most creative is Danzig's reworking of Belly of the Beast, which is entitled, Underbelly of the Beast. Hole's cover of Bob Dylan's It's All Over Now, Baby Blue was previously issued as a B-side, hence the original could be considered the most tough to find.The previous pair of soundtracks fit perfectly with the mood of the films and were outstanding stand-alone releases that solidly showcased the sounds from the alternative scene, albeit from artists who mostly led the playlists on commercial FM radio outlets that featured that music. But that time had passed by the time this project got (re)mixed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning to all Tricky fans!","review":"I bought this CD for the Forgotten by the World remix of Antihistamine, however, the track isn't a remix at all.

The only good song on it was Static X's cover of Ministry's \\"Burning Inside.\\" It's an incredible cover with lots of intensity, distortion, and the lead singer of Fear Factory as a guest star! However, I never thought I would see bands like Kid Rock or Filter on a Crow CD. I've never seen the movie, but don't buy the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Mentors","review":"This is the best album the Mentors made with such classics as On The Rag and Hetrosexuals Have The Right To Rock back in the day the only TV outlet that would show their videos was Night Flight on USA long live rape rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"My experience with the Mentors.","review":"when I got into my teens and really started getting into music.

I had to have a copy for myself. So, a copy was made. I listened to it and like most cassette tapes, got eaten. I loved the tape. Just recently finding out that they are still going. I do remember in the mid 90's hearing on the radio that the singer drummer died under odd circumstances. After recently repurchasing 2 cds, I found the Mentors again! I love this band!

Remember, practice makes perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Condescending","review":"I have read a number of books about rural living and/or moving to the country, but this book is one I would not recommend to anyone. There is one word for this author and it is \\"condescending\\". She makes fun of the \\"locals\\" while pretending NOT to...I was not fooled. In addition, the constant ridicule of the former homeowners' decorative taste was something I could have done without. Apparently Ms. Miller is a nature lover and a bird watcher (both GOOD things), so WHY did she refer to Canada Geese as \\"Canadian\\" Geese...where was her editor? I finished the book, but did a lot of skipping as some parts were way too long winded and uninteresting. I agree with another reviewer that the ending was quite abrupt and gave no clue as to whether this woman found happiness anywhere. All I know is that I wouldn't want her for a neighbor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Humorless self-indulgence","review":"As someone who grew-up in Central Pennsylvania, I looked forward to reading about someone else's experiences in an area of the country that I love. Instead, I found a smug, self-indulgent story that twitters on with a superior air and provides as much depth and insight into what Pennsylvania country life is really like as a piece of used plastic wrap.I loved the self-deprecating humor of books like Peter Mayle's \\"A Year in Provence,\\" in which the author provides a rich tapestry of what it is like to adapt to a different culture, and was suckered into reading this book on the promise that it was of the same caliber. IT IS NOT!! At all times, the author portrays herself and her husband as superior beings to their earnest, hardworking neighbors --she laughs at, not with them. If I could give this book negative stars, I would, but the form won't let me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Easy Read","review":"The first 20 pages dragged and sounded a bit snooty...but I really wanted to like this book and said I'd wait to page 50 to decide. As I read on I ended up getting drawn in and curious. At the end I was disapointed on the quick and simple ending. I would have liked more details about what happened to the home and the author. All in all it was a charming book on country life that most of us would love to live!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stealth Humor","review":"My mother recommended this book to me - I am not normally a reader of back to the country memoirs - saying that she loved Miller's rich descriptions and her \\"stealth humor.\\" I was raised in the country and appreciated Miller's perspectives - I'm sure I would turned up my mouth in wry amusement, much as her Pennsylvania neighbors did, watching this city girl trying her darndest to live up to the romantic visions of country life while living in landed poverty. Watching Miller making ends meet by gardening, canning, sewing and existing in the only way she could by doing everything herself the cheapest way, the hardest way, was a sometimes funny, sometimes sad, depiction of reality when our fondest dreams come true. A talented writer, Miller entertained me, too, with her stealth humor. It made me wish for a back-to-the-city sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful story of city slickers in the country","review":"Cathleen Miller's story of leaving a sophisticated lifestyle in San Francisco, and, with her husband, creating a new life and restoring a 100 year old home in the middle of a Pensylvania corn patch is colorful, charming and sometimes just plain funny. Her ability to bring humor to otherwise horrible situations is a total delight. I couldn't imagine myself living through some of the daily problems she faced. The old fashioned coal heater for one -- even venturing down into the cellar gives me the creeps.Cathleen's memoir is an enjoyable read and I highly recommend it.

It does offer only very basic information. In fairness to the CD, it is #1 in a two part set with the second CD being advanced strategies. This does not make the CD bad, however, the cost of the CD (even used) might be better spent on a book where one would get much more info or for free on the internet. I would have preferred only one CD with a little more advanced info on it along with some basic info, yet, that is not the fault of this basic part 1 CD.

I am Japanese. When we listen to Japanese anthem which is played by foreign performers, we usually laugh at these performance. They just do not understand our culture. Our national anthem is so often arranged to different way than we Japanese do. When we heard Japanese anthem in this CD, I and my wife were so uncomfortable, or upset. We even thought we were insulted. They did not only arrange the tune, they also change the pitch of the anthem. They just changed the anthem to totally different tune. IF THEY CANNOT READ THE MUSIC SCORE, THEN DO NOT PLAY! I am hoping, this CD will be discontinued, thus not many people remember this strange tune as the Japanese anthem! I beg Amazon buyers not to buy this sort of CDs. I prefer not making any comments for other anthems because of the reason above."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Avoid this album if you want to listen to the anthems with genuine arrangements. Most of the pieces are awfully arranged. Some of the anthems like Egypt, Bulgaria are no longer of their official ones.

Only the performance of the band is nice if you enjoy the pieces as ordinal brass music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harlequin Meets Harlot","review":"This is a slightly amusing and trashy book if you have an hour or two to spare. Don't gear up for any major intellectual challenges, this is the standard bodice-ripper Harlequin-type romance combined with adult bawdy themes. It consists of two stories which might make the more prudish of us blush, but excite the more mildly prurient reader. The stories take place in the Victorian era, and our lovely ladies have a heck of a more lively sex life than we were ever led to believe took place during those times."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent introduction","review":"One wishes all surveys were as good as this book. Prof. Kennedy's survey of classical rhetoric is clear, authoritative, informative, and a pleasure to read. He is pithy and didactic without being patronizing or superficial. His command of the subject is vast. Each chapter is conviniently divided into sections, to facilitate quick reference. Yet the narrative coherence of the book is preserved throughout. The notes at the end of the volume provide the bibliographical references that may be desired by someone wishing to delve deeper into the matter. In addition, UNC Press produced a handsome volume: big, clear type, wide margins, and good paper, ideal for annotation.I highly recommend this book as a starting point to study classical rhetoric, or simply to familiarize themselves with an important subject in Western thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic!","review":"This classic book on the physical chemistry of gases and liquids is showing its 36+ year age, but it is still the book for an all-encompasing survey of the theory of fluids. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"the funniest album","review":"every song is a masterpiece - and funny, funny, funny! the amazing thng is that the music is really good just by itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mars to Earth: \\"SEND MORE MICKEY KATZ\\"","review":"There are no highlights to this CD.

However, I find the WWF's production of this tape to be a little subjective at times. They tend to try and put over their current stars, while attempting to downplay former stars. There is an obvious case here: WrestleMania III, Hogan vs Andre the Giant. When they talk about the near fall at the beginning of the match, it is obvious that they added in the sound of the referee's count, up to a third one that never really happened.

This album alone set much of the foundation that made the 303 the lead guitar of dance music for the '90s.

The caracterization used was good and the author made his points very clear as they came across very good. I am very good at picking those kind of things out but he made them very clear to me. I feel that Bernice took this act of kindness very well as she didn't take the public humiliation badly. She just took all of the attention from Marjorie and took it well.

The story is about a boy who, during Second World War, has to deliver telegrams in his little town Ithaca. The boy's name is Homer, and his city is the ficcional Ithaca, which takes us to a new Homer's Odissey, in which Ulysses is his younger lovely brother.

This book was much different then all of the other books that I've read before in my life. It was all the books in one! My favorite person in the Human Comedy was Homer Macauley. He was the struggler in World War 11. He was the one who delivered the death telagrams to miserable, unexpecting mothers who lost their sons in the War. This made a great impression on me."},{"rating":"2","title":"You couldn't GIVE it enough stars!!! Loved this book!!!","review":"What can I say that hasn't already been said? It's a wonderful little snapshot of life in Ithaca, CA, as told through the lives of those who live there. But what I loved most about it were two things. One, other than the dramatic moments when a war dept. telegram was read, this book did not have that sort of overly (and phony) theatrical feel that other authors feel they must provide whenever they deal with similar subjects. Instead, Saroyan gave the majority of attention to the mundane, ordinary routines of life and showed how people truly LIVED in times of great distress. Two, I loved the synchroncity of events in certain parts of the book. In one scene, at the EXACT MOMENT that Homer is taking off on his bicycle to pick up messages, Marcus and his friend Tobey are on a passenger train taking off for their own mission. Pitiful example, I know, but read this book and you'll know what I'm talking about!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Human Comedy","review":"I personally enjoyed this book extremely. This book was interesting from start to finish and had good views on life. Having the book go through life about a little boy and the war around him shows you what can happen in reality. I was extremely pleased with the author naming it The Human Comedy and having a tragedy at the end. This book had good ideas of life and how one little boy and his family dealt with it in a good way. That even though life throws saddness, you can come out happy in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Next please. . .","review":"On those days when you feel like reading a good book, do not pick up the Human Comedy. The protagonist, Homer, does not at all seem human, even though he is made out to be a teenager. The author tries to brink back some of ancient Greece to California, with Homer living in Ithaca. As far as the plot goes, it develops slowly. However, once the plot has been developed, it is a lot easier to read. This novel is a recounting of one boy's family, and how they and their friends are affected by the war."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of Saroyans worst!","review":"This is one of the most boring book with hardly any action in it.

It has detail, and thankfully not as much as John Steinbeck, which would make it totally unbearable. Only bother with this book if you have a high tolerance for wandering through the story. You will not have a main character. You will not get anything out of the multiple diversion thrown into the book. I would, in short, recommend you get a book that has a plot, a purpose, ANYTHING but the pure 'fluff' in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"The Human Comedy was a horrible book. It was too simple, not challenging enough. The book had only a vague plot, and it was covered up by the additional and useless events that had nothing to do with the outcome of the story. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relevant, simple, heartfelt!","review":"Having read the Armenian translation, I was glad to finally sit down with the original. And what a difference! Although the translation was wonderful in its own way and I had enjoyed the book very much, but there is something to be said for the language Saroyan uses: so simple, yet so profound. The story is still relevant today with so many young soldiers going to war and with families left behind to take care of themselves. How do you grow as a family when the war has taken so much from you including your teenager's childhood? Having a teenager myself, I can't even imagine what the main character is exposed to because he has to support his family. It's a perfectly suitable read for almost all ages. Don't postpone enjoying this masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Aid for Understanding New Testament Times.","review":"Tenney has written an excellent book on the historical framework for better understanding the New Testament times. Containing illustrations, charts, maps, and bibliography, the book covers the political scene just before Jesus' birth to the emperor Hadrian (about A.D. 138).Whether for personal Bible study or preparing a sermon or Bible study lesson, the title will help the reader better understand the political, social, and economic culture into which Jesus came to and after His death, burial, and resurrection.Read and enjoy.

And the paraphrase gave a false impression of what Wald said in that article. It made him sound like an immoral hypocrite, and it gave an impression that was the opposite of the actual point of the article.So they were not passionate enough for truth to check their sources to make sure the quotes they used were accurate.

It also contains important philosophical and historical data.

His voice is also very impressive, showing sincerity throughout his songs, especially in \\"come around.\\" His lyrics in \\"our love\\" are so well chosen.

I'll probably get slaughtered for saying it but this CD reminds me quite a bit of the acoustic/electric pop on The Lemonheads \\"It's a Shame About Ray\\".There are some songs in the typical \\"boy meets girl/girl breaks boys heart\\" vein that Rhett mines to good effect. He even has a little fun at his own expense on \\"This Is What I Do\\" claiming that singing about heartbreak is \\"what I do for a living\\".

I can't believe the lead singer of Old 97's and this Rhett Miller guy who opens for Tori Amos (I didn't even know she toured anymore) are one in the same. It is a good thing Old 97's are so wonderful because Rhett almost ruined everything for me. His solo CD has that old familiar sold out ring to it, the lyrics are weak, and I couldn't be more disappointed. Did I mention all the songs sound the same? It didn't matter if the Old 97's never made it to the big time (eventhough it seems they were getting closer and closer).

I was familiar with Rhett Miller's Old 97's work, which was edgy and clever. Unfortunately, his solo effort is neither of these things. The lyrics are standard love song drivel with none of Miller's usual clever twists. Occasionally he seems like he's trying for a clever twist, but it just comes off as trite. Musically this album sounds like any number of mediocre one-hit-wonder pop bands. Deep Blue Something and The Rembrandts come to mind. Perhaps Miller should write a TV-theme-song or something as his next effort. Sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Most of the songs are forgettable, and the lyrics are subpar for Rhett. The production feels all wrong to me... it attempts to be slick and sheeny, but it just feels soulless, plastic, and self-indulgent (although some of the faux-retro stuff -- think early Traffic -- on \\"Point Shirley\\" is kinda catchy). While I understand that this is a solo project and not a 97's record, I really miss Murry's voice on the backing vocals -- it would've provided a lot of the warmth that this collection is lacking.Bottom line, I think Rhett (or Elektra?) chose the wrong collaborator and, with only a few exceptions, the wrong songs. (I'm hoping this means he's saving the good stuff for the next 97's record.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"a big disappointment","review":"I'm a big fan of the OLD 97s... but this new CD from Rhett has very little in common w/ the music his old band used to put out. If Rhett wants to 'go another direction' w/ his music, that's just fine. But if your a fan of the OLD 97s... be warned, & I'd seriously advise you steer clear of this cheesey CD. This poppy self indulgent effort is only for girls who think Rhett is dreamy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Far To 'Who\\" Cares","review":"Rhett should be stripped naked, placed in front of the many dissapointed Old 97's fans and then beaten.

I was a tad worried Rhett Miller would follow suit; but nothing could be further from the truth. \\"The Instigator\\" is a fine piece of work. It surely ain't at a level of \\"Too Far to Care\\", but it is a splendid effort in its own right. Miller has crossed the alt.country borderline here but maintains his good sense of Y'allternative taste and continues to display his excellent muscianship.\\"The Instigator\\" is a fine sampler of Rhett's talent.

This book is ideal for the young at heart, regardless of their age! With this book, you'll be able to enjoy a dozen or so friends and send them home at the end of the evening completely refreshed and talking about the fun they had at your gathering! At your next party, keep the TV and music off and enjoy each other with active games, quiet games, impromptu stunts, and just plain fun! Especially good for kids and young adults. The book is also loaded with practical advice for party leaders on how to create a relaxed atmosphere in which any party will thrive! Also ideal for church groups and gatherings. In summary, this book is about how to have good, clean fun with any small group."},{"rating":"1","title":"At best, uninspiring.

This is well-nuanced middle ground set in 1982. If you can look past the soft-core porn aspects, the misleading cover image and some of the heavy handed see-this-is-Texas touches, the story is compelling and deft, for the most part. The real story is not in the sex, but three young men coming to terms with their sexual identities in the early 80s. There's awkwardness and fear here, and to the credit of the film makers, they are not obscured by cheesy, cheap cliches. The atmospherics of life in the early 80s are well placed, aside from a few spurious \\"awesomes\\" dropped (only valley girls were using the term then), and it is a bittersweet snapshot just before the plague. This movie is very good for what it is, and it explores, albeit without much depth, some of the shadowland between \\"straight\\" and \\"gay\\" men that we see handled with mastery in \\"Gods and Monsters\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it","review":"The acting in this was terrible, I've seen better in school plays.

It is not fun - it is painful (acting writing, production quality).Not sexy - these guys are just not that interesting to look at (full frontal on all of them only goes so far, and with a couple of them, not at all far enough), nor do we want to hear what they have to say - back to bad dialog and weak acting.Not nice - the story is lame, and characters cardboard - and let's face it, in 1982, NONE of that would have happened. The out guy would have been chased off campus, or worse, and the others would have stayed firmly in their closets. A couple of hours I won't get back.

But it still can be categorized as a gay movie, since the two main characters are gay, even though one of them doesn't realize it until late in the movie. There is a sweet romance among all of the comedic moments, and there are a couple of scenes that tug at the heartstrings. Oh, and the nudity. Good God, the nudity. There are five full frontal scenes. All the male actors in the cast show their \\"longhorns\\". And Dylan Vox is hilarious in the role of Steve. Everytime he's on screen, be prepared to laugh. Longhorns isn't the best of its type to be released this year (I liked Eating Out: Drama Camp more), but it's still well worth watching if you're gay or just \\"curious\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing here","review":"Except for the cute smile and sexy drawl of the main character, there isn't much to see here -- including nudity if that's what you're looking for.

This book proved that point. For an overview of the history of psychology, the book was okay. However, I found many times that the theories of the psychologists were so watered down, one can hardly get a good idea of their original studies and propositions. I know it is difficult to read each and every work of each and every psychologist, but this text book is a waste of time for anyone who really wants to understand how ideas developed. In addition, I get really annoyed when writers do not quote the original author. Most of the quotes in this book were taken from other text books or biographers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Textbook","review":"This is an clearly written and informative textbook with excellent coverage and depth.

Don't let the small size fool you, Paul White stuffed these books full of good, useful, easy to read material. Now, I will say that there are books on these subjects that may contain more material, but these books are made for on the go. I keep several of these books with me where ever I am playing or recording. This set of books is even an added bonus. Seperately these books are $7.95, but that are sold together here in a pact for even more of a discount. Also because of the price, I don't mind carrying these books with me because if I lose one at a gig I know it won't cost me an arm and a leg to replace it.

Have you seen the PPVs with the Rock/Nation vs. DX. Have you seen him fight Austin way back when he first started becoming the Rock? Did you see him fight Mankind for the title during those 6 months where the two had about a billion title changes between them? Have you seen RAW from the beginning of the Nation Feud to all the way when this video was made? Then you basically saw the whole video. If you expect to see extras, that's not happening in this video.

Wrapped the second one up and haven't heard any news from my friend. However, we were able to fix the first one because the cheap Chinese plastic/rubbery wheels were easy to remove and shave off some excess material that was keeping the wheel from turning. Good thing I'm handy. We have tried this car many tmes in the water and continue to be disappointed. It barely moves in the water and if any current or wave catches it, the vehicle is a goner. On land it's okay on smooth ground, but cannot even run on grass or make it over the smallest obstacle.

I never immersed them just wiped them down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfactory performance","review":"Upon receiving the original Krups Belgium wafflemaker and a replacement from the vendor (Acehardware), both items performed unsatisfactorily; the problem was that even though the waffle batter was correctly mixed, the waffles baked on only the bottom side. It appeared that there was incorrect/insufficient heat to bake on the top side. In addition, the shipping delays back and forth during the Christmas holiday of the original and replacement units, the seller's time for return had elapsed and the seller refused final return of the replacement unit. We have since purchased a less expensive Belgium wafflemaker of a different brand and vendor, which performs to our satisfaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad and depressing.

Although, it's somewhat intriguing it sadly lacks good humour. You might be mildly entertained by the psychology of suduction, but if you're looking for a good laugh and a warm fuzzy feeling - that one might expect from a 'romantic comedy'- then this is not for you.

She and Frances O'Connor, you could tell they both took the accent seriously and didn't just wing it. I thought everyone did a good job, including Stuart Townsend and there were a couple of scenes that I actually laughed out loud at. The filming was Pulp Fictionesque and provided some insight and surprises. Cool Jag, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming","review":"Christina Rossetti fans take notice. This is possibly one of the only movies that will ever devote any time to her writing. I was delighted with the discussion of her piece \\"The Goblin Market,\\" and I knew then that this movie wasn't going to be just a little bit of fluff.It is indeed a romantic comedy, but it doesn't stop at love and laughs. It challenges the notion of trust and morality without a hint of condemnation. Having the fantasy unfold through mulitple characters' points of view was a wonderful thing and the actors carried off the movie charmingly.This movie lingered in my mind enough to cause me to see it again after initially viewing it. Perhaps not the best movie ever made, but certainly a pleasant way to idle away an evening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Mischief and Fun","review":"I loved how the story here is told and retold again from the different perspectives of each of the 3 sisters. Stuart Townsends character and the way each of the segments unfolds is brilliant. Funny and witty. Irish comedian Tommy Tiernan has a small cameo roll also.

I came across it when I was flipping through channels & I recogonized Stuart Townsend(Could he be anymore hotter?!?!?!?!?) so I decided to watch & it was way better than I expected.

You have to check this one out. The whole CD is just mind blowing. Runaway is a hit in the making. You have to hear it...even if it's just for the conga intro Chardy McEwan plays. Rebecca has always been the bands song and it sounds just as good as it always has. Anybody could be a hit too. It's got that catchy chorus that just gets stuck in your head.

As for the quality and legitimacy of the music & lyrics as so harshly criticized by Mr. Josephes, let's put it this way...I just saw them here in Boston and took my friend whose favorite band is Slayer. Not to mention his other favorites such as dying fetus, iced earth and meshuggah. He is an amazing guitar player, and despite his loyalty to metal and severe criticism of guitar players and musicians, he was so impressed with the Pat Mcgee Band and could stop raving about the show. If a band rooted in the spirits of Dave Matthews can move a fan of Slayer so much, I belive that says enough about the quality of the lyrics and music Mr. Josephes described as \\"musical mush is overproduced and anonymous to the point of annoyance.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The best sit back and listen album.","review":"This CD is \\"ALWAYS\\" in my rotation. It is a catchy, straight forward album, filled with great harmonies, guitar hooks and tight percussion. There is nothing complex about this album but I can't seem to stop listening to it. For a lack of a better description The Pat Mcgee Band is like, James Taylor meets Dave Matthews. I saw them live with Vertical Horizon and Sister Hazel and these guys had the whole audience whispering, \\"Where did these guys come from?\\" and \\"Where can I buy their album?\\" This album is worth every penny. The only reason this gets 4 stars is that I reserve 5 for the classics masterpieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great CD","review":"This CD is really good. I love this kind of music and the album has all the stuff I like on it. All the songs are really great. The vocals are really stong and they Shine (haha) on the album.

I also love the song \\"Anybody\\" which is so awesome and I love it so much. \\"Lost\\" and \\"Shine\\" are also really good tracks. I suggest this album if your looking for a solid, good album.

The organic fruit has been costly and disappointing. I asked about substitutions (parents on Lipitor and cannot have grapefruit) for meds or personal preferences and I'm told, \\"No problem\\". But after I've charged the yearly gift to my VISA and paid, the Fruit Company continues to give my parents either the wrong monthly delivery or give them a hard time about switching.

The plus was that it explained the law, but also explained historical cases where the law applied. Though, it did not show any photos of artwork to be able to better understand the cases--particularly the copyright cases where it would be important to compare.

Boring, lame, unexciting, short cut scenes and set in the 80's where spiked hair and Hawaiian shirts were as popular as Tom Selleck (who was mentioned at least twice). Just not a good read for me.

She writes a fairly meaty mystery and mixes them with a bit of romance, but this book was pure, predictable...um, not so great stuff.If you're looking for a good study on how a writer can grow, read this and then one of her mysteries.

As soon as I opened the package I could smell a very strong chemical-like smell that seemed to have permeated all of the contents. The smell reminded me a bit of a varnish-y type of smell, and was so strong that I could not imagine being able to wash it off. I returned this item as the scent was so strong that I was not comfortable giving it to my 14 month old to use in the bath. The designer applique aspect of these toys only warrants it getting a rating of the (required) one star in my opinion, as the smell makes them unusable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and different bath toy that baby loves!","review":"These foamy odd-shaped different colored bath toys are absolutely loved by my 6 month old son. He loves the balls that come with the set as well. He wants to play with every piece he happens to see, so even if he's already got a ball in one hand and another toy in the other he will try to grab a third! The only thing I noticed negative about them was that many of the shapes have long skinny parts that my son had gagged on once or twice, so I only let him play with the few more rounded ones for now until he gets a bit older. Other than that, great bath toys - easy to clean up since they don't retain water or even drip much and the baby is fascinated by them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun!","review":"These shapes are so entertaining to my 18 month old!

The smell was awful and I knew these would make it to my son's mouth and I didn't know what kind of chemicals could be on there. Oh well, maybe someday they will just sell the foam pieces alone..then I'll get them!Since you have to give a star, I'd say that star is for Amazon's customer service and really easy return policy.

My 7 month old loves the shapes and I actually keep a couple in the car as an emergency distraction to quiet her. She loves to hear the squeaking sound they make between her gums. I don't think these are worth $16 though. I found these at TJ Maxx for $8 so I recommend looking there first before buying online to save yourself some money.

They are stylish and fun and more importantly are all BPA, pthalate, and PVC free.However, these foam shapes emitted such an awful chemical smell when I opened the package, that I could not convince myself that they are truly non-toxic and safe for small kids to play with - especially in the bath tub where warm water may accelerate leaching out of chemicals.Perhaps the smell fades over time or can be washed out, but I wasnt interested in finding out.One other side note - The balls that come with this product are not made out of silicone as stated in the product description.

However, it does not work on my bath's faucet/spout -- it falls off easily and often, from my baby touching it, from the water flow, sometimes all by itself when noone's near it. The problem seems to be two-fold:1) Our bath spout does not have the pull-knob on it to switch between bath/shower mode. Ours is built into the wall. This knob may hold the Boon Flo on better (it is pictured in the product photos).2) The hinge-spring doesn't seem tight enough -- it seems to loosen after a couple of weeks.I wish Boon had specified that it doesn't work for certain types of bath faucets.

It's so flimsy. Doesn't fit my faucet well so it keeps dancing left to right. The only consolation is that it's very soft so I know that my baby's head will be protected even if he hits the faucet.

However, I can say that it was a tremendous help in getting my son acclimated to a full size tub. Before the Flo, my 10 month old would cry and pull away from the water and instantly want out of the tub. I think part of the problem was the loud noise of a full stream of water on a steel tub. The Flo solved that problem in two ways: 1) It diverted the water so that it was softer when it hit the tub, and 2) The waterfall effect intrigued my little one enough to get him over his initial apprehension (and still keeps him entertained, weeks later).Even if the mildew problem does turn up, and the product can't be used long term, I feel like I definitely got my money's worth, since it helped my little guy decide that bath time could be fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, falls off at the slightest touch","review":"I bought this thinking that it would fit my standard sized spout, which has no shower diverter, and right away it seemed too big. My baby loves the waterfall that it makes, reaches up to grab the source, and easily pulls the thing off. I really wish it wasn't so easy to get off of there, because it is a great idea. Hope someone else has better luck, but don't buy it if you don't have the shower pull to secure it."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more worries","review":"Great product. Very easy installation.

As those were the only reason's I wanted to purchase this product I am very happy, however we thought it was a bonus that you could put bubble bath in the compartment and the kids could just push a button to put some in the bath water. Only, the bubble bath does leak out on its own and we generally end up with a bubble bath when we were not planning on one, unless I spend the five extra minutes to wash the leaked and now wasted bubble bath out of the tub. No big deal for us but if the bubble bath compartment is a bid selling point for you, you may want to consider something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept, lousy product","review":"This is mainly a safety item, right? So it's a problem that my nine-month-old can pull it off easily. Like other reviewers, I have the most standard faucet around, and the Flo fits loosely, at best. Also, while the spout part is a nice pliable plastic, the upper section which covers the faucet is made of hard plastic which would give quite a painful bonk. We would have been better off with an ordinary old rubber ducky faucet cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never liked this cover","review":"This did not fit my faucet correctly - was constantly sliding off. That is, when my kids weren't taking it off to play with it. Plus, I didn't really feel that it was soft enough to really protect them if they did fall into it. Also, be warned that if you have well water and get some red iron staining, this product is nearly impossible to keep clean. Lots of nooks and crannies to collect soapy, scummy water.

My kids can create their own bubble bath.3. To protect them from hitting their heads on the faucet.I was surprised how easily it attached to my faucet, and by the quality of the material used to make the product. It doesn't feel flimsy right out of the box. It's actually a little heavy in your hand, but it's made of strong rubber and plastic. I have an infant and he loves watching the water cascade and fill up his baby tub (which is much easier now since this deflector pushes the water out on an angle, making it easier to fill his tub). My six and seven year old are also having a lot of fun with it.The only downside I see is that you may use more water if your kids want to \\"play\\" with the deflector more. Otherwise, this is an excellent purchase. I'd highly recommend it to moms and dads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check your faucet first!","review":"I bought this knowing there is a chance I would return it and sure enough I did.

I really like this cover as it is super soft and stays put very well. The only thing I've noticed is that the bubble part leaks a little. When I went into the bathroom the other day, I noticed some of the bubbles running down the side. As far as I'm concerned though, that's not a major issue to me since I can just as easily poor the bubbles straight into the tub!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not buy again","review":"I bought this because my granddaughter fell and scraped her face on the faucet in the bath tub and by appearance it looked like it would cover the majority of the faucett and keep her from getting hurt again. The problem is that we have excellant water pressure and when the water is on it shoots off the faucett - when the water is off it slides down to the end and barely hangs on. It has fit the purpose but I would like it better if it stayed in place.Grami"},{"rating":"1","title":"fits, but beware!","review":"Ok, so it fits over our weird lift up shower valve and it protects the kids from the sharp edge of the faucet, but it grows mold an is pretty gross. I soaked it in bleach ad it smells better but it didn't really get the stains off. Also, the soap drips out if you leave it in. Wastes the bubble bath and makes for a slippery surprise in the morning when you step into the bath tub. I haven't seen any other product that fits over our faucet, so I'm keeping it for now, but i don't love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall good item","review":"Overall this is a good item. I purchased this from Babies r Us after seeing it online. I have a six year old who takes showers and a two year old who takes baths. I like not having to remove it every time to turn the shower on. It does stay on the faucet very well, which I thought it would slip off easily. The only two thing I did not like was that it is made of a hard plastic. I guess it covers up the sharp edges on the faucet but if your child were to hit there head I think they would still get hurt but not as bad if there were nothing covering the faucet. Second the so called bubble dispenser. Great idea but it didn't work well. Not sure if solution was too thick. Other then that my girls look how the water comes out and splashes them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good thought but needs work","review":"This would be the perfect bath product except for a few flaws.1. It is meant to fit a range of faucets, however it does not clamp down tightly and is very easy for my children to pull off.2. The soap dispencer is a great idea but the soap residue is hard to get out after a few uses and the button sticks in the open position.It is nice and soft and helps block the kids from hitting their heads but I would like it not to fall off so easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for my tubs","review":"Unfortunately, this Boon Flo did not work properly on either of my tubs (different faucets). One is a very standard looking faucet, but I guess our water pressure isn't high enough (although decent). The water does not flow out as it's suppose to from the Boon Flo. I was disappointed. Another toy accessory for the discard pile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boon Flo's but doesn't fit","review":"This product is great in theory but in reality, it leaves a little something to be desired.

A slippery one year old and one less free hand are not a good combo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and functional.","review":"I bought this for our childrens bathroom, thought it would be of a softer material, but it is hard plastic.

Luckily she didn't hurt herself to badly but immediately after I jumped online to find a product that was safe in case that happened again. I love this product.

My only complaint is that the bubble bath soap dispenser slowly leaks which can be pretty annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"This faucet protector takes no time to install, and the rubber tip protects adequately.

Other than that, it works just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work GREAT!","review":"I love this product. It works great on our Kohler faucet. Really helps when washing hair and such."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"This product is pretty disappointing. It does not clamp tightly to the faucet spout and slips off to the end causing water to flow out the back. My spout is a typical design so the cover should be able fit properly. Many people mentioned the need for a shower pop-up knob, which we do have. When someone takes a shower, the cover slips forward holding the knob up. The knob would normally pop back down when the shower is turned off. Instead I get an icy cold shower when I turn my daughter's bath water on! The other problem is that the resevoir to hold bubble bath leaks badly and when I filled it in the evening at bath time it had completely drained by morning. This happened the very first time we used it, not after soap gunk had built up in the dispenser. The only feature I did like was that it was effective at diffusing the water flow which made it quieter and less scary to my baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit all faucets","review":"It is a great concept, but didn't fit my system. I just sent it back. But I would recommend it to anyone with an older, smaller tub faucet."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay.","review":"I don't really LOVE it, nor do I really dislike it? The bubble bath spout feature? Not the greatest. Great idea, poor execution. I am adding a picture to the main picture gallery. I literally just poured a lot of expensive baby bath into it, and it drained before 4 hours had even gone by! Yes, down the drain! So I cannot use that feature with this item. It's not very SOFT. Not the top of it, only the bottom. So I am not sure how this is really that much safer for the baby than just the regular spout alone. But I like how pretty it is. This is my first night owning it, so I may come back and say more, but for now- I'm undecided whether or not I will continue to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would work if It didn't fall apart!!","review":"I have to say at first I was so glad I ordered it. fit perfect!!

I have thrown the box and invoice!! So keeps Yours incase!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love flo","review":"We have modern taste, so we love flo (and the potty bench) because of the look. But it is so functional, too! It fit on the faucet very easily, is soft in case the kids bump their heads, and lets out an great, wide stream of water for both kids to play with. We just used the bubble dispenser last night for the first time, and it worked great. All in all, a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attractive Danger","review":"I purchased this product because my 10 month old loves to pull himself up on the tub spout during bath time. I purchased it to protect his noggin in the eventual spill he will take during this activity. Well, I have the exact tub spout that is pictured on the box and the cover slips right off...no problem for a 10 month old nor an adult to remove. He grabbed it the first time, it slipped off and he fell on his bum, spot cover in hand. He was also more interested in the spout when it had the cover on. The added color and newness of the cover and the fact that it high lit the shower diverter made it an instant attractive and dangerous item for my son."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not soft material","review":"I bought this thinking it would protect my child from knocking their head off of a hard faucet, but for this purpose this item is useless. It is just as hard as the faucet. The only soft piece on this \\"faucet protector\\" is the water deflector. What a waste of money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE this faucet cover.","review":"I use to have the rubber duck cover on my tub faucet and hated it. I had to cut a hole in it so I could still use the shower. Water got trapped in the bottom and mold grew. It was disgusting! Then I found this product...and it is fabulous. It easily fits on my faucet and can easily be removed for cleaning if necessary. My daughter also loves playing with the waterfall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The Flo is another Boon product that completely underwhelms. My little one figured out how to take this faucet cover off the faucet by the time he was 20 months old. Now it's a constant battle to get him leave it alone. The soap dispenser doesn't work; it's much faster to just pour the bubbles directly into the tub rather than hold down the button for 10 minutes while the soap slowly drains out. The inside (where the water flows) is covered in pink mildew and is impossible to clean (disgusting when you think about babies drinking bath water). The cover is not as soft as you may be led to believe. It's hard plastic; my son has hit his head on it a few times. Thankfully I can still return this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to return it","review":"If you don't have a typical faucet, it won't fit. Mine is decorative and it didn't fit. Great idea but just not for us unfortunately."},{"rating":"2","title":"A few issues, but generally pretty good.","review":"I bought this Flo for my 1-year old. I'd previously bought the frog bath organizer and liked the quality of it, so after reading some reviews, bought the Flo, as well. Out of the box, the Flo did not work well. For one thing, it refused to stay on my standard bath faucet. Big problem, obviously. But customer service was fantastic. The guy I spoke with stayed on the phone with me until we could engineer something to keep it on there. Eventually, we discovered that if you wrap a hand towel around the faucet, the Flo would stay on pretty well. That fix has worked for the last 3 months. One other issue wasa that the soap dispenser is not reliable. The soap leaks. So we don't use that feature. But as a faucet cover, water fall, and bath toy, it works great. Despite the minor issues, the value of customer service and general quality of the product still make it worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Hair rinse","review":"This is a great item to rinse hair for little kids. Your tub needs to have good water pressure for the flow to look like the picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea in theory.","review":"Okay, first, this thing looks a million times cooler than those duck ones. I was really excited about a functional item that looked cool too, but I was disappointed. I expected the design to be more evolved- there are a few major flaws. My 10 month old son can (and does) easily pull this off the faucet. When he does that, the door to the bubble dispenser pops open and all of the soap comes out. Additionally, the bubble dispenser door pops off easily (choking hazard?) I wouldn't buy a duck, but I am pretty disappointed with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last","review":"This product does collect mold and rust as other reviews state. Also, the bubble bath dispenser is an unnecessary feature since it doesn't release a lot of soap at a time and for the time spent in refilling the dispenser, it would be just as easy to add the bubble bath directly to the bath. Not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably not worth it...","review":"I think that the concept is great but it fell a little short for me. First of all, our bathroom faucet has the shower water switch at the back portion of the faucet so the Boon Flo doesn't fit quite right. However, if you work with it you can adjust it and it will work okay. Secondly, my son is 14 months and loves baths so he immediately wanted to take it off the faucet and examine it. In my opinion the bubble bath dispenser is a waste. I would stick to just pouring the bubble bath in the tub yourself. I'm giving this four stars because if you have the right faucet and your child isn't as curious about it (maybe a little older) then it would proably be a great product for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"pass on this product","review":"The problem with this water deflecto is that it does not stay on the spout. It keeps sliding down and i have to constantly adjust it, and I don't have anything fancy or unique... just a standard bathtub and faucet. The soap filler does not like any heavier consistency soap. My 5yr olds Johnson & Johnson regular bubble bath soap is too thick and it doesn't get released no matter how much we press the button. Had I not destroyed and threw away the box, I would have returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"LESS THAN ONE STAR IF POSSIBLE","review":"This is HORRIBLE. It does NOT stay on my faucet, if I hold it there, the water comes out in one flow, I can't really adjust the location of it. And the bubble bath holder/opening doesn't actually get any bubble bath into the water. This is a HUGE waste of money. So disappointed. Oh, and fair warning, the box is a complete mess to open so I practically destroyed it trying to get the stupid thing out. So I can't return it now! Extremely angry about this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nice idea, but it doesn't work.","review":"It slides off the water spout randomly when not in use, and the force of water pushing on it makes it fall off faster. Maybe because our tub doesn't have a thing that pulls up to turn the shower on, like the one in the picture has? We have a knob to turn the shower on instead, and maybe that little metal pull-tab would keep it in place better. Bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross!!","review":"I had read a million reviews before purchasing this item and my main big complaint is mildew! I clean this thing on a weekly basis and took it off to discover so much that will not come off with any type of cleaner. I knew all about the fit and knew it would be a bit wobbly but it still worked. I refuse to have my son anywhere near this because of the fact that like others state it breeds mildew. If you think maybe yours will be exempt I doubt it unless you soak it in bleach every night which is ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well but breeds MILDEW!","review":"I loved this product in the beginning. I bought it because I loved the water fall feature. I left it on the spout for months and months. It just never occurred to me to remove it. But I happened to be cleaning something on the floor near the edge of the tub one day and I looked up and saw mildew in the Flo! I was horrified. I took the thing off and threw it away. You'd think that a product that was meant for wet environments would be mildew resistant, you know, like shower curtains."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard plastic","review":"I was expecting something soft and rubbery which would help protect baby's head if he falls in the bath. But this is hard plastic. I couldn't figure out how it would really protect from anything. I guess it would help if you have your kids lean back to rinse their hair, this would allow them to sit further away from the faucet because of the waterfall spout. Also, although it's handy that the diverter is still functional, it's also a bit hazard sticking up that could hurt in a fall. I thought the protector came up higher around the diverter so that if you hit it, the head would stop at the protector and not reach the diverter. But that is not the case.I think it works as they intended; it fits our faucet, and the waterfall effect is sort of neat. Didn't try the bubble dispenser, that seems like more trouble than its worth.Just not what I was expecting, and doesn't work for us to provide the bath safety I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this, but I returned it.","review":"The cover is too loose and kept sliding off our faucet. Also, the spray was too wide and shot water out of the tub onto the floor. I wish it fit tighter and worked. It was really cute, and I think my daughter would have liked the waterfall. I ended up returning it to Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what i needed","review":"I have used this Water Deflector Faucet Cover twice and I am happy with it. The lower portion is a soft rubber so it's safe if your child's head hits it. The soap dispenser is cool, but I just dump the soap right into the running water. One note is that I really have to push the piece over my faucet. I think I have a pretty standard faucet, so maybe it's the way it's designed. But, I have to look inside/underneath to be sure the rubber lip is beyond the water output on the faucet. Once it's on though, it's tight and secure and the water flows nicely. It will be nice when my children are a little older and can hold their heads under the stream of water. It's a good quality item and will be used at all bath times from now on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy on & Off, but bubble dispense leaks","review":"After dealing with those MONGO faucet covers like the duck one and various other animals- this one is a delight. So much easier to get on and off the faucet. I really love this because the kids' bathroom doubles as the guest bathroom and I need a quick off to hide the kids' toys when guests come. I also like that the shower latch is still accessibly, another feature those animal covers don't have. This way my oldest son doesn't need to move this when he takes a shower.Only complaint it the bubble dispense leaks badly. I stopped using it altogether and just squeeze the bubble bath into the stream when it fills up and that's fine. Great idea but it doesn't quite work. Overall I'm very happy with this product. Five stars if it didn't leak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product","review":"Overall, I think that this is a really good product. Aesthetically, it's very pleasing. We have a standard faucet with the pull up knob to divert water to the shower on the tip of the faucet. It fits the faucet well. The kids love the waterfall and enjoy putting their fingers and heads underneath it.The only thing that I don't really like is that the soap dispenser is hard to push in and hold down. The soap cakes up on the holes where it comes out and then needs to be cleaned off in order to dispense more soap. It's not very easy to fill the dispenser. If you pour or pump the soap into the dispenser too quickly, it plugs up temporarily and overflows, and since the water doesn't reach the area around the hole to clean it off, it tends to get caked up as well. A funnel would make it a bit less complicated.It does work well. Turning the shower on is not a problem and it is good protection in a slippery area."},{"rating":"1","title":"leaks soap","review":"I was not impressed with this item. While it did prevent my two year old from bumping his head on the hard faucet and made for extra frothy bubble baths, I found that it leaked the bubble bath soap I put in it. One brand of bubble bath I use is thicker and it clogged. Perhaps my tub faucet is larger than standard but I had a hard time opening the Flo wide enough to slip it on easily. It ended up at funny angle that allowed water to pool in the end. The water spray freaked out my son at first, even on low waterflow. He got used to it after a few days but never really took to it and refused to wash his hair under it. Eventually he asked me to take it off the faucet. I will try it again when he's older, I suppose. Knowing what I know now I would not spend my money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let it go...","review":"Boons Let it Flo seemed like an awesome idea...the idea - awesome but the product not so much. I tried it on my faucet without a shower stopper and it fell off several times but because it was already out of the box I opted to try it out for the bathtime...when being held in position (by me) the water flowed nicely off it to give a good waterfall to shower off my toddlers soapy head. And it made the water come into the tub nicely as well...but the jist is:- it doesn't fit my tub (narrow faucet w/o shower stopper)- the item is made of hard plastic not a softer plastic that would be nice for the little kids heads!- from using it three times I could tell it was going to breed some awful mildew & soap residue that was going to be a pain to clean- and while the bubble bath dispenser is a cool idea...it'd be better if you didn't have to continuously push the button to get the soap out...Sorry Boon - I'm usually a big fan - but not today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"While the information was valuable, the disk would only play on my computer, and even then there was a delay between the sound of speaking and the movement of lips.

This one is a little smaller, but is still large enough for a big lunch and bottle of water. The fabric stretches and the zipper is strong, so I don't need to worry about a bag blowout. When it arrived, it had a bit of the funky new fabric smell, but it has since settled. It is washable, but takes a while to dry, and you have to be careful about putting anything wet in there (like from the freezer). My only other minor complaint is that the handles are not quite large enough to throw over my arm with a heavy coat, so that to carry it, you need a hand. (Problematic when you've got a purse, are trying to find bus fare, etc.) Either a larger hole in the handle or a detachable shoulder strap would be great. Otherwise, a great bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece","review":"This book is excellent. One of the most disturbing things I've ever read. And that's saying a lot.

My only complaint is that the book could have been a bit longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing","review":"Having read Dante's Inferno, a visual description is hard to render. Mr. Barlowe has done just that. He has painted the hard to desribe. One look through this book and you will be \\"disturbed.\\" Mr. Barlowe has taken the ideas of different religions and beliefs in rendering his \\"Inferno.\\" Having caught a \\"glimpse\\" of what awaits those that do wrong in the afterlife, one sees the visual deterent to doing wrong. This book is a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best!!","review":"Normally I am reserved in my reviews but this one stands out as an entity that deserves high praise. I had been researching visions of Hell for some years when this book came out. It was an exquisite find as the author's vision was finely detailed and provided a wealth of information. His Hell is different yet similar to Dore's vision which appealed to me. It is as if he took Dore's vision and placed his own ideas and concepts on top of Gustave's.This is highly recommended. The pictures are stunning and the text adds some nice thought as well. One reviewer wrote that he thought the souls looked to much like statuary and while I do agree with that criticism it is a minor quibble and is not always the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a trip","review":"Wayne Barlowe has long been one of my favorite artists, up there with Bekinski and Giger. He has a real talent for pulling the viewer into his world, so that we can almost smell the sulfur. This and its companion piece Brushfire are my (current) favorite art volumes, as I seem to be in a very hellish phase right now. But even when I'm not feeling hellish, I'm in awe of Mr. Barlowe's talent. I love the texture of the worlds and characters, the deep, roaring, ash-filled atmosphere of the environs of hell he portrays. I am always inspired by his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very solid album","review":"Dull moments on this album are hard to find. Energetic tracks with good variation.

Many of the problems Nelson has identified are now much worse than when he wrote, but the \\"solutions\\" seem both oversimplified and impractical. The only problem I know really well is the overuse of prison. Here Nelson proposes solutions that are both politically impractical and practically impossible. There are moving stories here and there which are well used to illustrate his points, but there is also gratuitous obscenity and celebrity bashing. Oh, and a complete absence of reference notes. I suspect this book was dictated rather than written. For the writing and remedies I was tempted to give the book a single star, but it is still worth looking at for the concise cataloging of what is currently wrong with the country, most notably a decline in spirit and increasing class polarization."},{"rating":"2","title":"A charming collection of stories about 8 remarkable women.","review":"Eight Who Made A Difference, by Erica Stux is a charming collection of stories about eight remarkable women who contributed to the arts.

While listening to this CD, had I not known the songs were supposed to be Disney tunes, I believe I would think I was just listening to another classical music CD.Some of the songs are a bit recognizeable if you listen very, very carefully. Others almost completely obliterate the Disney part of the song save for a note or two. For example, the Ballad of Davy Crockett sounds nothing like the original song. The Siamese Cat song from Lady and the Tramp is even worse. I had to look at the liner notes to figure out what song I was listening to and even after identifying it, I had difficulty picking out the Disney notes.Overall, I would recommend Disney fans skip this unless you are die hard, but Heigh Ho Mozart is a better investment if you actually want to hear the Disney songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bad","review":"We had high hopes after hearing one of the tracs on this cd.We were really disappointed!!!!

I would have given it three, but the premise of the Darkyn is very compelling. It's the romance that is lacking here. I'm not sure if the author considers it intregal to the development of the stories or if she just tosses it in to move to the next scene. The romance is just not well done. The author has yet to convince me that the characters she's created have achieved believable levels of intimacy. The development surrounding the romance is slight. I'll keep reading because I like the Darkyn. Maybe the author should focus on the world of the Darkyn and leave the romance out. It really throws off the flow of the story because it jangles while the rest of the story jingles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great second in the Darkyn-series!","review":"The second in the Darkyn-series after \\"If angels burn\\" is just as interesting, exciting and often funny as the first book. What I appreciate most is that the book is surprising and often unusual, as opposed to a lot of paranormal romances where you know right away what will happen. So in my opinion, this is a new author to look out for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the first one.....","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed her first book but this second one left me cold. 150 pages in and I still didn't really know what the plot was. Too many characters (Did we really need Beanie and her fecal artwork?) and too much wandering around with scenes that didn't build up to anything at all. It was as if the author couldn't decide who or what the book was supposed to be about so she just hopped around hoping something interesting would come out of the mix. It didn't.I finally got so bored that I turned to the end just to see where it all settled, something I NEVER do. I usually have to read every word of a book, but that would have just been more torture than even the Brethren can dole out.I like her ideas so I'm still hoping for more from the third installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Think first","review":"The other reviewers have covered most of the things that matter, but I'm glad I went ahead and bought both books at once (If Angels Burn and Private Demon).

So, when I have to go back to the manual, something isn't right. Next, the only adjustment wheel SUCKS!!! If you push it and aren't exactly in the middle of the button, you end up going to another menu instead of selecting the item you wanted. It's better with the remote. Great display, except you can't see it in bright sunlight and it's distracting at night. The bluetooth mic sounds like you're 15 feet away, so I had to go back to my headset.

The so-called energy-saving switch only doused the tiny console lights. Since it was going to be my fax machine it would have been on 24 hours a day. Even had that not been the case, even if I were just going to use it as a printer during office hours, I would not have kept it. I had already returned an HP unit purchased at a local store for the same reason (with HP at least, you could reduce the factory setting for the time the lamp stayed on, unless reactivated, from 8 hours to 2 hours.)

I was plagued with an alarm bell and flashing LCD error message the first time I turned it on that prevented printing, was not described in the troubleshooting guide, and required tech support to unravel. While I can now print, the setup of scanner and copier have so far frustrated my best efforts.

While it may be inconvenient to get up and go behind the tv (where I have the switch set up) to go between the TV/XBOX/Blu-Ray, it's way better than the expense of buying a new surround sound system.If your old system has no or limited HDMI ins, this is a perfect work around.

I connected my PS3, stalite receiver and DVD player to a sound system for 5+1 surround.Firstly, DVD player never worked at all. It works perfectly when I connect it directly, but I couldn't hear anything using it with this device.PS3 functions well but I need to restart sound system several times before it recognizes the input. Again no problem with a direct connection without a hub.Lastly I'm not sure if satelite receiver works with it. It is a HD receiver and same as PS3 I can have sound after several trials but the sound is not surround.Anyways, for those who have doubts to buy, I strongly recommend you try other devices. I'm really disappointed with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"DOES THE JOB","review":"The device does the job, it switches between different digital audio sources. Nothing special about it, you just have to make sure that you hear the 'snap' when switching audio sources or you will not get anything (that could be improved).

I found that the signal attenuation through this device was so great that some digital sources worked and some didn't. For the other side I should add that part of the problem is that the source device needs to have a better signal output, so the fault needs to be divided a bit in this case. The source device in this case is the Sangean HDT-1X, I purchased this precisely because it had a digital out put and wound up having to use the analog output."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it says","review":"My optical output on my tv doesnt work for some reason but I just bought a Bose Cinemate GS series 2.

Very easy to use and I don't notice any drop in quality whatsoever. The only thing that could make this device a little better would be a remote controlled version so you could switch the device without getting up.

HB"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last. DO NOT BUY.","review":"I don't know why I didn't listen to the prior reviews that stated that this switch was fundamentally flawed and will eventually stop working. It's flawed presumably b/c there's no protection from dust/dirt entering the optical paths, especially b/c it's a simple mechanical switch. Sometimes the switch itself doesn't 'lock' into one of the three paths, forcing you to jiggle with it until the sound gets thru.At any rate, after about 6 months, it started to get really spotty with making the connections. After about 9 months, the unit is toast. It hardly ever works. Only one of the paths works, making it useless as a 'switch'.Don't make my mistake. Just don't buy it. Spend the extra money for a more solid unit that doesn't have a plethora of orifices for dust to enter through!UPDATE: I bought the Nyrius SW200 & it works like a charm:http://www.amazon.com/SW200-Composite-Selector-Compatible-Satellite/dp/B00062NHTS/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid;=1336007168&sr;=8-7"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"While the price makes the product seem worthwhile, it is in fact not. The cables function as designed but the flaw lies in the design of the switcher.It works by butting two male heads of the optical cables together. As they use light to transmit data, any break in that light will result in a faulty or non-existant signal.While I'm sure there are many customers that are satisfied with their product, I like to buy things that work. This is not one of those things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Switch failed soon after installing","review":"Pros: PriceCons: 2-3 minute delay in A/V receiver reading signal from cable entire switch; entire switch failed three weeks after installation; looking for alternative"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"Guess I should have listened to the reviews.

I took it to the shop and took it apart to see why it wouldn't work. It has an uncorrectable design flaw. It works by simply moving an internal optical cable from one port to the next. Simple enough. The problem is the gap between the ends of the cables it too large. The cables have to be lined up perfectly for it to work. The sockets on the switch fit so loosely it is not possible to maintain proper alignment and the signal cuts in and out.

This switch & all of it's different colored clones on amazon are very poorly made. The Switch mechanism itself it nice & tight, however the contact ports (3 in, 1 out) are VERY loose & poorly mounted. Because of this the optical signals don't line up inside of the product. I tried this with brand new cables (cable ends were new & not worn) & tested all of the cables. The problem definitely lies within the switch. Avoid this cheap product & use a better quality splitter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Crap!!","review":"This product is badly designed, none of the internal components are permanently secured - end result, the optical cable inside easily gets out of alignment.

At the cost paid for it I would be loosing money sending it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.....","review":"I bought this switch to select between my PS3 and Satellite Receiver digital audio outputs to my single home theatre digital audio input.

Multiple digital optical sound generating devices going into one sound system is a problem that I expect a lot of people have.

The first one of these I bought didn't work as an actual switch, though input 1 did work. Amazon sent me another one that didn't work at all, except for the sound popping in and out. I'm guessing that the construction is just too poor because the idea itself is simple.

The size 6 is much closer to a 7, so I ended up having to exchange for a size 5.

The toe strap is made of soft material and so far it's been comfortable. I'm a size 5.5 and tried both sz 5 and 6. Sz 6's length fits slightly better but the strap is a bit too loose for me so I went with sz 5. The only thing I don't like about it is that it makes a flapping noise when you walk. Well, I guess most flip-flops do. The pros are cushiony foot bed and extremely lightweight so great for traveling."},{"rating":"2","title":"My review","review":"Hello.

The problem seems to be getting worse, as for a while it would only require 1 restart, and now it has been requiring 2 or 3.I did notice the 2nd one's test pattern is now yellow and blue, instead of white and black, which is apparently because of color streaks which would be all too visible on the original test pattern.This seems pretty dirty of Panasonic.

Basically, it's a really good projector. It has everything you need, and the picture quality and brightness is really good.However, this unit is really big and not just a little ugly. I mean, I suppose the picture quality is the primary objective, but couldn't they have made it just a little prettier?It doesn't actually look that much worse than other units in shape, etc. But it's huge, which makes the utilitarian appearance stand out. Also, it's white. Which means that if you want to use it as part of a home theater setup like me, it's more visible in a dark room.Ugly and more visible make a bad combination.I'm really happy with my projector.

This adapter, which is not made by Dell, feels to be of slightly lower quality than the official Dell AC adapter. It is lighter and feels slightly cheaper. The cord is also not as long as the one that came with my adapter.The biggest problem I find is that there is a constant hum whenever I am using my laptop with this adapter. The volume and tone of the hum also seems dependent on what you are doing on the computer at the time. For example, when the cursor blinks when typing a document the hum coming from the adapter will mimic the blinking of the cursor. It does this in XP, 7, and Ubuntu. It is quite weird and somewhat annoying.

There are references to mommy and grandma. I don't know the history of Jamie Lee Curtis. Perhaps she didn't have a father figure present growing up, which certainly would explain why there are no memories to explore.In regards to the editorial review that they \\"slip in implicit endorsements of specific cereals and junk foods (Cap'n Crunch, Chee-tos, Animal Crackers)\\", this didn't bother me. I would guess that most people have a specific image or memory in their head about when they ate Cheetos, Fritos, Cheerios, oreo cookies, or whatever. It's the beauty of our memory of being 4-1/2 years old.The watercolor illustrations are beautiful. There is so much detail that they tell a story themselves. (And at least pictures exist of male role models).As for the book overall, my daughter loves it, and that's what is most important."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something every child could relate to!","review":"This is the first year that I am teaching first grade.

I'm glad that a granny got a place in the book too, catching the little grandchild at the bottom of a long slide. That's me today. I like how Curtis weaved in the importance of reading to children at night, and I vote for her book to be one of the choices.

It's very topical because we are constantly referencing her being a big girl with different things and this a great way to point out how fun it is to be a big girl and how she is not a baby anymore and that is a good thing, not a sad thing, to celebrate all the milestones that she has made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Illustrations the only saving grace","review":"This books makes me feel like the only reason it was published is because of the author's celebrity status.

It would likely take 3-4 thin coats to become opaque, but why buy a sheer if that's your goal??That said, it doesn't last very long. I'm hardly dainty (none of that \\"I wear rubber gloves to wash the dishes\\" mental issues), but with normal life wear it starts to chip after ~2-3 days.

The problem is that such a view of the world is quite unrealistic. Rewards are necessary because a large number of workers are not intrinsically motivated, no matter what we would like to believe. To believe otherwise is fighteningly naive."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is dangerous","review":"While no one will argue that talking to people and working with them to understand their motivation is important, these positive points in this book are far outweighed by the negative ones. The author misrepresents the whole field of behavior therapy when he states that it can be boiled down to \\"If you do this, then you get that\\". He also misrepresents the research on the effects of reinforcement on creativity, performance, and intrinsic motivation. It is much more complex than he suggests and does not lead to the conclusions he makes. The really scary thing is that for some situations (such as children with aggressive and disruptive behaviors) behavior therapy works and works better than anything else.

Though nowhere near the offerings of Dead Alive, Bad Taste, or Meet the Feebles, this is Jackson's first attempt at going mainstream. As a horror film, it just isn't scary but it is good to see Jackson's overall film making skills blossom into a legitimate mainstream movie. Stars Michael J. Fox in the lead as a ghost buster.

This Peter Jackson directed film stars Michael J. Fox as a sort of ghostbuster. But he's a con. He has two ghost friends that he sends out to haunt somebody so they can call him and give him some business. Then he is put to the test when a ghost believed to be the grim reaper starts terrorizing the town and taking souls. The identity of the ghost is not who we originally thought it was. The movie is filmed with a cold, spooky, eerie feel. Michael J. Fox does a fantastic job as Frank Bannister. Former \\"Addams Family\\" star John Astin is absolutely unrecognizable as the ghost named 'Judge'. He is really impressive in his too short role. Dee Wallace Stone also turns into a magnetic performance. The first opening minutes are a classic.

The album is VERY different from Mommy's Little Monster.

Who would have thought that listening to Mommy's Little Monster? The album and the change to the music is very interesting, although not all liked it and \\"sellout\\" were whispered by some. I don't feel that Social Distortion with Prison Bound sold out in any way. Yes the album IS more radio friendly than Mommy's Little Monster, but it is in no way selling out the ideals that Social Distortion always held high. The album is still full of critic of society and is still siding with the working class.

However, this album is not nearly as goofy-funny ans the Dr. Octagon stuff, and not nearly as dirty-funny as the Sex Style album. Jackie Jasper and Motion Man both break out some dope and amusing rhymes on a few of the album's better tracks.

The last few years saw him release albums under enough guises to make anyone lose track of his comings and goings. (Which was probably the goal all along.) As something of a direct result from the tumult surrounding his work on the psychotically brilliant Dr. Octagon album, Kool Keith created Dr. Dooom. Opening with a scene where Dr. Dooom disposes of his previous alias with due speed. The rest of the album is pure Kool Keith freestyle, which is pretty hard to say no to. The album even takes a swipe at the computer generated portraits done on many of the new rap albums coming out. Kool Keith would later release an album Black Elvis/Lost In Space which got more attention, but for pure, beautiful madness, this is the real deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"KOOL KEITH'S LATEST INCARNATION IS HIS MOST BRILLIANT!","review":"taking the twists and turns of a demented dotor, dr. doom lays down the basic principles of fermented underground brain mechanisms while slashing through half-assed mc's with the greatest of government cheese. the repulsion you may feel at the sight of this rat sandwich being pushed in your face will dissolve into uncontrollable sensory overload sending drool to flow out of every orifice in anticapation of biting down into this fine specimen. bring a fistful of handi-wipes to this barbeque!"},{"rating":"2","title":"dr. dooom is in the room","review":"what can one say about the genius that is kool keith? is he for real? is he mocking everyone in hip-hop? is he insane? one thing i do know is that the man has lyrical skills to out-do about any other mc i've ever heard. i also know that he makes me laugh out loud, even after i've heard his rhymes 20-30 times. his use of prose and flow and rhythm and whatever else astounds me. the beats are tight, the rhymes are off-the-wall crazy nutty good...buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, better than Octogon...","review":"I have to admit, I liked the \\"Doom\\" character better than \\"Octogon\\".

That said, it's an acquired taste that isn't for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"another keith wonder","review":"Kool keith is on of the greatest mc's of the hip hop world and this album shows just how great he is. Although, this album could be even greater with a little better producing. But with songs like \\"No Chorus\\" and \\"I Run Rap,\\" keith lays out the law on who is king of the rap game. To be honest I didnt see how \\"Apartment 223\\" was so great, i could of done without it. But i guess it has its marks. In all, this is a must for any keith fan so i recommend it very highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"different from Octagon","review":"This is my favorite Kool Keith album because it has the most outrageous lyrics on it. If you enjoyed Octagon's weird, spaced-out lyrics, this album will really please you, as Keith takes his insanity one step further. If, on the other hand, you dug Octagon's beats, this record will be disappointing. The beats are just bassed-up, No Limits-sounding ..., which, while amusing in their mockery of mass-produced ... rap, are far less interesting than what one found on Octagon. In my case, this wasn't an issue, as I will take Keith's rhyme style over beats any day."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Bravo review","review":"this little mama has it all. walkin on the beach or sittin in the bathtub, this cd is all you ever need. i'm giving it the Bravo seal of aprooval and for out of five, little bravos"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"I read Ms. Presberg's book right after reading one by Dick Francis and right before reading one by Barbara Paul.

I read that book many years ago, and in my opinion Ms. Presberg's book does not come close. As a bridge player I found her bridge examples particularly dull. I am certainly not an expert on police procedures, but I doubt if any professional police officer would have acted as she portrayed the police in her novel.

After that album became a platinum hit, he dropped this weak follow-up. Aside from the second single, \\"All I Need\\" with the laid-back hook from Tony Sunshine, this album really wasn't much. \\"Bust At You\\" was about the 550th song to sample Bootsy Collins' \\"I'd Rather Be With You\\" and so many others have done it much better.

Its neat to see how one little paranoid teacher exposes this whole conspiracy and how Tim Robbins character uses it to his advantage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Premise Undermined by Improbable Conclusion","review":"The film starts out quite nicely as a sort of Twilight-Zoneish paranoid thriller (remember the episode where all of the neighbors accuse each other of being aliens? Well, this time it's terrorists)buoyed by terrific performances all around, but loses it entirely at the climax. The ultimate resolution doesn't make much sense and carries with it all of the incoherent ingredients of a fever dream. I tried to figure out the logistics of the villain's plan, and it was just too risky. Too many things could go wrong with what they were planning. To reveal these errors could be regarded as spoilers, so I am trying to keep it vague, but many other customers at the video store tend to agree with me.

A+"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies of the decade!","review":"Do not be deceived by the poor box office gross of this film. Nor be persuaded by the critics lambasting of ARLINGTON ROAD. Starring Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins (two of Hollywood's most underrated actors), this psychological thriller will blow you away (no pun intended). While the first half may seem slow, it's all building up to an edge-of-your-seat conclusion that will make your jaw drop. ARLINGTON ROAD may seem like it was all given away in the trailers. Listen well, reader: it was not. After seeing it three times, I feel I find new intracacies each time. ARLINGTON ROAD is a tale of modern-day paranoia, and it will leave you questioning yourself about what to believe and not to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great twist, shame about the atmosphere.","review":"'Arlington Road' has one of the best and most unexpectedly brilliant twist endings of any thriller, but the movie's premise is dependent on setting up a REALISTIC atmosphere of suburban life.

What's wrong is the whole premise that terrorism thrives because our government is so inept and screwed up. Bridge's character is screwed up because the government screwed up his life and the same goes with Robbins' character, although they're supposedly on opposite ends of the spectrum on what is right or wrong. Terrorism succeeeds in this movie because everyone associated with government and media, including FBI, is inept and screwed up. So, what is the message we're suppose to take away from this movie - that the terrorism will succeed and should be allowed to succeed because our government is so screwed up? If you buy into such pathetic cynicism, you'll fully enjoy this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling!!","review":"Everyone else has said this is a really good move.

This movie attracted me, because I live in the DC area.Robbins, Bridges and Cusack are all wonderful actors. Robbins acting abilities were great in this film, Bridges is a bit on the wooden side and Joan was wasted since her part is a small one. You see her quite a bit, but the part was minimal compared to the guys.I kept looking for the character to sympathize with in this movie and there just wasn't one. I didn't like any of them. The photograpy was really bad with a forties feel to it with cheap horror movie shots.

The message is crepuscular and over-stated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic, and plot holes you can throw a cat through.","review":"The most enjoyable thing about \\"Arlington Road\\" is keeping a running count of (A) the directorial cliches it employs, and (B) the numerous plot holes that not only strain credulity, but rip it into tiny pieces and flush it right down the toilet. Let's just say both are in the double digits, most coming in the last 20 minutes of the film.The basic idea here is great: the mild-mannered terrorist next door. But getting from there to the film's preposterous ending in one believable piece is something these writers were simply not capable of, even if the actors were."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"I can't tell you why without revealing a crucial plot twist; however, I can say that everything leading up to the climax suddenly depends on things just happening to work out right.

The man is a ham, an eye-sore. This performance is typical of his recent work. Robbins, on the other hand, is brilliant as always. Cusack an excellent supporting actress as well. The plot is OK, the cinematography fine. You get a little lost, but then again you are supposed to I guess. The ending is not storybook, which is a welcome change to most of the garbage that we see these days. However, it is entirely implausible. And for a master plan to hinge on so many variables takes away from the overall movie. However, if this was Harrison Ford playing the sad paranoid, with many of the easily discardable scenes cut out, this movie could have been far more digestible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak story, poorly executed","review":"This blah movie just drags on and on with no promise of a climax.

The struggles of Michael Faraday to uncover to sinister plots of his next-door neighbor as a deranged mad bomber is superb. THE ENDING BLEW UP THIS MOVIE SO BAD THAT IT TOTALLY CHANGED THE MOVIE! The ending gives the message that evil conquers good, and that the life of a man named Mivhael Faraday should end in such vain. This is a movie that is suppose to give you something to think about: that the bombings in this country may not be one-man operations. I think that this movie was superbly done, except that at the end Michael should have diffused the bomb instead of it blowing up and himself getting the blame, while the real killer of hundreds walks away. This would've gotten 5 of 5 stars if the ending was like that. Instead it got one star because the ending threw all of the movies superb action and suspense in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Masochistic, horrible movie.

I was resistant to watching this movie after watching the ads for it, but was talked into it by someone that had already seen it. It did not seem my type of movie. However, once I got into it, it was riveting and frightening to see how events could take such a twisted path. It is frightening to think that our lives could be so manipulated. In my opinion, this is a sleeper hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"TERRIFYING","review":"This smart, edgy thriller takes on a whole new power in the aftermath of 9-11. Made years before the 19 hijackers changed our world and killed 3,000 people on our own American soil, this movie taps into fears that have now already been realized in real life, in ways far more horrific than in its final moments. Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack are the real chillers here, as the are-they or aren't-they next door neighbors. But the twist to your gut will be that you've lived through this already. The most frightening thing about it is how familiar it feels in retrospect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, Excellent Ending!","review":"Not only was this movie creepy, but the acting was superb!

A realistic approach that helped to make it a little less of the clean-cut good vs. bad deal.Give it a shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected much more!","review":"The film starts out well enough, seems interesting, and then it just gets frustrating to see forced plot movements. The way it was shot was very lame at times, awkward angle shots, weird lighting, trying to be artistic and failing miserably. Like in the last scene when the FBI is all up in that basement garage of the building, and the main character runs back to the car, WHERE DID ALL THE COPS GO? I don't know, there was so much more potential in this story, but it became belaboring to finish the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Immediately forgettable","review":"One method for judging movies is to consider whether some aspect stays with you, a character, a plot event, a mood, a place. All of the great movies have \\"staying power\\" that way. You keep thinking about them in the days after. Then there are the movies at the other end of the spectrum--you can hardly remember what happened by the next day, and you care even less. Although I'm a Robbins fan, this video is such a forgettable movie. The advantage, of course, is that you can also forget the things that made no sense at all (and there were many) and you can keep watching it -- every night, I suppose, since it will not stick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alternate title - Villians with ESP!","review":"I am absolutely stunned by the rating this movie gets. It was absolutely horrible. The plot required such a huge series of coincidences that its success could not have been by chance. It did in fact require ESP. So many idiotic things were done by the \\"hero(s)\\" that it is a wonder that they have operated toasters without killing themselves. Its hard to describe whats wrong with the movie without \\"ruining it\\" for those who have not seen it, but one scene that is especially stupid is when the son is seen in the back of the delivery van.

I had a heart attack just a couple of months ago and the doctor expressed to me the urgent need to change a diet that had caused the problem in the first place. My previous exposure to \\"healthy eating\\" was not pleasant. The food was incredibly tasteless and bland. The recipes in this cookbook are both healthy and fun to eat. I didn't even realize that was possible. The added benefit of using this book-(along with an exercise program, of course)-is that I have dropped twenty pounds in six weeks and still going. I would definitely recommend this to anybody that wants to change to a healthier diet.

More so Scarlett Diva, it being written and directed by Argento. Actually, Asia doesn't really play the main role in Love Bites. I doubt either of these films will really be remembered for anything in particular, however, Asia Argento is one to watch out for... but back to the item, the transfers are acceptable and there are a couple of extra features here and there....however if you aren't a spooky kooky or a rivethead and also aren't interested in Asia or Italian female directors i wouldn't think you would want to bother...."},{"rating":"1","title":"asia argento davidleoherbert","review":"i cannot get this to play on any system dvd playerpossibly defective..dlh"},{"rating":"1","title":"Presumptions Falter","review":"The depiction of the contemporary cultural functionality of poetry here is rather oversimplified. The domesticated modernity of Eliot and his neo-symbolist reactionary Romantics on one side, the \\"academic\\" obscurantism on the other: this dichotomy presumes that 1) one is less amenable to the often redoubtable motives of academia; 2) there is some edenic endgame wherein poetry becomes a representative art (a weird nationalism, really); 3) most importantly, that neither tendency, even in these generalized formulations, is currently doing cultural work. If by \\"cultural work\\" we mean generating cultural moments and effectively shaping that culture, I can't see how the synchronic angle signaled by the first word in the book's title (and exploited as though a comfortable given throughout the argument) has any sway itself. Ultimately, the book is as defeatist for me as it is a rallying cry for others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get more than you bargained for","review":"There is a terrific DVD which poignantly describes how a rural Tennessee Middle School engages in a project to instill a sense of diversity by teaching kids about the Holocaust. They never expected to affect so much of the life of the town, gain such a deep appreciation of the lives affected and the international involvement they earned. The lesson learned was the need to fight indifference and intolerance. A beautiful scene was the admission by a couple of Washington Post reporters that they had to get past their own deeply seated prejudices against rural southerners and discovering the love that filled their souls.Enjoy this wonderful story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Moving Tribute","review":"Paper Clips is a deeply moving and inspirational tribute, not only to the victims and survivors of the Holocaust, but to the dedicated and compassionate students, teachers, and community members of Whitwell Tennessee. The film teaches all of us the importance of facing and acknowledging inhumanities of the past by focusing on the resilience of the human spirit and the humanity that is possible when we reach out to understand and appreciate people of different backgrounds. Paper Clips is an outstanding resource for students, teachers, and families to learn about the value of community and about going beyond ourselves to embrace others and to exhibit persistence in setting and achieving goals."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Remarkable and Beautiful Story","review":"This is the most beautiful and touching documentary I have ever watched. It is absolutely amazing to watch these young kids become enlightened on so many levels. What is most incredible is how profoundly it touched me watching these students learn the basic fact that we are all one on this huge planet. We all have the same fears, same hopes, same struggles. This film shows the impact that this project had on others who were involved, eventually leading to a worldwide response. If we as adults would take the time to learn the same lessons in life that these young folks learned our world would be so much more than what it is today. This is simply a documentary that should not be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paper Clips","review":"An outstanding documentary. I recommend this inspiring story to anyone seeking to enhance a study of the Holocaust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and Enlightening","review":"This documentary is fascinating not only because of the paper clip project, but because of the changes that occur in the people who worked on the project."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paper Clips Movie: A Huge Hit","review":"The Paper Clips movie is a hit on several levels. One, it is inspirational! Two, it reminds us that regular people can have a huge impact on the world! Three, it takes a very difficult period of history and shows how we can learn from the mistakes of the past.I recommend this movie to everyone I meet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Documentary","review":"I used this video as an introduction to teach the Holocaust for my Junior Hight students and it was well received by them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational","review":"A proactive and inspirational motivator for educators and parents in combating prejudice, anti-Semitism and ignorance about the Holocaust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paper clip, paper clip","review":"This is a good subliment to a study on the Holocaust. It shows how anyone can be interested in history. It was well done. Good for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paper Clips","review":"I would definitely recommend this movie because anyone that watches it will simply be in awe when it is over. The symbolic act of collecting paperclips to represent each person that died in the Holocaust is shocking. Paper Clips inspired me to not judge people on the outside, but see them for what is found inside. This movie serves as a reminder of just how awful and nasty people can be, and in some ways, this realization can make you a better person and hopefully a better role model for young people. This movie is absolutely amazing, inspirational, and is great film for people of any age. I especially recommend Paper Clips for middle school age people because you can see how much young people are capable of doing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the classroom","review":"I bought this to show to a group of 9th graders and they really responded!

It is more a 5th grade and older film. It is about a school boy who starts a project for school about how many people died in the Holocaust and how it mushrooms out. They collect a paperclip for each life that was lost. It is amazing to see the memorial they end up erecting to hold this project and puts the horror of the war in a tangible perspective. It really was a great documentary but does include photos and graphic details of the war. Not recommended for younger audiences. Have some Kleenex near by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is an incredible film. I highly reccomend seeing it and then telling everyone you know to see it.

This is the only book that I could find that deals with the subject as a whole (vs. a chapter in a book). I tried to read the entire book, but quickly skipped to the chapter that dealt with two-year olds. That chapter was informative (considering that I know nothing), but I disagree with the author's stance that all kids should begin the process when they are 12 months old. Come on!! The author based this on her own experiences, with little thought that all children are different and ready to start this process at different points. I was very disappointed because I have been criticized more times (by women my mother's generation) for not completing potty training by the time my child was 14 months old. After reading this book, I felt that I had been criticized again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Large Collection of Articles & Writers","review":"The number of writers included in this book is 43 and the number of articles even more than that. Many of these writers have not written about Gurdjieff elsewhere.The best in this book is that it presents many views of the people who had worked with Gurdjieff himself or those who were around him and carried his work on. Many of the articles are based on direct experience of the Work and only a few are speculative and theoretical. The tone of the book is positive; if you are looking for a critical approach to Gurdjieff and his ideas you will have to look elsewhere.People are different and so are their reflections. Some of the articles are brilliantly written both in content and expression; some are badly translated from French, vague and with very little content.About 70% of the book is on the Gurdjieff psychology and philosophy, 15% on the Movements and the music and 15% on cosmology."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interpretation of modern science forcast by Gurdjieff.","review":"For Gurdjieff followers, both school and independent; this work verifies much of Gurdjieff's cosmology and psychology.

Sure the equipment and clothing shows its age but what do you think Jurassic Park will look like in 20 years. Tell me the clothing, vehicles, and the computers won't look dated.

What was added here was hokey. The original book and movie made it seem like something like this could actually happen but this version introduced black holes and time travel and instead turned into a television version of a B movie. What made the original movie a classic was the writing. When updating don't get carried away, keep it simple stupid! If I had know the new version would have turned out like this I would not have bought it. This is a rental not a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great book, but a pretty bad movie..","review":"This Chricton classic was wonderful in it's book form, but I'm sorry to say, is horrible in it's movie form. Maybe it was too complex a subject for it's day, or maybe it got unjustly thrown into the 70's sci-fi mold... who knows.. but to be sure, this film is both boring and unbelievable (in a bad way)!

During the climax, everyone was so tense that I heard 3 girls near the back of the theatre scream, in unison, \\"Turn the key!\\". It broke the tension and everyone laughed but it gives you an idea of what kind of thriller it was. A good watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for any Sci Fi fan","review":"The original 1971 version of \\"The Andromeda Strain\\" has actually withstood the passage of time quite nicely. The stark sets help keep the film from aging, giving it an almost timeless reference. The flashing computer consoles with simple displays are obviously dated, but that's about it. The story of a deadly microbe from a recovered space probe is well told, very plausible and still timely.The DVD transfer displays great on an HD system, rivaling the better DVD transfers of many recently released movies. The sound is basic 2-channel stereo but that's really the only drawback to the disc.Many consider \\"The Andromeda Strain\\" a Sci-Fi classic; some don't.

Still not pleasant,but better than the alternative. A very good film."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK Movie","review":"This movie is okay, it isnt the best adaptation of the book but it does the job okay.

The story lacks a lot of details that might help to position it in the mind of the reader. Where does the story take place. How old are the kids? How is it possible that Bobby and Kirby are on the same Little League team when they are far enough apart in age that there is a sister between them?And there are scenes in the book that add nothing to the story - like the scense with them in a tent watching a deer.And the ending was bizarre.

Don't even bother with this unless you just like to be grossed out by disgusting immature spit games or cheesy redneck acting and dialogue (You a' gonna go out thar?

I will admit that it is fun to see how bad a cheap horror movie can be. A waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Legend in its Own Time","review":"I can honestly say that a film has never moved me as much as Blood Lake did. This film did not get the recognition it deserves because it was so ahead of its time. The acting, cinematography, plot, everything was absolutely brilliant. I'm not ashamed to say that some of the dialogue from this film brought me to tears. And the final scene, not to give anything away, was a real tearjerker. I recommend this film to anyone with good taste in edge of your seat thriller films.

I don't have too many good things to say about this film. The water skiing was too long and drawn out and the scene when the group was playing quarters seemed like it lasted forever.

I gave this ** only because of the nice photography which was shot on video."},{"rating":"1","title":"An 8mm video camera could bring better quality","review":"The only reason why I rented this movie was because the box looked good. When I put it in the VCR, I thought they had given me a home movie instead by accident. This was the WORST thing I've ever seen. Poor editing with NO lighting or dubbing, most of the movie was in complete darkness. \\"It's good enough for me\\" and \\"I got my alcohol and my sex partner\\" gave me the idea that an 8 year old wrote the script. I wish I could give it 0 stars. It even gave me the inspiration of filming my own movie, I guess Blockbuster takes EVERYTHING as long as it's on a VHS."},{"rating":"1","title":"too soft for my needs","review":"I bought this to replace a similar contour pillow I had purchased from Select Comfort several years ago; the old one seemed to be wearing out.

I have been having some neck issues, so I thought this would help--it hasn't solved them, but I sure do rest a lot better with the pillow.

As a matter of fact, I had to send it back to get another one. Then I had to send that one back to get a refund. This pillow has a very powerful stench of petrochemicals, so much that it gave everyone who tried to use it a migraine. Also, a very large flammability warning was on the pillow. Correct me if I am wrong, because I deal with industrial and occupational safety instead of home safety, but isn't all bedding materials supposed to be flame retardant? As always, Amazon was great to work with and gave me a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"better sleep","review":"I have arthritis and disk degeneration in my neck, as well as suffer from muscle spasms in my upper back and neck. This pillow gets the job done as far as giving me the proper support while sleeping in any position and I am no longer being awakened in my sleep with neck pain or bad headaches. I've been sleeping better and longer and am a much happier person since finding a pillow that works for me. I will definitely be ordering additional pillows for travelling and gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for back, stomach & side sleepers (I'm all three)","review":"I was looking for a supportive but soft pillow, and I had 5 different pillows on my bed to prove it. While I like the softness of down, there is no support and it needs to be squished and smashed, etc. Firmer pillows have no give. This is a great pillow. I can sleep on my side, on my back, or on my stomach and not have to worry about neck pain the next morning. Fits standard pillow cases with no problem, comes with a soft fabric cover that zips on and off.

He has quietly become the finest honky-tonk songwriter of our time. His latest creation, the band \\"Shaver\\" features his son Eddy on guitar. Eddy Shaver is one of the best young country pickers in the business. Listen to him \\"throw down\\" as Billy Joe urges on \\"Georgia On a Fast Train.' His twelve-string work on the ballad \\"Live Forever\\", backed by vocals from the Kentucky Headhunters' Doug and Ricky Lee Phelps will charm you. Billy Joe welcomes the vocals of his good friend Waylon Jennings throughout this record. \\"Tramp On Your Street\\" is always perched at the top of my CD stack. The title cut is a haunting tribute to his life as a honky-tonk hero. The lack of airplay, not to mention a Grammy nod illustrates just what is wrong with country radio, and the music industry in general. Best country record I've ever heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Billy Joe proves Nashville can be forgotten","review":"I have 3 Billy Joe Shaver cds. All of them are excellent. Why, in the later years of Billy Joe's life, does Nashville exclude the real purveyors of country music from its pantheon of stars? I'll never know. This cd starts with the help of Waylon Jennings and you can see why Waylon borrowed heavily from the Billy Joe songbook. Waylon's deeper voice makes these tunes shine, but it is the songs themselves that are already diamonds. Waylon just put the luster on a polished stone.Eddie Shaver is a great guitarist. He will be missed. This boy could chops some wood! And he has great taste in not overdoing any of these numbers. He should have been a a studio mainstay in Nashville, instead he is dead.His father is the master behind all of this. What a great songwriter and even a good singer and muscian. If you are country music fan, please get this cd and find out what Nashville had either forgotten or doesn't know about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent album - one of the all-time best!","review":"If you like excellent songwriting and phenomenal guitar playing of the country-rock ilk, you will absolutely love this album! In my opinion, Billy Joe is one of the greatest songwriters of all-time and his son Eddy is one of the greatest guitar players of all-time (and maybe the most unknown/underrated, outside of certain circles). All of the performances have a lot of heart and are very moving, be it happy or sad. Grab this album, give it a bunch of listens and I truly doubt you will be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just A Foreshadowing Of \\"Unshaven:Live\\"","review":"This is a great collection of outlaw country-rock, from the slow, haunting \\"I Want Some More\\" to the frantic country-rocker, \\"Georgia on a Fast Train.\\" Waylon Jennings helps out on the uptempo, soft-rock \\"Heart & Soul\\" as well as the moody, acoustic \\"Oklahoma Wind.\\" Brother Phelps also lend a hand on the soft, acoustic \\"Live Forever\\", and the EXTREMELY catchy \\"If I Give My Soul.\\" The latter is very reminiscent of a Fleetwood Mac rocker. \\"Tramp on Your Street\\" & \\"Hottest Thing in Town\\" go from slow blues to blues-rock, respectively. The slow, acoustic \\"When the Fallen Angels Fly\\" & the rockabilly \\"Old Chunk of Coal\\" each feature some very introspective, spiritual lyrics without being preachy. As great as this CD is, though, it was a mere foreshadowing of its followup, the \\"Unshaven:Live\\" CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tramp On Your Street by Billy Joe Shaver","review":"This disc is filled with some of Billy Joe's best known older works. With his son on lead and electric guitar, they make quite a pair. Here are examples of some of the best country songwriting you will hear. I admit, I am a real \\"fan\\" of BJ Shaver's and this is a disc I bought through Amazon after going through his entire discology. You will not regret buying it. Not all of these tunes are favorites, but there are so many and they make it worthwhile to have this in your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for gerbils......but nice to look at","review":"we purchased two tof those cages, just because they look really nice in a kids room. That's why I am giving it 2 stars because they look nice but do not last very long if you have Gerbils. Everything which is plastic inside the cage, they chewed up. Now we are on to chewing tubes and making doors larger. They escaped so many times, it's not funny. We did purchase a whole bunch of the tubes but most are thrown away, because there are holes everywhere. The wheels are great but get used as a bathroom too and have to be cleaned everyday, unless you like the smell!! I definitely would not buy this cage again, at least not if you have gerbils. I'm not sure, but the constant chewing on the plastic can't be healthy and it's very annoying.

Constantine's 'The Man Who Liked Slow Tomatoes' came highly recommeded by one of the best crime writer's to grace the genre, James Crumley. He lists this book as a classic and I can confirm that it doesn't disappoint. Constantine weaves a tapestry of small town crime in PA. where local politics, family affairs, and ex-coal miner petty hoods grate on the nerves of boozy, hard nosed fireplug detective, Mario Balzic. Like the slow tomatoes that remain at the thematic heart of the book, the charaters here take their sweet time in revealing their intent, developing at a pace which allows the reader to get a full taste of what they're all about. Balzic ain't no Marla Maples cozy, but he also isn't Sam Spade lurking in noir shadows with a tommy gun about chatter at any minute. More like he is the penulitmate small town detective, relying on a few smooth moves, a hangover cure, and a knowledge of his environment and its PA. locals to win the day."},{"rating":"1","title":"flimsy","review":"this book was hard to force interest in, for me. The phony accents so exaggerated;it also seemed to me that Balzic is trying to be Peter Falk, and failing miserably. I don't think I'll read another by this author. Very flimsy, especially the last quarter of the book. Would not recommend to anyone.

Many I did not have words for. The way Charlie and Linda Bloom have verbalized and illustrated their ideas is absolutely invaluable. This book makes for great conversation within a relationship. Charlie and Linda have created an enviable marriage, and they let us in on their secrets. I would highly recommend it for couples who are struggling, couples who want to \\"kick it up a notch\\", individuals who wonder what went wrong, and anyone else seeking to create a peaceful and connected relationship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluffy and lacking incisive insight","review":"A lot of feel-good language, but little concrete ideas on how to keep your marriage strong.

This book brings up lots of questions that would have otherwise been unasked before I tied the knot. I only knew my wife for 6 months before we got married, and I daresay, that without asking some of the questions in this BEFORE we got married, we may not still be together today. As it is, we DID read this book together, and answer the questions. We came to many questions on which we did not agree, and came to a compromise on each. Doing this before it is already a heated issue is essential. We have been married for 5 years now, and see many many more ahead.A friend of mine, who I recommended this book to, ended up breaking off his engagement. This book made them both realize that they were far more different than they thought, and getting married would have been a grave mistake. Very good book! A+.

Maybe the reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it's like the Book of Proverbs in the Bible--not all of it applicable to my own life, so here and there a chapter didn't really interested me much. But I do like this approach of building a brief chapter around one verse from Proverbs, especially since a lot of them have to do with money matters, which is something we can all relate to. The book displays a huge amount of common sense, which (as it says in the Intro) isn't nearly as common as it should be. I guess my favorite sections were the ones dealing with bad companions, since I went through a phase years ago of having the worst kind of friends.

For example, the video contains rare footage of the first Cadillac off the assembly line, the first Cadillac plant, the first meeting of the first Cadillac board, etc.Even though its not perfect, you can't really find a video solely dedicated to this subject anywhere else.

There is more intelligent booty waxing music on this album than anywhere else this side of Memphis.

This album is shallow and meaningless nonsense with no theme. Half the tracks are readings from \\"his\\" books, which are in fact legitimate 19th-century obscure books, selected passages of which he replaces with his own and embellishes with his art (read \\"scribbles\\").

His music captures his life, his useless exsasperation and orgasm. I must admit, Mister Hellion was at the top of the tith when he made this record in his ghostly honnor. It's by far the worst.

I have it hooked to a crown 200Watts a channel PA amp so power is there and an adcom preamp so I am using sound electronics. The sound from the these woofers is just not very clear or very powerful.

They have so much intelligence and metaphors woven into their music (and they actually write and play their own music, too, I might add).

I asked about it and the vendor was terse in response, indicating that the photo of the item is not their responsibility or control. They offered that I can return the item but who wants to go through that effort if they can just get a good answer to their questions. I also questioned the age of the inventory as the color of the moisturizer in the tube was different that the tube I had just finished (purchased from a local store.) I was always given the option to return the item and I chose not to because of the effort required on the purchaser's part, but I suspect that the answers I was given may not have been entirely true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing can compare","review":"I absolutely love this moisturizer.

Their un-unique ability to rip-off heroes such as the Pixies and Sonic Youth is present throughout the entire C.D.

I was very disappointed in the product. It does offer basic makeup applications and some brush information. The end results were not what I would want my daughter to think was pretty. The models were very heavily made-up and also looked like they had excessive makeup on. From everything that I have read - the trick to makeup application is to look like you don't have much on and to highlight your best features. This video misses these marks. I purchased several books and this video.

As a story, it was phenomenal. Twists and turns, enough mystery to make you turn the pages quickly.

It has changed me as a Dad. Every parent needs to read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, Great Charity!","review":"I found out about The Gravel Drive through the Make-A-Wish Foundation because the author is donating $1.00 from every book to help sick children. (I also found out he gives $1.00 from his first book to breast cancer research - I just ordered that one!). While I really want the author to sell a lot of books so he can raise a lot of money for Make-A-Wish, I think the true value of The Gravel Drive is how it can change your relationships. It just totally makes you think about your kids and even your spouse in a new way. I am grateful to Kirk Martin for being a giving person, but even more grateful that he had the courage to dig down deep and share his innermost struggles and feelings as a father. It is worth it because there are many people who will be changed because of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartfelt and Moving","review":"My husband and I both read The Gravel Drive, and I agree with other readers - it has made us better parents. We identified with the father's struggles. They were genuine and show the depth and vulnerability of Mr. Martin, which we admire. The storyline was original and while we couldn't wait to find out the ending, it was the father's intimate thoughts and transformation that held us. I am sure we will both read this again and again over time. Every parent should have a copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Too Morbid","review":"I'm confused why readers are giving this 5 Stars. It is a well-written book, a quick and easy read, and DOES make you realize how precious time is with your children and to not take time for granted, BUT this book was EXTREMELY morbid! Not only was it morbid throughout the entire book, even the ending was morbid. I checked out THE SHADE OF THE MAPLE at the library today and plan to start that soon, and I am hoping that book is better than THE GRAVEL DRIVE.

This book made me think. About my priorities in life, my kids, my wife. I'd have to admit I think it changed my heart and when I woke up this morning I looked at my family a little differently.

She has no talent for singing and its such a shame that people that have the talent for singing have a hard time breaking into the music industry but like they say it's who you know and who you rub elbows with. By the way I dare you have her sing ACAPPELLA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great music and lyrics, but Jennifer can't sing.","review":"In my opinion, I think Jennifer Lopez is a beautiful actress and a fantastic dancer. She did a tremendous job in Selena, as well as her other projects, and she should be applauded! I am proud that she is a Latina! Even though she's a very talented actress, the sad truth is that she cannot sing! Her voice sounds weak in her album and it is evident that her voice has been enhanced. This was very apparent in her live performance on the David Letterman Show. Her back-up singers over-powered her singing, and she had trouble staying in tune and hitting the high notes. I felt kind of sad for her because I did want her to succeed in her singing career, but after all she does have her acting career and drop dead gorgeous looks to fall back on. Not too bad, don't you think?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not impressed","review":"Businesswise,I can see the logic behindthis release.Ricky Martin blew up thespot,and now is the time for Latinos torepresent.Yeah,yeah,yeah...I get it,butstill,Jennifer isn't the one. For starters,My Love sounds like everyother mediocre R&B fluff joint litteringthe Urban format today.What,Brandy hadthe day off? It is very clear to me thatPuff's worked OT on this one,but Jennifer's voice doesn't bring it,notlike other Boricuas(India comes to mind),her voice lacks that uhhhh! needed tomake this album work. Regardless,it should do well.I neversaid the video was wack,and in the visual arena,Ms.Lopez is always on point.Do us all a favor,Jennifer.Stick to acting,and leave music to the pro's."},{"rating":"2","title":"good beat, good song","review":"i thought it was a good song. she took a good beat and used good lyrics to make a song i thought was very catchy. i thought it was ok at first but now it's grown on me and i cant wait for her next release."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's always acting...","review":"I was anxious to hear this single but I can safely say that the song is nothing without the video to accompany it. The lyrics are ridiculous and Ms. Lopez sounds like an ethnic Paula Abdul (hardly high praise). I guess I'll know to skip over this cd when it is released..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jennifer's voice too thin","review":"Normally, it's hard to listen to a song when the singer's voice doesn't sound too great. Jennifer's voice is pretty thin, and I can barely hear her voice. It sounds as if she can't sing any louder. It even sounds like she's trying to sing as loud as she can, which makes her voice sound strained instead of in a comfortable volume. She'a great dancer, though, but not a really great singer. Geri Halliwell's voice sounds better than hers. At least Geri's has some depth to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Quit Your Day Job, Jennifer!","review":"I've got just one word for Miss Lopez: TALENT! And that's something she doesn't have when it comes to singing. She has no vocal range whatsoever, making her song sound very flat and perhaps a little redundant. I think the only audience she is drawing are the hormone crazed guys who just think she's hot. Doesn't she make enough money as it is by being an actress? Jennifer, do the world a favor and let the people who deserve the record contracts, have a chance to get them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try","review":"Jennifer Lopez has become a greatly known star, thanks to the great opportunity given to her, to represent the belated singer Selena. Ever since this great achievement, her fame has multiplied at least three times. Now, she has decided to sing. It was very noticeable during the filming of the movie, that Jennifer Lopez loved the idea of performing. Shortly after, she began to persue her career as a \\"singer\\". This CD is a nice try from the actress. Though she doesn't have a nice and strong voice, the style of this music is very reliable for weak voices. Perhaps she will learn to become a better singer with time. Lip-singing to this simple music, is not going to bring her to the Hall of Fame, but for now we can enjoy dancing to the rythym of \\"If You Had My Love\\". Anyways, if Britney Spears has gained fame with THAT voice, Lopez deserves a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"She looks better then she sounds...","review":"Sure, she's pretty, she's got a healthy body, but her voice doesn't really cut it.

Acting is one thing, singing is another. Her voice is of very poor quality, and it's enhanced tremendously by technology. The lyrics are simplistic. The only saving grace is that the chorus is catchy. But, a better singer could have done more with it. I give it a boo!!! Needless to say, I won't be rushing out to buy the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's not my fave","review":"Her voice is OK but I'm sure it's only decent because of the mix. She's a great dancer but a great singer she's not. Her voice is thin and weak and I bet she sounds horrible live.I'm not a big fan of hers anyway -- I think her ego is a little too big for her britches."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHE CAN'T SING","review":"I've listened to this song and seen the video about 25 times. Jennifer is a beautiful woman and on her way to being a very good actress but she is not a \\"singer\\". Her voice is weak and thin and her ad libs are stiff and awful. You can tell she has no vocal range. What's even worse is that she sounds this bad and you can tell they've done studio magic to make her sound as good as possible. The video is eye candy for men and the track (music itself) is okay but I can see that producer Rodney Jerkins'(The Boy Is Mine - Brandy/Monica) tracks are begining to sound the same. That's the best thing I can say about it. I never thought there could be a singer worse than Paula Abdul but it appears that Jennifer fits the bill. Please stick to acting Jen, maybe even dancing, but singing is CLEARLY not your bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"jennifer can't sing","review":"jennifer lopez can't sing and i'm not so sure she is that good of an actress either. she sure has some ego though and i wish she would stop talking about how fine her puerto rican butt is...i don't think it's that great. i hope jennifer reads this and would learn some humility. rosie perez is more my style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good music, poor singing","review":"I think that Jennifer Lopez should just concentrate on her acting career.

After several minutes of work, you can get it stuffed in enought to hold, but it is never going to slide up and lock in the small half of the keyhole. It will take 10 minutes of fumbling to get 1 package ready to mount on the window. Crazy!This looks like someone took an old design and got cheap with the suction cups. We had purchased these years ago from a different source, and the suction cups were larger, fit in the hole and slid up to lock.

The stories are entertaining, but most of the nephrite pieces illustrated are tourist grade curios rather than authentic period pieces of nephrite jade.

Jadeite is from Burma and not used by the Chinese before Late Ming at the earliest. Until modern times the Chinese preferred Xinjiang (Hotien, Yarkand)nephrite. He was right about white being the most valued color of nephrite then and now.. but not with jadeite. Chromium green, which is considered a gem stone, is the most valued jadeite.

It's not Links 2002, it's the championship version of Links 2001 released in 2002.

Seems extremely difficult to get a hole in one. I run this on my Powerbook G4 with 768 megs of ram and the 8 megs of video running OS 10.2.4. It runs flawlessly when no other apps are open, but if you have a few ram intensive apps open, close them before you begin the game. One enhancement that I see as a neccessity is the ability to still navigate the dock when the game is running. I run iTunes at the same time as playing usually, and if I have to close the screen for some reason, iTunes stops playing and cannot be restarted without going to the dock."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Yertle fan","review":"When I was little, my Grandmother had a copy of Yertle on a record, or tape, that I could read along with.

My six year-old, in particular, loves the way Seuss puts words together with his irresistable blend of scansion and rhyme. His books can be read on several levels at least, and most of his stories contain some sort of lesson or other that a parent can use to initiate discussions about larger topics.This book has three stories, one about an ambitious turtle, one about a vain bird, and one about two silly braggarts. All three are short, can be read easily, and raise questions about morals which young children can understand and explore. My favorite of the three is the first, Yertle the Turtle, and his insatiable quest to be the biggest and best, which leads to his eventual downfall.This is not my absolute favorite of all Seuss's books, but it's a good one, and one I can recommend heartily for any parent and child."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story with a twist","review":"My family have been happy fans of Dr Seuss and we enjoyed this book, it's quite funny because as a adult reading this to your children, you can't help but think that there is a message in the story aimed at the adults !!!!

Unfortunately my joy was short-lived as the cars broke 2 days later. My son loves the racetrack and quickly figured out how to wind up the cars and place them in the correct slots on the track. The problem is after 2 days of not even what can be considered full time play, both cars stopped functioning and cannot be wound enough to even go but a few inches. I placed a call to Playschool (Hasbro), and they were very accommodating and will be sending replacement chassis for the cars within 3 weeks time (the warehouse is closed after the holiday for inventory). I was told that additional cars are available for the set to purchase, and depending on the price and whether I can locate them at a retail store, may pick up 2 in the meantime. Overall my son enjoyed the set when it was functioning however for the price of the toy I expect it to last a bit longer than 2 days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"My 3 1/2 yr old son was very disappointed by this toy.

I don't even fell right donating this junky toy to the Salvation Army."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Make It","review":"Before giving this toy to my 4 year old, I decided to put it together and test it out. After cranking up the two cars and placing them in their proper positions, the red car \\"maybe\\" made it around the track once before falling off the track, but the police car NEVER made it around the full track before falling off the track and sometimes the body of the car would come off the chassis. I found this toy very frustrating and returned it back to the store the next day. A one star rating is too good for this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lovely Bowl","review":"I was taken with this Merchant Ivory production of Bowl, undeniably opulent and likely the best-looking of all the Merchant Ivory productions. It is near-perfect visually. Most important, I feel Thurman has given a valid interpretation of Charlotte - an opinion not widely shared. It would have been easy to play the role as a cool, reserved fashion plate; Thurman instead chose to play the character as a still maturing, somewhat insecure girl. It is a vastly more honest and truthful depiction - and certainly much more difficult as an acting choice. A passive portrayal of victorian feminine mystique would hardly be news nor much of a challenge for an actress like Thurman. I've never liked her more than in this role."},{"rating":"1","title":"Film Ok","review":"I found this film to be slow moving. Some of the acting was good and some of it wasn't. I wouldn't see this film again. I'd like my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Golden","review":"I agree with the reviewer from Cambridge, MA. The only actor I had a problem with was Uma Thurman, who carried no weight or presence in her role. I didn't know who she was or how I was supposed to feel about her, yet the crux of the movie rested on her shoulders. As a result, the movie seemed tepid and dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this one","review":"A warning, to all who enjoy fine movies, and especially to anyone who reads Henry James with pleasure: this movie is a horror, badly written, dismally acted (as if by teenage amateurs), melodramatic and superficial and vulgar, at times even cartoonish in the famous Merchant Ivory settings. James's psychological penetration is difficult to capture in a film, but an infinitely superior job was done 30 years ago in the BBC version with Cyril Cusack, unfortunately only available now on used VCR -- a performance too quiet for today's clamorous market, but quite superb.As for this one, centered on the clumsy inept performances of Beckinsale and Thurman, unless you can see it as a very clever satiric send-up of its own genre and of American wealth and \\"culture\\", the only reason to watch it is to see just how bad an ambitious and expensive film can be. If you haven't that perverse interest, avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfying, horrible casting and acting, don't just give MI a pass","review":"I have to agree with the negative reviewers here, I have not read the book but books are always better than movies period. I hate these english actors that are cast as Americans, Beckinsale and Bale are the two prime examples but there are many more.The acting was universally bad here as well, Nolte seems very wooden in particular but Beckinsale is not far behind, the only decent acting was by Uma Thurman.This felt like an incomplete study throughout, by far the worst MI movie I've seen. MI should stick with the English Victorian/Edwardian periods that is it's forte and leave everything else to those who would know better. I'm glad this was a rental for me, not worth more than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Golden here.","review":"I kept waiting for a twist in this movie that never came. Maybe I just didn't get it. This is my second Henry James novel to movie that I have watched and not enjoyed. The other movie, Turn of the Screw, has a rather disturbing ending. Golden Bowl just ended. I found Nick Nolte's line delivery to be more like he was reading from cue cards. Northam and Beckinsale are the only redeemeding factors in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excruciatingly Boring!","review":"This movie was just plain BORING. I am a great fan of Merchant-Ivory films (A Room with a View is one of my all-time favorite movies), but this movie was extremely disappointing in contrast with their other films. I watched it all the way through because I kept thinking 'it has to get better.' Unfortunately I was wrong and it didn't. I haven't read the book, but definitely won't now. It felt like they had all the right ingredients; great cast, great director, and beautiful locations, but they just couldn't pull it all together in the end.

The whole book reads like a boring book report: \\"first this person did this. then the mark did that. then it got worse.\\" It's never really explained how exactly they stabilized things but by the time i got to that point in the book i was too bored to care. the author doesn't draw his own conclusions until the last few pages either.lords of finance is leaps and bounds ahead of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too academic","review":"The author's writing style is academic and boring.

But when you open the book, be prepared to look up a bunch of vocabulary words. Also, if you don't know much History, you will be pissed off that you cannot understand anything in this book. What annoys me the most is that the author uses big complicated words. He seems like he wants to seem smart, but it really appears like his ego got the best of him.

The author basically just i) drops names of people, places, and events without giving the nearly enough background information to help the reader actually understand and follow the sequence of events, ii) frequently notes the deprecation of the mark vs. the pound, and iii) includes some anecdotes from letters written by various people during the period.

Instead of repeating the same over and again with variations, the author should have included tables and graphs that would be much more telling. This book doesn't explain much of the fundamental role of foreign and international policies and capital movements in this historic event. Overall, it is spiritless, limited to very superficial accounts and reporting, and boringly written.I would not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy customer","review":"The book was received promptly, in good condition,and at a good price.

She also writes wonderful book reviews for the London Review of Books. However I put Beyond Black down somewhere before the middle. While the unpleasant characters are portrayed with skill and and some sympathy, they remained essentially uninteresting -- small town psychics with small town ideas. The death of Princess Di thrown in didn't help the mix. I wanted something a little deeper or more exciting to wrap my mind around. However I think it is well worth trying Mantel's other books -- she is in general a skilled and fascinating writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tough read","review":"As an American reader, I found the British dialect, especially that of the cast of characters from the childhood memories, very hard to get through. I kept hoping that there would be something interesting in the story that would make the tough reading worth it, so I hung on until the end but was disappointed. I never felt connected to the characters at all - in fact, they all sort of disgusted me. They were pathetic, not sympathetic characters who had no compassion for each other.

However, it was such work to finish the first three chapters that I started another book, which lead to five new ones. For a first-time Mantel read, I was underwhelmed at the prose in the book. It just didn't pull me in and the novel just seemed to drag. I tried to get through it again and still couldn't make it to the halfway point, so I just let it go.

This was Mussorgsky's original intention for this famous piece; that is, music for an opera: orchestra and chorus. The chorus, the monumental Westminster Choir, is literally shrieking the parts that would normally be played by strings, high winds, and high brass. This piece alone makes this CD an exceptional and somewhat unique buy.My rating gets a four because the rest of the CD selections, also from operas, are not even comparable to the headliner work.

I took one good one out and sent the two broken ones back, after advising them of what I was going to do. No problem with Amazon. The first time I used one of the glasses I was concerned on how fragile they felt because of the reviews I had read, and guess what, as I was going to the kitchen sink, I was examining it and it popped out of my hands into the sink and broke; not the glasses fault. These are really great glasses, I love them. I already have a set of the 10oz and the 4oz glasses too.

This is one movie for your shelf of classics, because of its special effects (terrific for the time), fast paced action (after a slow start to develop the story line), collection of new scientific words that Webster would have loved, beauty and the beast episode, supreme sacrifice, and an exciting, albeit, drawn out ending that clearly runs over with lessons on morality, war, love, man and mankind, and a vision of interplanetary space travel and its consequences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who wrote TIE?

Forrest Ackerman reprinted the book a few years ago (by all reviews I've read, the editing is terrible in the reprint).Anyway, I agree with Russell C. Longmire otherwise- it's one of the best SF movies to come out of the 50s. The movie follows the book pretty closely in the first half.

Because except for the brief appearances of the Mutant Insect Monster, this flick is a plodding snooze-fest.

To obtain more power the aliens have sent a team of colonists to Earth, where they mine lead to be transmuted into uranium for the power needed back home.The special effects are quite good despite being dated in the 1950s.

That's just too far fetched.I also thought that the book was too long and bloated. For example, several pages are devoted to Castillo whining about having to check his luggage on a commercial flight because there's not enough bin space.

By mid-book, one gets to know the characters, the country(s), the love interests, and the (forever recurring)Famous Grouse. This book, however, never takes off. There is a hint from time to time of ominous characters waiting to pounce on Castillo, as he in turn amasses his own good-guy forces.

It's also a passionate history of Brazilian music, through the lens of the tropicalia movement created by Veloso, Gilberto Gil (also imprisoned with Veloso, and recently named Minister of Culture by newly elected President Lula!), Gal Costa, Tom Ze and others. It's personal, scholarly, revealing, and will offer a glimpse into the mind and soul of a fascinating musical genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult to read in English","review":"The problem is the translation. Not knowing Portuguese though, I can only assume that Caetano writes eloquently in his native language. I base this on having watched the DVD Outros Doces Barbaros, the 25th reunion of Doces Barbaros (w/ Gil, Gal, and Bethania). Here, based on the English subtitles, he articulates his ideas very clearly.BUT, this book is very tedious to read: long complex sentences that I suspect are a result of literal equivalencies i.e. word for word--instead of conceptual ones. I had to start the book 3 times before I could finally finish it. I am a musician who is a great admirer of Brazilian pop music and this book is a great resource and reference tool.

I own all of caetano's cds and I really appreciate his music, but I found this book a bit too apologetic and pretentious at times. It must be because I wasn't born at those times, so I cannot know how it was to live under a military dictatorship; yet I simply can't understand why you have to explain all those details inherent to one song (sem leno, sem documento). The writer is definitely better as a musicians, so, buy one or ten of his cds first."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are very nice","review":"I bought these to go with my kitchen makeover which includes copper.

Quality and Longevity of the blade is important, particularly when there's more than one to be groomed. The initial cost is somewhat high, but you get what you pay for and the Andis blade works out cheaper than a less expensive one in the long run.I found the Andis blade retained its sharp cutting edge longer than other brands I used previously. My dogs have thick, wirey coats so the quality of the blade is very important.I would suggest one caution to groomers: don't use the blade directly on the pet without attaching a comb over the blade if you intend to groom for longer grooming sessions. The blade becomes very hot and can burn your pet's skin, even though the blade has a protective coating. The unit requires a cooling down period before using the bare blade again on the pet."},{"rating":"1","title":"unsatisfied","review":"Im a barber and use the blade every day.

Great design & quality,it works really well.Thank you"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Perform As Promised","review":"The blade didn't perform as expected. My dog is a Pomeranian with fairly long and dense hair and I expected to use this attachment clip to give a decent haircut without scalping him. I knew the clip that came with the Andis clipper I bought cut the hair very short and was looking for a somewhat longer cut. Unfortunately this clip didn't work on my dog's hair at all. Ended up using the clip that came standard with the clipper unit (3 mm) to do the job which scalped the dog. The kids were terrified!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clipper Blade size 3 3/4FC","review":"Another waste of money. This blade won't even get into the pets fur let alone clip it.

So, I'm sure it works fine on the right machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really close cut","review":"I cut my bald and blade gets my cut close enough to where I don't really go over it again with anything else unless I'm going out. So if you're looking for blade that will allow you to quickly and easily go over your head and give you a decently looking bald shave without taking up a lot of time this may be for you but on the other hand if you're looking for blade that cuts to we you can't even feel the hair when you rub your head this won't work.

I only did one spray because the initial scent is SO overpowering. I guess I'll have to deal with it to get to the nice smell that follows minutes after. Overall, it's ok, but not as good as Burberry Brit, that one is amazing. If you're into fresh or citrusy scents, this one's not for you. TRY before you buy, i can't stress that enough with Burberry London."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bogus & Bootleg Cologne. This is a Steal not a Deal.

It is also very sweet, which am into, but many will find it too sweet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this one","review":"Burberry's London smells a bit like Polo (the one in the classic green bottle) mixed in with Christian Dior's Poison (a perfume for women).Smells sweet, has woodsy, cinnamonny, vanilla overtones, and its dry-down doesn't differ much from its opening notes, with moderate longetivity and projection. (I use two sprays, both sides of the neck.) It's an enticing cologne and great for the fall/winter, holiday season. Its sum is greater than its parts, which is what makes this cologne so natural and yet urban, classy and everything that one would associate with a heightened brand such as Burberry, a stylized aromatic representation of a British city.I also have Burberry's The Beat. I like London a lot more."},{"rating":"2","title":"liquid beauty","review":"Burberry London is one of the first fragrances I reach for during the fall or winter. Its a beatiful scent, with spicy notes that call to mind the best parts of the holidays. Suitable in my opinion for any special occasion where friends or family might gather around the fire and reminisce. Projection is moderate, people will notice you as you go by, and longevity is moderate also, lasting on my skin perhaps 6 to 7 hours. I highly recommend this product to anyone who enjoys fragrances, you cant go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique, long-lasting, fall winter fragrance from Burberry","review":"Burberry seems to have a very unique set of fragrances for men on the market. Unlike many other popular designers, they have a whopping total of 8 different scents available: Classic, London, Beat, Touch, Brit, Sport, Weekend, and Summer. I have 5 of these, and have smelled all except the Summer. They are all excellent scents that bring their own unique appeal. For the London, its spiciness and woodiness brings to mind the fall/winter season. For me, it lasts about 6 hours. The bottle is cool in that the sleeve that covers it is a cloth material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake","review":"Not the real thing, the fragrance is similar, pleasant enough, but projection and longevity are abysmal, wears off after an hour...

She is masterful when it comes to create tensions between her hero and heroine. She also has a beautiful and poetic way of telling a story. But Keeper of the Dream is not her best. PW's book is usually very emotional but sometimes she over did it, which is the case with Keeper of the Dream. I agree with the \\"bipolar\\" comments from one of the reviewers. And I found myself very very tired going through one misunderstanding after another between the H/h. For a while the story seemed going nowhere.

It is very inclusive, but since I already had the general background, I didn't find that suggestions like, discuss a character's motivation, to be particularly helpful. I was looking for a springboard to lesson plans. I would rather have had a skinny book with just a few specific workable ideas I could have brought into my classroom.

The speed (when I could get a signal) was 1 to 11 Mbps, my old router held a steady 54Mbps. I did need a range expander for my old one to cover my whole house, but I couldn't use it with this router. The expander only works with the basic G-router, so no way to even boost the signal on this new one. Support was a joke, couldn't get any help or explaination as to why the \\"Expanded Range\\" was so much less range the the previous \\"unexpanded range\\" Bought another older version, and everything's great again.

I haven't experienced any serious problems at all and it's been over 4 years of non-stop use. Unfortunately the settings are a little dated for me. The router doesn't support WPS, no guest, nor does it support 802.11n, despite having MIMO capabilities. Speeds are good enough to watch streaming videos and movies online.If you just need a reliable router to setup a network that doesn't need 802.11n capabilities than this router is for you.

After plugging in the cables the network was working immediately without me having to read any manuals.

The Linksys delived significantly better range than our old \\"G\\" router, even to a laptop with a normal G WiFi card. When we bit the bullet (and the checkbook) and got a new SRX card for the laptop, the performance jumped again, and we're getting excellent range and a very stable signal. Setup is a bit easier than older Linksys WiFi routers. Be sure to enable the security features, even though they're a bit of a pain. You have to enter the security code into the computer(s) that are linked via WiFi, something that Linksys' website doesn't explain with sufficient clarity & detail. (And Linksys tech support by phone, while available and free, is provided from offshore and is very weak.) The router is expensive, but if you need to get more range or penetrate solid old walls and floors, it does make a difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"it works!!!","review":"This is a great wireless router. It was very easy to set up -- just plug it in, plug in the modem, and it automatically recognizes the IP address. (It may take a few tries, and you may have to unplug both the cable modem and the router once or twice, but it eventually connects to the internet on its own.) The great thing is that it really does what it says it does: the wireless signal reaches very far -- we now get an excellent signal in our gazebo, which is in our back yard, several hundred feet away from the router. One thing you need to know about this device: it uses Mimo technology (not sure what that is, but it's the latest), which isn't compatible with the Linksys Range Extender that we had been using. But it turned out we didn't need the Range Extender after all, since the router does the job by itself. We now get an excellent signal everywhere on our property, both upstairs and downstairs. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"It worked just fine","review":"Im new to the wireless internet game and I must admit that I dont know very much about wireless routers.

A major weak point in my book lies in the fact that when inserting the plug-in on a track, it takes a longer time than normal for it to load up so it's evident that this piece of software is pretty taxing on the computer's processor & not too efficient, even for one that is has a lot of RAM.
