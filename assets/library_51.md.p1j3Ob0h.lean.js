But it does require a bit of diligence to make good 'corn every time. You have to keep turning the crank the entire time or it will burn. Don't put the heat up too high, just medium-high or so. And finally, you know how nasty dried-on oil gets -- so clean the popper with soap and water after every use. It's easy to do, if you do it every time. I also wipe it down after washing to prevent rust. It looks like it might rust if you left it wet, but I have had no problems with that. I have never removed the lid entirely, as one reviewer mentioned, but it is not hard to reach in and clean with the lid still attached. I definitely think the trouble is worth it for such great-tasting 'corn. If you really love popcorn, this is the ideal popper."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly designed and built","review":"As far as taste, the popcorn was good- but as far as construction goes, the popper is very poor quality. I knew it was probably a bad sign when the first thing i pulled from the box was a list of where to buy replacement parts.I used the popper 3 times. It is very difficult to hold the popper still during popping. The doors on the top don't stay shut during popping, so you can expect to get splattered with hot oil occasionaly.Upon the third use the top came off and the viewing window cracked. The hinges on the top are poor quality.As for burning popcorn/oil, I have never had that happen, but then again i used coconut oil instead of the oil they sold with the product.I hear the stainless steel popper is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"great popcorn","review":"I agree with other reviewers.

The gears were sticking, the window clouded up after 3 uses and the lid had actually started seperating from itself in the midlle. When I went to pop the corn, it actually stuck to the pan and began to burn.

But I am not at all surprised that Gary Shank defies this altogether, for his textbook reads like a \\"real\\" book, a great read to boot, and a lot of fun, though no less useful (in fact, more useful)as an educational tool as a result.He and I were colleagues once - though in different departments - back in the 1980s. I have then had several opportunities to observe his teaching. He was as marvelous in the classroom as he is as a \\"narrator\\" of this book.I have also heard him read papers at various professional conferences. He gave enviable stellar performances in that arena, too. So, again, I am not at all surprised that he wrote such a wonderful textbook. If more textbooks were of this calbiber, more students would love to read and learn. I am very happy to see this book out there.

Zelazny unfolds a rich and magical universe, as always, tinged with Chinese mythology, monsters and magic.However, not all is good. The book lacks depth and some way, and the ending somehow seems too simple, too abrupt for a book whose plot unwinded through 3 planes of existance.Again, this is not a bad book, quite the contrary. However, it could have been much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't finish it!","review":"I really loved the Amber series, also by Zelazny, so I purchased this book. Now, it is very rare that I do not finish a book, even if I dislike it. However, this was one that I could just not bring myself to finish. Even halfway through, I was unsure of precisely what the plot was. It was extremely strange and I found it hard to follow. I do not suggest this book, especially to fans of the Amber series. It was nothing like what I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lindskold deftly realizes Zelazny's wit and style!","review":"I have to disagree with the first commentator. Despite the explicatives, which leads me to believe the writer of the review is a little too sensitive, Lord Demon is a great read. The use of sh*t is used properly in the vernacular of the time-period the book is set in and is in and of itself very funny. Imagine an all powerful demon saying the word and you will understand what I am saying. Start to finish I was thoroughly entertained and highly recommend this book to others.

The classic song from Steve Wonder gained a brazilian house club vibe by the magic hands of Bob Sinclair, who produced de track. The groove is vivid, the vocal so emotional that you can feel it even if you are not a portuguese speaker. But if you are, then you'll have the pleasure to \\"listen and sing\\" this beautiful dance track."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're Not Missing Anything","review":"It took me a while to get through this book. I kept losing interest and I would just set the book down and pick it up a few days later to continue reading it. So Professor Nikki Chase becomes involved in a 3rd murder mystery. How believable is that? Why not introduce new main characters into the Ivy League Series who solve mysteries? And why does it always have to be murder? Anyway, this \\"mystery\\" was too easy to solve. Nikki was always either at the right place at the right time or she would ask suspects numerous questions and they would give her the answers she wanted without any suspicion as to why she was concerned. Nikki's relationship with Dante Rosario is getting old and stale and I see no point in their relationship. I predict the 4th book in this series will be titled \\"Brown Bomber\\" and Nikki will again be involved in a 4th murder investigation at Brown University."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kymberly Graves","review":"I highly recommend this book. The storyline is intriguing and the characters are wonderfully crafted. It is a first class mystery with all the thrills and chills one has come to expect from the Nikki Chase series. The detailed description of college life at Princeton is richly woven into the story and unveils an inside perspective of the choices available for African-Americans at this esteemed campus. Nikki's opinions of Princeton, carefully steeped in fact, are adeptly contrasted by Eric's (the lead character's brother) reality of the life he has crafted for himself at Princeton. The novel carefully unfolds the different schools of thought on African-American studies and its value to Ivy League institutions. It is an interesting read from start to finish"},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay, still a good read but...","review":"I do have to admit that some of the themes are getting a little played. I did expect Dante and Nikki to be a bit further along and over some of the sophomoric sexual tension, and the \\"passing\\" thing is well...enough already.

I'm now 14 and I still love watching this movie. At first I couldn't understand what everything meant. But now at 14, I understand that sex isn't what it's made out to be. Like in the movie where after Angel and Randy have there fling, Angel cries. It's because she realized your virginity is something you can't get back.All the actors were good at portraying the roles. I loved Matt Dillon in those tight jeans and shirts.OOH LALA! Badass Angel turned sweet at the end, but Ferris, she turned into a naughty girl. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I may someday find myself watching it with my own daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Darlings","review":"I have the video to this movie that I absolutely love and it is missing the song by John Lennon. The quality is not so great either. I need the DVD and I recommend this for you pre teen children to watch as well as teenagers. Kristy MCNichol is great in this.

Long story short I totally related to the main characters, it was exactly like when I went to Camp the catiness, rivalry, and contests to see who can outdo each other for the grand prize (THE CUTE GUY) only in this case to lose their virginity. This movie is like a time machine, it takes me back to being 14 again. I think the characters are all beleivable, and the story line is actually, touching.

Kristy McNichol and Tatum O'Neal do an awesome job as they battle each other over the loss of their virginity, but to their friends demise, the two become good friends. The movie has a lot of taste and certainly reflects a \\"sign of the times\\" from 1980.Oh, and when it gets released, per previous reviews, I hope they reinstate all the original songs, such as the end credit song \\"Let your love flow\\". I know you can do it, \\"The Pirate Movie\\", (another Kristy McNichol favorite) was finally released on DVD, and I sure jumped on that one, so now I am ready for this one to be released! It's a must."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie is still great, changing the music isn't!","review":"Wow, it's been years since I've seen this movie and it's still funny and very touching, but why on earth did they change the music? I hate that they took the Bellamy Brothers song from the end credits and even worse? They took out John Lennon's \\"Oh My Love\\" song which was a haunting part of the movie during that scene in the boathouse. They ruined the re-issue. ARGGH!! That stuff is all part of the nostalgic charm of that movie, in my opinion. When it comes out on DVD, I sure hope they restore it back to the original way it was.

The design looks nicer, however I find it less user-friendly. I have the Sportline 470, so I know that the design presented here (but not the product shipped) is better.As far as the stopwatch goes, I am not impressed. If I go from countdown timer mode to stopwatch mode, it stops and zeros out the timer.One thing that I do like about the timer is that when you go into that mode it lets you select every digit. So, for 30 minutes instead of pressing or holding down to increase minutes one by one up to 30, it instead lets you select the 3 and leave the zero. Very efficient. I might have kept this for that reason alone, but receiving the same model number that is very different (and inferior) to the one presented here confuses me and I am just going to send it back.I have the 470 model and it is excellent. I'm going there right now to give it a good review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Re-Mix","review":"With a group that has been over-compiled, often unsatisfactorily, a very interesting exercise is to open up the iTunes store (I should probably also suggest using the Amazon music store too), and listen to the different versions of the songs on the various anthologies, for example \\"My Girl\\" or \\"Get Ready\\" which are on almost all of them. The mixes on this CD (#1's) seem to be unique to this release, with very interesting accents on horns, background vocals, and other instrumentation too often buried in the mix, especially in the Anthology release, where many of the early songs are inexplicably presented in their mono form."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Of All.........","review":"These are great songs but..........this compilation was put out purely with corperate ideals in mind and you can pick between it andThe Ultimate Collection,Anthology-The Best of The Temptations,Gold,Psychedelic Soulor the boxed setEmperors of Souland be more satisfied.These songs are victims of pure oldies radio ware and tare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"The Body is great.

If you haven't read this book you're missing a lot, and you definitly need to."},{"rating":"1","title":"First and last","review":"This was my first book by this author. I am always reluctant to try new authors and this book is a major reason why. The plot was totally contrived even for a romance novel. The characters were likable enough but you just didn't care. The female lead comes off as boring and unlovable. There is just too much side plots involving one dimensional super villain (French of course) to make this worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"convoluted claptrap","review":"Bettina Krahn usually writes a good novel. This was not.The plot was convoluted and silly. Her dominating Daddy wants to marry her off to a man of little honour, who is a one dimensional very nasty fellow.Our intrepid heroine goes off to London and pays the hero 4000 pounds so he'll wed her, a total stranger. He then seduces her, just as her slimy fiance doesa few days earlier. She seems to have trouble saying no to complete strangers. The wedding is a sham, and she docily marries the villain who is a very, very bad fellow indeed. She keeps him from the marriage bed, but he fortuitously expires in suspicious circumstances. Oh yes, she undergoes a complete overhaul of her appearance and gets skinny. Probably from being locked in the dungeon. And then we have the Big Misunderstanding. I didn't finish it. This was apparently one of these rewritten early stories. Why take a potboiler and make it worse? Bettina, you are capable of so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it","review":"I loved this book and i can't understand why others didn't enjoy it.Oh well, the main thing is that i had a wonderful reading experience.I loved the characters.This is my thrird book that i have read from the author, and it hasn't disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucias are only so-so","review":"I liked this book at the beginning. Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez has a wonderful way of describing her characters (and exposing their flaws). Each of the characters is at least marginally likeable in her own right, but because the point of view switches so frequently, I got to the end of the book feeling I didn't know any of them very well.The persecution of Elizabeth for her \\"secret\\" struck me as unrealistic and not likely. And the characters' revelations about God seem to come from someone who has never cracked the cover of the Bible or stepped through the doors of a chapel. My advice: Enjoy the book for its awesome characterization, but ignore the liberal preaching."},{"rating":"1","title":"well...","review":"I like a fun guilty pleasure read as much as anyone. As I started this book, I was encouraged by the novelty of a diverse group of Latinas in literature. Unfortunately, my excitement didn't hold. As a previous reviewer mentioned, none of these characters are particularly sympathetic or makes the reader feel an emotional connection.The storytelling often comes off as shrill and needs to be toned down. One gets the impression that this book was thrown together too quickly or without the aid of a skilled editor. What's worse is the author resorts to the typical literary female character flaws that we've all seen before. Aside from the protagonists background, it's similar to the recent glut of \\"chick\\" books which I have found lacking in plot and character development. In the end, it wasn't a fun read which is a shame because novels with a Latino-American perspective are eagerly awaited."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"I am absolutely baffled as to why there is so much praise for this book. First off, the first chapter was absolutely grating. The writing style was horrible and seemed like a high school student wrote it. I appreciate that it showed Latinas of different backgrounds and ethnicities, and it was a light, entertaining read, but it is definitely not quality literature. Also, two details bugged me: At one point in the book, a black British man actually says that in England there is no racism. (??????) Also, Lauren's bulimia is almost passed off as a normal coping strategy, and there is no indication that her behavior is a disease. I felt that was pretty irresponsible of the author.All in all, it's like a soap opera -- mindless entertainment with plenty of eye rolling."},{"rating":"1","title":"If not looking for fluff, you'll be disappointed","review":"I was expecting a Latina Terry McMillan but thought the conversations were not that witty, the ending was predictible, and the writing was just not that clever. I agree with the other comments about the stereotypes; the story contained too many of them and they were exxagerated and inaccurate - a Puerto Rican as wide as a bus?! Even with all the problems, if you don't expect much, you'll be entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really liked it","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Granted you don't walk away with a new attitude, or to have learned anything. It's pure junk food...and I had a lot of fun reading it. No, it's not deep. No lessons to learn. Nothing life changing. Just an enjoyable read. Pure junk food, without the calories! :0)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The meaning of Friendship","review":"A story that highlights the ups and downs of girlfriends. A realistic story of 6 girls from college who remain close friends despite changes in their lives. These girls show what it really means to be true friends.

This book is easy to relate to for any girl and one easy to enjoy and read."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the dumbest books ever","review":"This book gives latinas a bad name. Basically it's about a group of empty headed, useless, lazy, out of shape, and on the top of that boring girls. They are a disgrace to latina community. The book was the most boring one I've seen in ages. Yuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the Mark","review":"What I immediately noticed about this book was the choppy writing and fake sounding dialogue. The voice of every character sounds the same.Where the book really goes wrong, however, is with Rebecca and Amber. The history and sensibility are off-base, and it's obvious that some serious issues about which the author knows very little are being trivialized and mocked. I guess that's what passes for wit.The book drives home the point (over and over again) that people labeled as Hispanic are all different, and come from various countries and backgrounds. The factual errors really drive that point home. Having a Spanish surname doesn't automatically make one an expert on all of the other Hispanic ethnic groups.If you decide to read this take it with a grain of salt, not as an inside look at Hispanics."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major Latina Letdown","review":"This book was improperly marketed and was poorly written. Why all the hype? I have no idea other than the fact that Latinas are searching for more representation. This book was not thoroughly researched in terms of Christianity being that she does make it a focal point of her story but with the ignorance of someone who has never actually read the Bible herself. Also, this book was not a \\"fun\\" read. This book dealt with very serious and controversial issues that she tried to make \\"funny\\". I was deeply disappointed by this book and felt that it was very misleading to a whole generation of up and coming Latin American women. I also will not be watching this as a movie. I enjoy Jennifer Lopez as an actress but not enough to listen to this immature story twice. Pass this book up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"blah","review":"I did not fall in love with the characters. Rather, I would like to kill every one of them. I bought this book thinking it would be a fun read. I ended up wanting to get my money back.This book is full of pompous, money-grabbing women whose idea of a good life is to find a rich boyfriend/husband. A life-altering, earth-shattering crisis arises when one of them (...) must decide whether or not to choose a \\"poor\\" man.Between Usnavys who flaunts her riches to stuck-up (...) Rebecca, and Amber/Cuicatl who is reminiscent of the Christian evangelists, this book merely goes through the motions of being \\"diverse\\" in its portrayal of Latinas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big, fat, enh...","review":"This book was just OK. It's not fabulous, and not horrible. The biggest weakness is that there were just too many characters. If Valdes-Rodriguez had four main characters instead of six, the book might have been better. There just wasn't enough character development to really get interested in the lives of the six. Usnavys, I felt, was very undeveloped. They were also stereotyped characters in a way. There's a token lesbian, a token victim of spousal abuse. Sara and Usnavy could easily be left out, spend more time on the other four, and the book would be a lot better.I came away from this book not loving it and not hating it. I didn't feel like the time I spent on this book was wasted, but then again, I didn't have a lot to do on the day I read it.It was nice to see a book set in Boston though."},{"rating":"2","title":"a MUST read girl!","review":"This is by far the BEST chick book I've ever ready.

Instead, the opening chapter was one long complaint about Latinos being sterotyped, discriminated against, etc. It was \\"poor,poor,pitiful me\\" paragraph after paragaph. The following chapters were downers. Not until the last chapter did good things seem to happen--not the high=spirtited funny novel I had expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"makes a diservice to young girls prone to eating disorders","review":"I started reading this book knowing it was not going to be an intellectual kind of book but rather a fun, light one. However, by page 23 there were like 3-4 mentions of bulimia and throwing up as an accepted way to be thin. I know someone who just spent 7 weeks at an eating disorder unit at a prestigious hospital. She had anorexia but there were many bulimics there and the damage bulimia causes to the body of a young woman is really frightening. Young girls reading this book might just get the idea that throwing up is ok in order to look thin or to fit into a certain dress at a certain time but in reality bulimia becomes addictive and in the end bulimia just makes the person really, really sick. The salivary glands swell up and they also end up with chipmunk cheeks, which is the opposite of looking thin. I would not recommend this book to anyone. Besides the foregoing, the writing is like from someone in 9th grade, not a college graduate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok ...a little disappointing","review":"After much hype from the media I purchased (full price) the novel \\"The Dirty Girls Social Club\\", I was a little disappointed it wasn't everything I thought it would be, the characters are somewhat unbelievable at times but its kind of cute. I guess I am what the book would call a Latina, my mother is American and my father is Mexican (directly from Mexico), but I couldn't relate to any of the characters at all. I am a professional and around the same age group as the girls portrayed in the book but just some of the things in the book were a little hard to believe. In my opinion wait for the movie because I'm sure there will be one to follow:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"I had been on a roll reading like crazy until I got to this book. It definitely slowed me down. I just couldn't get into it. It's about 6 Latina girls that are friends from college that are getting their careers, love lives and thoughts together. None of them were really deep characters that made you want to root for them. The only character that I even came close to wanting to see how she came out was Sara, the domestic violence victim. I thought this was going to be a easy going beach read for the summer but I felt like I was slogging through it. I won't be reading anymore by this author unless she gets a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry.....get your saltines out !!!","review":"This book has a very dry start.

I can relate to all the characters in the book, except for the Amber. Amber's character simply throws me off, it's like they needed to have the mexican be someone important and a singer is all the author could come up with. I have an \\"Amber\\" type of friend and a more realistic career choice is a photographer.Over all the book is an okay/funny vacational book."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh c'mon!!","review":"An abused wife whose friends don't notice the bruises and broken bones? A beautiful newscaster who is basically run out of town once she's outed in a contemporary city (uh, like Liz Smith? David Brudnoy?)

You'll fall in love with each and every charcter, but you'll probably identify with one or two, she's really not bias and gives each and everyone of the ladies a fighting chance.I can't believe how much I learnt about latina's and how basically they come in so many colors and backgrounds. In a way you feel she's writing your story, and breaking the stereotypes that bind."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"The book is not the best, but it was pretty good. There is no deep ,underlying meaning or prize-winning writing, but the book is witty and keeps you engaged in the lives of the characters. This is the perfect book for taking to the beach or lounging on a lazy afternoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Guilty Pleasure","review":"I have seen The Dirty Girls Social Club described in several places as a guilty pleasure and I have to agree with that assessment. The novel is fun and entertaining in a bubble gum-pop sort of way. The story concerns six Latina women in their late twenties--all close friends, to a certain extent--and their lives. It's a fun read, but afterwards, I had some criticism. The novel takes itself just a bit too seriously than the storyline merits. All of the characters are smashing career successes (at age 28!), yet all of them are failures in love. A bit of variation in their situations and perhaps a touch more lightheartedness would have improved the novel. Dirty Girls is not serious literature by any stretch of the imagination. What it is is a fun, amusing and entertaining read that is sure to please. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow","review":"I was so looking forward to this book after reading about the bidding war and the movie rights, but unfortunately it doesn't live up to the hype.The characters, six Hispanic girl friends in their late 20s, don't have any depth to them. The dialogue sounds forced. They read as representatives of whatever ethnic group they happen to be from, and not as characters unto themselves. In good books, the characters take on a life of their own, but that just doesn't happen here. One character is so out there (Amber), it's just silly.Overall, I just wasn't convinced."},{"rating":"1","title":"blogging isn't a novelistic form....","review":"This isn't writing, it is thoughtless blogging. But if you like soap operas and reality tv, perhaps you'll enjoy it.There are a few real women writers out there, but AVR is not one of them, not yet. However, identity politics seems to bring in a bigger paycheck than writing....so why shouldn't she cash in on that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dirty girl junk!","review":"Probably the worst book I've ever read. Only gave it 1 star because there was no option for a 0 star, or negative stars. She trivializes serious issues of poverty and racism faced by Latinos, and most of her characters are extremely unlikeable, especially Lauren, Usnavys and Rebecca. The book has done more of a disservice in its representation of Latinas than actually breaking stereotypes as it was suppose to. I read certain lines of the books to my Latina friends, and they couldn't believe such garbage had actually been written and hyped up as the Latina Holy Grail!Not worth the paper it was written on! Pass this dirty girl junk disguised as literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stereotypes","review":"The Dirty Girls Social Club is about a group of Latinas who meet in college and who meet a few times a year to dish the dirtt.The characters aren't believable, and everybody is stereotyped, especially the men. They're like something from a bad telenovela. Plus the author doesn't seem to know anything about Latinas outside of her own background, and the errors make you cringe.I don't recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"more than a good 'beach read'","review":"All in all, a very enjoyable, engaging read. The book was not at all stereotypical or trite in its portrayal of six contemporary Latina women. They were well-developed characters with distinct identities and lives. Of course, I had to wonder at one point: How would such incredibly diverse women ever become (and remain) friends in the first place? There was plenty of drama and conflicted romance to keep one engaged. Although parts of the plot were a little implausible, there were realistic situations and conflicts. It was easy to picture these women and relate to certain aspects of their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"This book is what I call easy and FUN!A great group read. The girls are funny, bitchy and vivacious. Latinas will be able to relate to some aspect of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected!","review":"I was disappointed by this book. I usually like to read women oriented stories, especially from different cultures and expected the same of this. Unfortunately it didn't keep my engrossed at all. It took me few months to finish it...wasn't interesting enough to compel me to pick it up every night. There are many better ones out there, so don't waste your time and money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relatable to all women","review":"I found the book extremely entertaining and very relatable. While I am not Latina, I could see myself and my close group of friends mirrored in the charatures. I think we all have a \\"Lauren\\" or a \\"Rebecca\\" that we know. As for people who feel that Latino men are not represented well, stupid men are found in all races. This book has a similar flavor (but milder) as \\"Sex and the City\\". I can't wait for the author's next book"},{"rating":"2","title":"An exciting look at why Latinas are and are not all the same","review":"Great book! I could not put it down. Valdes does a good job of tying together the cultural differences of each of the characters and how those differences help shape their individual identities. Can't wait for her second book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can I Be a Dirty Girl?","review":"This was our book club selection for the month, so it wasn't a book that I would have normally picked up but am glad that I had the chance to read it. The story centers around six Latina girls that met while attending Boston college. They all (mostly) live in the Boston area still and stay in touch, but make sure that they attend their \\"sucia\\" nights twice a year to REALLY catch up on each other's lives. It is very much a character story and those are the kinds of books that I enjoy most. Each chapter is from the perspective of a different girl, but carries on the stories of all of them within. It can get confusing, but you learn the characters quickly in the book. I'm not sure if I was supposed to learn anything culturally from the book, but I did enjoy the story of the six friends. I would recommend this book as a good summer read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous","review":"These shoes are gorgeous.

That's right. We have seen bands like Grandaddy and Earlimart already. Now we have Built Like Alaska who have been around for seven years themselves. All those bands were very low-key, unpretentious, melodic bands bringing some of the odds and ends of the heartland to urban hipsters. Back in 2000, Grandaddy was a breathe of fresh air, because we all wanted a little realism in our music. Five years later, being a regular Joe seems like a clich. Every band looks like Grandaddy and rides skateboards. This is not to deny Built Like Alaska any love. Neil Jackson is as talented as any singer now working in this format. This may be the best record of the year. It's just that anything that comes out that gives me the feeling Calexico does, I feel that I have to move on to the next record.

None of them really did. You put it on your belt like it says and it doesn't even count all your steps. Sometimes, it even resets itself and goes back to zero. It is just so frustrating.

When I went for a bout of actual exercise and walked for 1.6 miles at 4mph...it again did well. Today, back in dress pants, I just did the 1.6 mile loop at a more typical walking pace...75 steps.

We were lucky enough to get a good VHS recording off of television years ago and watch it several times each year. So we were delighted when it came out on DVD.We saved our first showing for New Years Eve with the whole family. What a mistake! The DVD copy is totally butchered and the funniest parts cut out entirely. Ugh!!!I wouldn't have minded so much if the footage was for some reason no longer available -- but there it was on the DVD as Special Features. It wouldn't have taken someone with the right editor more than an hour or two to put the movie back together again.

It was only $65 or so when I bought it last week, I see the price has gone up substantially. Heck, it went up by 50 cents while it sat in my cart that day. Anyway, I uninstalled that horrible TYC mirror and replaced it with this one.Like the other mirror, it looked just like the OEM. Although the TYC had a big scratch on it, the rest looked great. The electronics on this one worked fine too. I went for a drive, and although I didn't hit the freeway, I saw none of the horrible vibration or mirror warp I saw in the other mirror. So far, I'm very pleased with this product. Hopefully that won't change when I finally test it on the freeway.It's a bit more expensive, but considering you'll be sending the TYC model right back after you get it, start with this one. If it turns out to vibrate crazily on the freeway, I'll amend this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jungle as easy listening","review":"I haven't been bored by a drum and bass album this much since Goldie's insipid \\"Timeless.\\" Most of this album tries really hard to leave jungle for easy-listening-lite-jazz-john-tesh-style stuff altogether. It's pretty much succesful on that note, but I sure as hell want to listen to something besides cool \\"jazz\\", or i'd probably be reviewing a yanni album. And the four or so hard jungle tracks are pretty uneventful and boring for that type of music. I say pass this up unless you've got a lot of moeny to burn."},{"rating":"2","title":"A milestone in Electronica","review":"I heard 4 Hero described as DnB.After hearing their song \\"Journey from the Light\\" I was impressed, so I downloaded random tracks.The first being a song called \\"Spirits in Transit\\".This song couldn't be farther from traditional DnB if it tried.Which is what I would have to say about the entire album.That is exactly what makes this such an impressive cd, 4 Hero's ability to tap into some older styles(jazz,early IDM..ect)and do it well.This cd comes off less as an electronica cd as it does a theater album.Heavy jazz influences and very rich percussion add to 2 Pages's \\"big sound\\".Be warned, this is not for you Junglists, rather its more geared toward the intellectual minded listener.You don't have to be a fan of Electronic music to enjoy this album.Very nice work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational","review":"This album is has me thinking in a new way--expandig beyond the norm and digging into the surreal.

The entire 1990's is the decade for 4Hero. I have been listening to 4Hero for 7 years now, and they have yet to disappoint me. They have always been consistent with their style of Drum and Bass, having a hint of dark, eeriness (used to be called Darkside Jungle back in the day). Probably the one fact that made me a devout supporter of this album is the fact that they use LIVE INSTRUMENTS. Beautiful symphony of live Bass guitars, pianos, and drums.My personal favorite track of the moment in Third Stream. Dego McFairlane has never let me down.In short, BUY THIS ALBUM. No, this isnt Roni Size or Goldie, for you hardheads (in fact, Goldie is a product of 4Hero!!!). This is what Drum and Bass is supposed to be. 4Hero always had a vison. Follow it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawless Drum and Bass taking a step back to the future.","review":"This album is what everybody remotely interested in Drum and Bass should own. Already a nominee for this years Mercury Music Price, 4 hero have taken the music to unlimitless levels. This album is all about soul, and is in my opinion the best drum and bass album of all time. The last time I said something like that was 4 years ago with the Timeless album by Goldie, I think this one surpasses that one tenfold. Buy it., you will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid page-turner by a great writer","review":"The story of a loner and outcast leading a wagon train west is a familiar western plot but Louis L'Amour uses it here to good advantage. The hero is a man who appears to be a drifter, yet is tied to the land to which is being squatted on by settlers who are manipulated by an unscrupulous speculator. An Indian attack, a spark of romance, gun fights and a range war add up to a diverting tale of the old west as only L'Amour could write it. Colorful descriptions of the land also lend realism to this fast-paced novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kind of Like a Chocolate Covered Vitamin","review":"I think all women who've reached the point where the reality of the walk of Christianity or wifehood becomes fraught with more questions than answers and more struggle than bliss need to sit down with Becky Miller.Hinck's first novel made me laugh often, and sometimes out loud, and it brought tears to my eyes. She tackles the hum-drum of daily life when all you really want is to be God's MVP (most valuable player).Hinck doesn't shy away from the stuff that hits us when we're already whipped and dragging. She points us where we need to go, into the arms of God and His grace.Secret Life is also clever and well-written. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read for Anyone Who Daydreams","review":"Becky Miller escapes the pressures of her day with a vivid imagination. In an instant, she steps into a mystery to solve a crime or does gymnastics in the Olympic trials or saves lives in the ER or leaps tall buildings with her cape. Yes, each chapter of this novel begins with a different daydream and points out the secret life of Becky Miller.While the daydreams are fun, Becky's real life is full of challenges from three young children, her studies as a part-time college student and her active leadership in the women's ministry of her local church. When her husband, Kevin's company is downsized, suddenly life in the Miller family grows even more complicated. How can faith intersect with these challenges of life? The story reveals solid truths about how God can work in a family.Each chapter is laced with humor and rich images from this first-time novelist. I recommend Sharon Hinck's book and look forward to future novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Uplifting Christian Chick Lit!","review":"I've had a few disappointments lately with the Christian Chick Lit genre, but this book restored my faith!

I usually love a good \\"mom-lit\\" book...but this one was awful! The writing was poor, and after just a few pages I put the book down.

It has kept good time and I have liked the style. The watch has shown some wear on the band with some of the black finish coming off, but it still looks good. The watch itself looks nearly as good as new after long use.After using the watch for a little over a year, the band separated between the mesh and the endpiece that attaches through the pins to the watch itself. I can be rough on watches, and don't mind this other than will I be able to get another band? I don't see any bands for sale from Amazon and I will check with Skagen. Perhaps I will get lucky there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Watch for a Man","review":"I bought this for my husband's birthday and he hasn't taken it off yet. It's design is wonderful. If you've never had a Skagen watch, they sit flat on the arm and are unobtrusive. This particular titanium model is a good everyday watch and for the price, it's really beautiful. It took seconds to fit it to his arm, which was a far cry from his previous watch, which we never did get to fit right. Everyone in our household now have Skagen watches and I highly recommend them.

For Me at Least","review":"I'm a watch collector with close to 40 watches in my collection. They range from about 40 to 52 mm in diameter. The Skagen was intriguing for its titanium construction, the mesh strap and the very thin design (which I consider a good thing). Upon receiving the watch though, I was disappointed. I think the watch is too thin and too light--even thinner and lighter than the Movado Museum watch I have. Because of its small size, light weight, and thinness, the watch feels flimsy and fragile. Maybe I am used to heavier and bigger watches, but this watch feels insignificant--if that makes any sense. On the positive note, the watch is beautifully designed and I liked the colors. Had the watch been bigger, I definitely would have kept it, especially considering the exceptional price, but i ended up returning it. On a 6 foot, 250 lb guy, it just looked like I was wearing a paper cut-out of a watch instead of a real one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clasp hard to work and broken","review":"Really nice watch as pictured.

It isn't as big as the measurements in the image claim, it's actually a bit smaller. This watch is lightweight and you don't really feel like you're wearing a watch. I highly recommend it!!*******My girlfriend bought it for $80 here on Amazon, but now that price has increased twice since she bought it (I'm guessing because Father's Day isn't too far away), so if you are planning to get this watch you may want to wait a while.

Its a beautiful, lightweight timepiee with easy to read dial. I think the sleek design is stunning and I love the band material, a sort of light metal mesh with a very tight weave. I am very pleased with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Found it cheaper on Amazon","review":"I had originally purchased this watch at Macy's for $140 plus tax. I went online the night I bought it to find that Amazon sold it for half the price. So the decision was easy, I returned it to Macy's and bought it on Amazon.

I just hope that the face doesn't brake like mentioned by other reviewers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice!!!","review":"This watch is definately one of the best!

Mine unclasped and fell off my wrist several times in the 6 months I've owned it. 3.

The band is very long and inflexible, and the excess wraps up on the underside of the watch. Since it doesn't bend well, if you have a lot of excess it will cause the band to bow out and not lay flat on the wrist.

Only downside is that it scratches easily, and the scratches are easy to see due to the black paint. If I had to do it again, I would just get the silver version of this watch. It's harder to see scuffs on brushed titanium with it's natural color."},{"rating":"2","title":"the watch is nice","review":"The watch is exactly as advertised. It is thin and the steel band is fully adjustable fits nicely. I've had it for a few weeks and it has kept time to within 3 seconds of the time on my computer.

I got it because it is extra thin and light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted 3 weeks...","review":"The watch still runs, but the mesh band is worthless. One snag on a sweater, and it fell to shreds.Prior to that, the black coating was wearing off, the clasp was only moderately secure, and replacement? A reasonable $15 for the band with a Danish \\"Up Yours\\" shipping fee of $9.Kind of tells you what the watch is worth.I also felt that the pin attachment of band to watch was weak and poorly designed.I found a Fossil Men's Watch FS4439 that is infinitely better made, more attractive and the same price.Skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great watch!","review":"This is a great looking watch! It gives me exactly what I'm looking for - a classy design (but not too aggressive), lightweight (I don't even feel it on my wrist!) and comfortable.

I actually really like the clasp.I highly recommend this watch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strap issues? Adjust the clasp.","review":"People who buy this watch need to adjust the position of the clasp on the band to fit their wrist. It was set initially way too long. If it's too long there will not be any tension to keep the clasp in place, but if you adjust the clasp so the band is effectively a little shorter, this mechanism works fantastically well.I went on a five mile run the other day with this watch and never had any of the wrist strap problems that others had. The adjustment is seriously all that you need to do. I made the adjustment with a small narrow flathead screwdriver.Great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap clasp makes an otherwise attractive watch unusable","review":"Looks great, quite beautiful, really, but you risk losing the watch when the clap pops off. Even if the claps appears functional and fine--\\"OOPS, there it isn't\\". If you are lucky, you will find this little beauty on the floor or maybe under your brake pedal. If you are unlucky, it is gone. The liberal guarantee that is provided is useless if the watch vanishes.On the other hand, it probably does make a nice target for thieves in crowds. They may be less likely to go for your wallet and more likely to go for the watch.Admittedly, this watch is a tough little fellow. It withstands repeated falls to the floor and like the Timex watches of the 1950s, keeps a tickin'. You can even step on it, which you will, and it will not scratch or stop. Replace the band and you have a nice watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thin, light and stylish","review":"I got this watch to replacethis guyand I'm satisfied. The Timex is too large and heavy for my wrist: the metal band couldn't get small enough and the heavy watch always made its presence known. The Skagen is also noticeably quieter than the Timex. Why?The Skagen is thin and light and I have gotten several unsolicited comments about its attractiveness. I was surprised to see that the numerals are raised and lined in silver, not outlined in white as it seems from the photo.The calendar will be too small for people with bad eyes, the band is a bit complicated to do and undo (it becomes easier with practice) and you have to use a screwdriver to change the size of the band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this watch...","review":"I had different skagen watch which I lost when I was not using it....

Even after sending it back to Skagen to have the problem fixed it was returned with the same problem. You would think that with the use of one of the hardest mettles in the world it would make for a solid closing mechanism but it is all about the design. I swapped it for a new one and it came with the same problem (Three Strikes).

This watch is amazing! The face is large ( as most men's watches ) but what I LOVE the most is that the band is mesh and therefore you NEVER have to remove links - you can just adjust where you want the clasp to go and wear the watch as more like a bracelet -I think the hands of the watch may be glow in the dark ( i have a leather skagen that is) I haven't had a chance to confirm this as of yet.The price was a total bargain!

So when I saw this online in black, I thought cool I can now have two in different colors.The new watch is 4mm larger. I have small wrists so this looks a little out of place. One of the major reasons for going with Skagen was the reasonable size and slimness.Point number two, it's not as slim as the previous watch, but still manageable.Point three, the band sucks. Looks nice until you try to close it around anything less than a 9\\" wrist. Seems there are tabs on the backside where it connects to the watch that do not allow for the band to extend downward past 30 degrees (it's preset) no movement.Now I can opt to change bands for an additional $40 or sell the watch outright.

But I think this album reflects the political and social upheaval during the Paris 1968 student revolts. Dutronc portrays himself as the true countercultural that stands outside the chaos.

This isn't a work which should be read for \`plot surprises', but rather for its tight structure: Blish looks at magic with precise, almost clinical attention; as he set out to do in writing this work, he strips the book of extraneous details and instead confines himself to a select few questions and themes. The four main characters - Black magician Theron Ware, monk and White magician Father Domenico, weapons-maker Baines and his assistant Jack Ginsberg - all play clearly defined roles, each providing the reader a different point of view from which to evaluate what is being said and done.

He is very satified with it and has even recommended this model to his brother and mentioned more than once he is glad to not be buying razor blades.

I was really surprised at first how little irritation there was. My old Norelco was giving a bit of irriatation in places, but no problems with this one, even though it was a new razor. First time I used it was on 6-days growth, and there was none of the painful pulling I was used to. To top it off, the shave was so much closer. I really have no complaints about this razor...

I bought my 6618X razor last October and have been quite let down. First, the box said it was made in Holland like all my previous shavers; inside on the unit it's marked made in China. Next, don't even think this thing can operate on the cord when the battery gets flat -- you'll simply have to wait until it gets recharged. Whose idea was that? My advice is to look VERY carefully to see if it can be operated with the cord as well as cordless; this was never a concern in my past Norelco's, either they had a battery or they didn't but they always worked on the cord.

When I received my crystal and had it put in, the crystal lasted 2 days before breaking on the end of my desk at work (which has a rubberized edge, by the way).

My only complaint with the design of the watch is that the clasp on the band comes completely apart, and I would prefer that the two sides stay connected but just loosen.

The band is somewhat rigid which is sometimes uncomfortable if worn too loosely. Keeps time just fine...but a little hard to read with these tired eyes. The face is reflective and the hands don't show up distinctively against the blue background, not enough contrast.

This probably is related to the way that the band flexes since the break and pending break are in exactly the same places on either side of the watch. Otherwise the watch continues to work well, and I have sent it off to Skagen's service center for a new band, which should run about $18 postpaid. I'll report back on the repair.UPDATE #2: The watch came back from Skagen in about a week and a half with new band, crystal and battery.

It came back seemingly normal and in what looked like good shape. One day later i bent my wrist backwards slightly while leaning on the wall and same problem occured. I took it to repairs yet again.

I'm not to much of a watch person, but I do like this watch. The blue bezel is fantastic and really stands out (deep blue, rich color) This is well worth the price and it's super thin and light weight.. you almost feel like your not wearing a watch, until you look down at how awesome it is!!!

I can't understand why so many people come in their pants over this watch. It's as plain looking as it gets. The minute and hour arms are so thin that you can hardly tell them apart. The calender window is so small that you have to move the watch right into your face. And I'm 30 years old and don't even wear glasses. The dial color looks more like black than blue. It's not a shiny bright blue as shown on the picture here. I noticed a lot of kids in my college started wearing this watch and others made by Skagen. So it looks like a fad.

By this I mean I am a student of the game and I have not taken long extented breaks off from my striking. I also love Anderson Silva. His eye for openings, timing, reaction time in mma is complete. So this is more of an over view, so this not for me. Excellent for beginners.How this video could be better is his advanced boxing foot work, distance, and defense. He showes you in his sparring session, but does not go over in this DVD. Like when he slips a punch and ends up on his sparring partners right side.With all that said I did enjoy the Takedowns DVD. The Dvd is very informative and clear. If you looking for some good info, purchase that.Those who want a great advanced DVD in boxing Title Boxing called \\"Freddie Roach's Advanced Punching Techniques\\" or \\"John Brown's Advanced Shadowboxing DVD\\" plus \\"John Brown's Effective Footwork DVD.\\" Those videos are worth their wait in gold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst I've ever seen","review":"This video is nothing more than home video of sparring. There is not discussion of technique or explanation of what move he's working on. You would get more out of going to a boxing gym and watch a sparring session. You cannot hear what Freddie Roach says to Silva as he's always got his back to the camera and mumbles a low tone. If there are truly over 62 techniques, you have to be a pretty experienced boxer to see and figure them out. If you're that experienced to see what the techniques are, you wouldn't be watching a video like this in the first place.Follow-up: Appears to be something wrong with the DVD as I see some of the actual lessons that are supposed to be on the DVD on youtube. It loads the extra bonus feature instead of the real video as if they forgot the main feature.

He is an English Teacher at Providence College, a Catholic institution. His retelling of the Divine Comedy is reasonably accurate and quite readable. The problem comes with his notes. They range from the scandalously inadequate to the downright offensive. Esolen has written a number of anti-gay articles for religious publications . This is reflected in his notes where he refers to homosexuality as something like \\"that most heinous of sins\\". This is not only offensive in a contemporary publication, but is totally out of tune with Dante himself, who took a much more sympathetic and nuanced approach c.1300 AD. And there are other personal and inappropriate comments.There are many superior translations out there. Mandelbaum's is excellent and has very good notes.

Other than that one weak spot, the unit is brilliant. With the desulfating function, I have brought several starter batteries back from the brink after months of sitting undercharged. The charger is a little quick to throw a fault code if the battery is very weak, but a few tries at the lowest setting, with a desulfate cycle thrown in between them usually does the trick. Of course, overly discharging a lead acid battery is highly destructive to the battery anyway, but this charger is the closest thing you will find out there to a miracle cure. It is also very well suited to maintaining a perfect charge on banks of RV batteries during winter storage.

Probably Enescu's greatest hit, it's self-recommending and nicely done here. But oh my... where DID this haunting Symphony #3 come from? I literally had never heard it in 40 years of listening. This 1918 score defies categorization, having good points of varied composers in one gorgeous melange: the nobility of Bruckner with the perfume of Debussy in the first movement; sinister Martinu-like burblings with the orchestral muscle of Strauss in the second; and a sedate, divine final movement with added pipe organ and wordless choir like Holst's \\"Planets.\\" The sound engineering is particularly impressive in this movement.

Other reviewers have analyzed both far better than I can, so let me limit myself just to the emotional reaction I had to each. As I said, both strike me as introspective, but the Third seems to have a much more restrained emotional spectrum, plodding along with sufficient energy and invention to keep my interest but never stepping very far from the beaten path. The Seventh, on the other hand, does begin to get into the emotional wilds, though in a restrained way -- with Rubbra you don't get fireworks, but that's not to say there isn't drama.

The lume of the watch hands and number markers are very bright when charged. The back of the watch has the always classy looking clear glass. Being that it is an automatic movement, the watch must be worn or \\"wound\\" by using a watch winder. The expected fault of this watch is definitely the band. It is very cheap feeling, and I personally would never wear it, however I expected this and ordered a beautiful leather pilot strap to replace the garbage steel.

They are so distracting, frequent, and major that it made me crazy.. and really disappointed. I know, I know, you get what you pay for. This one is so good that I'd actually PAY for it, which is high praise indeed from a cheapskate like me. The only good thing about this edition is that someone elses highlights are included in the text, and that someone has chosen a few really pithy, memorable quotes.

It doesn't have a rechargeable battery, but so what? Plugging into the outlet for a couple of minutes while shaving won't hurt anything :) The finish is clean and neat, the grip is secure.

Why does the motor sound so weak-it sounded like a dying battery!\\" (And since there are no batteries in this we both were taken aback!)

I'm impressed with how comfortable and easily it takes off my whiskers. The floating head is truly a floating head,not just the blades like my older model. It gets close around my nose and mouth,and there is no irritated skin left behind. If you have never used an electric,give it a try for at least a couple weeks before giving up. It will take that long for your skin to adjust. Don't bear down,but just let the razor do the work,and I'm sure you will enjoy the results. Norelco is easy on the skin.

I have also tried foil shavers, but they are terrible for me. Fortunately I have electricity in my bathroom (I must be one of the lucky few, judging from the number of corded models available) and I actually like the fact that I don't have to mess with recharging or dead batteries (don't they always seem to die when you need them the most?).

It must be because I have really, really coarse facial hair, but this thing is painful! I keep looking at it to see if it's accidentally set to 220V because the blades seem to kind of poke around in lazy circles, and periodically grab a hair and come to a complete stop, right before yanking it out of my face. And what's worse is that if I put off using it for a while, my facial hair just gets longer and more coarse, and it hurts even more.A hint if you end up in the same situation as me (coarse hair) ... start shaving from the top down on your face, drawing the shaver down s-l-o-w-l-y and with zero pressure on the skin, over the same area several times.

I cannot compare it to the first volume which was mixed by Matt Darey, since I feel both have a unique distinct style all of its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trance kings","review":"This album is a masterfully compilated collection of Progressive trance songs allowing any of those who listen to it to either fall asleep comfortably in a fascinating dream world or dance until 3 in the afternoon the next day without ever wanting to stop!!!

He was the first to catalog this style of chord formation, developed by Red Garland, Wynton Kelly, Ahmad Jamal, and Bill Evans -- a style learned today by every serious jazz pianist.Bill Evans appreciated this book enough to write the (short) introduction to it.But it won't teach you how to play jazz. It's a book for musicians, an invaluable reference to the \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" rootless piano voicings.

My personal Favorites are 'Rooh Ki Pyas' and 'Iltija'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old stuff","review":"The new album of Junoon turned to be like their own old conventional stuff. There's nothing in it, just a bunch of songs with no pure ideas, just to continue with their fame, as they thought would make it hit. This album is selling because of their fame, other wise if you just keep aside junoon's image and listen to it, you would think of it as an amatuer band who have just tried to mix a few eastern and western instruments and produced the same ... stuff sith no meaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive !","review":"Received as a gift and can't get enough of it.

It is basically Schatz rambling on without any real plan. He goes through things so quickly and disorganized that you can't follow it. And since there is no book there nothing to go back to except trying to find the spot in the video again. I found this incredibly frustrating. After this one, I don't think I will ever buy an instructional video without a book to go along with it. I feel like I have been had on this.

Anyhow, by the time I discovered this I had passed the warranty period and decided it was just a badly spent $29.

This book documents the impacts of transition on pastoralists,through multidisciplinary field studies at several sites between 1998-2000. Topics include: Asian agrarian reform, vegetation dynamics, livestock nutrition, grazing patterns, marketing and pastoral income, land degradation, institutions for managing pasture and livestock. The fourteen authors include five Central Asian scientists, and range from social anthropologists, animal scientists, economists, pasture agronomists and climate ecologists. The book will be of interest to researchers on range and livestock in semi-arid areas and to policy analysts of transition in the rural areas of the former Soviet Union."},{"rating":"2","title":"Progressive, superior... Splendid!","review":"This newest release from the progressive metal powerhouse Artension is amazing. The sound is amazing... crisp and clear, certainly one of the best produced discs from Shrapnel Records. The style is amazing... highly musical yet still in the context of songs, not just instrumental romps.The heart of the band is clearly Ukranian keyboard wizard Vitalij Kuprij, also known for his stellar solo offering High Definition and his work on Steve Howe's Ascend. Classical influences are obvious but in the heavy vein of early Malmsteen.John West's vocals are clear and strong, very much like Jeff Scott Soto with Malmsteen's Rising Force. The guitar work is smooth, articulate and in perfect tandem with the keyboard solos and runs that abound.If you want to enter the world of progressive metal this is an excellent starting point. I would compare this to Symphony X in quality and originality... fresh, powerful with a sense of majesty."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good...dog got diarrhea","review":"not long lasting really and makes the dog sick when she eats too much of the treat.

She's VERY food-oriented so trying to get the treat out of the ball by licking it and scraping with her front teeth originally kept her occupied for almost a week during the days (we would put it up when we're home to play with her) with the bonus of cleaning her teeth really well. However, she has figured out how to pry the treat out of the ball after some licking, so it only lasts about a day or two now.

The reviews from national magazines and amazing authors (like Jerry Stahl) said that it was lol funny but I haven't laughed once - or even smirked. In fact, I found it tried much too hard to have humor and completely fell flat. After reading Augusten Burroughs, I likely have a new standard for humor. His books are poignant, intelligent and hilarious while Loser Goes First is typical, trite and self-indulgent. The book received one star because there was no lower option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hits close to home","review":"Five minutes into reading this book, I felt like I was reading my own memoirs, if I had the motivation to do it. The procrastination, the job-hopping, the seemingly \\"wasted talent\\" of the author: yes, this could very well be my life story. When Kennedy fails to comprehend why his boss doesn't understand that he only works three days a month (since he makes 500 dollars a day, of course!) I knew exactly what he was talking about. Still, I would have liked to read about how he went from being a slacker with no money and no ambition to being the current DIRECTOR OF CREATIVE DEVELOPMENT AT ATLANTIC RECORDS! That I wouldn't mind falling into. Otherwise, hilarious random coming-of-age story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really folks, not that funny........","review":"I had high expectations for this book, something on the order of \\"Selling Ben Cheever\\" or \\"A Working Stiff's Manifesto.\\" Both of those books had a biting sense of humor, but they were also insightful about the world of work and the confusing sense of identity that comes from frequent job loss and career shifts. \\"Loser Goes First,\\" however, is heavy on smarm and self-satisfaction, and provides little to no insight either about the author or the uncertain workplace. I would categorize this book as yet another installment of the \\"Slacker Chronicles,\\" whereby writers with style to spare and not a lot of relevance or depth, tell about their lives as if we should automatically find them interesting. I'm not kidding when I say that I didn't so much as chuckle, and instead only finished the book because it was short enough not to be a burden. Given the press, I'd say this is a highly overrated piece of fluff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"Follow the author as he travels through a series of short careers, finding himself in the next before he realizes what he likes about each. Dan Kennedy has a remarkable ability to describe his life's catastrophes without being either too glib or too serious. This allows the reader to relate to his problems, but in an enjoyable way. Following his progression from warehouse employee, to firefighter, to working at an espresso stand, and his reasons for choosing and then abandoning each leads to a truly engrossing story. In particular, the description of his performance at an open-mike night in Texas will blow you away.Dan Kennedy's writing moves the story along, and the story itself is great, this one is not to be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"starts off strong and falls right off the ledge","review":"The first chapter is gut busting funny but after that the whole thing collapses.

Dan Kennedy's wickedly funny life story is one that most of us can identify with, because at one time or another all of us have experienced painfully embarassing moments reminiscient of A Christmas Story or The Wonder Years. The writing is a little rough around the edges, which is fitting of the theme and the hilariously nagging reminder that we are all too human."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Hilarious","review":"I highly recommend this book if you enjoy edgy, humourous story telling. At several points during Loser Goes First, I had to put the book down as I knew I was going to laugh uncontrollably in a public space and didn't want to look like a raving lunatic. I purposely read this book slowly so to stretch out the enjoyment of it. It's that good. I enjoyed Dan's telling about all of his crazy jobs and experiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny","review":"This the author's second book. It's an episodic memoir that is equal parts hilarious and embarrassing things that the author has been through.

It was perhaps just a little better than the third book in the series, and possibly not quite as good as the second. I found once again, as in Comanche Moon, that the Amerindian characters were quite well done, although not quite as well as CM. The Sin Killer was a very interesting character, and Tasmin was also a well-developed and compelling personality. McMurtry did an excellent job of re-creating the American West in the early 1830's and showing just how dangerous conditins were at that time. The beginning of the book was a little bit slow, but once a reader gets past the first 15 or 20 pages, she will be rewarded with excellent prose, a dynamic plot, and fine characterizations. I recommend this book highly, although not as highly as Comanche Moon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zane Grey on Drugs","review":"If this is to be a four part series, McMurty should have given this one to us for free.

Although \\"farce or \\"fantastic\\" has been an apsect of some of his Western Books, this book was just too much. The characters not being believable was one thing, but not caring about them was the coffin in the nail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Gone Bad","review":"The book Sin Killer is not a very good. The book is pretty much pointless. In Sin Killer it did not give very much information and it was not clear. It talked about where they were going but the author jumped around on many subjects. The author would be talking about one thing then all of the sudden he would be talking about else. I would reccommend this book to people that are older mature and can read very well. I think this book was more written for adults than young adults. This book was mainly about a girl who moved to America. When they got there they bought a steamboat and started to travel the rivers of the west. It talks about what goes on the in the wild west and the adventures they have. This bookis best suited for adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saccharine Drivel","review":"McMurtry has always relied on cuteness, but some of his books have had other, redeeming qualities. In this book absolutely nothing else is going on. Up to page one hundred, when I gave up, not one of the many characters had uttered a believable line of dialogue or exhibited a plausible reaction to any situation. I'm not sure what McMurtry intended, but this book with its mostly English cast ends up seeming like a second rate, unfunny imitation of P.G. Wodehouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are ye Augustus?","review":"After writing the outstanding Lonesome Dove, it is understandable that McMurtry has a lot to live up to. Unfortunately, Sin Killer misses by a very long mile. The story revolves around a wealthy English family that has hired a steamer to steam up the Missouri River simply so the bombastic, sex addicted father can hunt. McMurtry surrounds the family with a host of eclectic characters, all of which seem to be having sex with each other. The Sin Killer is a young man raised by the Indians and given back to the whites, in this case a hypocritcal bible thumper. The Sin Killer, thus, tries to kill \\"sin\\" in everyone. You, know, I don't even want to go on because this book was so lacking in plot, character development, and so full of characters I couldn't give a damn for. I am a big McMurtry fan and I am sorely disappointed with this effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vastly disappointed !","review":"Just finished reading SIN KILLER by McMurtry. I have always enjoyed read his books but was greatly disappointed in his latest endeavor. There seems little if any plot or story line and his attempts at farce fall far short in my mind. If this is an example of the first book of his tetralogy, you can definitely count me out as far as reading any further volumes in this series.The characters in the book don't a semblance of establishing any personality---they are shallow, predictable, and without any substance in my opinion.I'm disappointed in McMurtry and wonder if he is trying to make it on his name and past writings with this current series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissapointment","review":"An unfocued annoying cast of characters. It has none of the magic, none of the bigger than life sense of place of Lonesome Dove. Mr. McMurty should have stopped and rested on the laurels of having created the Western equivilent of a Gone With the Wind classic in Lonesome Dove.Now his new novel leaves you with a sense of embarassment to have spent nearly twenty bucks on a book that didn't deliver a good read. From the history angle of the Western Genre, Sin Killer offers little to be believed. It offers the type of writing you expect from a first time writer, not the craftsman McMurty proved he was with Lonesome Dove."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable read!!!","review":"After reading many of the reviews for this book, I felt compelled to weigh in my opinion. First of all, everyone seems to be chasing a high they got from \\"Lonesome Dove\\". While it is one of my personal favorites, it does not serve as a benchmark for everything to follow--both a unrealistic and unfair standard.That being said, I found \\"Sin Killer\\" quite enjoyable. It was funny and entertaining, and was an easy, leisurely, yet quick read. I think that identifying the book as a sort of black comedy is key to enjoying it. I am eagerly awaiting the next book.If anything can be learned by the two extremes of reviews this book has garnered thus far, it is that you should not judge a book by its cover OR its inside flap. Just trust the author and read the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop at book one.","review":"I also loved \\"Lonesome Dove\\". So I bought \\"Sin Killer\\". I did not expect another \\"Lonesome Dove\\", however I did expect something better than what I got. \\"Sin Killer\\" is one of the few books that I did not finish. I got just over half way through and gave up. It was pointless, and poorly written with no depth to the characters, none of which had any redeeming qualities. If you must read this book, get it from the library don't buy it. My mother an avid reader did, and she quit about two thirds of the way through. At least she saved her money.A note to Mr. McMurtry. When you sit down to write the rest of the \\"Sin Killer\\" tetralogy....don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst McMurtry book ever","review":"As a long time fan of Larry McMurtry, this book was a big disappointment. I rated Lonesome Dove as one of the best books of all time. Sin Killer is one of the worst. The characters are unbelievable, the story line is non-existent. McMurtry's characters in previous books have always been so life-like and interesting. Sin Killer characters could not for a moment be considered real, nor be representative of the period which McMurtry writes about. Don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was he thinking?","review":"As one other reviewer has stated, this book is certainly no Lonesome Dove........Although I very rarely give up on a book halfway through, I didn't even make it halfway through this one. The characters in this book seem cartoonish, and their circumstances are impossible to sympathize with. If you must read it, hoping for another Lonesome Dove, get it at the library. Don't waste your money by buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely readable","review":"I'm a fan of McMurtry but this one is a stretch. I've lived in England and I've camped in much of the area along the Missouri that he is writing about. Of course this is not a realistic book, but I didn't get even a whiff of authenticity in his characters or his landscapes. Funny? I didn't think so. For humor it seems to me you have to have something to push against and the characters and situations are so far out that nothing is surprising. A 1 star minus for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"how truly embarrassing for this author","review":"Made it 125 pages. Without question the worst book I have read in a decade. Let's see... a comedy that isn't funny (hah hah! the mother, cocktail in hand, fell down the stairs, bumped into a bunch of other people, broke her neck and died!); scores of characters, none of which is interesting or well-developed in any way. The jacket cover info is a bald-faced lie. Comparing this work to Lonesome Dove should earn any reviewer a jail term. How deeply, deeply unfortunate. And we get to look forward to 3 more books in the series! I blame McMurtry's editor. It is that person's duty to tell an author, even one of McMurtry's incomparable talent, that he's missed the mark this time. For those of you that read Lonesome Dove and want another McMurtry gem, read Comanche Moon. As for me, I'm going to try to forget I ever saw this one in the bookstore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Bad Writing","review":"This novel is a real dissappointment, especially from an award-winning author. The characters are not only uniformly unlovable, but also two dimensional characteratures. The story is not helped by a series of major historical bloopers in the first chapters - one in which a little boy wishes that his big sister could be bitten by a mosquito so \\"she could die of malaria.\\" This in the 1830's decades before anyone had any idea of the connection. Later the author,in two places, has the aristocratic lord valuing his daughters only for the large doweries they would bring in. It doesn't take a student of English history to know that dowery refers to the amount of property required to marry a girl off, and that a young English girl's matrimonial prospects rose and fell on the amount she could bring with her. Perhaps McMurty is confusing this with the Arab world and \\"bride price.\\"In short bad writing, worse editing, a dull story. If you have to read it at least wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Start","review":"If a reader is looking for another Lonesome Dove, it's not here. But if a reader was satisfied with the sequel and prequels of that work, then they should be very well pleased with this one. There is more humor in this than I have seen previously. I like the Native American perspective much more than Commanche Moon. I found myslelf falling more in with the tone and feel for the story towards the end of the book, resulting in eagerness for those to follow. I like the excerpts at the beginning of chapters and accompanying chapter titles, but find the chapters to be too short. Overall was left with a satisfaction closest yet to that of the Pulitzer winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work. Not by a long shot!","review":"Larry McMurtry's Sin Killer must have been published only on the Author's past reputation. This book features an unbelievable ride through the Great Plains. The first installment of a proposed tetralogy, The Berrybender Narratives, Sin Killer follows the adventures of the Berrybenders, supposedly a large, noble English family traveling the Missouri River in 1832. The characters are unbelievable, and unlikeable. The family is suposedly travelling via a luxury steamer, accompanied by an equally unbelievable and unlikely assemblage of servants, guides, and natives. All of the situations of adversity seem contrived and random. A waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hugely disappointing!","review":"After enjoying McMurtry's masterpiece \\"Lonesome Dove,\\" I had high expectations for this book. However, I can honestly say that it is one of the worst books I have had the misfortune of reading. The numerous characters are unlikely caricatures and the rapidly occurring events are equally ridiculous. There is never an opportunity to understand or care about any of the main characters, and each surprising turn left me rolling my eyes and wishing the book would simply end and spare me the trouble. The tongue-in-cheek language used both in the narrative and in the dialogue suggest that it was meant to be a farce, but the plot unfolds with such ponderous self-importance that I wonder what the author could possibly have been thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sin Killer = Sanity Killer or Insomnia Killer","review":"This book was just plain awful. So awful that I want the time I spent reading it back. I mean can I sue someone for suffering through this awful read? Most likely I cannot not, but I can warn others. So that is what I will do. The book try to accomplish what was done with Lonesome Dove, and that is getting the reader firmly in the grip of a story that is so interesting that they will purchase the succeeding books in the franchise. The Berrybinders left me wishing they were all dead, hell tortured for all the pain they caused me in this book. It was great prose, but even great pose cannot give life to a stillborn story. Avoid this one, and keep a few hours of your life from being wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"After reading throuugh 2 chapters I gave up on Sin Killers. THe British names are to difficult for me to pronounce. I just could not stay interested in the book. Unfortunately, I purchased the other 2 books in this series as well.Next time I want to buy a book I'll read the customer reviews. Seems this book has a lot of negative reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpleasant Prairie shenanigans!","review":"Well, I am a big fan of the McMurtry oeuvre and some of his signature elements are here in this book series. He has a certain style that is unmistakeable--and in this case he seems to be trying to parody himself. There was enough to hook me to read this, and in a pinch read the second book, but there were times I was skimming portions of this book.The main things to dislike were that the characters were mostly selfish and upleasant. It was hard to find anyone to like. The plot was not very interesting. It left me feeling unsatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Perfect Book on Tape...","review":"...to loan to people you don't like. A lousy story poorly told, with a hugh cast of unlikeable characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh","review":"I have read A LOT of Mcmurtry's novels, but this one I like the least, which is odd, because I think I might be the only person. :) I love the rest of the books, just not this one. I actually got bored reading it. A lot of people compare the characters as dynamic as those in Lonesome Dove, but I was VERY disappointed when I actually read it, and they came no where close. I didn't fall in love with these characters, and although there were some real neat situations they got themselves into, it wasn't as gripping as some of his other books. Things were amusing like Lord Berrybender continually losing limbs, but I dunno. The way it ended it sounded like the one after this one might be better and more interesting. I love all other Mcmurtry books though! Particularly the Lonesome Dove Tetralogy, Zeke & Ned and Boones Lick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed reader","review":"Awful..Just simply awful. I forced myself to read about 140 pages and finally gave up..Not once did I even crack a smile at what I suppose was meant to be funny. I gave up and so should McMurtry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"McMurtry's latest novel is set in 1832, as a familial band of English nobility and their sizable group of retainers set forth on the Missouri River for an adventure. The novel's theme of Old World meets New World is glaringly obvious, and as shallow as the river on which it is set. The characters most often are caricatures - at time I thought, \\"Was this written by Monty Python?\\" Nevertheless, McMurtry's lyric pen and ability to conjure up the geography of this once unspoilt country are intact.Sin Killer is the first of a planned tetralogy (four books), and one can only hope that theis master of Western frontier fiction returns to form in the remaining books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A strike-out for Larry McMurtry","review":"A realize that everytime at bat cannot produce a home run, but Larry McMutry this time has written a complete strike-out. I am used to much better things from his writing. Lonesome Dove and most of it's spinoffs were excellent. I cannot help but wonder if someone else wrote this book. I have felt this way about Steven King among others. It seems that they run out of things to say and are only churning out words to fullfill a contract If this is supposed to be the first of a four part series, I doubt that the rest are worth anyones time or money !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sin Killer","review":"I just read Sin Killer and was very disappointed. At times I was tempted to just put it down. I loved Lonesome Dove, both the book and the movie, the book was best, and was really let down with this one. I will read other works by McMurtry though because of the outstanding Lonesome Dove."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only buy this if you have a table with a short leg...","review":"Yes, I know it's supposed to be satire.Yes, the dialogue is delightful and quaint.Yes, Larry McMurtry (who's written more screenplays and novels than God himself) is the author.That doesn't magically transform \\"Sin Killer\\" into a good book.I got this is a gift, so I spent no money on it, but I *still* feel cheated. If you've ever read McMurtry, skip this book; it will shake your faith--usually well-earned--in his writing. If you're not familiar with McMurtry's works, don't read this; it's not at all representative of his genius.I'm going to re-read \\"Lonesome Dove\\" just to get the bad taste out of my mouth from \\"Sin Killer\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Terrible Book","review":"There were hardly any characters with any redeeming qualities whatsoever in this book. None of the characters cared about each other and I didn't care about any of them. The possible exception was Jim Snow, who could have been a fairly interesting character, but he only had, like 10 lines in the whole book. Then, the book ended with nothing resolved, like cutting off a 30 chapter book at then end of chapter 10.I won't be fooled by McMurtry again. This is his style, and some like it. I don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Immensely Satisfying Tale","review":"Once again, Larry McMurtry has created a complex world of eccentric characters in the Old West. Since I consider \\"Lonesome Dove\\" a contender for \\"The Great American Novel,\\" I was delighted that McMurtry is once more writing Western novels. The Berrybender family with its independent named and numbered offspring, self-indulgent parents and haphazard entourage contrasts starkly with the Americans, Indians and Canadians but there are no saints here. Neither trite nor predictable, the main story line is frequently put on hold as the action follows characters to their fate or doom. My only complaint is that book one ended too soon and I don't want to wait for a year for the next installment!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sad effort","review":"I've read nearly all of Larry McMurtry's books, so obviously I'm a big fan of his. But what happened here?? The characters are more caricatures than characters, the premise ludicrous, the scenes unbelievable. I shudder to think that there are three more books to come in this series that is so wasteful of a brilliant writer's talent. Larry, your time could be better spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Usual McMurtry caliber","review":"After reading this novel, I had to ask myself \\"why was this ever even published?\\" I've enjoyed McMurtry novels immensely over the years and was horribly disappointed in this piece of rubbish. The characters are simply bizarre and as a whole evoke no emotional response from the reader. The plot is childishly simple and, although at times humorous through folly, not specifically engaging. Barely 300 pages (and that's with careful formatting), it's obvious \\"Sin Killer\\" was churned out to simply make a deadline and is not a true effort from a highly talented writer. There are many much better Larry McMurty novels. Forget this one and go try something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"like a silly dream best forgotten just before awakening","review":"This book is populated by beings so shallow, selfish, amoral, thoughtless, and devoid of any substance that permits the word character to be used in their behalf. I am really glad that I didn't buy this book, but am much saddened to note that it was given to me by someone I considered to be a friend. Alas, perhaps she may be able to redeem herself if she does something magnificent and minds her mannerss.If there is a plot to the thing I never found it in the first 2/3 of the book, the point where I tossed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!","review":"Having read and enjoyed earlier works of McMurtry, I looked forward to this new series. However, after about 100 pages into this one (I kept hoping it would get better), I decided it wasn't worth my time. Poor character development and mediocre diaglogue certainly were factors. But having to read on almost every page about which characters were sleeping together or lusting after each other got to be downright boring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money.","review":"Fortunately for me, \\" Lonsome Dove\\" was the first McMurtry book I read. To this day it is one of the best books ever read by anyone. It's first sequel was a nine, the co-written \\"Zeke and Ned\\" is also a keeper. Because of \\"Lonesome Dove\\", I have read or tried to read most of McMurtry's work, looking for even a bit of the brilliance that was in LD. With that hope, I purchased all four of the Berrybender series. All were read, cover to cover, and there were a few good moments. But overall, I'd like to have the time back and spend it searching for something well written. Larry McMurtry should block all calls from his publisher, take some time off to find himself and then do for us, what he does best when he is at his best. J.

Unlike the Pickwick Papers there is plently of violence as the huge cast of characters is gradually winnowed down. Many of the deaths are abrupt and comical. The book is entertaining and unpredictable to say the least. It is one of the more unpredictable stories I have come across in recent years."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Lonesome Dove","review":"It was a bummer for me. I expected more good story telling like Lonesome Dove, Commanche Moon and Dead Man's Walk. Was I disappointed!

Now I know why he had to do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unlovable bunch","review":"This is certainly no Lonesome Dove. McMurtry is one of my favorite authors but this book was a disappointment. While the characters are interesting and diverse they all share one common trait: they are all extremely unlovable. I like to have at least one character that I can care about in some way. So far there are none in this story. Perhaps he is waiting for the next three books to bring out someone's good qualities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure embarrasment from beginning to end.","review":"Sin Killer by Larry McMurtry is not only the worst McMurtry book I have read, it is the worst book I have read Period!!!!

It is sad to realize how low McMurtry has fallen."},{"rating":"1","title":"A false and degraded West","review":"Mr. McMurtry continues his agenda of prostituting and degrading this great land's history. In his early days, he restricted himself to debasing small West Texas towns. But he is a prolific writer and over the years has falsely painted his own ugliness across most of this country's past, from the Rio Bravo to the Canadas and from the Missouri to the Rockies. He mines true history and uses small truths to beguile the city reader with a false view of our heritage. This book seems merely an attempt to degrade the story of the Missouri River. If you love your past and the truth about it, this book will not speak to your heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Kind of Read via McMurtry","review":"I find it difficult to be critical of any of McMurtry's efforts, but this book was so foreign to what I had expected, so much so, that I disliked the foolish characters and their ridiculous behavior. Some have said it is \\"black comedy,\\" and I expect that is what it is, since one cannot take these characters seriously. Frankly, I am disappointed.

It was a wise decision on my part, for I enjoyed the book very much. The writing is excellent, and the plot, while a bit odd, is quite interesting. The Berrybender family, travelling in a \\"Ship of Fools\\", is out to see the West in 1832. These spoiled English aristocrats have no clue as to how to behave in a strange country with different ustoms, so most of them go on acting as if they are still at home, with devastating consequences at times. There are deaths, mutilations, ravishings, amputations, but through it all, the pater familias acts as if he's still on his estate, and the lord of all he surveys.

I've read all of the McMurtry westerns and I was confused by this one. The plot revolved around a romance between the Sin Killer and Tasmin a spoiled English wench from the buffoonish Berrybender family. The book jacket should have been illustrated with a cowboy hat wearing Fabio embracing some bonnet wearing, buxom bimbo. The characters are one dimensional and downright absurd. Whoever wrote the book jacket NEVER read this book. It stated that Lord Berrybender came to America to broaden the horizons of his children. NO, he came simply to hunt.

Fefe Naa Efe is a classic Fela Kuti track, although not one of my favorites (the proverb lyrics seem forced into the song structure and the song lacks the intensity of \\"Expensive Sh*t\\" or \\"Schuffering and Shmiling Part 2\\"). Overall, this album is definitely worth getting, particularly if you're new to Afrobeat.I'd also recommend \\"ASAP: the Afrobeat Sudan Aid Project,\\" a benefit compilation album (with all proceeds going to aid in Darfur) featuring some similar artists (Tony Allen, Antibalas) as well as a number of emerging afrobeat artists like Akoya, Kokolo, and Franck Biyong and Massak.

I couldn't believe how Elizabeth naively went to all that trouble to save her sister. She should have let her sister face her own consequences.

So, instead of 2.4 volts as it was designed for, it only has one, 1.2v battery. Just shaving will stop it completely. A complete piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing compared to my old one","review":"I've gotten used to Norelco making a superior product; I'd be using my 10 year old triple header to this day if the shaver guy hadn't talked me out of repairing it again.

The beard trimmer is excellent and easy to clean (unlike my old remington, where hair would get stuck in the beard trimmer and be impossible to get out)cons:1. it's a little on the big side, not so much that it's uncomfortable to hold but for travel it would be nice if it were a bit smaller.2. the case is made of el-cheapo vinyl or something similar, they should have sprung for a nicer case with a little padding."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much better than the older Norelco","review":"I have been using a Norelco razor for about 12 years, and the battery finally gave out. So, I can't complain of the longevity. I have always thought the thing was terribly loud, and it was only so-so for comfort. I looked at some other brands to replace mine, hoping to find something quieter and more comfortable. My father had replaced his older Norelco with a Braun, and he said it was not a lot quieter than the Norelco, and the shave was about six of one, half dozen of the other. So, I finally decided to stick with what I know and get another Norelco. Am I glad I did! This thing is very quiet compared to my old one, and the newer, articulated head improves shaving comfort and closeness 1000%! I am very pleased. I rated it 4 stars, because it lacks the an auto-shutoff when it is fully charged, so therefore you can overcharge it and ruin the batteries. A fairly minor inconvenience to have to remember to unplug it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Bargain","review":"This is a very good electric razor. Good, close shaves. Long battery life.

Norelco took a great razor design and components, then, must have told China to make it cheap. So what did China do to save money on manufacturing? It would be unbelievable, except that it's China. They took a perfectly wonderful 2.4v cord/cordless shaver and only put one 1.2v battery in it. This piece of junk now runs slow and boggs down on wiskers.

The cord is too short.Good - the battery last along time, but how can you tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"My old 835RX is Much Better","review":"I've been using an 835RX for years. I inherited a new 6843XL and after much comparing I found the old reliable 835 is MUCH better than the 6843.Using the same set of new blades on each razor, I find the 835 quick and efficient while the 6843 is slow and inefficient. It is way better than no razor at all (hence I gave it two stars).Mechanically the only difference I see is that the 835 head is flat, i.e., the three blade heads are in the same plane. They are also less flexible. The three heads on the 6843 face away from each other (slightly) and are very loose, able to float much more than in the 835. I think this floating ability actually hurts the functionality.

The cage itself is as to be expected. The problem lies in that it's far too small to give proper exercise room to any sort of guinea pig, ferret, or rabbit. Unless you intend to use it as a part-time cage part-time litter box, it's too small. If you intend to keep any of these animals in it full-time, you'll have an unhappy animal, plain and simple. There's not room for food, water, toys, hides, an animal, and still give them room to stretch and run about. If you want it for something smaller, say, a rat, consider a leveled, vertical cage instead. They like to climb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for a new small pet!","review":"I searched all over for a cage for my son's pet lopp-ear rabbit. This was the best priced cage I could find.

If I had a job that I had to be out of the apartment for more than an hour or two at a time though, I would never get this cage.

So, there I was on Amazon ordering all new stuff for our new Guinea Pig. This is the same model we had previously also. Built very well. Nice solid lower tray. I did notice that the wire used on the cage portion is somewhat thinner and flimsier than the older model it replaced. There is definitely no worries of an escape, so don't take it that way, just an observation that they have made them a tad less tough. This is still an excellent value and the quality is well above the low price. No issues with this at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for rats - save yourself some trouble","review":"This cage is very well built and a good deal, but it is definitely not for rats. If you have a rat save yourself some trouble and buy one that is specifically designed for rats. The bar spacing in this one is too wide and our rats were out within no time. I'm somewhat annoyed that the manufacturer advertises it as suitable for small pets instead of naming the specific animals for which it would be suitable. We did our research and quite a few of the reviews on amazon.com said that this cage was suitable for rats - they either own Godzilla rats or giant mutant rats from a research gone wrong. This cage is not suitable for normal rats, period!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy, messy, messy!","review":"I have been a rabbit owner for many years and I have also had these cages for many years. This cage is great to start with especially when the rabbit is small, but when they get older, clean up is a hassle. They learn to kick and dig bedding out of the cage, and pooping outside the corner of the cage as well although they had litter boxes and were well trained. I found myself cleaning the floor outside of the cage daily. It is also a hassle to take the wire top off the cage to actually clean it. Of course, rabbits will be rabbits in this case, but I had to find an alternate cage to minimize cleaning outside of the cage. :) When I first bought this cage, I did find it extremely easy to assemble, but when my rabbits got older, it wasn't tall enough for them to stretch their legs in, and my rabbits aren't very large."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT GET THIS FOR GUINEA PIGS!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Di not get this for guinea pigs it is tortcher!

No animal should live in such measly conditions. C and C cages are much easier to clean than this difficult to use cage, they last much longer, and your pet will be so much happier. When I built my C and C, my guinea pigs did laps around the cage and popcorned for an hour! They are so much happier now. They enjoy my company and are much more vocal. Like a flower moved out of a closet and into the sun, they absolutely bloomed!

The only downfall of the book in my opinion is that there are several photos of cheesecakes in the book of which none of them have a title as to what type of cheesecake it is.

I never had any problems with prior models (Palm 500, Palm III, Palm IIIxe). This is the second T5 I have had. I returned the first one because it constantly locked up (just like an old windows PC), and when it was working, the hot-sync would fail a lot of the time. I am ready to send the replacement they sent me back because the battery lasts about 2 DAYS even when I am not using it. Then I have a hard time getting it to turn on. I usually have to leave it plugged in for an extended period of time until it finally decides to turn itself on. What a waste of money.

PALM support was clueless about fixing the problem but they know that it exists, i ended up being frustrated for days. ended up searching almost every forum on the internet until i found the developer's backdoor to force the T5 to hold the hotsync.another thing is that it does not have wi-fi, you will have to buy a card for this, which is entirely stupid. i have a lot of medical databases that do not fit on the internal memory so i have to use the memory slot. if i want to use the internet i have to remove the card and slide the wi-fi card in, rendering my databases useless.all in all avoid at all costs. buy a dell axim instead, pocketpc is so much simpler than this. and you get 2 card slots, wifi and bluetooth for less. imagine that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even thinking in BUYING this troublemaker PDA","review":"Since I bought it this T5, the only results obtained were troubles!.

I received little support from Palmone. My supplier readily replaced it with another T5 only to have it do exactly the same. Again I got mediocre support from Palmone. Will never use a T5 again.

This is a classic example of a product designed in a vaccuum, with little or no regard for the needs and expectations of the customers who keep palmOne in business. I live overseas and the tech support one gets from Singapore is, while courteous, wholly ineffective.

As stated in other reviews, the instructions are less than desirable as illustrations of the steps would be better than just plain text instructions. However that wasn't the major problem with this birdhouse. After putting the front and back on the base of the house, the instructions called for the sides to be installed. Only problem was the sides didn't fit at all. In fact putting the sides in caused the front and back to bend forward and backward, breaking the base of the front and back where the nails were located.

It is not apparent that she has absorbed any of Scriabin's writings or recordings, but seems rather to follow a vaguely manneristic style of execution.In other words, there is a lack of imaginative effort and deep identification with the composer's aesthetics and spiritual world.

I was born and raised in the United States, but both of my parents were born and raised in Puerto Rico. My knowledge was only based upon what they knew. Growing up America was the only history I was taught and I thought it was the only history I needed to know. After Reading Roberto's anthology, I was able to connect to my heritage and it has since opened so many doors for me. Now I can't get enough of these authors who have been around for ages but are new to me. I am now glad to talk about my Puerto Rican heritage because now I understand it so much more. I have always been proud to be Puerto Rican because that is what my parents had instilled in me but now I'm more proud because I understand what we have gone through and the struggle that continues today. This is a great book and I'd recommend it to anyone, but most especially anyone who is confused or not sure of their heritage this book is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"This book has enlightened me. I know I am not alone in my thoughts. All the feelings I have towards the Puerto Rican struggle for recognition and respect have been expressed and shared throughout this book.

This book has opened up and filled a void at once.TO Piri Thomas, Edwin Torres, Pedro Albizu Campos, Esmeralda Santiago and Even Freddie Prinze, I thank you. I feel as if I have discovered I do have a past and yet there is so much more I need to learn. Thank you.This book should be used in school.

What I love the most about this book is that it will introduce many Puerto Ricans as well as the rest of the world to the many talented Boricua authors there are.

I didn't.This book serves as a reference book, a novel, a selection of poetry, among other things.

Couldn't put them down until finished. This book, however, was a huge disappointment. I found myself skimming pages to get through the plot. Rapp's character development has apparently been stunted, and Anna was nothing more than one-dimentional and completely annoying. The plot contained too much news and history intertwined with what little action was included. I'm still a Flynn fan; I just chalk this up to a need to fulfill a publishing contract since this novel does not resemble his earlier novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Read","review":"If you enjoyed the other Vince Flynn *Mitch Rapp* books, I think you'll enjoy reading this installment.

As with any good summer read, the story resolves itself very neatly in the end.

Clunky writing and shallow characters are expected in a genre book like this, but there were two points that really didn't work for me.First, the Phillipines and Palestinian plots were totally unrelated. Almost as if he took two incomplete book outlines and shoved them together to make deadline. Lazy lazy lazy.The worst for me was the alternating self-righteousness of the main character about thoughtless Washinton bureaucrats who thought they were above the rules and are therefore bad, as compared with the self-righteousness of the main character about his own definition of his own rules to govern his own actions which must be good.

Some of the characters / sub-plots (Phillippines, the love story) didn't come together quite well. The \\"hero\\" was a little too macho and not too likeable.

Coloring each character with each new novel is a waste as is the blank pages and multiple blank spaces on the short chapters!The plot(s) weren't as good as in his previous books and leaves out enough reality to make me wonder if he should write comics!Rapp, Rambo or Gump?

Unfortunately, it got lost somewhere along the way. Almost like it was exposition rather than serious story telling. More accurately, the book's two separate stories that were forcefully melded into each other for no rhyme or reason other than to add pages. To add insult to injury, neither story is very good standing alone.Take the Abu Sayyaf angle.Q: How does the Abu Sayyaf story relate to Omar and David's?A: It doesn't, other than that Mitch Rapp stars in both, but that's a flimsy reason if you ask me.Worse, the only character with any real depth or complexity, David, dies at the end.Seems to me Flynn's going the way of Mr. Clancy, from very good to extremely mediocre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwrapping Rapp","review":"Sub-par story as author Vince Flynn, obviously trying to keep up with fast changing events in the Middle East, spends far too much time explaining the ongoing political struggle between Israel and Palestine and too little time with the hero, Mitch Rapp. Also, having Rapp domesticated and reassigned to a bureaucratic environment subtracts greatly from his far more interesting freelance, loner-assassin role in earlier books."},{"rating":"2","title":"CIA Anti-Terrorist Advisor Mitch Rapp Has More Adventures","review":"The reader is confronted with a rather wimpy Democrat President who had the good sense to bring in as an Advisor Mitch Rapp, a real all-star hero. The book starts off with an ill fated attempt by a Navy Seal team to rescue an American family being held by the Abu Sayyaf guerrillas. The enemy was tipped off by a corrupt Philippine general. The Seals were ambushed. Rapp comes into the picture and carries out a successful rescue operation that dispenses with the general. The story then shifts to the middle-east (Israel,Palestine, Saudi's). A somewhat sympathetic character is the Palestinian terrorist David who orchestrates some very clever plots. Irene Kennedy, the CIA Director is fighting the good battle. Rapp's wife, a tv reporter is a bit too much. It's hard to imagine a guy like Mitch Rapp going for her. Anyway,it's a fairly good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flynn Makes a Good Point","review":"I found this book to be very moving and exciting.

I sure didn't realize how poor Amazon's return policies are and the lack of customer service is just another strike on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works all right, but not for everyone","review":"If you're listening to MP3s, etc from spoken word, then this will work fine.

I'm a slow reader and it was simply time consuming to finish each chapter.The chapters are told to you by Ali's friends, family, contemporaries and the man himself.You really get a feeling for Muhammad - the person not just the boxer - through his family, friends and those that know him. I put the book down feeling closer to Muhammad Ali and feeling a warmth from him and a warmth towards those he loves and cares for...I walked away from this book with such great feelings for Muhammad Ali.

I am surprised that Jonsi (Sigur Ros) has lent his voice on that project (5 minutes of vocals out of 90 min).

Even as I'm laughing at the anachronisms in the CD, I'm enjoying the heck out of some really good music.

Kay Starr's \\"The Man With The Bag\\" just swings. The tunes by the Hollyridge Strings just drip with candy-cane sweetness (when will somebody issue the whole album on Cd!?!). Les Brown's big-band arrangement of \\"The Nutcracker Suite\\" is inspired genius and worth the price of admission.

He has incorporated the character analytic perspective of Lowen and Wilhelm Reich and blended it, albeit not seamlessly, with object relations. Johnson's compassion is evident in the way that he employs every useful technique from any tradition to help clients. His writing is slightly stilted, but clearly Johnson 1)wants to be taken seriously and 2) wants to be precise, because precision is necessary to 'corner' the resistance of character.

Is it just possibly that this book was harshly criticized because it deserves to be, because it is a very sorry excuse for a work of musical--and, for that matter, sociological--scholarship? I think it IS possible. I think it is more than possible; I think it is quite likely. It is \\"readable\\" for non-musicians not in spite of its \\"scholarly content\\", but only in that it lacks \\"scholarly content\\"; it is not particularly well written. Obviously, it has its partisan proponents--the sort of people who don't like having to think subtly or deeply but who still want to be taken seriously, the sort of pseudo-intellectual people who want to have it both ways--, but this is no recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"mystical musings","review":"It seems reasonable to me to suppose that in certain cases music can be (in some way or other) an expression of sexuality, but it seems no less reasonable to me to suppose that human sexuality can be (in some way or other) an expression of musicality--for human sexuality is, after all, and by design, pliable and subject to fixation. This book does not truly concern itself with the possible relation of music and sexuality; it wishes, rather, to reduce music to sexuality, to deny music its musicality. It fails on the one hand because whether or not music is an expression of sexuality, it is also much more, it is also music. It fails on the other hand because its author is no more able to divine a composer's sexual impulses from examining his compositions than an astrologer is able to divine a man's fate from drawing up his horoscope. In short, this is not a work of scholarship; it is a puerile indulgence in solipsistic fantasy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read Conventional Wisdom","review":"This book changed me from a Stravinsky-like \\"music has no meaning\\" stance. I still don't think that music is sad or happy or like a day in the country, things are more complicated than that, but I no longer feel that music is an empty if beautiful vessel.

Rather, it addresses the question, \\"Why does Madonna wear underwear outside her outerwear?\\" I'm not making this up. It goes on at length about the musical significance of Madonna (without actually discussing her music, such as it is). This sort of thing is not a blemish, not a minor flaw; it's the whole book, front to back. This book may well influence a new generation of pseudo-scholars, but it is unlikely to influence a generation of scholars--or, for that matter, a single scholar--, because it is not itself a work of scholarship. It is \\"maligned\\" for a very good reason, but it is better ignored.

The lack of Stansfield's imagination and research is evident from the first pages of this book. I found the plot predictable and the writing utterly repetitive (in fact, a friend of mine who also tried to read the book for book club said she kept thinking she was re-reading pages she had already read, as Stansfield's writing was so repetitive). I agree with a former reviewer in recommending Nancy Turner's \\"These Is My Words\\" as a WONDERFUL, delicious alternative to this mundane book. Incidentally, the author overuses the names \\"Alexa\\" and \\"Jesse\\" so much that I couldn't bear the thought of reading the word one more time (we counted an average of 6-8 times per page)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Porn for the religious","review":"This book is ridiculous. It is chock full of thrusting, throbbing, moaning, hoarse utterances and all manner of endless \\"not quite sex\\". That is all the book has. The plot stinks. The characters are ridiculous and unsympathetic. The setting was clearly inspired by the author watching \\"The Man from Snowy River\\". Every scene is repeated several times with very slight variations. I guess it is supposed to be a moral book since the two main characters never actually have sex before marriage.

I think my biggest disappointment was the inaccurate track listing. It was supposed to have the rarly-heard sitar version of \\"Heart Full Of Soul\\", but instead had only the regular version. If you are a hardcore Yardbirds fan, pass this one by.

The story is very enjoyable and can teach you a lot. My favorite part is that even though the story is fictional the examples used are real and the student gets homework each week which is based on real books so you also get a wonderful reading list to continue your learning. The books he gets assigned are sometimes more about learning a way of thinking than about business itself, for example \\"The Art of War\\".

The book is structured around twenty three distinct profit models, presented in a story-telling fashion as a conversation between a student and a guru. It may sound tacky, but the style and narrative really do work. The author encourages the reader to tackle each chapter a week at a time and take the time dwell and think about each of the models, providing reading suggestions and useful exercises.As far as the profit models themselves, I'm sure many people will find them familiar either through first-hand experience or through previous readings. Having said that, the compare and contrast style of the book, as well as the exercises really help draw the distinctions and provoke further thought into why and how many of the companies we know of (as well as our own) can stand to benefit from adopting one of the models.Definitely a keeper and a great reference book."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoy the CD","review":"Got this business CD for Christmas, and haven't been able to resist the temptation to listen to more than one track per day, let alone per week.

Zig Ziglar, Brian Tracy, Earl Nightengale, etc have been doing that for years before, and besides we could all learn something from the sly pitch - yet another profit model to study about - so don't feel like you've been taken advantage of just because you didn't think of it yourself, he he he!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the series and enjoyed this book.","review":"This is one of the better Cheney Duvall books.

I bought my truck with a broken mirror, so when I put this on I had no idea how much it should vibrate. It was unusable. The mirror shook a lot. I returned it. I had a new glass put into the original body and it shakes too, though not as much. Maybe I need better shocks to dampen vibrations more?

This is the only affordable watch I could find that was titanium. Titanium is awesome because it holds up well, is strong, light, and maintains a great look. The watch looks amazing. I orginally bought this watch at a department store and then I found it on Amazon pretty much for half price. I ended up saving 70 dollars so that was great. My boyfriend loves his watch and he feels like he was spoiled but really I just got a great bargain. Skagen is also a great company. I view Skagen as the most affordable brand for what you get.

(Of course I had to pay shipping and handling both ways, which came to about $20 total). So I sent it in and got it back good as new about a month later, which was fine. But then 10 days later, it cracked again!!! I assure you that I wasn't wearing the watch while playing sports or doing anything that would cause it to crack.

It does not wrap around the arm securely without turning a bit sideways and showing a bit of the end of the band. While this is not a severe problem, it is not 100% acceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clasp doesn't hold securely","review":"This watch is lightweight and elegant in appearance.

The band can't be replaced - I've tried to order new bands and taken the watches to watch makers with no success.

Apparently it is adhered with a sort of epoxy. It didn't last. Now I have the watch, but no wristband. This did not happen because of a violent or abusive action to the watch, it was merely through daily wear and tear.

I had only worn it about 20 times and I never had any blows or hard bumps to the watch. It looked like it just got brittle and cracked. I could replace it for about $50 with shipping, but since I paid under $100 for this watch, I did not want think it worth it.

I somehow dented the edge of the band while working at my desk job. The damage caused a piece of the metal band to protrude which kept getting caught on my shirt until I bent it in with my fingernail. Luckily the damage isn't too noticable because it is near the clasp where people won't usually see it.The watch is still useable but hopefully it won't happen again or get worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Watch","review":"As usual with Amazon it shipped quickly and was half price of the expensive Dept. stores.

I've had the watch for about a month. No problems so far.Very sexy watch, feels good on. It took me a bit to figure out the clasp, but once I did, I really like the design.The only con -- the band is not as flexible as it appears around the face part. It bends only so much then stops. For someone with small wrists, it can bend and wrap around your wrist so much. But not so bad to make this a concern. I still really like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice watch, awful latch = dealbreaker","review":"This is a nice-looking watch, and very slender.However, there are two things a watch absolutely needs to do. 1) Tell time. 2) Stay on your wrist.This watch tells time accurately. However, in the 3 months I owned it, the poor latch system caused it to fall off my wrist at least four or five times (I lead a fairly active lifestyle and rarely take off my watch).

May be the quality of thread is poor, therefore, the thread-count would not matter. 300-Thread-Count usually would feel a lot smoother and you wouldn't see the 'holes' in between the threads so clearly.

It includes the best of Ray's outings with Cut and Stiltskin as well as incredible versions of Genesis and Genesis related songs. Ray's versions of Genesis classics demonstrate why Tony and Mike chose him to replace Phil Collins and Peter Gabriel. Where this album really shines is in Ray's treatment of his own songs. Ray Wilson should be an international superstar, and probably would be if Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford had the foresight to continue with Genesis and allow Ray to show what he can do as singer and song writer to a broader audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack Russell","review":"This probably works better on other breeds.

These are probably ten of the best songs ever written and you get to hear the man himself do them the justice they so richly deserve.

Sadly, he played to a less than full house - which is a poor reflection on my native Dubliners appreciation of good music. I am disappointed that this album does not include \\"Do what you gotta do\\" - which is by far and away one of the best songs ever. Nina Simone covers this song and her verison would bring a tear to a glass eye. You should watch out for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible album that takes me back to my youth","review":"Jimmy Webb recreates some of his classic hits like Wichita Lineman, Galveston and By the Time I Get to Phoenix with a remarkable and powerful simplicity. Rather than the big production approach used when Glen Campbell made them hits in the late 60s, Jimmy delights you with slowed down verions using only piano and acoustic guitar. Add to that background vocals of Michael MacDonald (Galveston) and Shaun Colvin (Didn't We) and you have an CD that will delight you. I can't stop listening to it. Thanks, Jimmy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Webb's pristine in the presentation of his own music.","review":"Webb is a craftsman and the piano is his lathe, turning-out voluptuous note after note. In this album, he shuns the strings and horn sections that Sinatra, Campbell, and Garfunkel used, and makes an intimate expression of his words and his music to the listener.From the first notes of Galveston until the last chord in MacArthur park, you will appreciate the mastery of what makes Webb stand-out from other singer/songwriters: his ability to arrange and accompany himself as only he can.This is Webb, back again, to perform his classics. Don't confuse \\"Ten Easy Pieces\\" for a nostalgic trip down memory lane... it is the artist recaliming what is rightfully his and presenting it as he envisaged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Songwriter...but","review":"Listen... no one likes his songs better than I and read his book which is also good... but not this album. The piano is too dominant.. and his vocals just can't come to the point. Pass on this if you want the music... if you want the mystique go for it but don't think he needs the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"As a songwriter, Webb is a gem. As a solo artist, he leaves much to be desired. He plays piano well enough to gather in an additional star, but his vocals are wooden and without the pathos and love others have brought to their renditions of his songs. Webb writes beautifully. All he needs for that is the piano, a sheet or two of paper, and a pencil. He does not need to be recorded. Give this a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like the songs, stay away from this recording!","review":"I feel bad being negative about this CD, but it really [stinks]. I love the Glen Campbell versions of \\"Galveston\\" and \\"Wichita Lineman\\" and was hoping this recording would add something to those songs, being interpreted by the songwriter, but it's a big disapointment. If this had been recorded when the songs were written (late 1960's, early 70's) instead of 1996 with it's over-slick produced KURZWEIL digital piano sound (YUCK!), I think this would have been much better and timeless recording. Instead, it sounds like bad SMOOTH JAZZ. I just hate it. I should have ran when I saw the names Marc Cohn and Michael McDonald associated with this. Ouch! I'm sure if these songs had been released for the first time in 1996 (like this), that Jimmy Webb would not have been the influencial artists he is. Stick with the famous recordings from the time they were written. They add far more to the craft and poetry of these songs than this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jimmy Webb brings together his classic songs in a suberb and","review":"Jimmy Webb surprises even his oldest fans with a superb collection of his classics. Jimmy performed at the Frankston Cultural Centre ( Melbourne Australia on 25 March ), and it was at this concert I realised that his songs were not just successful because of artists like Richard Harris and Glen Campbell.Jimmy places his own interpretation on the classics, and benefits from the strength of contemporary performers such as Shawn Colvin and Michael McDonald to add, but not overpower his distinctive and raw vocal style.Well done Jimmy, come back to Frankston soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"gorgeous","review":"i was born too late to hear most of these songs in their hey day. the ocassional renditions on easy listening radio stations do no justice to these interpretations by the writer himself.buy it and feel inspired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential to any collection","review":"This is simply one of the best releases of 1996 and a timeless album I will enjoy twenty years from today.

Everyone knows these songs; enjoy them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great songwriter performs his best work","review":"Jimmy Webb may not be as prolific as some of the songwriters of this age, but a few of his songs rank up there with the greatest pop songs of the post-WWII era. Who could deny that \\"Witchita Lineman\\" is as close to a perfect pop song as was ever written? Hearing him do his own versions makes some of them even better- I never much cared for Richard Harris' overblown version of \\"MacArthur Park\\", but Jimmy's minimalistic version, with just piano and voice, shows what a fine song this actually is. The same goes for other songs here, like \\"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress,\\" which combines a lovely melody with real poetry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just buy it!!","review":"Don't read the reviews, don't worry about whether it is hip or trendy, just go and buy it.

The story starts off describing the life of a major celebrity and his lifestyle - casual sex partners from Hollywood hills, romps in Venice, drug indulgences and plenty of crazy, surrealistic living - before his life becomes surrealistic itself. He manages to cope with a descent into anonymity and all sorts of quirky escape-the-cops-with-the-weird-stranger-who-just-befriended-you action in it that we've now gotten used to.

It stars off as a very interesting thriller about a man trying to regain his identity, and evolves into a surreal sexual odysee(though without much sex go figure lol).But in the end, to me at least, the novel is about one thing. The corruption of government. About the horrible things the Government does. About the iggnorance and justifications behind these acts, and about the governments lack of responsibility.And when it come down to the actual ending of the book I find myself still thinking about it, wondering if I liked how everything came together or not(I'm ignoring the epiloge). But theres one thing I know for sure, the fact that I'm still thinking about it says alot about it's power."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was the benefit worth the cost?","review":"The basic concept was interesting, and kept me reading to the end. But the most disturbing thing to me about Dick's dystopian world was the total amorality of his characters. Perhaps this was Dick's intent, but I don't have any indication of that. This leaves me asking, was the entertainment I derived from the basic plot worth the exposure to the underlying philosophy? (On another topic, is the benefit of Kindle Fire's auto correct worth the effort of changing Sick back to Dick 3 times?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A decent action story but goes nowhere.","review":"Taverner is not supposed to be likeable, he is an arrogant man thrown from his usual reality into one where he is no longer important or privileged, but he carries the story very well.The other characters are a strange mix, all broken in some way, and Taverner's journey shows us a violent and brutal world that isn't too hard to believe.The pace is good but the ending and the explanation it provides aren't, it is too simplistic and easy and the epilogue is a annoying.This more like a bad John Brunner story than something by Dick.A journey but lacking in the final destination."},{"rating":"1","title":"bang bang bang bang fizzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"i like PKD, and this was an amazing 5-star novel... up until the end, where it plummeted straight down in a shooting stream of crap for the last 40 pages or so and never came back up. i hoped, i wished, i prayed, and it still went straight into the toilet. PKD, like jim thompson, was a great 220-page writer who for money's sake was forced to write 180-page books and could never really get the hang of it. his visions were much more suited towards lengthier books. if you're interested in his work, read \\"man in the high castle\\" or UBIK or \\"scanner darkly.\\" don't start here."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting but painful read","review":"I find PKD's ideas fascinating, thought-provoking, \\"far-out,\\" you-name-it. He was clearly a cutting edge thinker. However, his writing here is so god-aweful, I could not summon the will power to slog through this book. The exposition was so heavy-handed and the dialogue so cheesy I had to stop. When he wrote of a Rolls Royce skyflyer(a rocket of some sort, apparently) that its engine \\"idled throbbingly,\\" I nearly flung the book (frustratedly?) across the room. I then picked up VALIS.

Too often I find that a book has lots of five and four-star reviews, only to find that, once read, the book just wasn't very good. And this book is not just not very good, it's no good at all. The writing is just so amateurish, the plot, as one of the other reviews suggested, is way full of holes, the ending, trite and completely disappointing. The book is an interesting idea that died on the vine.So we have to understand that Dick was a little nutso to appreciate his work? Sorry. This may be a good example of therapy for a sick mind, but that doesn't make it a good book. Sheesh...To balance all of the five-star reviews that, I think, are way off base, I give it one star. Come to think of it, forget balancing the five-star reviews. This book deserves one star on the merits."},{"rating":"2","title":"1st of his books I've read","review":"I liked this book.

However, still a compelling read with PKD's usual themes of paranoia, reality vs. unreality, and so on."},{"rating":"2","title":"SF Readers Are All Plot","review":"I just finished thise one, and it's absolutely Philip K. Dick. This means it's absolutely excellent. The plot has been explained by others, so I'll get right to the good stuff.PKD clearly loved to play with ideas of perception and reality. He does it really well here.Previous reviewers have mentioned that they felt this novel fell apart at the end, but was consistently good before this. I have to disagree. The first majority of this book is great pulp SF. The last ten or so pages (don't count the epilogue as the end, PKD just uses it to tie things up) are a whole lot more contemplative and less action filled than the rest of the book. Most people don't expect much stylistically from a speculative fiction author, but the end of this book flows like poetry.There is no masterful unfolding of some vast plot, and there is no enormous confrontation to close up the story. PKD is beyond clever; he's insane. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthralled","review":"I found the book completely enjoyable. Dick's writing style is colorful, imaginative, and easy to follow. I enjoyed everything about the book except for the crux upon which the plot resided, which was this mystery drug. It was handled so quick, in such a spurious fashion, and the descriptives of it left me dazed. In short, it was extremely contrived and was very disappointing. So, 5 stars for everything else, but the thing that made the rest of the story possible was just plain lame.Despite that, I do recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Meaningful Gift","review":"I bought the Shorter English Dictionary for my daughter, and she loves it.

I have the full unabridged OED on CD at work and bought this version for my own use at home. I've found the shorter version just as good in practice. The search and hyperlinking facilities are good, better than on the full version in mt view and of course even those can't be compared to using the reference on paper, which will surely become a lost art before long. (At a full bookshelf's worth of paper the unabridged OED doesn't even have the usual 'you can read it in the bath' benefit of printed books when compared to CDs - it wouldn't even fit in my bath).All in all I rate this as the best dictionary available in its price range - in any format."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depth of the North Sea","review":"In summer 2007 my wife and I were on a cruise from England to Russia.

The main saving grace is with the One Power and how Talents, Affinities, and Weave Levels are treated.

There are only so many monsters(which is true of Robert Jordan's world, but fighting darkfriends all the time gets boring). The weave list is expansive, but there must be more. The Angreal, Sa'angreal, and Ter'angreal are almost all there, but so many are already allocated to one place or another that few are left for PCs.

For example, the eagle falconers of the east, whom Sam meets first in the book, supposedly \\"starve\\" their birds for \\"weeks on end\\", keep them \\"creully\\" hooded, only releasing them from their \\"shackles\\" to kill savagely. C'mon! I had to put down the book in disgust.If you would like an authentic idea of what eagle falconry is like, complete with excellent and engrossing story-telling, I would highly recommend Steve Bodio's book \\"Eagle Dreams: Searching for Legends in Wild Mongolia\\" or, for a more practical point of view, Martin Hollenshead's \\"Hawking with Golden Eagles\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This book takes you through another woman's journey and as you read it, you find a little bit of yourself in her.

This book is an accumulation of true masterpieces which an amateur can never attain.Those who criticize this book for the lack of explanation are making the same mistake as saying \\"no explanation of how to paint!\\" looking at the book of Leonardo da Vinci--crying for the moon; besides, bonsais in this book are grown for tens of, sometimes hundreds of years. So it would be impossible to explain what time does to the plants.In front of this book, all I have to do is to sigh for my lack of skills.

Except for one plant there is no such a thing. And it is a pity. The book has four different chapters, one for each season. But they do not repeat the same plants. That is to say that they just select good plants to be photographed in each season as most books do. Therefore one cannot see the richness of a bonsai throughout the year.

I could feel the emotion of the characters and visualize what they were seeing. Without giving away too much of the plot, I want to point out that this book gives easy to understand explanations of some Pagan philosophies and practices that are necessary for appreciating the story. The action, which takes place in the USA and Europe is reminicent of an older James Bond novel. I don't want to give away any more. You'll have to read the book for yourself.

Getting 100% right on the practice exams in this book does not mean you will have the same results with the real thing. For an acurate representation of test questions, purchase the Boson practice exams. Also, there are a few diagrams and explanations that are in the Cisco CIT book that are not in this book, but covered on the test.

Though I failed by a calculated two questions, I can say practical job experience contributed more than this book. Things were worded in Cisconese and seemed to be centered around that company's learning objectives with no deviation.

First, I do not consider bigamy romantic at all as Wakwa has two wives. I believe true love is with one person. I don't think most readers are going to find the leading man sleeping in the bed with two women and going back and forth between the two romantic. It feels rather degrading towards women in that respect whether the main character is indian or not. It certainly wouldn't be my fantasy! Second, this book had an uncomplete ending.

If you have a problem with listening to two masterpieces, this might not be your best investment.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Excellent!","review":"I have been buying a number of CD's lately of old albums I once had or thought might be more interesting versions than the ones I did. In this case, I recently bought three Janis Joplin Big Brother CD's, one to replace one I previously had had (\\"Cheap Thrills\\"), and two like this one, that I don't remember ever owning.Of the bunch, this one really stands out. I am not knocking the other albums, which are great in their own right, but \\"Live at Winterland '68\\" was the one that really stood out, especially for a live album from this era. It has excellent sound quality, and many of the songs far surpass the studio versions. This is probably one of the best live albums I have from this time period, and I own a number of them.If I were to choose one Janis Joplin Big Brother CD to buy, this would be it."},{"rating":"2","title":"No new tunes, but some killer performances!","review":"All of the songs on this album are available, in different versions, on other Joplin/Big Brother compilations, but this previously-unreleased recording is one of the band's best ever. Those who were at Winterland for this show in 1968 have, annoyingly, never stopped talking about it, and the recording vindicates them at last. Both Joplin and Big Brother were always better in live performance than on studio recordings; the feedback of energy between them and the audience was almost tangible. This 'live' CD shows them at the peak of their creative powers, and contains what may be the best-ever recordings of two of Joplin's signature tunes, \\"Summertime\\" and \\"Ball and Chain.\\" The album's probably as good an introduction to Big Brother as any other (certainly better than the \\"Best of Janis Joplin\\" compilation), and for the still-crazed fan, it's a must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than IN CONCERT, but rips you off in 3 ways!","review":"Get this CD instead of IN CONCERT, for one thing! Sure, Full Tilt Boogie's good, but the Big Brother here is far superior to the one in IN CONCERT. Secondly, \\"Bye Bye Baby\\" is from IN CONCERT, \\"Ball and Chain\\" is on CHEAP THRILLS, and \\"Farewell Song\\" is from FAREWELL SONG, so don't expect new exciting versions of those songs, they're the same old ones. But, still great! Don't pass this up! Maybe this is a sign the Joplin family will start releasing Janis on a regular basis! Keep your fingers crossed! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"big brother","review":"i was very satisfied with this cd.i am a big fan of big brother and the s.f. sound.awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BALL AND CHAIN","review":"I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A COPY OF THIS CD FOR QUITE A WHILE, AND I'M HAPPY I FINALLY PICKED UP A COPY. THIS MUSIC TAKES YOU BACK IN TIME TO THE WILD, PSYCEHDELIC 60'S. JANIS WITH BIG BROTHER AND THE HOLDING COMPANY WAS ONE OF THE PREMIER SAN FRANSISCO PSYCEHDELIC ROCK BANDS, HEAVILY DRENCHED IN BLUES. AND JANIS REALLY SHINES IN THIS PERFORMANCE, THIS WOMAN JUST OOZES TALENT. THIS PERFORMANCE FROM WINTERLAND BALLROOM IN 1968 CONTAINS 14 SONGS, ONLY TWO OF WHICH WERE EVER PREVIOUSLY RELEASED.

It was easy to fix - just a little household glue put them back in place.They don't come in half sizes, so rather than order a size UP, I ordered a size DOWN - I generally get a better fit that way - but because of this, the back of the shoes always folds down and now it pretty much stays that way.

In the photo, the sole of the slipper appears to have a raised arch area, however, this turns out to be only a styling effect where the sole wraps the upper -- there's no structure under it at all. The quality of the slipper's upper is lower than expected, it appears to be entirely sythetic despite the description of \\"wool-blend\\". Also, one of the soles was not glued in properly and fell out after I put my foot in the slipper the first time. The rubber sole is substantial, though heavier than I like to wear in a slipper. All in all, I regret spending the money on these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great slipper!","review":"I received these slippers for Christmas in December 2005.

I can't say it was my favourite but it came close. The Ashleigh series is so realistic.I liked having Rhoda come to stay she seemed nice and friendly.

I'm not usually a big fan of psychic topics, but this story was well done. Just enough skepticism and uncertainty to make it seem plausible."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very different kind of mistery.","review":"This book is so good that you will not be able to put it down. I did not want the book to end. I became so caught up in each character's personalities. This is a great mystery that I could not figure out the ending. I can't wait to start reading the next book.

The mystical fears of the past were replayed. The older half-brother offered his loyalty and support to Jeff while he provided a safe home for the recuperation of the savage street attack that opened the book. Isolation rejection and abandonment was Jeff's legacy. A true picture of a dysfuntional family. Jeff remained resolute to his endeavor to solve the mystery of the heinous murder. I enjoyed the intricacies of the plot. I think I will read more Jeff Resnik mysteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"This book had good storyline. Book held my interest well.

I was so excited to start reading this and in the beginning, it had so much potential... until all suspense was lost because the main character can basically figure out everything and there were no surprises whatsoever in the book... well maybe in the end a bit... but hey, where was the suspense?! maybe the people who gave the book 5 stars liked everything being revealed before it actually happened, but common, at least try to keep me on the edge of my seat a bit please! I had no problem putting down the book... I read the Lightning Thief after this and even though it was written for the age group of 12-15, I had more fun reading that than Murder on The Mind"},{"rating":"2","title":"The mind can do marvelous things","review":"Enjoyed the twists and turns as the case was being solved. Will certainly read future books and love not having the end figured out at the beginning. Great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"Just what my title says. The best part of the story was how our minds can work. I also liked the fact that the main character's brotherand significant other had been changed by the experience.

The book has to grab me and keep me right from the start. I usually can figure them out too which either boars me or keeps me going. This I had at times difficulty figuring it out. So I'm on to the next book. I've bought them all hopefully there just as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad that it was free","review":"This was a free book on my Kindle and I'm glad that I didn't have to pay anything. If I had one word to describe this book it would be - BORING! We were already told who the killer was pretty early on, so what was the point in continuing to read the book? If I'm reading a mystery novel I want there to be suspense until the very end. Once the main character revealed the killer, I just didn't want to read any further. It also didn't seem very realistic that so many people were willing to give Jeff confidential information and even invite this stranger into their homes! Sorry, but I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"DULL AND BORING","review":"I have never had more trouble reading a book as I have with this book.

I'm an avid reader and read around six books a month while commuting and I bought this on my Kindle because there were so many 4 and 5 star reviews. I guess if you like books with no depth, little character development and hardly any suspense this is for you. I prefer a rich story, intricate details and characters I love by continuing to learn about and grow with in a series. This was not it. I much prefer Louise Penny's mystery novels.

I would have given it a better rating, but for the language. There was too many vulgar words. So for parents, you might want to think twice before letting the kids read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great thriller","review":"Very well written and exciting. Jeff Resnick is a three dimensional character. I found a couple of simple editorial mistakes in the beginning of the book...kind of puzzling. But once I passed them, I couldn't put the book down. Gripping, at times frightening; all in all, a book you won't regret reading. Good job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"It was a good book.

Anxious to read more of this author's work. Expected a little more of a twist at the end but I like not figuring things out until the last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want something useful, look elsewhere","review":"This book-and-cassette package is a disappointment. The emphasis is on certain set phrases -- \\"Where is the bathroom?\\" \\"Everything is so interesting!\\", with weak coverage of grammar. The tapes feature an English phrase, followed by the Italian translation (repeated after a pause).In the \\"section\\" on occupations, we are told how to identify ourselves as either a businessman or a lawyer. That breadth of coverage gives a pretty good idea of the value of this book. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn easy phrases","review":"I thought this book was great. It was very easy to use and is organized very well. I used this book while on vacation, and I was able to find the phrases I needed fast. It has a great grammar section, too. It's divided into many sections like, dining, finding your way, shopping, etc.. Great little book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, this aged version slightly outdated","review":"Used this book extensively during 2 week sojourn in Italy. Very helpful, but as this edition was several years old, some vocabulary (particularly internet, phone) out of date. Other than that content was excellent, well organized and easily usable.

There is no map inside, (to show you where these places are), there are descriptions of hikes and cool things to see, but there is no ranking on how difficult it is or for what age group, there are no tips for activities for children at all. In fact, I think this was a guide book NOT written for families and the publisher just put that title on the book to sell more copies! Buy something else if you really have a family and are taking them to Yellowstone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to program, battery dies quickly","review":"The key fob was waaaay cheaper here than at our local auto shop, shipped quickly and was remarkably easy to program.

However, my key no longer works as the door lock is falling apart from the inside. I have to get into my car through the passenger door, which is especially a pain when it's raining outside (which is often, since it's summer in Florida.) I purchased this and received it within 4 business days. The instructions that came with it, though, aren't programming it. I have yet to go to Honda to see if they can take care of it.**EDIT**I went to Honda and asked them to program it. I WAS SOLD THE WRONG KEY FOB and ended up buying one for $80 at the dealer to make sure I got the right one and it was programmed successfully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honda Civic Keyless Remote","review":"The remote arrived on time and worked as described.

They are sturdy, easily manipulated, and do a good job. They clean up easily. They're easy to toss into the cooling oven to dry thoroughly. The handles make it easy for my young children to help cut cookies with.

The charecters are flat and the story killed itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cave collapsed.","review":"I think this book is the worst Hardy Boys book ever.This book is so poor I think it wasn't even made by Franklin W. Dixon.I would give it one star but I have to give it some credit.Listen to me and don't get this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Was The Author Thinking?","review":"This review concerns the revised 1964 edition. A young girl asks Mr. Hardy, Frank and Joe to find her brother, a young university professor, who recently disappeared. A clue left by the professor leads Frank, Joe, Chet and Biff to the Honeycomb Caves, not far from Bayport, where the boys discover a connection to Mr Hardy's other case involving sabotage at a new radar station in Bayport. I don't know what the author of the revised edition was thinking; he/she took the original edition, that was already not very good, largely rewrote it, stripped away the only really good thing about the original (its rich language and descriptiveness) and made an already dull book even worse. This is a bad book with a boring mystery and not much action. If you're determined to read this title, read the original if you can, neither one is very good, but at least the original was well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cave Canem","review":"Those of you who were forced to study Latin know the old joke: \\"Cave Canem.\\" It's Latin for \\"Beware of Dog.\\"And this story is a definite dog. Already this early in the series, \\"F.W. Dixon\\" has started cannibalizing his own work, thinking that hanging about caves is somehow exciting or mysterious.Let's face it: caves are dreary, dark, damp and dismal. What sort of real entertainment is afforded here?And besides, about halfway through this story you forget what the boys were looking for. However, in the revised version, there are a great many fun references to the much-discredited 1964 New York World's Fair, especially the huge Uniroyal ferris wheel that they made look like a big whitewall tire.Guaranteed to break the ice at parties, that is."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very Beautiful Curtain Book","review":"The Pictures and Designs are the very latest, some of them do not even require sewing.

But what I heard greatly disappointed me... either they took his worst old songs or he didn't get good till he got signed. Each song follows this basic pattern, some with very slight modifications: A vocal or sound effect will play, then a loop, usually just of a beat, will play, and it will repeat over and over again with no changes at all for the entirety of the song. Don't buy this album, it's a total waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vaseline Lotion","review":"Very good product as i was looking for an older lotion that wasdiscontinued i guess. it was advanced healing but it could notfind it as ordered this as a replacement and it is fine. as ithas no fragrence and it is very southing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful if you have allergies","review":"I work in a hospital and must wash my hands many times a day, which leaves them dry, itchy, cracked and bleeding. However, I have very sensitive skin that reacts to many topical allergens and lotions. I have previously used the Vaseline Intensive Rescue Healing Hand Cream with great success, but it is no longer carried by my local provider so I tried the Moisture Locking Lotion today. The first time I applied it the backs of my hands almost immediately broke out in a painful itchy rash. I thought that might have been a fluke so I waited for the rash to clear up and tried again about six hours later. Within 30 seconds I again broke out in a rash, even more painful this time. I will be taking this back to the store tomorrow and ordering the Healing Hand Cream online. This may be great for those with normal skin, but if you have very sensitive skin don't let the \\"hypoallergenic\\" fool you."},{"rating":"1","title":"It hurts!","review":"I had very high hopes for this razor but unfortunately, I had to return it. I don't consider myself to have sensitive skin but the trimmer blades on this razor hurt. I've used my husband's razor plenty of times and like it alot but it's not cordless and I wanted something I could use in the shower but this definately wasn't it for me. Also, it's battery has to be completely disharged every four weeks. I wasn't looking forward to having to remember to do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This razor has no button or notch or anything to assist in getting the top off so that you can clean out the hairs, etc. It's designed for you to just YANK it off - well that doesn't always work so well and I have twisted the blade inside while doing this and just barely got it back on. The reason I say \\"twisted the blade\\" is the second big problem - there is no actual blade! It's a flat piece of metal (thin & moldable) with holes in it (like a cheese grater) that lays up against a motor and this is what goes against your body to shave. Also the manual says to get a new \\"blade\\" every year - so you have to keep all the mailing info and order it yearly from the manufacturer! Keep looking - there must be a better razor out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfulfilled possibility","review":"I purchased this book after reading some of Meloy's short stories. Needless to say I was greatly disappointed. Reading this book was the equivalent of being on one of those conveyor belts in American airports. Everything felt rushed along, but you never really got anywhere. The plot was contrived and the characters were cutouts -- poorly conceived. Ms. Meloy pushed her story along as if she couldn't wait to finish it, and start something else. If she had taken more time to write a novel, instead of an expanded short story, the book might have kept me in its grip and I would have had better things to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"big disappointment","review":"I was recommended this book and read it during a long flight. I found the characters to be sadly underdeveloped and did not feel that the growth of each characters was visible so by the end I didn't care about any of the family members. The end was a bit too dramatic and seemed like a \\"Lifetime\\" TV plot. The writing was good and so maybe the author's next attempt will show some maturity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Growing Up Catholic OR Growing Up With Family Secrets","review":"I think the title of this book could easily be changed to 'Growing Up Catholic' and/or 'Growing Up With Family Secrets'. I imagined the matriarch of the story as actress, Imelda Staunton (she was Academy Award nominated for the film VERA DRAKE in 2004). The story moved along so quickly that the first chapter had the matriarch married as a young girl, the second chapter had her with two young daughters and the third chapter had one of the daughters impregnated by a schoolteacher during a school dance outing. The chapters get more steamy as one reads along. I must thank my dentist friend, Jane Carter, in Surrey, England who recommended the book. I truly got a lot out of the book. It's clearly true that 'a family is irrevocably changed with each additional child' as is mentioned in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great dialogue, good characters, wanted a little more","review":"This is an excellent first novel by Maile Meloy, and I look forward to reading her future work. In getting through nearly 50 years in 260 pages with multiple characters, you can't help feeling that some stories would have been better served with some more pages.With that said, these were good, well-realized characters. With an economy of words, Meloy manages to give each person a distinct voice, and make them complex and conflicted in the bargain. Real-life dialogue adds to the mix. The story is compelling, and lets us see how all involed are both liars and saints, and how secrets haunt our lives--and deaths.Read this novel. The characters stay with you, which is an indication of how good it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting with no meat","review":"I read this book in one day. Not because it was so good I couldn't put it down, but because there was not much to read. Although it has an interesting and complicated plot, the characters are dreadfully underdeveloped and stagnant while the author's voice lacks compassion. The characters found themselves in precarious situations resulting in scandalous consequences, but I found myself unable to care. While reading, I was wanting to know more, but by the end, I could care less what happened. If you are looking for a book to pass the time on a rainy Saturday, this is the book for you. If you are looking for literary heft, look elsewhere. Try \\"The Curious Incident of a dog in the Nightime\\" by Mark Haddon. He has written a character you will truly care about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely a star","review":"I had the great misfortune of choosing Liars and Saints for a discussion and was the first to echo our group's great disappointment in this book. The prose is poorly articulated. The characters and plot are sadly underdeveloped. As a result, the novel reads like a fifth grade creative writing assignment. The dialogue uttered by many of the characters seems inconsistent for their life experience. As an adult Catholic, I find the treatment of Catholicism to be both superficial and superstitious. There has been no theological reflection or struggle demonstrated in the characters or in the prose. If you have a free afternoon, relish it, don't waste it on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and Underdeveloped Story","review":"Was sent this book by a friend who thought the subject was sad and depressing. I was disappointed in this book. I read the first reviews out, and thought it would be a good story and a good read. I was the one sad and depressed reading this story because of a shallow plot, predictable story, and underdeveloped characterzation. Maile Meloy has more talent then this book tells."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I bought this book excpecting something very different from what I got. It is not just a story of how a family is affected by Catholic guilt, but Catholic guilt topped off with some incest and a vengful God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising writer, not yet a novelist","review":"Four generations of a family in only 250 pages just doesn't work. The characters and the plot had tremendous but unrealized potential; the author just didn't flesh them out enough to make you care. I was sorry that I started the book. There were points to admire but they were completely overwhelmed and negated by the missed opportunities.

(Interesting sidebar learned while cruising with the familia Santerre: Teddy Kennedy received his First Communion from the Pope?)Meloy could have drawn out this saga for hundreds of tear-jerking, soul-searching, Catholic- guilt- coated pages, but, thankfully, her style is brisk, bouncing chronologically one step forward and two steps back. It is a fine and gripping foray through many cultural taboos - sex, incest, religion and politics. /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best New Primer on the Ancient Practise of Ogham.","review":"This is an excellent starting point for new practioners of Ogham.It's a practical reference for all Neo-Druids,or even for Neo-Pagans that want a new divination tool.It's not just for Keltic seers among us ,to channel the natural forces of trees.It's great also for all clairvoyant truth-sayers and seekers, just to sample Skip Ellison's unique passagework here."},{"rating":"2","title":"rep yo set","review":"It's about time the rips and dawgs put together another cd together. this bangin from track to track if you like bangin on wax 1,2,nationwide rip ridaz 1,2,damu ridas 1,2, b-dawgs or n.o.t.s then hang it up cuz they gave it their all on dis"},{"rating":"1","title":"mainstream garbage","review":"another album i wouldnt pay 2 cents of a dollar for this is a disgrace nothing like bangin on wax nationwide ripridaz bdawgs come better flamin or any n.o.t.s or blueragg this is a joke stay away from this garbage it has maybe 2 ok tracks but a major dissapointment HAHAHAHAAAAAA!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"These are very good","review":"OK, I admit it, I'm hooked on the shows!

If you want to learn about them go somewhere else. Most of the information (which is slim like the book) is unsubstantiated in any way or referenced in any way. We are left to accept the authors opinions without further questions. Many mistakes of fact multiply the questionable opinions expressed. This book does little if anything to add to the knowledge of Pipe Tomahawks except giving the Dealer's slant on the business of buying and selling. The author attempts to rate them and date them using his own system which is not truly based on fact, but on opinion. Books like this perpetuate inaccuracy to the point of ridiculousness. But if you like only photos of pipe tomahawks, this is the book for you.

I used to own one of these a long time ago and it was a very good unit. This one has really LOW power and speed using any common toothpaste I found. The battery charge retention is way below that of competing units. The concept of the rotating tufts is excellent, but the execution is bad. I ended up replacing it after two weeks with an Oral-B Professional. Much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best designed electric toothbrush ever","review":"The reason this electric toothbrush is superior to any other on the market is simple. Each individual tuft in the brush head (there are 8 of them) is connected to a gearing system that lets each tuft rotate independently of the others. No other electric toothbrush that I am aware of on the market today has this excellent feature. The drawback is that in time the toothpaste tends to migrate into the gearing system causing the brush head to fail. Using the several ports to rinse the brush head with clear water delays this inevitable process by a factor of 10. I have tried a Sonicare and an Oral B to compare. The Interplak systems wins hands down. They also make an excellent device called a Water Pik for cleaning between the teeth that is also head and shoulders above the competing products. Good Luck"},{"rating":"2","title":"Got my money's worth after 3 years of use!","review":"I've been a long time Interplak user, and truly believe that no other product can come close to the thorough cleaning of Interplak. My dental hygienist can tell when I've been using another type of tooth brush. No other toothbrush has a design that can get deep in between teeth. I had this model (NT7CS) for three years before it needed to be replaced. For a $20 investment, that's good enough for me. The biggest complaint in the reviews I read when I initially researched it was that over time, toothpaste residue would build up in between the ridges of the rubber handle - and it does. But it only takes a minute to clean the handle with a brush that has stiff bristles. I recently replaced it with a newer model,Interplak DPI9R Direct Plug-In Rechargeable Power Plaque Removerand would recommend shelling out the extra money as the DPI9R has a much stronger battery and cleans more powerfully on its high setting than the NT7CS."},{"rating":"2","title":"I prefer Interplak...","review":"I have used an Interplak toothbrush since they first came avaiable many years ago.

I just want something to clean my teeth and give the gums a workout. This one seems to do the trick, but I use it without toothpaste as a pre-brushing exercise.

While using it, I had dental assistants remark how little plaque I had, even after two years one time when I was lazy and didn't visit the dentist. That Interplak was an amazing toothbrush and the battery in the unit held out for close to ten years. I bought another Interplak after Conair purchased the company and it wasn't even in the same ballpark as the old one. The battery wore out after about nine months and the soft, silky brushing of the old Interplak was never there. I suppose the problem with the old Interplak was that they were so good they rarely wore out and how can a company survive if people don't recycle their old products for new? I've discarded the Conair Interplak for a Braun which is okay but not even close to the original Interplak purchased in 1990."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointed.","review":"I was real excited to find this electric toothbrush for such a reasonable price.However when I got it home and started to use it I was a little disappointed.

My main complaint is that the brush shaft is so large at the base that a person can't comfortably hold their lips around it to keep the \\"stuff\\" in their mouth. Too, the fact that the shaft has several holes in it lets liquid squirt all over the place when one of the holes comes out of the mouth, as in brushing the front teeth. And, the brush has only two rows of bristles.Lastly, the thing just shuts down when it has reached the scientifically determined minimum cleaning time of 2 minutes. Sometimes I ain't thru yet. I don't need a timer. I brush them until I am thru, thank you very much.Based upon the sloppiness issue I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok","review":"Its aight.

I know I was young, but I saw many serious films that year (I went to the movies every Saturday)--films like Imitation of Life, Anatomy of a Murder, On the Beach, Room At the Top, The Sound and the Fury, and Suddenly Last Summer (to name just a few), and I loved them and stayed interested. I don't think I was too young to appreciate this movie at age 15 because I tried to watch it a couple of years ago on TV and got just as bored.

At the end all the soldiers and the mutinous lieutenant march off willingly to Cordura, led by the sergeant---the one person who could never go there! Terrible!

Because there is a euphemism replacing God's name in vain which is repeated over and over again in this song, we will not be listening to it again. Shame on you Veggie Tales for putting that in a \\"religious\\" video.None of my children were impressed at all and even MY little princess said she was disappointed.

Mary McD is very bold to attempt to step into shoes so well filled by Kyra. However, I think Rader's character is stong enough, and Mary's performance good enough to succeed at this tough job. I've been a long time fan of Mary McDonnell's anyway and think she did and does a great job. I can see that this new series will contain much of the best of the previous, even if a few important characters are absent. I hope this series makes it.

I don't know how they do it, but I remember at the beginning of the show, there were a few niggly issues as everyone tried to find their pacing. Well, they found it, and that pace seriously rocks. Sharon just keeps getting more relatable and I personally loved seeing her in some casual wear and being tough.

It is common sense that one can only replace a superstar by team work, and this is what the show is about.The bad side is, I don't quite think the show charming any more.

There were so many ways the author made this a five star book by using words of wisdom. For example, instead of saying stories, the author said tales and instead of run, she said hurried. Also, she said midnight instead of blue and even took the slightest things in the story and made them better.The words in this story really came to life. The book expressed so many feelings, and I highly recommend this book. 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Addie....","review":"I give this book five stars.

My advise is to steer clear of these headphones and the dealer I got mine from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good enoff","review":"The sound quality is good, although unlike others, I missed some more bass and maybe a little more volume. Did do a good job cutting outside noises. Como with an adaptor, so you can use them on 3.5mm jacks or the \\"bigger ones\\" (the ones you can find in professional sound systems, but I forget their specs...). Build quality seems decent (plastic, but doesn't fell flimsy), although the place where is rotates (a kind of rotator cup) seems like it could brake under little pressure...Very long cable (which is good), and the last half of it is spiraled like a phone cable...------UPDATE: I hardly use, just because the sound is so low and lacking. Also can't use it when doing some light DJing at partys even, because the noise isolation is almost null. The only good thing I have to say about it, is that the build and material are good. Maybe you'll have better luck with a high output mixer..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Headphones","review":"I ordered these headphones about a year ago. Pretty reasonable quality for the price. The body is well built, but is mostly made of plastic. I bought these headphones for djing, and they are great. Especially how the connector can convert from a 3.5 mm jack to a 1/4 jack with a screw-on attachment. (Included) However, i said the quality of the sound is good, but these headphones lack bass. They mainly produce mids and high frequencies. Therefore if you are looking for some heavy bass headphones like I was, i would not recommend these. Otherwise the Gemini djx-05 headphones are good headphones, but not made for bass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks adjustment, Cord not long enough.","review":"The single cord on one ear phone was good, but the cord was not long enough. It should have been about 12 to 15 feet. If somebody is buying headphones with an accordian cord, they obviously need to move around with it. I couldn't reach much of anything in the DJ Booth. Better to have too much cord than not enough. The headband adjustment is limited. I needed it to go smaller, but the adjustment stopped short and the earphones were below my ears. I have to wear a hat in order to use them. Sound quality is okay. Overall, it's not what I was hoping for, but kinda gets the job done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the cheap price","review":"Pros:- Sound is actually pretty good.Cons:- HURTS your ears really badly. After about 15 min your ears will be throbbing with pain.- Super cheap material. It feels like it will break at any moment. Plastic is hollowed out, it has no weight to it and the wiring is so plasticy i barely unravels.- The ones I got looked as if they were used before. Scuffs and dings everywhere.I regret having bought these mainly because of the pain they cause my ears. I understand the cheap material for a cheap product, but it shouldn't cause me pain.

I am disappointed than the super store by me has discontinued the replacement blades from their stock but was happy to see it here at amazon. The cleaning mose is great just hit a button and go. If the noise \\"more like humming\\" bothers you just fininh your business in the room and hit the button on your way out.

I only used the recommended cleaning solution, changed it according to the instructions, and cleaned it after every use. I sent the shaver back to Remington, they were very nice and sent a new replacement shaver after a few weeks. It worked wonderfully, for about 2 months when the same problem occurred again!

Cleaning is super simple for a very close shave. Not as close as my Gillette Mach 3 razor, though. The only downsides are that I have to use the razor for my side burns and the stubble directly under my nose. If I didn't have to switch to the razor to finish up, then I would have given it 5 stars.I was hesitant about buying the razor since I hadn't tried a Norelco, but I'm really glad I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shave and features","review":"I replaced my 6800 series with the 8890xl.

WHY the merchant who should have known what razor I was buying this for, and know it would fit should have notified me. But assume they don't know WHY is item packaged in such a way you CAN NOT TELL if item fits without removing from package. ALL they would have to do is package in see thru material and there would be NO PROBLEM. I find this deceptive, and even am more concerned AMAZON doesn't see to be concerned about the merchants, what I consider at best a very poor way of dealing with customers. I might add I emailed this merchant THREE times with no reply,and when did reply claimed I did not send email yet it went thru tne amazon system ,stay away is my advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Norelco razor heads","review":"I received the box of razor heads for my Norelco electric razor in the mail promptly, immediately popped the old ones out, the new ones in, and shaved before 15 minutes had gone by.

He systematically shaves with an electric shaver one day (dry shave) and a blade the next (wet shave). When his shaver gets dull, he is not happy, and he is the type to throw away an unsatisfactory product. I have tried convincing him that some things can be fixed, upgraded, or at the very least, used by someone less fortunate. So I was very pleased to order replacement blades for his cordless Norelco shaver rather than to have to buy a whole new shaver. The order arrived fast - within a couple days of my placing the order - and it took me all of about a minute to take out the old, dull blades, drop in the new ones, and reassemble the shaver.

Useless.","review":"Bought these heads for their exorbitant price and they were dull from the moment I installed them in the shaver. They deteriorated rapidly from that point on and were useless in about 2 months, basically hacking off my whiskers and not cutting them. I'll bet that Norelco outsourced manufacturing of the cutters to China and they botched the process transfer. I switched to a Remington foil shaver model F4790 and am getting vastly superior results --- and replacement heads and cutters are about 1/2 Norelco's outrageous price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much hype, not enough solid information","review":"This book was highly recommended as I began my search for evidence based information on raw feeding. As a veterinarian I found the book to be sorely lacking in solid, useful information and instead found much of the same hype and extreme thought that usually turns people off of raw feeding. I wanted to learn more objectively how raw truly promotes health but instead had to read page after page about how ignorant many vets are with regard to pet nutrition and how the pet food companies all want to kill our pets and profit from it. While both of those thoughts may or may not be true, this was not the reason I chose this book. I thought a book written by an alternative minded veterinarian would help me learn the benefits of raw feeding for clients. This book did not help me begin to learn raw feeding for my own pets, let alone clients."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read.","review":"I just wanted to take a second to write a little review. No not one of those big reviews that yells \\"give me all the attention, I'm the best reviewer out here!\\"But a lil small review that covers some of the things some people have spoken about and what not.First some say this book seemingly is all about the author, Tom Londsdale. Ok, the forward, preface, and even chapter 1 is about him and the industry, but then he goes in to great detail about dental care, how artificial dog foods damage the teeth and so forth and so forth.Some say it's hard to follow, well, I'll admit at times it is. It's a book of detailed reasons of why to go on the raw diet. It's not a recipe book, it's a good book to give you an idea about the raw diet, and frankly for the raw diet you dont need a recipe book! What's so hard about giving a raw chicken?So I give this 4 stars, because it is a good book, however it can be a bit boring at times.I just ordered \\"give your dog a bone\\" how I look forward to reading that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No \\"How-To\\" Information","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I read the reviews here and thought it would tell me how to change my dog's diet to RAW. It told me everything but that. Tom Lonsdale devoted exactly 1 page to the most important information! He simply told his story about his war with the dogfood industry and vets who support it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw Food Diet","review":"This book is designed for folks who are interested in feeding their dogs a natural diet. It seems to be a precusor to the Barf Diet Books. It is technical in it's approach but describes a recommended diet which takes about two sentences. For anyone who feeds this type of diet to their dogs this book gives an excellent rationale for doing so. Although currently there is a \\"feud\\" going on between the author and those involved in BARF diets. In my opinion they are basically the same and only differ at the fringes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Science behind the diet","review":"This books gives you all the science and clinical testing that supports why the BARF diet is the best diet for dogs."},{"rating":"1","title":"The matyrdom of Tom Londsdale","review":"I bought a few books on raw feeding and holistic diets and I have to say this is the worst. It's not even about raw meaty bones. This book is more about how the author feels martyred by both the Australian Vet Association and the pet food industry. I guess this might make an interesting story if thats the kind of thing you want to read about. I just found it a tiresome tirade.Work Wonders, by the same author, is much more informative about raw feeding and can be downloaded for free at [...]."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is a great book! Gives you all the reason you should switch your animal to a raw diet and then gives you so much more.Dr. Lonsdale shows how a corrupt pet food industry is protected by an equally corrupt profession, the vets. His courage in facing these two monsters is to be embraced.The book is not a 'how to'-- but who needs a how to? Feeding animals a raw diet is not a complicated thing to do but understanding why we do this is very important"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if your writing a research paper.","review":"The book goes on and on about why store bought pet food isn't any good for your pet. It gives very little information about the raw bones diet. I am very disappointed! I didn't need convincing, I wanted to know some diet particulars. I know it isn't just about raw meat. They need other things as well, if only in small amounts. This book gave me no pointers or examples. If you are looking at feeding your pet a natural diet, and are looking for example diets, etc. don't buy this, unless a whole one page appendix is good enough for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE DON'T FEED YOUR ANIMALS RAW MEAT OR BONES!!!","review":"i haven't read this book but i do know that raw meat and bones are extremly dangerous for your pets. raw meat contains bacteria such as salmonella and e. coli that can cause your pet to become seriously ill. also, bones can get lodged in the throat or intestines and can fragment inside the stomach/intestinal track. your pet could bleed to death internally!! BONES AND RAW MEAT COULD KILL YOUR ANIMAL. if you don't want to feed your pet commercial foods, read \\"Food Pets Die For\\" by Ann N. Martin. it is an amazing (and sometimes frightening) book that uncovers the truth behind the commercial pet food industry and also includes recipes for feeding your animals home made diets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really, really good","review":"After 25 years, I'm still not entirely consistent as to where I stand on occultism or esoterica or whatever you want to call it. When I do indulge in such things, I'm not exactly easy on authors, as I have a fairly excessive education and am as hyper critical of such books as I am of anything I read. I grabbed this book on a whim, and as it turns out, it is easily the best book about esoteric tarot and one of the smartest, if not the smartest, occultism books I have ever read.Granted there are a few historical ideas early on that would alienate anyone with a solid historical education (and give Michael Dummett fits), but other than that, the book is gold. As theory/philosophy, it's incredibly clear and intelligent, and as a a handbook, it contains much practical advice that will help anyone to get the whole system into their brains and begin playing with the concepts.If you are at all interested in occult tarot, beg, borrow, or steal this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Jazz June album (I think)","review":"This CD is super terrific. I love it to death. It's classic Jazz June, with the great guitar driven rock that they do so well. It's fast, it's catchy, and it's very well played. The lyrics are great, and the recording is great. Everything blends in so well and creates such a beautiful layered sound. It's just a great album to put in and listen to, you can tap your foot to every song. This band never gets old, they just sound so good. There is no comparison, the Jazz June sounds like no other.

I wear anywhere between a 8.5-9.5 depending on the brand, so with this I chose to order a 9 and it was almost perfect. The heel is a good size for extended wear and the leather has started to soften and flex a bit now that I've been wearing them off and on for the last month.

A struggle to wade through at times. I must admit that there are a couple of useful nuggest in the book if one has the time to mine them out.

Wells.","review":"Before \\"Independence Day\\" and even \\"War of the Worlds\\" (film version), there was John Wyndham's book, \\"Out of the Deeps\\". The title refers to invaders who come from the sea, relentlessly attacking coastal areas, then spreading death and destruction to inland areas across the globe. Humanity's nemesis is intractable, and the course of the invasion chillingly described, in the style of the best H.G. Wells or H.P. Lovecraft work. The method of the invasion is unique, to my knowledge, and the scale immense. If you might enjoy the heart-pounding realism of humanity facing an implacable foe, I heartily recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great early \\"what if?\\" alien invasion story!","review":"John Wyndham has crafted a story that is both realistic and fascinating, while never allowing the suspense to drop. The aliens in this story are not here to teach us a lesson on how to properly take care of our world, nor do we ever see them. Their motivations and reasoning are left largely unexplored, but that makes the story all the stronger. The two central characters, Mike and Phyllus, and the pesimistic and overly-intelligent scientist Boker, are likeable.

Try this.","review":"Pets Digest Support 8 fl oz from Nature's AnswerOur dog is not a delicate eater but sometimes she has a bit of tummy trouble. We've been using Nature's Answer Pets Digest Support since she was a pup (she's 8 now) and she loves it. She even waits to eat til she gets her two squirts of this beef-flavored (from soy) liquid on her dry food. This all-natural product has ginger and slippery elm to help relieve gas and improve digestion.What is very sad is that the company seems to be scaling back production of its pet products line. That is unfortunate because this product is unique; many pet digestive products have enzymes, etc. and I have tried them but this is the product my dog prefers. I hope that more people urge Nature's Answer to continue with their fine line of pet products!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging Portrait of Justinian and his times","review":"This is a very good, readable account of the reign of Justinian and Theodora. The author does a commendable job of providing a concise overview of the political, religious, social and economic issues of this era of the Byzantine empire. Architecture and art are also addressed. The author is clearly knowledgeable about the subject matter and knows how to tell the story in an engaging manner. He is adept at bringing many of the key individuals to life and describing the political, diplomatic and military activities among the Byzantine empire, the Persian empire, and western Europe. A nice set of illustrations and maps are also included. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome product","review":"I am a service member and a close shave is not an option.

This razor ripped up my neck and throat every time I used it. I don't consider myself to have sensitive skin so this was a suprise to me. In my life I've used every kind of blade and electric razor out there and I've never had this problem. The instructions say to use the razor for 30 days so your skin can get used to it. I used this razor for six months with no improvement. I finally threw it in the garbage out of frustration. I gave it two stars because on my face it worked ok (not great) and I did like to be able to use it in the shower. My next electric will be a Braun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story--wonderful series","review":"Emma is such a well developed character that just gets better with each story.

On this, Epica's 3rd album, the songwriting, production, even Simone Simons singing has improved dramatically.I also own Epica's first 2 albums, and while I think they are ok, they do not blow me away. Some of the songs on those are 'meh', some of the choir-sounding vocals are a bit hokey, Simones voice, while beautiful, still needs work, etc.On this new album \\"The Divine Conspiracy', everything good about Epica's sound comes together. The difference between this album and their first 2 are like night and day.If you like power/gothic/symphonic/etc. metal with female vocals (some male growling as well), you cant go wrong with Epica's 'The Divine Conspiracy'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Still trying to like this album....","review":"Wow...I hate to be the only naysayer in the group, but....Production-wise, I found this album to be top-notch. The orchestrations were done very well. However, I found the majority of the songs on this album to be....well....forgettable. None of the songs really stood out to me like they did on Epica's \\"Consigned To Oblivion\\" album.As for Simone Simons' beautiful voice...the more I hear it, the more I become convinced that she's in the wrong band. The songwriting just doesn't utilize Ms. Simons' amazing vocals enough, in my opinion. It's almost as if the band is competing with itself. While I appreciate growly vocals as much as the next sweaty headbanger, they just turned me off on this album.All in all, I just did not find this album as memorable and accessible as their previous offering. I hope their next is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why? WHY? WHY!!!?","review":"Does anyone actually LIKE death growls? Is this some sort of male domination thing?

It's a shame really, because if it weren't for Cookie Monster, this would probably be one of my favorite albums ever. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the Digipak version for the Replica bonus track!","review":"I haven't seen anyone mention it yet, but the digipak version of this album includes one of Epica's best songs...Replica (a Fear Factory cover/remake). This is not a typical Epica song and it deals with a controversial subject (child of a rape victim), which is probably why it was left off the regular version of the album, but it is a great song that all Epica fans should have. Some parts of the song have Simone's voice being digitally altered, kind of industrial sounding, and other parts have her voice clear and beautiful. I was really shocked at first to hear an angry sounding Simone singing \\"I am rape. I am hate.\\", but she does a great job with it. If you don't already have this album, be sure to get the version with this bonus track! If you already have the album, the song Replica is also available on the single for Chasing The Dragon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy Ground CD","review":"I really wanted Monica Brown's Holy Ground CD.

Do you have the Monica Brown Holy Ground CD that is an Emmaus Production?"},{"rating":"2","title":"After 14 years, they're still the best band I've ever heard.","review":"This album is still at the top of the list in terms of best all around CD. There's not one song on there not worth listening to.All of the songs of \\"Ghost of Cain\\" pack power and punch along with both rebellious and intelligent thought behind it. As a testament to their music, I know of two metal bands that have done covers of \\"Hunt\\" and do it justice.If I had to put New Model Army's music into a little box and label it, it'd be right there in \\"Songs to Start Your Own Revolution To\\". I've listened to NMA for 14 years now and I was lucky enough to see them in their US tour some 10 years ago. I can honestly say that they are more powerful live and in person than in any CD recording you've ever heard. In that performance in Berekeley, Ca. they played \\"Hunt\\", \\"51st State\\" and \\"Master Race\\" and drove the crowd insane.Buy it, they're an addiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Nilsson's early, innovative albums.","review":"I was a fan of Nilsson's music growing up and still listen to it frequently.

Wrong. Even the \\"easy\\" designs (one or two stars on a scale of one to four) were frustrating. I would cruise through a third or half way through the design and then hit a step that I could spend more than an hour on and still not figure it out. Very frustrating because I was excited to do some of the bug designs for my sons.If you are an advanced intermediate, you will probably enjoy this book very much because it has many cool designs for birds and bugs.

The birds designs are intermediate difficulty. The bugs range towards hard, but are conversation pieces once you fold them. (Use Amazon's Look Inside feature and the pics will tell you clearly how cool these designs are.)Diagrams were as clear as possible, given that the designs are often complex (sometime there are like 8 arrows on the same step telling you to fold all at once - gack). I was able to work through these given enough time.I recommend this book only if you know you have the patience to try and work through each pattern very carefully. These are very nice designs but also complex and not for beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better choices","review":"I am a nursing student currently using this book for pharmacology in Med-Surg I. After having worked through 7 chapters, I am not fond of this book. The authors have set it up in alomost a circular manner so that you are searching all over for the information you need. Some of the informatrion is too simple and doesn't help create a good understanding of the material.

When I saw it at the bookstore I was interested because I thought it would be a nice story about Spain. Plus, I take Spanish so it just seemed right. Well this isn't some cute Spanish story. It's more geared for 14 and up. I think the characters, Ruth and Tom, were overdone and you could have lived without some parts of the book.

I picked this book up out of curiosity, and was happy to find out that Cann's style has picked up a few notches, and she knows how to keep a reader hooked very well. \\"Spanish Holiday\\" was a quick read, but still very good, although the ending is a bit abrupt and definitely a cliffhanger. All around though, the book has defined characters who the audience can really feel for, and wonderful settings that envelope the reader and keep him/her hooked throughout the entire read. Hopefully Cann comes out with another book in the series, and let's hope she can find Laura another beautiful country to visit!

Not all covers are bad of course, he does a restrained, but burning, version of the Pixie's \\"Monkey's Gone to Heaven\\" on \\"Kite\\", and anyone with that kind of guts deserves some cred. Both the new album and this are very much worth having, but you will have to set aside your objection to the Brit MOR pop touches to gain access to his fine hooks and smoking vocals. The potential here is probably greater than what's on plastic already, well worth watching. His lack of presence on this side of the pond is inexplicable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummed.","review":"I was so excited to get this one.The original version is so darn good.

I had the misfortune of buying it because it was required for a data structures class at my school. My main problem with it is that it does not use the STL versions of the classes in the book. The author writes his own versions that do not conform to the standard. This presented a large problem when I went to use the concepts from the book in a program. I got tons of compiler errors until I finally got mad and looked up the STL version documentation. To my surprise, this book uses different function names and different function signatures in many cases.

Finally had to give up on this and got myself Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen et. al. to relieve myself of the trouble I was going through with this .... There are a lot of weaknesses to this book the most glaring of which is the lack of depth in which the subject has been treated by the authors. The code examples are very poorly documented and most subjects are given a very superficial treatment, certainly not the kind of reference one is looking for when trying to understand a subject.

It's for the C language, but is almost identical. The difference is classes for the implementation, but most everything else is the same.I get the idea, after looking at other DS books for C++, that this one is just a port from C to C++ without much extra thought involved.I'm having to use another book from the school library to learn from, and following the design for the structures in this book for my assignments.

This was not a simple tale of eating someone's porridge or sitting in a chair, but vandalism that was approved of by the little bear's parents!This book made vandalism and revenge seem like acceptable things to do, and to make matters worse, it turned out that the bears were not actually in Goldilocks house, but by accident they had ransacked the wolf's house.

What happens to his cop brother played by Wahlberg is also very real and you get a very \\"real\\" feeling from this movie, especially in the last half. It does not have the sugary happy good-guy movie ending either which I appreciated. It realistically portrays in an entertaining way some conflicted, sad situations."},{"rating":"1","title":"melodrama that aims for mythic","review":"An intriguing set-up and some great action sequences, especially a car chase that is (rare for the movies) both believable and riveting, ultimately devolves into a slow story of brotherly reconciliation. The movie never pretends to be more than melodrama but then goes for broke by trying to make the characters and their story mythic instead of just keeping us rooted in a grimy crime drama. Writer-director James Gray tones it down and gets something far superior in the drama Two Lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls off a cliff in the 2nd half","review":"For the first half of the movie, I found it to be quite good. Up to that point it had a good story, good characters and fine acting. Then, after the pivotal scene of the movie, the story looks like it's written by a couple of high school drop outs. It's really amazing how dramatic the fall off is. At that point it is so bad, I still was able to enjoy it a bit because I could laugh at from that point on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"This movie was fantastic all the way through! Starts off good, and never quits! Watch it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"We Wish We Didn't Own The Night!","review":"The creators of this movie stole from the best and then squandered the booty. This movie is 100% derivative without an original element, except for the wildly improbable scene where a citizen is given a gun, a badge, and a police uniform and told to go out there and be a cop. The great Robert Duvall is wasted here; he shows up to recite the script, but forgets to act. Phoenix and Whalberg alternately over-act and forget-to-act. I wondered how two notable young actors ended up in this crime of a movie, then the end credits revealed they both were: \\"producers.\\" Skip this one and rent \\"The Godfather\\" (where Robert Duvall remembers to act), \\"Serpico,\\" \\"Prince of the City,\\" or \\"King of New York\\" if you want real NYC crime, grit, and drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow","review":"Wow.

This was such a bad movie that I want my 99 cents back and the 2 hours of my life wasted watching this.

The actors involved are all very good, and Phoenix and Duvall have been excellent in roles previously; however, the actors got lost in a predictable and boring plot. There really were not any new ideas here. This is a 2 1/2 star film. It is okay to watch, just don't expect to be impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star studded, but slow","review":"Although Robert Duvall gives his requisite on target performance and Eva Mendes is, as always, soft on the eyes, this movie is a bit slow. It's as if we started the movie in the middle of the characters lives; consequently, you feel as if you missed the back story. For instance, why did the brothers dislike one another so much? Which son did the father identify with and why? At the very least, these questions should have been asked and answered before establishing the central plot. And if you can get past that the movie's not so bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"JAMES GRAY, OPUS 3","review":"I like the way James Gray patiently builds his imaginary world through his films. He deliberately chooses family circles as an ideal place for tragedy to appear. Here, in We Own The Night, we have two families, two brothers and two fathers. And we have Robert Grusinsky, who changed his name to Bobby Green, desperately trying to find the right place and the right circle. Masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joaquin Phoenix brings this movie home","review":"One of my top movies, Joaquin gives a life time performance.

Whitelaw shows how this has been extended by artists, into fabricating creations that blend computing into art.Some of you may have known about such things as cellular automata and how structures might propagate, and well as the use of fractals for renderings of irregular objects.

(In my case at least) The binding of my book was falling apart and the cover was already about to fall off when it arrived.

The sound quality is passable apart from the first track which sounds like its about to jump its so bad. It sounds here like Jimmy Smith is backing some RnB sax player like Sam the Man Taylor. Not very jazzy and not very good. It only runs to 24 mins as well"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"The sound is woeful, it is clearly taken from a rough LP _ the scratches are extraordinary on track one; you wouldn't give someone a homemade tape of this standard. Worse, it's not Jimmy Smith aural evidence, and a little research, suggests it's Dave ''Baby'' Cortez. In fact, Cortez is named in the writing credits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage with no historical value!","review":"Two reasons not to pay any attention or even considering bying this non-official Jimmy Smith album - 1) Audio quality is so poor that the CD transfer must be from an scratchy LP or cassette 2) Tunes drawn from Baby Cortez albums - no Jimmy Smith album.

So, I looked up on the Norelco site a local authorized repair shop. I took it in and the guy opened it up.

I have been having a difficult time with latch and positioning with the original Boppy. I bought a second one (for the second floor of my house) today, after contemplating buying a My Brest Friend instead and I am SO glad I gave Boppy another chance. Something about the Miracle Middle has made nursing just come together for us all of a sudden. Positioning and latch are happening and the Boppy is playing a major role. The Miracle Middle is definitely a miracle!I will be consigning the original Boppy and buying a second one with a miracle middle."},{"rating":"2","title":"A absolute MUST for breastfeeding.","review":"I cannot imagine learning to breastfeed without a Boppy. The Boppy helps you comfortably rest your baby while you nurse. I even took this in the car with me on road trips. When we pulled over it was much easier to feed her in the car with the help of the Boppy. I would recommend purchasing 2 covers.Boppy Flowers and Chocolate Slipcover, PinkIt is a bummer in the middle of the night if your baby spits-up or has a blow-through diaper. The Boppy is also great when your baby is learning to sit on her own. It offers great support and if she has a tummy ache she will enjoy laying on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this boppy!","review":"Perfect for our twin granddaughters.

Yes, it is wonderful and everything the other reviewers said. However, my issue is that it begins to \\"bend\\" in the middle from use. Really, this is fine...I mean a year of nursing is going to be hard on any pillow. But my main complaint is that the covers they make for these things are NOT waterproof (or spit-up proof). What is the point of a cover? I had to wrap my entire Boppy in saran wrap, then put the cover on to get any protection nd prevent smelly stains. just my two cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good nursing pillow; get \\"My Brest Friend\\" instead.","review":"I completely agree with the review posted by the user: \\"Jacob's Momma.\\" The Boppy is NOT the ideal pillow for nursing, but it is good for letting my baby lie on to rest/sleep and as a support pillow for burping my baby in a sitting position. For a good nursing pillow, get \\"My Brest Friend.\\" I got the Boppy first, and it is too soft to support my baby for nursing. It also constantly slips away from me, and my baby tends to slip between me and the Boppy. For these reasons, my back felt strained when I used the Boppy for nursing. Then, I bought \\"My Brest Friend\\" and it worked great -- all the problems that I just mentioned were solved -- it's firm and supportive, and it also \\"locks\\" around my waist so it won't slip. Check out the reviews for \\"My Brest Friend\\" before buying the Boppy as a nursing pillow. Final FYI: I've seen the Boppy sold at Ross for $19.99 and that includes a fleece cover, so keep an eye out for it if you want a bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and saggy after short use","review":"The miracle middle is nothing special, so if you are a plus size mom on the larger side of plus, don't buy this thinking the pillow will stretch and wrap around you. I'm very short and this pillow was in a awkward position while breastfeeding, and wasn't long enough to offer the ever important elbow support. This applies when using the bottle with a heavier baby as well.The pillow is painfully missing back support, and the middle dips and sags. I only used this pillow for 3-4 months before using one of my regular pillows with a waterproof pad under because it was cumbersome and already losing shape.Use of this as a baby support is okay, better than a regular pillow, though in a pinch rolled up blankets work fine. While having the ability to customize your pillow style is nice, the added expense for an average product almost negates the pros.The pillow is said to be machine washable, but given the poor quality of the stuffing inside, do so at your own risk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Disappointment","review":"I registered for this thinking I'd use it for nursing. Well, I've been nursing for almost a month now, and I've found this pillow to be a bigger nuisance than helper. Here's why:1. The way it's shaped allows the baby to slip down towards your belly button. Rather than being flat towards your stomach, it angles downwards, allowing the baby no support. I end up holding her anyway.2. It doesn't stay on! No matter where I'm sitting: couch, rocker, chair, etc., it falls off! How annoying.3. I'm tall. I have to slouch over.4. Because of problem #1, I use a blanket to stuff in between the pillow and my belly. What a complete waste!It really should be shaped the like the pillows used in hospitals: flat the whole way. Totally a better design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Breastfeeding Pillow","review":"I'll say that the Boppy is great for tummy time, as a little prop-up pillow for babies who can't sit yet, and other similar uses. It is NOT a good breastfeeding pillow. Unless you luck and and have just the perfect shortness in your torso, this pillow will do little to prop up your baby to the right height without you also having to use your arms, other pillows, etc. And when you are nursing an infant all the time, your arms get tired. The boppy is useless! I saw a number of lactation consultants when my daughter was born and all of them said the same thing. They all recommended a pillow that gets your baby up to the right height and allows you to be \\"hands free.\\" Check out the BrestFriend-- it was the key to our nursing success after I gave up on the Boppy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will hinder your breastfeeding","review":"Horrible waste of money. The pillow slides all over the place, away from me, away from the baby, and onto the floor. The only practical use we found for it was for my husband to prop his head up while bottle feeding. It does not fit around the waist or support the weight of a baby. Get another pillow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped off ... at the seams.","review":"I purchased this pillow because I planned to breastfeed, and it worked well for that purpose at first. It also was good for propping my baby up whenever he was awake, but the reason I gave it only 2 stars is because of its poor craftmanship. At a cost of more than $20, it should be better made and last longer than 6-to-8 weeks. By the time my infant was 3 months old, the pillow was falling apart at the seams in at least two places. Stuffing was coming out where the stitching had come undone, forcing me to have to repair it myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every new parent should have one of these","review":"This product is a must have for new parents.

It works great as an infant support pillow but I'm not sure I would have registered for it just for that. As many others have said, baby slips down between you and the pillow. Also, I'm a short person but I still have to hunch down to keep a latch. I struggled with breastfeeding initially and because I thought this pillow was supposed to be some sort of miracle breastfeeding aid, I kept using it and continued to struggle. Now I'm using regular pillows from the bed while I try to decide if I can justify the cost of a My Brest Friend. By the by, I had mentioned my Boppy issues to my lactation consultant and she said she hears complaints about it all the time. If you are crafty, she mentioned that you can buy a piece of foam at the craft store, cut it to curve a bit around your belly, and cover it in fabric and get much better results than with the Boppy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it zero stars if I could!","review":"I do NOT understand why anyone likes the Boppy for nursing. I am a pretty small woman (about a size 8) and I found that the donut-hole in the middle was so small it buckled in the front when I tried to put it around my waist. Not only that, but it really needs to sit around the hips in order to be low enough to rest the baby on -- and that never worked, it just kept riding up to my waist. And because it's so round and puffy, I had to use just as much muscle to keep my baby from rolling away from me as I would have to hold him up! I tossed it in the closet and used regular bed and couch pillows instead. Also, I couldn't use it in any chair with arms (like a rocker or a dining-table chair because the big fat arms of the Boppy got in the way of the arms of the chair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made for an uncomfortable nursing experience","review":"I had purchased this product prior to the birth of my baby with much excitement. I could not wait to use it! After it's first use though, I was highly disappointed. Not only did it not fit around my waist/belly ...but it was not nearly thick enough to support my baby to the level of nipple. My arms were tired and sore as well as my back. I had to stuff extra pillows underneath in order to make it work. I ended up no longer using the Boppy after only a few feedings and just stuck with using regular 'ol pillows. I did however use the Boppy to help prop my baby in upright positions. I hardly think it's worth the price. A bit of a waste if you ask me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for breastfeeding","review":"Like many women, I bought this thinking it was for breastfeeding. It is not.

It didn't work for me at all! It kept sliding forward and he would end up wedged between me and it, down on my lap. My husband bought me a \\"My Brest Friend Deluxe\\" on Mother's Day. It is THE BEST! It may be because I am on the smaller side but I could not keep the @#$%^ boppy against me. Yes I have the newer model with the Wonder flex middle or whatever they claim.

This pillow isn't thick enough to support baby at nipple height, I find myself slouching/twisting/bending to get my breast to her. As a result, I feel miserable. I'm only 5'2, I can't imagine this would work for a tall person. I'm also thin, size 6... The pillow wraps around me and hits the chair back behind me, leaving a huge gap between my waist and the pillow, leaving baby unsupported too. I have tried bending, folding, turning, etc the pillow to work-it just doesn't.

This thing lays in on your knees, whose breast reach to their knees?!

Thankfully, a friend told me about \\"breast friend\\" (not the best name) and that nursing pillow saved the nursing experience for us, you can strap it around yourself so you can have it higher and it stays in place, it's also much better quality so it doesn't fold on itself and therefore more comfortable for the baby as well. It's a bit more money but absolutely worth it.Since we took off the tags of the boppy and washed the covers, we kept and my husband used it for bottle feedings but to us it was not worth the money for what we ended up using it for.

If the miracle middle was supposed to expand or something, it didn't. I'm not a plus-sized person, but I DID just have a baby for crying out loud.Third, they say all covers fit all boppies, but the spare cover I bought didn't fit.

I always felt like he was sitting too high or too low to be comfortable. I thought there was just no happy medium and that maybe I was doing something wrong. After visiting my lactation specialist she had a nursing wedge that I used and suddenly it felt so much more relaxing. I wasn't straining to hold his head in position like I did with the boppy. It was firm and not pillowey where he would sink into it. But I didn't want to ditch the boppy so quickly after just buying it so I stuck it out for a few more months then eventually just started propping him up with pillows until it felt comfortable. Next baby I am getting the nursing wedge!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended for breastfeeding","review":"I got the boppy for helping hold up the baby during breastfeeding. If you want a product for this purpose, I'd recommend trying a different one -- perhaps the breast friend? Because the edge of the boppy curves down, the baby falls into that crack / lower spot. It's just awkward. Also, it's better to have the baby's head higher than their tummy to avoid acid reflux (trust me -- you'll care about acid reflux :)), and so you'd have to somehow tip the boppy, which I never figured out how to do. I ended up not using it at all and just using a little square pillow under my arm that was holding her head, and no pillow under her bum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Breastfeeding Pillow","review":"The Boppy was never designed or intended to be used as a breastfeeding pillow. While it may have some good uses, if you need a pillow for breastfeeding support, try the My Brest Friend Pillow.

I've been using them since I was in the hospital having my son, and he is now 18 months. We had one upstairs, one downstairs, and I used to keep one in the car. Yes, you can nurse without a Boppy, but why would you? It's so much more comfortable to have the baby supported. It was especially useful for me as my son nursed multiple times a day for up to 1.5 hours each time. I used this for both the football hold and cradle hold. We would use it for my son to have tummy time when he was really small too. We bought this waterproof coverBoppy Water Resistant Protective Coverfor each pillow and put a decorative cover over that. I really like the covers that have one cotton side and one minky side.

It was!I liked the characters very much, and the author is great at describing the people and the feel of the area. Also the author is right on describing the beauty of this wonderful part of America.I gave it a four rather than a five only because I felt the end was rushed, the stories that I were wading through trying to figure out the mystery, just kind of fell into place a little to neatly and a little to quick.

Aspects of the book are quite good, such as some of the characterisation ofthe male characters - Garibaldi, Grey and Bester the short guy. The writing is juvenile and someof the sexism is unacceptable. Every time Ivanova or Talia are mentioned, the author has to say that theyare 'beautiful' or 'glamourous' or 'aluring'. Never once is Garibaldi described as 'hunky'. Andyes I know there is a reason for that, but still...

This is no \\"Moonlight\\", this is no \\"Appassionata\\"there is no moon here, this is the eye of the storm and a mute black night that follows.

The pivoting heads easily and snugly fit the contours of your face and it gave an excellent first shave that will only get better as the blades break in over the next few weeks.

I've found that it was easier to open the bag by blowing into the bag than to try to pry the clinging sides either by inserting my hand or a tool into the bag.The only other annoyance is that the bags come somewhat wrinkled.

JUNK!","review":"Very disappointed in this product. I'll give you the pros and cons. PROS: None! CONS: Everything about it... 1) It falls apart way too easy. You have to triple check that it is screwed together properly and even then , after you are sure it's screwed together properly, half the time it still falls apart. 2) It falls off the power head very easily. You have to attach it to the power head after the power head is positioned in the tank and even then it falls off half the time. 3) It Does polish the water and filter stuff out, then again, it does NOT! Let me explain: It will polish the water nicely. You can see it eagerly sucking in little bits of debris. Only one problem...when you are done with it, 90% of everything it sucked up dislodges as soon as you touch it when you want to remove it from the tank. So all the gunk you just polished from the tank is now floating in your tank again!!!

It makes your eyelashes feel light. No clumps at all. So far, so good. Sunday a pet had taken ill in our house. I spent much of the day crying. The same for Monday.

One good thing about this CD is the most popular songs by Poison is mostly all together, one after the other, so you don't have to search, rewind, or skip to many times to the better favorites.

Listen to alternative instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO GO","review":"Poison was more worried about how big their hair was and how many girls they could get then their music. They have to be one of the most overratted bands of the 80s. I will say that they are way better then most of the crap being made today. I saw them over the summer at Moondance Jam and I didn't even stay all the way through their show. They started out with one of the worst covers (We're An American Band) that I have ever heard.

No denying the guitar had some catchy hooks.. that a fourth grader could play. This is a perfect example of \\"corporate, all about the image\\" rock.

The production of the actual albums are very good, but then they should be......so are Britney Spears!..and why? Well, after the new wave of British Heavy metal led to talented bands like Van Halen to get on the scene and make metal enorously popular in the US, record producers wanted to cash in on the act. So, just as Disney do today, groups were manufactured into iconic figures......in the case of poison, ....lets sell sex and string a few guitars in...oh yea, and hairspray.......and call it music! Its because of bands like poison that metal in the 80s was doomed. I hate grunge, but thank god it came before metal died forever.

I hate all hair metal. Wearing spandex, makeup and leather do not make you a good band. I admire bands that don't need a glitzy image in order to make it and just wear the clothes on stage that they happened to wear that day.

I dunno...Anyway, it starts with some of their bette songs (Nothin' But a Good Time, Talk Dirty to Me, etc.) and finishes off with 2 previously unreleased songs (Sexual Thing and Lay Your Body Down).

I've been playing the guitar since I was a kid, I have a good ear, and feel that anything I can hear, and sit with for a while, I can figure out, and play but where my playing suffered was learning good habits from the beginning, working on timing, feel, tone, and, importantly mastering precision hand.

An \\"all boys club\\" (no Isabel Allende in those years) struggling for finding themselves, found that writing novels (or romances) will be, maybe, the best way. Mario Vargas Llosa, a then young and (very handsome) middle-class Peruvian wrote this satirical, funny, and witty novel where he laughs at himself, family values, modes and above all, men-women relationships.The setting: a radio station where the most popular genre were radio soap operas(\\"radio-novelas\\" in Spanish, and from which he is taking the model for the construction of his writing).Interesting and moving, the afternoon strolls between Aunt Julia and Marito (he is her junior).If you are interested in Spanish Grammar (and/or culture) the usage of names and slang words at the diminutive should be noticed(Very Hispanic usage indeed). A reading in Spanish is highly recommended)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful example of Vargas Llosa's talent","review":"The author weaves the story of a young man (18) who woos his older aunt (32) in with stunningly interesting \\"soap\\" scripts which are written by a fictitious Bolivian writer -- a series of stories within an overarching one. Most of the action takes place in Lima in the late 70's, but, as is the case with \\"universal literature\\" -- Vargas is a Nobel Prize winner after all --it could have taken place in many new world big cities of that time from New York to Buenos Aires.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong here, but this book explains how to program in an--albeit related--language called 'PocketC'.That in itself is not so very disappointing. However, what I did find unacceptable was the notice on Page 4 of this book which states: \\"Technically, PocketC does not compile code directly into the PDA's machine language--it uses a special language called byte code instead. This means that you will need PocketC to run the programs.\\" Which means: PocketC creates files which will not work as stand-alone PDA applications (i.e., *.prc files). Any programs created with this application require a separate program (called 'PocketC runtime') to be installed on any PDA running your PocketC-created program.Sorry. Not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Misleading","review":"I eagerly purchased this book as soon as it became available thinking it would benefit me in programming PalmOS applications in C.Wrong, wrong, wrong.

However, the desktop compiler refuses to work on any of the source after chapter 1 (it only supports code up to 768 characters). In order to complete the examples in the book, you must either purchase the full version (at least [more money]) of PDE, or write and compile everything on your palm top.Many other reviewers of this product apperently have been programming for a long time, and have purchased PDE already. They fail to note that the true cost of this book is [a little more] (after purchasing the full version of PDE).The book appears to be good, but this is dishonest marketing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great way to get productive with PocketC","review":"I had never done any C programming before buying this book. I had done some basic in high school and arexx after but had never progressed beyond hello world in C. Granted PocketC is not \\"real\\" C, but when I comes to getting an idea from your head to your palm it fits the bill almost perfectly. You are introduced to all the basics of working with pocketC in this book. Unfortunately it does not really cover the PDE version. If you read all the documentation that comes with the program and the parts of PToolBoxLib that you will need though, the total becomes more than a sum of its parts. In less than a month I had the basic understanding of how to go from an idea to a working project and would not have made it without this book. If you couple it with a standard text on C you will be able to work through most of your problems. It is to be noted though, that pocketC apps are kind of slow.

A handful of nuts for breakfast, lunch is whatever she wants--cheeseburger, fries, whatever...then comes dinner. Popcorn or a chicken strip or two??? You've got to be kidding?

She says it's ok to eat cheeseburgers and such all the time if you have a smaller meal later, but it's not healthy. She uses vulgar words and it is not necessary because she is neither funny nor insightful in this book. I tried to finish the book as fast I possibly could because it was dull and the advice she gave was not sound.

It is surprising to find one resource that cuts deeply to the heart of the Western mindset and then turns to showing how the fruit of the Spirit can replace it. Kenneson’s writing is encouraging but challenging because it requires a different kind of out-of-the-box thinking to recognize where we have believed our own lies. Changing a lifetime of thinking is very difficult.I am excited to try to apply these concepts to my life. I have often been interested in trying to analyze my own culture as I explore the cultures of others, and with the recognition that not only did Christianity originate in a very different culture but has also now moved back away from the West, I am learning to place a higher emphasis on cultural exegesis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to the Basics","review":"Among the many church growth specialists who want us to rethink the purpose of the church, the many theologians who want us to rethink the purpose of the Christian life, and the many Christian activists who want us to rethink Christians' relationship with American culture, this book stands alone. It brings us back to the basics: Our purpose as Christians is to live out and cultivate the fruit of the Spirit, a task which (the author is careful to tell us) only God can do, but which we can help or hinder. If you want to know why it's hard to have love, joy, peace, patience, etc.; if you want to know what things in your culture might be blocking these fruit; and if you want to know what a normal Christian church can do about it, read this book. The book, while more insightful than how-to, should give enough hints for practical Christians to start changing our Christian communities into places where the fruit of the Spirit is not just a memory verse, but a way of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really helps!","review":"This is one of the Best ways of learning SAT vocab, or simply vocab for your own personal gain.

However, it's clear that Ms. Michaels didn't spend much time on developing the other characters in this novel, esp. the \\"hero\\", a small-town doctor whose grouchy, graceless demeanor is clearly meant to mask a heart of gold. Ms. Michaels' writing is so clumsy, though, that I found him to be just, well, obnoxious.

I tune theFM van radio to a clear frequency and tune ROADY2 as I move from one city to another but have no luck enjoying good sound.There are days when I get a good signal when parked in my driveway and then on the next several days there is no signal, only noise.I have talked to and emailed XM and have been told that they have no clue what is causing my problems. Yesterday I started the van in the garage and roady2 came on with the best, clear,beautiful music it has ever made.

I've read that other Roady2 users have experienced the same defect.

It's easy to move from car to car and the small antennae was simple to install and never moves from it's spot.

I wasn't impressed but he said they seemed to fit good and they would be fine.So, I washed them. No further problems. He wore them and this is where they got a single star. An hour or two into the day, the legs were stretched out so they resembled regular boxers.While the company I bought these from were very accommodating, I would have had to pay over $10 to ship them back which would not have been worth it.

Please Stay is sung with such emotion it pulls your heart strings.My favourite however is Ain't it Strange, one of the bands own songs.

It is loaded with songs that nuzzle up to popular song styles, with decent production (compared to the 4 track stuff on most of the old albums).That said, Dongs is a brilliant record. Its bound to build Smog (Bill Calahan) a much wider audience, which could upset some long time fans. Still, this album isn't selling the staunchly DIY Calahan out. Quite the contrary. The songs are still insightful and slightly weird. For example, Dress Sexy At My Funeral, the albums second cut. Strange title, hilariously dry song. And that's just the beginning.Dongs is a lot brighter than Red Apple Falls, almost giddy by comparison. I would reccomend this as a starting point for anyone curious about Smog.

They were punk rock pioneers who paved the way for many punk bands out there now. 21 tracks spanning their 12 year career all in chronological order (so you can hear their progression as the years went on, the tracks don't bounce around like other hits collections). Plus, they added a 2 bonus tracks, one studio track and one live track both recorded in 2004, the year they hung it up.The liner notes are amazing as well. An introduction written by Trever Keith and notes from each band member on each track, I found, very interesting and informative. I have followed this band for many, many years and I learned a lot by the notes.Whether you are like myself and own every Face to Face record or not, this CD is a must have.

Well, thankfully the last show was documented .. great set-list, incredible performance, perfect sound, and quality production. A perfect book-end to a fantastic career and a must have for punk fans.

If it had been called Prunes and Candy nobody would have ought the single anyway. There's nothing much to the song or any of these songs for that matter.

Easy to listen to, and but still has the edge that it takes to make a great song.This album shows the talent that most people can't seem to hear. How to pull of a terrific album w/o the usual cliches and mind-numbing blandness.Wozniak dares to be different.

Although their success was fleeting, the albums music is surprisingly refined in a timeless fashion that renders enjoyable listens for me time after time. Sex & Candy is examplary of the remaining songs on the disc- soft, authentic, whimsical and a bit cynical.

I had difficulty giving this away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Textbook","review":"This is one of the worst textbooks that I have ever used. It is just plain poorly written. There is very little organization within the book; sure, there are chapters and section headings, but each paragraph often seems to be completely unrelated to the one before and after it. Whole sentences or thoughts are often repeated within the same section, leaving you confused about what new material you've actually read. It is also poorly edited, with spelling and grammatical errors all over the place. The information in the book seemed rather outdated, and a lot of the \\"concepts\\" were so obvious that I often thought, \\"why am I even reading this?\\" I knew nothing about library management before reading this book, and I still feel like I know nothing about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst written text ever","review":"This is likely the worst written text I have ever had to suffer through. I suspect that our prof felt the same way, as she, thankfully, didn't have much required reading from it.

Case fits well.DISLIKES: Have to remove the case for line-in access.

Before this I had only heard hideaway. The weird thing is if someone gave me this album on a blank disk and had written Albert King on it, I would have believed them. This sounds a lot like Albert King, or course my only exposure to albert king is the excellent compliation album titled Blues Power.

I borrowed it from a friend along with 5 or 6 other CDs (Johnny Winter, etc.) -- and I played this CD much more than the others. I am a big fan of Freddies guitar playing -- but it is the vocals that really captivated me with this album. He does this thing with his voice, it is hard to describe but he seems to hold a note and then increase its volume (any vocalists out there?) -- I had never heard this before and was fascinated by it. I found myself singing along trying to imitate it! Anyway I had an awesome blues-jam guitar lesson immediately after that -- my guitar teacher was blown away.

It feels unfocused, as if Iris were writing a great deal while searching for her real interest in the narrative. The characters are all rather dismal, and she certainly makes quite a gargoyle out of the old man. I don't think I've seen any geriatric case who is quite as hideous as Iris's Bruno. While Bruno certainly stands out in bold hideous relief, the women all seem featureless, but then all women in Iris' novels seem this way.

I heard this piece several years ago on our classical music station here in SLC. I fell in love with it then. It inspired me to travel to Yellowstone which became my most favorite place on earth. This music is one of the greatest treasures I own. It fills the soul the way Yellowstone does. It is an emotional musical portrait that carries one away. Musically, it is subperb, masterful, but not corny. The colors this composer paints with his musical skill is incredible. I give this CD away as presents as much as possible. I will agree with another reviewer, this is one of the finest American pieces written - ever! Play it, let the music carry you into this wonderful place. The beauty and power of this music brings one easily to tears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patchy, but very nice patches","review":"with the album having much in common with the Division Bell (age, musicians, sleeve art etc) i was expecting it to be like the Division Bell, which it isn't, with the obvious exception of Coming Back To Life. When it works it is fabulous, but this only comes in spurts: the guitar solo on Along the Shoreline, Sinead O'Conner on Breakthrough. There are few songs which are classics, yet musicianship and production values often lift them above the ordinary. It is th production that so often marrs the album, though. Night of a Thousand Furry Toys is a horrid with dated dance beats and embarassing lyrics (Wright can't seem to bring himself to sing the chorus). It is a song that seems like a joke , yet the album is entirely without humour, and the album never really recovers from this track. It's only in the less gloomy momens that the album picks up, and these are few and far between. A real mess, whilst still hinting at greatness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mainly for Floyd Fans....","review":"The main reason I got this one is because it was by one of the members of Pink Floyd and I need to keep my collection fairly complete.

If you liked Wet Dream, you should like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing effort from a talented musician","review":"I bought this record on the strength of Wright's 1977 solo album \\"Wet Dream\\" but it does not live up to that standard. This album is very self conscious lyrically and flat musically, even Sinead O'Connor's contribution is below par. I hate to give a negative review of this record but I would recommend listening to it before you buy it.I don't really begrudge the money I spent buying this record since I have got more than two albums worth of enjoyment out of \\"Wet Dream\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only a couple of OK tracks.

Truly a \\"Thelma & Louise\\" story of the brutality of men towards women in Japanese society, the book says even more about the day to day struggles of the \\"every\\" Japanese."},{"rating":"1","title":"A really disgusting read","review":"I am writing this review because Amazon suggested I should buy it, but I have already read most of this book and found it such a disgusting experience that I did not complete it. Unless there is a twist at the end that I missed by quitting, this should not be called a mystery. No mystery involved.I was surprised that the editorial reviews were quite honest about the content and also surprised that the customer ratings are so high. I do not find reading about chopping up bodies to be appealing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only mystery is why anyone liked it!","review":"I bought this book because of all the glowing reviews - but, although well written, it is one of the worst books I ever read.By way of example, the author need only have described a character as incontinent ... I neither needed nor wanted page after page of description about the diapers, stench, etc. Learning how hourly workers on the night shift live and work in Japan was mildly interesting, but not for so many pages - and the plot seemed depressing and contrived. The book was sick, and I can't even imagine liking it. I love mysteries, and read and buy many each year - but this wasn't a mystery; IMHO, the only mystery is why anyone liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"whoa...where did that come from?","review":"This book was enjoyable--the writing was to the point, and often very funny. The author makes a very unlikely story seem natural and totally believable.The ending caught me completely off guard. It felt a little out of sync with the rest of the book, which is why I gave it four stars. But maybe that was the intent, and if so, mission accomplished. I didn't see it coming..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book that Travels Between Dark, and Thought Provoking","review":"If you enjoy detailed murder mysteries that make you think... then this may be a book for you. The author does a good job blending clinical, i.e. descriptive and eerily unemotional murder scenes, with very thought provoking characters. And what's so interesting is you find yourself going back and forth between scenes that should provoke drama yet don't, with the complete opposite just a few pages later (scenes that appear blase, yet which really make you wonder what is going to happen next). Plus the insight into the characters is something you should remember for weeks after reading it.The only flaw I found was some of the chapters seemed overly descriptive and violent. In some cases less would have done much more to keep the book on a more dramatic, and less gruesome level. Still, overall it is a very good book. As a side note, I read this during a trip in Tokyo which made it much more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing and Powerful","review":"I found this book riveting and memorable. I still think about it, months after reading. The perspective on Japan was different than anything I've ever read - a side of Japan I did not know existed. A very dark and disturbing side.The characters were well drawn, the pacing excellent, and the plot extremely clever. The relationships among a group of women who toil in a factory were complex and believable. The book is a fast, gripping read and excellent for airplane reading (don't read before bed - you'll stay up too late to finish it!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating work of psychology","review":"Out is by far one of the most intense books I have read in a long time. Although I am sure much of the subtext is lost in the translation, the story is nevertheless fascinating. The characters and the manner in which they interact together are realistic and compelling. The story demonstrates how seemingly ordinary people get caught up in extraordinary, gruesome circumstances. The psychological themes the author deals with are not for the weak-minded, and many scenes are truly disturbing. Kirino explores many themes in the book, some from a feminist perspective, but not all. I am not familiar with Japanese culture at all and the book was enlightening in many respects. A careful read of this book will yield more about human psychology than any textbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"a dark cringe inducing page turner","review":"a friend recommended this book, noticing that I gravitated towards male authors...something I hadn't given a whole lot of consideration. By twenty pages in, this book had me. I can't say that I've read anything that was able maintain a balance between the grotesque and thought provoking through to the bitter end. I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in literary crime fiction and a tolerance of endings not tidily resolved."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Japanees \\"Desparate Housewives\\"","review":"I will not go into the plot since many others have already. What I will tell you is that Out is a tought thriller that places the lives of ordinary women struggling to get by into a swirling vortex of violence and deception. None of the wives could have imagined, at the outset, the horrible things they would do in the next few fateful weeks.I would recommend this to anyone who loves a good thriller (you'll keep thinking that they are going to be discovered again and again), or is interested in the daily lives of your average japanees housewife, as seen through a funhouse mirror."},{"rating":"1","title":"Either poorly written or poorly translated","review":"I bought this due to the plethora of rave reviews. Boy was I disappointed. While some of the actions reminds one of a Coen Brothers script the book is overly long and at times excruciating boring. It amazes me that anyone would describe this work as well written. there were far too many examples of the narrator blatantly telling us what should have been left ot our own conclusions. In one instance a character with a spending problem is contemplating a purchase of a handbag which leads her to realize that if she makes this purchase she will need to buy shoes. Instead of leading the reader to make their own conclusions the author then spends two additional paragraphs telling us how one need for this character leads to another.Worse still is the ending of the book which has a final and unbelievable twist that is so implausbile you will be tempted to through the book at the wall screaming I suffered through all these pages for this?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the New","review":"A breathtaking novel that, for once, lives up to its hype.

Lunch box production will assume more interest than you thought imaginable. Other activities will, er, bowl you over as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"This is the perfect book for you if you are looking to get hooked in a great story of suspense and excitement. I read this book 3 years ago and I still havent found a suspense/thriller novel that tops this. If you like looking into the workings of different cultures, a scary, thrilling storyline, and pretty much a huge mix of crazy characters and schemes, THIS is the book for you. Read it, you will not be able to put it down and it will become one, if not the one, of your favorite books!!Note on Natsuo Kirino's other books: I have also read Grotesque and Real World by her; they are okay, but OUT is by far the best!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and a bit dull","review":"I had high expectations for this book, which is probably part of the problem. I heard a positive review on NPR of Kirino's more recent book, but I decided to read this one instead based on even stronger reviews here. Unfortunately, I found the book to be dull and predictable. The characters are all some mix of unlikeable and unbelievable, with the female characters tending towards the former, while the male characters are ludicrously worthless or demented. Several of the review snippets printed in the book's cover pages refer to its feminist viewpoint, which should have been my clue that the novelist has an ax to grind. I'm giving it two stars instead of one, because although I came very close to abandoning the book midway, I was sufficiently curious to stick with it to the end. It's not clear that was the right choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Queen of Mystery","review":"I am a HUGE FAN of Kirino Natsuo!! I always thought that it was really sad that I could not share her books with my friends who cannot read Japanese. But hey, here is her book in English! Bravo! Her descriptions of characters and backgrounds are incredibly real and vivid since they are most of the times inspired by the real people on the real problems of Japanese society. Her analysis over those problematic situations is always deep and critical so that it often shocks you by revealing the painful reality and the drama underneath our everyday life. In her books, reality does not byte, but stabs. So, if you are ready to be shocked and stabbed by the undeniable reality, I would recommend her books to you, but if not, you'd better stay away from them because you'll see what you don't want to see. Anyways, I love her books. \\"Gyokuran\\" is actually my favorite book. Hopefully, that one will be translated and brought to American fans soon, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible story; didn't enjoy one part of it","review":"This was one of the worst books I've read in a long time. The theme was just so horrible and the characters not believable. And the ending!!... are you serious? She enjoyed what was happening to her?? Unbelievable."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic read !","review":"As someone who likes my reading to be realistic, this novel has it all and puts the story in a most real life situation. I could not put the book down. The worst feature is the long wait for another novel to come out by this author. For reading entertainment this author is the best I have found.. Jim"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Thriller to Read","review":"Very few books actually keep me up past my bed time, but I had to know what was going to happen next in this book filled with twists and turns at every corner. I had read this book a couple of years ago and although, I don't remember every detail, I do remember it was one of my favorite reads in a long time. I don't remember there being any dull moments, every page had you on your toes and you just never knew what to expect next. I recommend this for anyone who likes books that keep you guessing until the very end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Out: A novel","review":"During the reading of this novel I really wanted to be able to read Japanese. The translation at times confused me with euphimisms that I felt pandered to American expectations regarding this genre of fiction. I admired the protagonist but she unfortunatley fell in love with another. That love is what I found revolving around the central theme... and what makes the author a worthy competitor in the guessing game of looking into the well of human darkness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in translation.","review":"As one who relishes complex, engaging works of fiction which are character-driven and often quirky (such as those of Haruki Murakami), I can only surmise that Kirino's Japanese prose was poorly served by a translator with little gift for writing. The narrative style was far too literal, much more like a cheap detective novel than a work of literary merit. After about 50 pages, I no longer cared for the characters or their impending plight as described in the cover blurbs, and left my copy on the subway for someone else to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steady character study","review":"I enjoyed the rhythm of the book. It gently pulled me into its world and held me secure with its fascinating characters and interesting details. With each page that I turned I wanted to know more. I look forward to enjoying more books by this author in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark, Dark, Dark","review":"This award-winner from Japanese author Kirino is as much a psychological study of the underbelly of Tokyo life as it is a dark and gritty crime novel - and that's to her credit. The story focuses on four women working the night shift in a factory. When one of the women kills her abusive husband in a rage, she seeks help from her co-worker who in turn, must reluctantly involve the other two women as well. In Kirino's expert hands, what unfolds is a fascinating look at these women, each a victim trapped in a bleak life and desperate to get out. Recommended but not for the faint of heart!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"OUT IS IN\\"","review":"Once again I was looking for a novel by a Japanese writer and spied this on the shelf. I had never heard of Natsuo Kirino and how I wish she was more prolific. Not great cover design but covers can be deceiving. This piece of work is nearly flawless and packed with important ideas and critiques: sociology of middle class Japan and Japanese women, femninism, hard boiled crime fiction, mystery; even immigration. The story moves quickly, is very engaging and at the same time it is powerfully grotesque. One cannot believe that these seemingly bitter, unfriendly women come together in conspiracy and perversity. Sometimes I felt disgusted. Think \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\\" written from the perspective of a Japanese feminist. This is far shorter and ultimately a bit cleaner and quicker than her previous novel, GROTESQUE (which is also worth the read)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreams","review":"The alchemist is a book written to persuade everyone to listen to their hearts and chase their dreams.The alchemist believes if you don't listen to your heart, for whatever reason, then you will live your life with constant fear of the unknown and unable to live a fulfilling life. This book is about one young man's journey to realizing his dreams.I would reccommend this book because it can be a very positive influence on the mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Some people love to be preached to and if so then this is your book. i felt the book was boring, and so full of cliches. there was no suspense, you knew everything was going to be just fine for the character because \\"god was on his side\\". please! what a load of crap. this book is not life changing except that i will never get back the time i wasted reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An insightful book.","review":"I bought this book for my brother after reading about a woman whose life changed after she read it. My brother reviews it saying 'With a simple tale it provides great insight into life and our own 'personal legends'. ' He highly recommends it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do not miss the point","review":"One may believe that the world does not exist as a single organism, that everything is coincidental and unrelated. I don't!Man continues to search for common laws to explain all matter. Complexity is one of these studies, whereby all matter, living and non-living, organise into more complex structures to perform complicated tasks. From the complexity of the human eye, the stock exchange and our world to the single cell amoeba organism, all may combine to accomplish common outcomes.What am I going on about? Perhaps these common laws to achieve organisation from chaos will work faster for you with positive energy. Perhaps the unresolved solutions that you desire will be achieved as we organise to reach our personal and group goals.The book emphasises that the search towards your dreams and goals is a most fulfilling journey. If you just receive a simple message to believe in yourself and follow your dreams, the author has succeeded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This book is quite a painful and tedious read; I only finished it because I had a promise to keep. Great many times I was about to stop, but somehow I was foolishly hoping to get to some glorifying, summarizing final redemption. Not a chance. From its very beginning it feels unfocused, vague, messy, sloppy and lost in its own search for meaning. A journey populated with eclectic characters who do not seem to understand their own purpose yet alone significance, a hero who seems to undergo quantum leaps from his shepherd origin to a treasure finder...Kafka claimed a book should be an axe for the frozen sea within us, but this one hardly qualifies as a straw stalk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, sentimental nonsense","review":"This is a book that seems to be everywhere--and it's not necessarily all that new. Yet, any airport bookstore usually has this read included in its select cache. So after seeing it so many times, I decided to give it a read. wow. Talk about juvenile. Perhaps, that is what this is: Juvenile fiction that should be placed with the teenage titles--the Young Adult section, but it's considered serious spiritual fiction. I found it laughable for all the wrong reasons. Cliche upon cliche. I almost winced at certain parts, embarrassed for the author--who is probably not embarrassed at all--as he must be making money hand over fist with such shallow fare. What can I say? Romance fiction sells well,too.If you're looking for pap, pulpy, sugary feel good, gook, this read's for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Follow your dreams","review":"11/01/2005 - I Read this book for the third time this past weekend and LOVED it again. It is a very good book about following your dreams and anyone who enjoys exploring the inner-self. Subjects like destiny and omen are referenced and highly focused, making the reader think about life. There are also many references to the middle-eastern world which makes the book a cultural experience as well. (Le monde Arabe, Andalousie, Spain, etc.) I found Santiago's story very enlightening and would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fable","review":"This is a simple tale, bursting with pearls of wisdom.

Written in a fantasy style, it will motivate you to pursue your dreams no matter how difficult they might seem."},{"rating":"1","title":"trite but short.","review":"Thankfully, this book considers itself a 'fable' and not a novel. It reads much like one of those cliched self help manuals we often see in bargin bins at book stores, full of buzz phrases and meaningless cheery advice. The premise of the story is stolen from a '1001 Arabian Nights' tale and the characters come off more like mouth peices for the author than actual characters, but after all it is just a fable. There are a few plus sides to 'The Alchemest'at least. You don't have to agree with everything the author says, but, if anything, this story will at least get you to think. It's a short read too. It's the type of book I'd recommend only if you have a long bus, train, or plane ride, with little to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"First I read it four years ago, and since then many times.I like simplicity of it and it gives me a lot of inspiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life changing","review":"The Alchemist should be read by everybody that at one point in their life looked at the skyand wondered if there is more to life.

He should also gone back to see his father."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring, brilliant, and amusing!","review":"This book is very inspiring. I was only reading several pages of the introduction part and it already gave me some enlightenment! It's been a long time since I've read a good book like this. Paulo Coelho took us in our imagination to join the adventure of a young boy who was searching of his treasure and Personal Legend, but at the same time, also told us the lessons of life, to pursue what we really want to be, to reach our dreams and to be a person whom God wants us to be. Very inspiring, indeed. :) If you want to find a book that is motivating, this is that kind of book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A BEAUTIFUL and MAGICAL and MEANINGFUL STORY","review":"This is one of those books that you don't want to put down until you have finished it. It captivates you. The story is simple, but it really makes you think about a lot of things going on in your life and also in other's lives. It is very easy to read, but it is a book that you will treasure for the rest of your life once you have read it. One of my all time favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite","review":"I had never heard of this book when I bought it at the airport. After the first fifty pages I was hoping for a \\"Siddhartha\\" but it ended up being a \\"Celestine Prophecy.\\" In other words, instead of simply yet beautifully written and a great piece of literature, it was trite and poorly written with a cheesy new-age plot. Ok for kids but any adult who is a fan should look up Herman Hesse and step it up about 10 levels."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE OF THE WORST BOOKS OF THE CENTURY","review":"This book is so full of clichés that i wont waste time talking about it.

If you are a careful and thoughtful reader who appreciates literary style and creative, artful expression through writing, you'll likely be disappointed with this book--as I was.The writing style is disjointed and hard to follow, although it is written at a jr. high school or high school level. It is truly amazing to me that this person is a best selling author. A real credit to marketing, packaging and understanding the mystery of what will satisfy the hunger of the masses. Who knows, maybe it was just his 'Personal Legend'. After reading this book, I thought even I could do it......To be fair, the author did include some insights (albeit fairly commonplace) towards the end of his story. But I always appreciate being reminded of those kinds of things..and since I spent the time and money, I had to choose to get something out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"insipid nonsense","review":"What a lot of utter overblown empty nonsense. The very story is stolen from a well-known folktale (\\"The Treasure\\"); the characters are mere game pieces with absolutely no intellect or emotion (particularly the woman, who has no qualities except that she is beautiful, which we're supposed to assume is enough --blech!); the only quality of suspense is created by the author's failure to explain anything in ways that can be understood by curious, intelligent, thinking readers; and the writing is just abominably bad! What do people see in this book??? Is there such craving out there for spirituality that this insipid fluff is even acceptable? Please look eslewhere for guidance on life; you'll find it in any novel worth it's paper. I'd give it no stars at all, if Amazon allowed that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much ado about nothing","review":"There is nothing deep or profound about this very simple story.

Half way through I thought, \\"Oh no! Another Jonathan Livingston Seagull!\\" I loathed JLS. I have trouble with books that espouse everything is possible and life doesn't involve compromises and choices. Romantic love is experienced instanteously. Within 5 minutes the main character is ready to commit his entire life to a woman he has just met. She is so detached that she allows him to leave forever while claiming she will love him passionately til her death. Follow your dream and only good things will happen. What pap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The king's invisible clothes syndrome?","review":"After reading all the hype I ploughed through this undemanding little tale searching for the hidden depths.

Try Voltaire's Candide instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure how this is so popular","review":"I honestly don't understand why this book is so popular. It seems like it's been over-hyped that now loving it has become a brand of cool.I didn't love it. I didn't even like it that much. It made me go meh and I kept checking to see how many pages I had left. The main character, Santiago, didn't feel like a real person. He was merely a symbol of the common man who became in touch with his inner feelings and follows his dream. Yep, that's what the plot is about: following your dreams and being in harmony with your feelings and the world. It all just felt like a long anecdote that a motivational speaker in high school would tell.I was bored reading this the entire time.I'm not saying that the lessons aren't good and it's not going to change someone's life and blah, blah, blah. I'm just saying that the simple writing style mirrored an over simplified plot with cardboard cutout characters repeating over and over again some kitschy and cliched \\"inspirational\\" truths."},{"rating":"1","title":"Omens here, omens there, omens everywhere.","review":"In this childish fable our young hero learns to speak with his heart (also with the wind, with the sand, and with the sun), and meets magicians and alchemists, who teach him that if he follows his dream (i.e. his personal legend) then all the world will conspire to help him. Most importantly he learns to read the universal language written in omens that guide him along his way. Books are not really helpful for him; at the beginning he is reading one (and using it as a pillow), but once the quest starts he stops reading altogether. A fellow traveler who reads a lot is subtly made fun of, and is left behind.Well, I see precious little wisdom in all of this. Of course you should follow your dreams, but to believe in omens as a guide, or that if you really want to realize your dream then the world will conspire to help you, is simply nonsense.

The book told of a boy named Santiago, who made his living as a shepard. He was faced with a choice to follow his lifes journey, or to stay with his sheep. I brought in teachings from the bible and also from the koran. It showed many different views on life and how different people decide to choose their life. It gave me fulfillment in reading a book that could actually relate to my life outside of the story.

My instructor, Anthony De Lorenzo gave us because is his favorite book, and we worked on it. I learned how follow the dreams, never stop.

Santiago was always optimist, he never was afraid.I liked this book very much, because I have to learn let my fears, reaching my dreams like Santiago, begin to fly. I believe the dreams come true, if you want do it, if you want follow them. I reached a dream when I came to the USA but I need others dreams come true.\\" There is more time than life\\", says my Grandma, I hope have time enough for my dreams.This book change my life a little bit.

While the main character is attaching, we are let down throughout the book, as time and again the promised pearls of wisdom turn out to be plastic beads. The fact that so many people liked the book, shows how shallow our modern civilzation is becoming. As in the Rosarch psychology test where people interpret meaningless inkspots, The Alchemist was written in such a way as to leave plenty of space for individual imagination to complete the story in the most ideal way."},{"rating":"1","title":"yaaaaaaaaaaawn","review":"this book isn't awful but i'm giving it one star to bring it down to a proper average of 2.5 stars. do real 'fables' contain taglines that declare themselves \\"a fable about ...ing your own ....\\"? i don't think so. what if aesop had titled his work \\"aesop's fables: how to live a happier/healthier/more enlightened life\\"? sounds pretty absurd, doesn't it?this book is just one more on a long list of watery eastern mystical philosophy-meets-western self-improvement books. nothing terribly offensive or interesting here because there is nothing new here either. unless you're the kind of person that doesn't read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply a crap and cheating","review":"Just by using the powerful words like 'Destiny' the author has tried to build up an illusion that it is a philosophical book.

It is highly superstitious and useless for adults. May be used for entertaining small kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"A truly forgettable book","review":"I read this a couple of years ago. I was struck by just how awful it was. Usually I can find some redeeming qualities in any book, but not this one. Seeing this on the \\"best seller\\" list made me have to comment.

I must emphasize the word 'simple', to the point of being simplistic and trite. It almost seems as if the author is targetting this novel to pre-teens when he continually hammers in the same message of 'follow your heart', et al. After reading, in effect, the same message for the 10,000th time one does get a bit tired. However there is an innocence and sweetness permeated through each page which makes the entire reading experience to be most disarming ... but, for this humbug, not quite enlightening.Bottom line: enlightening for some, utterly simplistic for others. This reader found it all to be rather charming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic Stupidity","review":"My book club choose this: it was so bad, I stayed home so I wouldn't hurt the hostess's feelings.

Here it is Christmas Day and I'm waiting to go to the family's for dinner. I'm wishing now I'd bought a thriller or something at least well written. Fortunately I just opened my gifts and my sister sent me a book on dogs. I'm saved. Maybe if I was 17 and just starting out in life \\"The Alchemist\\" might strike a chord. If a person is happy with their life and direction they shouldn't spend the money on this book. It is boring, boring, boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland and unoriginal","review":"I found the book very bland and unoriginal. The plot is similar to old fairy tales, and the ideas are very shallow philosophy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame, lame, lame.","review":"Maybe this book is somehow better read quietly on your own. We heard so many good things about it that we read it as a family. We were rolling on the ground laughing at the lame conversations with the boy, his heart, the wind, etc. If you are seeking good life advice, read Ben Franklin's autobiography and his selected writings. But life is far too short to waste any of it on this silly tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inspired by ancient oriental tales","review":"I read the book of The Alchemist,the story is interesting andinspiring, but sadly, the end is the same of an ancient arab story that I read when I was in elementary school, an arabian fable called \\"The story of two men who dreamed\\", a fable of Arabian Nights.Also, the argentine author Jorge Luis Borges wrotea tale based in that story.I expected for a different and original end of an interesting and a best seller book.I think that the author should give some credit to the surce of his tales."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful journey in pursuit of dreams and knowledge","review":"I read The Alchemist in a single day and was enchanted by the beauty and truth in what was written as well as the immense wisdom incorperated skillfully in the story line. I loved every second of the shepard boys' search for his treasure by the pyramids and his journey through the desert. A wonderful book about seeking your personal destiny, and learning from the quest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Book","review":"Personally, I don't really like this book, Santiago's personal legend is to find treasure and live a happy life. BORING!!! That is not a great personal legend, I think it doesn't really count. I think personal legends would be more like, getting a job you love, and making lots of money with it.I don't think I have a favorite part in this book, but I do have a least favorite. I did not like it when Santiago read the flight of the hawks. People should not know what is to come in the future, it could devastate them forever, until the thing happened. They would always be thinking about it. I have read many hundreds of books, and this would not be a book that I would recommend to people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aida Osmani","review":"This book is one of my top three favorites.

Its universal message tells readers to follow their dreams, their Personal Legend. I read this book for the first time years ago and read it again recently.

Paulo Coelho is one of the most talented story tellers in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite and Cumbersome","review":"I'm a modern spiritual person. I read, I meditate, even chant. But I listened to this unabridged book during lunch breaks, and kept thinking how shallow and repetitious it is.

Maybe the original Spanish is more artful, but it came off like a cartoon on the Christian channel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The simple truth about us and ourselves","review":"The one and only thing I was reminded while reading it was that I should never stop talking with my heart. Never to stop writing down my night dreams. Always hear what I want and go for it.

This universal character of the book comes from its abstract side dressed with a story of someone in the search of a tresor. This book applies to every person since all what it says relates to the human nature. No wonder it was translated to many languages and made the bestseller in many countries. It's a wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"ARE YOU READY TO BE INSPIRED?","review":"this book is so fantastic,it conspired to help me reinvent myself.PLEASE read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything but The Girl","review":"This is a nice little read and will be right up your street if you are a fan of Jonathan Livingston Seagull. I was, however, put off by the shallow characters, in particular Fatima. While her lover is busy following his destiny of travel and adventure, her lot is to content herself with household chores on a desert oasis while awaiting his return. As we are repeatedly told, this is her fate as a desert woman and she is only too pleased to live a life in waiting. I don't find this inspirational in the least and I would not pass this book to my 10 year old niece even if it is within her reading ability. Nor would I be keen for any young boys to get a hold of this lest they come to the conclusion that it is the role of all young women to simply sit around for their white knights. Sure it's a cute story - but one that is trite and somewhat thoughtless."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pleasant read...","review":"This is a nice story of a young boy in search of his dream, unfortunately the author attempts to throw in alot of fluff, or attempts at serious omens and symbols, trying to create a sense of a deeper meaning than can really be had. Nonetheless still a fair story for inspiration."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Alchemist Is NOT Gold","review":"I was excited about reading The Alchemist since I had heard so much about Coelho's book. What a dismal, simplistic disappointment. The quest that Santiago follows is shallow and ethnocentric. This was not a quest for spiritual guidance, this was a male chauvinistic and Christian-based journey with flat characters sprouting cliches and meaningless mumbo jumbo.I wonder, why in the 21st Century is it only men who seek spirituallity and why are women to stay home and wait for their men? Why does the revelation sound more like a kid taking his first communion than the acquisition of spiritual enlightenment? Why is this poorly written book so esteemed?If you want to read a short, worthless novel, feel free to choose The Alchemist. The book will not disappoint you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Excuse for a Writer","review":"As a professor of literature - and I may add a constant student of this wonderful world -I must say that the Alchemist's contribution to the literary world is NONE. The amount of readers who have read this book is absurd. This shows - alarmingly - how people don't have even a basic critical thought and are poorly read. I even read it in portuguese - which I'm fluent - and it didn't improve my opinion of the \\"novel\\".Ps. Spanish and Portuguese are my mother tongue, English is just my second language so I apologize in advance for any mistakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"sanctimonious platitude, simplistic parable","review":"Imagine Joel Osteen trying to be Hermann Hesse, and you will have a fairly good concept of this novel.Whatever in this book is not sanctimonious platitude is simplistic parable. Read Siddhartha instead - Hesse understood suffering, as opposed to Coelho, who denies its existence:\\"My heart is afraid that it will have to suffer,\\" the boy told the alchemist one night as they looked up at the moonless sky. \\"Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams.\\"That this gibberish is presented with an error of tenses - it should read \\"...has ever suffered when it [has gone]...\\" just sums it all up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many answers, too few questions","review":"I almost wish I could give a zero here, but I recognize that the ideas of the author have probably impacted people in ways that were positive for them and for the people around them, while not harming anyone. Compared to many other ideas with a wide dissemination, this is actually pretty good. Now, this said, I could not even bring myself to finish the book. The writing has a complete lack of subtleness, and consists of just one grandiloquent fallacy after another, with an unnecessary use of absolute language. There is a serious lack of questioning or criticism, and a similar excess of earnestness."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Wish it. Want it. Do it.\\"","review":"I read this book after hearing countless reviews about its amazing and even life-changing qualities. However, what I found between the covers was nothing more than a poorly constructed plot with highly superficial characters, and buckets of dime-store philosophy and \\"wisdom\\" dumped over the top.lines of wisdom include such commonsense bull as: \\"if you want something in life, do it.\\" (paraphrasing)In all it seemed like Brian's joke book, on Family Guy, \\"Wish it.

Easily one of the worst books I've ever read.Not only did I find the writing juvenile (it was worse than simplistic), I felt that the author weakly disguised his New Age beliefs behind a psuedo-Christian front. He is welcome to believe what he wants, but I hated that he attempted to disguise those beliefs as something else in order to reach more people (at least, that was my take).Yes, I realize that this is supposed to be a \\"personal journey\\" book; however, I think that \\"find the truth within yourself\\" stuff is just nonsense.Save your money.

THE ALCHEMIST is a very simple tale but so full of wisdom, you can't read it but once. If you're looking for just any story, this is not for you. If you're on a personal quest towards spiritual growth, then make sure you have this on your shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get the praise for this book","review":"It is a easy read with a somewhat interesting story. That's about as much as I can say for the good of it. The whole thing is basically built around the idea that if you think positive thoughts and really try hard, then the universe or God or fate or some kind of generic force will help make sure you get it. Personally, I think that is a really dumb idea (I'm all for religious belief, just not for the pop psychology positivism that people call spirituality these days).Even if you are in to that, I would image there are books out there with more compelling stories worked in. You'd be better off spending your time reading something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"All hype and no substance","review":"My review goes against the grain,but here it is...DO NOT BUY this book. If you went by all the hyperbole about this story changing lives,then that's humbug. No such thing happened to me. It's in fact an insipid fairy tale written in terrible prose,that is simply really bad literature. That would have been forgivable if the story had had some substance,but it doesn't. Sure,many people you know would recommend this book,so go ahead and read it by all means,but don't waste your money by buying it. Read it from somewhere else before you buy. This book isn't even suitable for children as a bed-time story. How it became an international bestseller is beyond me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple.

All the ideas are carefully explained in a four-page prologue, which makes the book itself redundant. I read on and on, waiting for a revelation, but nothing happened. The writing style was so unbearably didactic that it might as well have been one of those horrible self-help books which seem to be so en vogue these days. Nice try at creating a new classic, but this book is really just a fad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Please!","review":"It is hard to imagine that a book this shallow could become a best seller. With the wealth of fine, complex and challenging books one could read to spark contemplation about one's life path, why would any adult choose this one? I forced myself to finish it out of loyalty to my book club, but like several others we've been \\"conned\\" into reading by clueless reviewers (The Five People You Meet in Heaven, the Four Agreements) it is at its core a quick buck book. Apparently, if you repackage any simple truism you heard from Grandma in the nursery, you can rake in many dollars from the gullible.

It's entertaining and provides interesting views on life that are worth pondering and discussing, but overall it struck me more as a spirituality/self-help book than a novel. And as with the few books I've read in this genre, like the Celestine Prophecy, I was left feeling I'd missed most of the metaphors and hidden messages within its pages. But I'm not particularly good at reading books that require analysis - I read for escapism and entertainment and I like rushing through the rollercoaster ride that most novels provide. So I'm probably not the most qualified person to review The Alchemist - but it is critically acclaimed and has apparently resonated with many readers around the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was traveling at the same time I was reading","review":"I'm not gonna talk about the book sorry, It's changed my life for one month, and forever like a human being, I used to read the newspaper when I went to my work by bus and subway all mornings and afternoons however when I began to read this book I teletransported myself to the place that the novel has ocurred, were a magic moments every morning and afternoon I was happy because I knew that I had this book to read, I changed my way to see the life now I'm following the light and beginning to encourage myself in any sense in order to achieve my Personal Legend that I don't want to talk about it.

Unfortunately, however, it wasn't as good as I anticipated. The book is an allegory about a boy-Shepherd who is on a search for his \\"personal legend\\" in the desert. On his way he meets an assortment of people, including an alchemist, who help him on his journey to find his destiny. The concept of the story is interesting and there are a few touching and inspiring bits, but other than that, I found it cheesy and a little too heavy on the religion."},{"rating":"2","title":"I had good things happen to me the very next day!!","review":"I read this book coz of all the reviews...and am surpised that it was not all that fascinating.

However, I must point out that I have done so in Spanish, which closely resembles Portugese, Coelho's native language. Out of curiosity I began to read The Alchemist in its English translation and found it to be too sachrine and at times even dull. Needlsess to say, I did't get very far into the English version before putting it down.If at all possible, I'd recomend to those who can to read The Alchemist in Spanish (a sophisticated knowledge of the Spanish language is not necesary; the vocabulary is quite simple). The two-star rating refers to the English translation: Otherwise, this book would easily earn five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"This is probably one of the most hyped-up books history. It's neither inspiring nor entertaining. Language of the World, Soul of the World, Omen, Destiny that's all what you get to read - repeatedly.

First, the author couldn't even just have a plot being about following one's dream, calling, etc; it had to be one's \\"Personal Legend\\" (complete with initial caps). Second, the metaphysics doesn't have anything that one couldn't get from Obi-Wan Kenobi's take on the Force. Third, the characters are one-dimensional. One doesn't get the sense of the shepherd being driven by something, despite the fact that his leaving the seminary in order to herd sheep is motivated by wanderlust. Finally, the plot itself is contrived at many points. For example, the idea of a former seminary student and shepherd making a success of himself as a merchant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Cup of Tea","review":"This is a very simple story about Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who dreams of a treasure under the Egyptian pyramids.

Along the way, he learns spiritual lessons from an Algerian shopkeeper, an English scholar, and finally the eponymous alchemist.I am a fan of deep, complicated characters, and this book has none (AT ALL). It's like a self-help book turned into a story, and I'm sure many people will find it deeply moving...... until the next fad comes along.

The Alchemist book taught me that if we want something or have a dream we could do everything that we want. Sometimes we need to make decisions of the things we like more and sometimes it is hard to decide, but we need to take the challenges and confront all the problems that could happen. We need to do the impossible to realize our true dream. Sometimes we find things that take us far from our goal but we need to have the courage to do things that seem impossible for us to achieve, because when we think that we are near our goal things appear to destruct us and we feel like trash.If we persist to achieve a goal or a dream we need to make an effort or sacrifice to realize our dream. What I learned in this book is that we could achieve anything we want as long as we are alive and we have God's blessing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Searching.....","review":"When you are told of a book that may harbour lights for your heart & give feelings of inspiration that answers are close by, I couldn't wait to read this book.

He pursued his life goal legend in traveling and learning, but he was still naive to the fact that there was going to be hindrances during his journey.

There is nothing in this book that is good. Paulo Coelho's lack of writing skills is appalling. He cannot write a single sentence without making the most basic grammar errors. Probably he is much more readable in other languages than in Portuguese because the translators certainly should correct all such errors. Coelho's lack of talent is so shocking as his common-place sentences and images that he tries to evoke... If he was writing a mystery novel, he would start like:\\"one dark, raining night...\\".Paulo Coelho is a poser, and in my mind, only people who never put their hands in a good book can appreciate his complete nonsense.

It turns out it's all about hype. This is not literature; it's a string of trite self-improvement bromides.Of all the gushy blurbs on the cover, the most outrageous is the one that compares it to Voltaire's Candide. It may be a story about a quest, but there the similarity ends. Lovers of Candide should imagine that book, stripped of all its nuance and narrative richness, and populated by stick figures who ponderously (and repetitively!) intone Big Thoughts. And in the end, those thoughts wind up being nothing more than that this IS the best of all possible worlds, in which anyone with pluck and determination can go to El Dorado, become fabulously rich, and then head back to Westphalia, secure in the knowledge that Cunegonde will be waiting faithfully. Some may find this fluff uplifting, but I'm going back to Voltaire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Overpraised Nonsense","review":"This is one of the most ridiculous books I've ever read. I only picked it up to see what all the fuss was about. It turns out that it's not about much. Coelho fancies himself as a Hemingway of sorts, using simple language rather than being unnecessarily verbose. But he ends up doing something more like Hemingway's pal Fitzgerald, getting really bogged-down in exposition without advancing the story.What really confuses me is how they are going to make this into a film. However they manage to do it, I hope they make it better than the book. It simply can't be much duller or worse.And Julia Roberts really hasn't read much if she considers this her favorite book.What You Should Stick To Instead:The Old Man and the Sea (by far the best novella dealing with spiritual awakening)The Living (Pascale Kramer)The Sibyl (Par Lagerkvist)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The alchemy of ignorance","review":"I am totally impressed by how easily a poor writer such as Coelho is given such praise. His worldwide aclaimed success is one of the worst books I have ever had the displeasure to read. The only motive I had to go to the second page is that my opinion was asked by the person who gave it to me. I read it in the original language in which it was written, i.e., Portuguese, and I find it poorly written, both in shape and in content, if there is any at all. Coelho repetitiveness is annoying and his pretenseis bitter and hard to swallow. It is not uncommon that his subject matter would, at the end of a millennium lacking criticism in all areas, find success. I worry about the level of education our future generations will meet, if not tought now what good literature is. The only trip I can associate with The Alchemist is its trip to my trask can."},{"rating":"1","title":"spiritual hogwash","review":"I was expecting more from this book. Unfortunately, it did not deliver. The author borrows heavily from earlier writings, showing little in the way of true originality or creativity. His ideas seem simplistic and shallow (e.g., Personal Legend), while the repetetiveness of certain words like \\"omen\\" and phrases (e.g., Language of the World)are laughable. Worse, he seems to believe that \\"when a person really desires something, all the universe conspires to help him get it.\\" What nonsense! On the plus side the story was somewhat interesting. However, the central ideas are simply not seminal and to be perfectly blunt, the book seemed amateurish.If you are looking for a great spiritual book written by a true master, read Journey to Ixtland by Carlos Castenda. His other books are almost as good. Hermann Hesse is another terrific writer with something important and original to say.Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Move on","review":"I had heard that this book was a really good read, but I had to struggle through it.

This is an old story told long ago with the same themes in children's fairy tails. I gave it to my 10 year old son who liked it but did not love it.

It was a waste of my time and a lot of paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't relate...","review":"This book was hard to follow for me. Perhaps because his quest was typically male (boyish) and as a woman I found it hard to imagine that young men are that two-dimensional. To think that fullfillment of a dream must be a journey taken alone... Santiago makes nothing happen on his journey. In his quest,things only happen to him, not because of him. Santiago gains insight-big deal. One reviewer from Santa Clara wrote \\"I am a self professed evangelist of the book since I've read it. Absolutely love it's lessons without the \\"preachy\\" feel, and love the fact that the situations are those which every one of us can relate to - though all may not recognize them as they happen to us.\\" I read the book because of that review...I wish I could get together with this person and discuss that. Lessons learned in the Alchemist are learned on stand-bye, they are not learned from experience. That's no way to grow in life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insidiously insipid","review":"Though prettied up in an appealingly innocuous package, this story of a young boy's journey to find his \\"treasure\\" is a rather insidious form of propaganda for a particular and particularly inimical point of view. The New Age myth of the personal dream which must be pursued in order to fulfill one's destiny is custom-made to instill dissatisfaction in the average person trying to find joy and fulfillment in life's every-day normality. The risk of such an approach is that those foolish enough to follow it without extreme caution may well abandon those things which will indeed give true happiness in favor of the pursuit of some pipedream which never will. The fragile psyche will be particularly vulnerable to such influence. We make a grave mistake if we believe that literature cannot be such a powerful force; it can be and is.

It is one of the better pieces I have read concerning the interrelation of God, luck, omens, coincidence, destiny, and one's part ina ll this.

For example it talks about evolution over millions of years, then talks about man being created on the sixth day of creation. It talks about heaven, but then mentions previous lives. Then you get Allah as the way to heaven, then the Son of God (Jesus). It refers to animistic spirituality as well!

What is supposed to be a philosophical journey of self-discovery is better described as a trite, overly simplistic, and predictable waste of time.

He came off to me as two-dimensional and, really, quite boring. None of the events made me sit up in my chair and make me want to read faster: it flowed, yes, but, very, very monotonously and on occasion tediously.There were many intelligent metaphors and inspirational messages about life, but I did not hear anything new.The Alchemist is not a bad book.

I think the biggest problem I had with this book is that it is a modern attempt at an ancient style. What makes fables and ancient text appealing to me is the connectedness I feel with people and places that are centuries old.

The next night, I finished the alchemist and was pretty disgusted to find that the conclusion was nothing but an exact rip off of the legend. This book's supposed to be a stand-out, and as such you expect quality and moreso, *originality* throughout. Overall its probably a reasonably good read, but in the end I feel completely cheated by such a blatant piece of plagarism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading this book is truly a waste of time","review":"This was one of the most boring books I have ever read in my entire life. The story, in its entirety, could have been told in about 4 pages. Instead, the author repeats himself over and over and over again so that he is sure that the reader understands the importance of following his or her dreams. This book lacks any sophistication whatsoever and is more of the children's book than anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I read this book recently, and have to say it is the most boring, dull and confusing book i have ever read. True, you should chase and reach your dreams, but must they be found in such a uninspirational and dull way? There are some interesting concepts but they are also equally confusing. Due to the mass hype and praise of this book, i read it a second time - hoping to grasp something i missed...but i just felt bored and wished i hadnt spent valuable time of my life reading this...maybe this is a revolutionary book for some but i just didn't like or believe in the unrealistic and often at times ridiculous storyline"},{"rating":"1","title":"High on the cheese factor","review":"I found this short book disappointing. Although it was at times suspenseful, and there were some insightful moments, it was quite heavy-handed and condescending. The writing (a translation of course) is repetitive and feels like it was destined for someone who doesn't speak English very well. There are few characters, and they are not very well developed. If you like modern stories that don't preach or mention destiny, love, and courage every other paragraph, this book isn't for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything that happens is for the best (LOL)","review":"It should be illegal to sell this book without including a copy of Voltaire's Candide.Candide: Or Optimism (Penguin Classics)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Search for Treasure in this Book","review":"This book was absolutely delightful. It's a fast, easy read that still has substance. It left me feeling uplifted, with its simple message told elegantly and well. Coelho seems to have a talent for squeezing big ideas into a simple story, a boy searching for treasure. The mystical elements are handled deftly, and the reader never trips over complex or cumbersome mythology, but instead glides happily along to the end with the hero. The alchemist of the title could be the character of the same name or it could be the boy, but I think it is the author, with his lovely, eloquent prose that speaks volumes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wondrous journey","review":"The alchemist by Paulo Coelho is a refreshing lapse into the way stories used to be told. A boy, a dream of treasure and a journey, it is perhaps the oldest of tales, but Coelho makes it all fresh and new by highlighting the simple, but important things that many of us have long forgotten. How long since we first had our own dreams of going out into the big world and making things happen? Coelho brings it all back with his brilliant, insightful storytelling. While on his journey, Santiago learns about new and different people as well as foreign places and in doing so he learns even more about himself and the type man he wants to become. Though it is just another version of an ancient tale, it is told simply and for the most part lyrically and so well that the author has crafted it into something special and memorable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful....breathtaking","review":"There's nothing like a good, simple book that contains all the messages of life in a language all can understand. I first picked up the Alchemist because it happened to be the only book in my library that I haven't read. From the amazing prologue to the surprising ending, the author's beautiful way of writing kept my eyes glued to the page. Sometimes simplicity is more meaningful than all the adjectives and metaphors in the world.So in conclusion, the Alchemist was a wonderful and breathtaking novel that I recommend to anyone who can read! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A true gem among books","review":"This book is a true gem.

When she explained the book to me, my first reaction was another \\"pretend philosophical\\" book. Since she spoke of it so hightly, I bought it any way. The book does not treat you like a listener but more of an observer of events. It does not compel you to self analyze or gives you the secret to life or death but makes you think.I like the book because it stays with you. Parts of it jump at you as one goes about eating, sleeping, brushing, finding truth and earning money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"After reading all the great reviews I thought this book might be engaging/interesting/enlightening. Boy was I wrong. After reading on and on and on about all these strange terms I was expecting some type of revelation or meaning to present itself; but instead, it was a frustrating and pointless read. A major play of words without any real substance.In addition, the story itself was boring and juvenile with no development of the characters (I had no picture of who they were and did not care what happened to them).I can't comprehend anyone who's read other books giving this 5 stars.The other one star reviews are right on..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh... Not My Type Of Book","review":"I first read The Alchemist as a teenager and disliked it and now having read it again (with inhibitions) in my twenties still dislike it. A minimalistic story (without the pleasure of reading other minimalist authors) outlining a boy's quest from Spain to the Pyramids and back again. Mixed in with alchemy, universal languages, souls, omens, and above all else fate - the overriding theme is to follow your dreams, etc. Nearly every noun is a symbol of something else and the overall idea of the book put me in mind of Tuesdays With Morrie or The Secret; that is, a single idea story loosely veiled behind the suggestion of a story. If you're looking for something less metaphysical/religious to read or simply another book with (some) similar qualities I suggest The Higher Power of Lucky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I picked up The Alchemist because it looked like the kind of \\"makes you think\\" book I enjoy. Besides it's perpetual place on best sellers lists, I was intrigued by the book's name and synopsis. A classic case of judging a book by its cover. Much to my dismay, The Alchemist was hardly the kind of reading material I expected. Far from intriguing, the book was terrible. If you'd like a full blown account of its foibles, check out some of the other reviews. Suffice it to say, the universe and life do not work as easily and as magically as Coehlo's fable insists. The Alchemist provides an easy and uplifting answer for humanly existence - it oversimplifies what it means to live, to succeed, and to fail. No wonder the general public finds something so worthwhile in its message. It strives to reach those who prefer the easy answer over the right one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple answers for a fulfilling life","review":"It would be all too easy to shoot this book down because it's not overly intellectual- the story is a simple one, told simply. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. Here, simple works, as Coelho strips away the all-too-human tendency to over-analyze human motivation and purpose, showing us instead that we don't have to tie ourselves in philosophical knots to achieve genuine fulfillment. Rather than a Rube Goldberg approach to life, sometimes the simple truths are the right ones by virtue of their simplicity. The trick is to realize that complexity is not always superior, that affairs of the heart are not always served better by our intellectual abilities. And as Coelho's simple fable shows, that realization can be difficult to obtain, but is worth pursuing for the happiness that results. There's another enjoyable fable called An Audience for Einstein that explores similar ideas in a different way. I would recommend both for everyone school age through adult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting","review":"I dont get what the deal is with this book. I read it in one sitting. The author repeats himself over and over again, the plot line is simplistic, the characters boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not for everyone","review":"I think this may be the most polarizing book of all time; it seems like everyone gave it either one star or five. When I was 22 (15 years ago) I read \\"The Celestine Prophecy\\", enjoyed it, and thought a lot about it afterwards. Today I can't believe the younger me got sucked in to such spirtubabble....so something much have changed in me during that time. Did I become jaded and cynical as I got older, or just wiser and more mature?The point is, while I absolutely hated the Alchemist, finding it incredibly boring and staggeringly cheesy, I can't help but wonder if I would have liked it in 1992. But if you are like me (today) and tend to roll your eyes and say \\"oh please\\" when you read about someone speaking to the sun and turning himself into the wind, then definitely save your money and more importantly, your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite","review":"Masquerades as profound, but actually exceptionally trite.Peddles a dangerous & confused stew of sappy mysticism.To be avoided at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get it","review":"I think it's me. I mean a lot of my friends have this book and they just adore it. I thought it was senseless, idiotic and most of all, boring. I think it is not only a waste of time to read it but a waste of ink."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its a parable, understand that before buying","review":"I bought this books with some expectations, so I was disappointed. I should have looked that its listed under, mysticism and self help. I was looking for a great story. I assumed it was fantasy. But this is about as simple and shallow as a story gets. No depth whatsoever to characters. The story is quite simple, know what is your true dream and follow it. If you do that life will help you along.The story advocates listening to your heart, because it speaks to us, and gives us guidance. Often when we fail its because we did not listen to our hearts. To underscore the truthfulness of this, my heart was saying \\"Stop reading! This is Dull!!!\\" but I did not listen and pretty much had to push through this book, suffering all the way.That said it gives a nice message, although unbelievably simple and personally I feel it should be a childrens book. I figure someone looking for some guidance or inspiration in their lives might get more out of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get rich quick scheme","review":"I've read a lot of negative reviews about how shallow and childish this book is. But, the worst part for me wasn't just that the boy was following his dream, but that it wasn't even his dream. It was \\"interpreted\\" for him and sold to him by every character he encountered. This is just like a typical get rich quick scheme except but in real life, there isn't really a chest full of gold at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I have my two hours back?","review":"The other 200 one star reviews provide all the adjectives necessary(\\"aggresively awful\\" is my personal favorite). I will just try to find it in my heart to forgive the person who recommended this (add preferred adjective here) book to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little room for imagination","review":"A shepherd boy named Santiago travels from his homeland Andalusia to the Pyramids of Giza to achieve his dreams (or, as the author puts it, his \\"Personal Legend\\"). Along the way he faces difficulties, overcomes them, and acquires the ability to speak the \\"Language of the World\\" (the ability to communicate with sentient beings of the world). As a modern day fable, the book possesses neither the compendious quality of R. Bach's \\"Jonathan Livingston Seagull\\" nor the warmth and imagination of Saint-Exupery's \\"The Little Prince.\\" The indicative mood employed by the author leaves readers with almost no space for imagination. It comes to me as a surprise that this book has been such a hit. Perhaps we are all ears when it comes to fables."},{"rating":"2","title":"just as described","review":"product was just as described, shipped prompty, and was in great condition. would recommend seller, and will use again. thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thing I've read in ages!","review":"This is a quick read and made me thing about the choices I make.

I was mesmerized as I read each page. This is a story that makes you think about what you want in life. I've always been one who believes there are signs that help guide you in the direction you should or should not go. How we, as individuals, interpret those signs is another matter. My only complaint is that I didn't discover and read this book many years ago. I read a library copy of The Alchemist, but will most certainly purchase a copy that I can keep and read again. Thank goodness Paulo Coelho wrote so many books. It will be a grand journey reading them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant","review":"This is not only a book...not only a beautiful story, but more than that, it is the manifestation of a universal dream, written in the language of a poet.

Paulo Coelho tells a thought provoking tale of the inspiration story of the Sheppard boy. The way that Coelho crafts details, imagery, and ideas is amazing.

I look forward to reading more of his works."},{"rating":"2","title":"First time I read it, hated it-now, I love it!","review":"I am an avid reader. I love both old and modern classics. This book was recommended to me by someone and I couldn't even finish it. I hated it. The simplistic writing style was unexpected and insulting. Years later, I came across the book again and reread it. This time I had no expectations for it and I was prepared for the fact that it is a simple fable. It is now one of my favorite books. It is easy to get caught up in the great complexity of life. This book is a reminder that deep wisdom can be obtained from simple lessons. This book is also a reminder that we all have a purpose even when our journey seems pointless. The book had to be simply and ineloquently written, that's the point! You don't have to possess great intellect to fulfill your purpose and find happiness in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"One for the shelf","review":"The AlchemistJust started reading this book and wondering why I missed it for such a long time.Mark certain paragraphs in the book and keep in in your bookshelf.Remember to read them through the years.

Its central theme is that we all have a role that we have come to fulfill,our \\"personal legend\\" and that recognizing it and following its path leads to happiness.However we may agree with its premise, many have found inspiration in its pages. The novel promps us to look further and identify what it is that we want out of life, somewhat along the lines of a quest or a pilgrimage. We glean from the story that for some the outcome brings fulfillment, and yet for others the gain is found in the process and the journey becomes the goal."},{"rating":"2","title":"An inspirational book about the journey of life","review":"Paulo Coehlo is an excellent author who takes his readers on a spiritual journey.

Everyone would take something different from the book. It depends on their view of the world and people. It is a good read. It is simple writing and a smaller book. Its full of big information. The characters are not very deep since the book is smaller. The characters can make you smile though. Its a change from the normal psychology books I read. I have taken a few lessons from the book.

Very simple in style and form, The Alchemist hammers home the power of patience, persistence, and positive thinking. It is a bit overwhelming and preachy at times, particularly in the mid-section, and the journey from Al Faiyum to the Pyramids seems to take forever.

Sorry, but unless the author and I are in the same place in our minds, I just don't know what he is talking about and he didn't give me enough information to figure it out. Enough of these mystic books already. It'll probably be made into another bad movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Candy coated Pop Philosophy","review":"While to the uninitiated this book might seem inspiring, it is in fact largely a rip off of various world religious/spritual view points packaged up in a moderately inspired story. The writing is fairly weak by literary standards. The book reads more like a self-help manual with little to no evocative description or creative imagery inspiring you to truly care or identify with the characters. The lessons are rather simple. Follow your dreams, don't let other people tell you you'll fail, listen to your heart, blah blah blah. Hallmark cards and Dr. Phil spin the same cleanly packaged inspirational messages.Like most hippy influenced new-age religion, in the end you get to have your cake and eat it too. Santiago gets the gold, the girl, and Paulo Coelho gets your money. Rather ironic don't you think?Read Siddhartha instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fairy tale with a philosophical touch!","review":"The alchemist is as casual or as profound a read as you want it to be. The book has a very 'Arabian Nights' tale feel to it. The story is simple but inspiring.The cover of the book is exotic and the water colour illustrations in the book are DREAMY and BEAUTIFUL!The book reminds us and encourages us to follow our dreams.However, I think that a little bit of the book is lost in translation. The writing is a little unimpressive... but over all a good read especially during those lazy summer afternoons."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Little Prince\\" for Dummies","review":"I hated this book. If you've ever saw only the beginning of a movie, and already knew how it ended, this books reminds you strongly of that. I know that it is a fairy tale, but the unrealistic circumstances that surround this boy's life are at times ridiculous, and even disheartening when you think of real life situations. People, save your money and check out the Little Prince instead. All the important things to learn in life are in that book, and as opposed to The Alchemist, it is not ego-centric. It really bothers me when people equate The Alchemist to the Little Prince.

Well, let me tell you - I was disappointed. First of all I felt like the author was assuming I (the reader) was incredibly stupid. Otherwise, I really don't know why he kept repeating himself. In my opinion, the one idea the book does have, could have been easily summarized into 2 to 3 pages. At most.Second of all, I think this book hasn't a single original thought in it. People have been writing about one's dreams, his abilty to do anything if he believes, the goodness of human being etc. since for-ever. The only thing Coelho did is: he recycled.And last but not least, think a minute to yourself and answer this question: Does the idea of a boy traveller in search of meaning remind of anything? I have one name for you: The Little Prince (and really, if you want to go with the \\"real stuff\\" read The Prince and don't waste your time with this silly book)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple or Simplistic?","review":"I understand that this book is meant to be read as a fable, but if that is the case, why does the author insist on spelling everything out for the reader on virtually every single page? Every step of Santiago's journey is so painfully obvious, this feels more like a self-help book with a \\"plot\\" thrown on top than a fully thought out novel. Yes, it does contain some basic truths, but that does not make for good reading. Furthermore, unless one is completely un-self-aware, one probably has an idea of what some of these truths are in the first place. But I suppose that's why it's so popular - people caught up in the rat race pick this book up and are convinced they've \\"seen the light.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"from a student","review":"The best of all Coelho's serie (including Veronika)I'm a 20 years old psychology student.I loved the way it's written, and the way the message is said"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Alchemist","review":"This is a book's story is really nice.

I don't care if it's a fable, it was written as if it was meant for third-graders. I also have a problem with material wealth being the coveted reward for spiritual awakening. The book is also sexist, the only female being a cipher who waits patiently for her man to complete his quest, apparently with no dreams of her own. The main character is completely self-absorbed, concerned only with achieving wealth and getting the girl of his dreams. At the end of his quest, where is the reunion with his family? They are never mentioned again. Weird. I think it would fit on the shelf nicely between The Secret and The Law of Attraction."},{"rating":"1","title":"simplistic and pompous","review":"How can a book be both simplistic and pretentious? This book does it. Another thing, repetitious. For instance, I wanted to scream each time I read, \\"men/women of the desert.\\" I know it's a fable, but I have a problem when a person speaks to inanimate objects (such as wind, sun, heart) and actually gets a dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why all the hype?","review":"Having just finished The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho, I must say that it certainly did not live up to my expectations. Probably those who most enjoy this simple story were not influenced by all the hype and therefore did not expect as much out of this book as I did. Having let down my high expectations, I was left wondering why it took Coelho 167 pages to say that we should all follow dreams, no matter what obstacles stand in our way. While I commend Coelho for wanting to convey this message, I just don't believe The Alchemist was the best avenue in doing so. In summary, the simplistic tone and bare-bones message of the book makes it a quick read that would be more applicable for a teenager than for adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nap time reading","review":"I began this book looking for a fast, short read and hoping that they hype was true - the book offered a fascinating insight to the reader. At first, I was pleased with the simple writing - it read like a bed time story - I looked forward to the culmination of the almost rambling tale. By 100 pages in, I no longer cared if this book held the secret to life - it was BORING!!!! The quaint, simplistic style became insultingly childlike and the rambling became a chaotic assortment of characters who in themselves were uninteresting and almost annoying. I shelved a lousey 160 page book without finishing it and I have no qualms about it. All this book did for me was to make me tired of the entire notion of the meaning of life and sick of characters who are too ignorant to find a happy path through life without it being spelled out for them by total strangers. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Danger ** Beware of Foreign Translations","review":"The Alchemist is a great book originally written in Portugese. Looking for a third party bargain as a gift, I wound up with a copy marked \\"For sale only on the Indian sub-continent\\". The translation was meant for a different culture and missed many of the nuances of the western/Amercian/English translation. It was terrible. I couldn't give that as a gift and returned it and bought the full priced edition to be sure that I received the American version."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of 150 pages","review":"I love inspirational, motivational books, but this was one of the worst books I have ever read.The author beats a dead horse talking about having a Personal Legend- as if reading it once every chapter isn't enough, we sometimes have to read about it several times in several pages.The story has no flow, and was honestly difficult for me to read- I was expecting to zip thru this book in about 2 hours & instead it took me about 3 painful days to force myself to finish it to find out what wonderful things everyone was talking about....I guess I learned that if my dream was to write a book- I certainly could. If this guy can sell 26 million copies so can I - that must be the lesson I got out of reading this piece of junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read - thought provoking!","review":"This book was recommended to me by a business colleague and I bought it to be able to tell him that I'd read it. Boy, was he right on! This is a great book for our times - helps us be forward thinking about our real purpose, being authentic, and the impact of our decisions.

Everyone that I know who has read the book shares my enthusiasm, so it is of no suprise that the book holds the 'cult' status that it does worldwide. BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple, ridicilously simple and being such - nonsens.","review":"Paulo Coelho needs a reality wake up call. Life is not that simple. I wish it was but it isn't.Two words - wishful thinking. If you are still under the spell of all the new age wishful thinking with little critical thinking - this book is for you, if not - stay away.Even if looked from the viewpoint of mysticism, spirituality or religion - this book is not only nothing new in terms of ideas, but a huge simplification of their meaning.If you find this book appealing, i suggest pick up a intro to philosophy book, you will learn more from 1 page then from 10 books of Paul Coelho."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good all around book","review":"When I began reading this book, I believed it to be to simple and preachy, but after thinking about it, I realized that it was a little deeper than I had first believed.

It's concise and enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"I had high hopes for this book, based on it's popularity, I guess. Or perhaps I'd seen so many references to it that it had wormed its way into my subconscious. I had some misgivings when I read the jacket cover, but I thought, shucks, millions of adoring Earthlings can't be wrong, right?Well, I should have listened to that little voice inside me (perhaps that was my own \\"heart\\" talking to me, which I ignored to my chagrin). What a bunch of pseudo-religious poppy-cock! I've been more \\"moved\\" by some of the patently false urban legends circulating on the internet.As one reviewer suggested, perhaps the translator is to blame.

I found the book to be like many other stories I have read in that it is written in a simple format with a \\"this is the morale of the story\\" type of ending. I was rather unimpressed and frankly don't understand all the hype this book has generated. The writing style was not particularly riveting either, probably because it was translated from Portuguese into a basic form of English so some of the meaning may have been lost. The story is inspiring, positive and has a good message overall, but so do so many other books that are better written..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alchemist Cooks Up an Interesting Tale","review":"I would agree with other reviews that the Alchemist is more parable than novel. This is the story of a shepard boy, Santiago's search for his Personal Legend as an allegory for the rest of us to break free from our daily routines and begin searching for our treasures. Paulo Coelho uses a common literary device to end this story (I won't spoil it for you). This is a fun vacation book but bring other books with you. This one is a fast read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read 1001 Arabian Nights","review":"I tend to stay away from books that are pushed on the masses. I am not a snob. It is just that my reading sensibilities tend to run counter to the populace. On some ocassions my literary taste meshes with what the world seems to like. \\"The Alchemist\\" was not that book for me. The whole time I was reading it I had a feeling that I had read the story before. It wasn't until I got to the end did I realize that I had. It is one of many stories in 1001 Arabian Nights. That telling is short, sweet and much more powerful. Coelho drags the story out thereby losing much of the poignancy. Brevity is often the better choice when telling a story. Compare the two tellings of the story and you will agree.

I was forced to read it for an activity I am reading, and the minute I read a few paragraphs, my heart sank. I knew I had to continue on with this book, in order to teach it.

The fable of a boy who is not afraid to follow his dream, it inspires us to pay more attention to the world around us, and learn to see and hear in a more open way.

I read this book because my girlfriend bought it for me as a gift. I have to say that it is the worst gift I have ever received.

I can't believe it received so many bad reviews. Clearly the much of the book consists of METAPHORS and are not meant to be taken literally. I loved the fact that the book was so simple. Its so refreshingly different from so many other overly verbose books. It reminded me of the Little Prince for those reasons.Pretty much everything that happened in the book has happened to me in some form.

Seek your personal legend, be the best you can be, don't be afraid to take chances and enjoy the ride good or bad , in your quest in life. This beautifully simply written book is not fitting or worthy of disparaging remarks. I was given this book to read with love and in turn gave it to someone I love to read. The circle is complete for now until someone else is given this exqusite book of truths that carry a powerful message to read. Recommended for seekers of truth and light but not for those who drink haterade."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand the accolades","review":"I was really looking forward to read this book having heard so much about it. I was utterly disappointed. Quite honestly, I am puzzled how this book earned such rave reviews (\\"will change your life\\" etc.). The book is simplistic, naive, cute maybe. It reminded me of the time when my mother read stories to me when I was a little kid. I would rate it with zero stars if I could. The book is thin and you can read it easily within two days or one if you got the time.

It is an awesome book, partly because or its simplicity but also because of the relevance of its content. I would recommend it to all"},{"rating":"1","title":"too simple","review":"i agree with some of the other reviewers who have been disappointed with this book. it was recommended to me as a life-changer. while sweet and magical, it is the kind of book i would perhaps read to my child (if i had one) at bedtime. it is a fairy tale. there is nothing wrong with that in and of itself. however, it lacks substance. for example, it may say (and i'm paraphrasing) that \\"over time the boy learned to listen to his heart\\". how? what happened? another reviewer mentioned that he never makes mistakes and this is true. the boy always seems to have revelations at just the right time and never has to learn from mistakes, only realizes the truth before it is needed. coelho leaves out all the meaty bits. it almost seems like a summary of itself. like the cliff notes for a very good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Profoundly insipid","review":"Profoundly vapid, insipid, merit-less, pseudo-spiritual tripe. If Cinderella is your idea of a good read, this will appeal to you. Could have been written in the time it takes to read. Next to this, the Harry Potter series merits a Nobel.

Like a bad classics comic without the nice drawings."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it...","review":"I saw all the great reviews and the title sounded interesting so I decided to purchase this book. There have been only two or three books in my life that I had to drag myself through, and this is one of them.Sure, the message is inspirational and all that, but the writing is so simplistic that it teeters on childlike. Coelho is repetitive and it really seems as though he is writing for a 10-year-old. This is not great literature; this is a self-help book masquerading as literature for people who don't seem to realize that they have no concept of what makes a good novel. I would give this novel to a pre-teen or a person who has never willingly read a quality book in their life.Maybe I'm naive or sheltered, but I am amazed by the amount of people who are so flabbergasted about the whole \\"following your dreams\\" thing.

It took me a long time to get through The Alchemist because I found the rhythm of the writing to be flat. Yes, the over all message was good, but it could of been summed up in the form of a proverb. I don't understand the hype of this book. I've read better stories for spiritual enlightenment, and metaphysical intrigue, this was just a drag. It's a shame too, because I was so excited to read it, being such a fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too preachy.","review":"This book is an absolute bore. I fell asleep every time I tried to read it. I had to read it for school. I can't stand the way the author goes on and on and on and on about things like Personal Legends, the Language of the World, and God of the desert and whatnot. It's a crappy book.

I choked my way through it because I felt obligated to fully understand the depth of its failure. It is grandiose in its attempt to be profoundly simple, like a pompous man at a coffee shop who talks loudly about his own generosity.There's nothing wrong with people who find inspiration here, but this book unequivocally shallow and twee.

Granted, it is an eloquent tale about following your 'Personal Legend,' but does every single theme have to be spelled out in caps so I'm getting hit on the head constantly? Does the message of the book have to be repeated every two pages? And why does the tale turn from a boy following his dreams to a philosophical spiel? This is \\"literature\\" for dummies. Even though Coehlo said in an interview he writes for adults, this is just a packaged tale of magical realism to coat a fluffy tale that everyone already knows. Don't waste your time.

Agreed that our hero found the thing at last but it was pure coincidence and not a fruit of his effort. In reality chasing for the meaning of a stupid dream is not going to take anyone anywhere. Justification of strong belief in intuition was the second thing I didn't like. The hero did risk his life in just because he had an intuition that the oasis will be attacked. And worse that the circumstances if the story justifies that whatever he did was correct. This book is full of such non-realistic craps.This book may be good for time pass but please do not get inspired by this story and start behaving like a crazy person (the hero of the story)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I read the other reviews before I wrote this, and thought that many of them were very judgemental (especially the one made the assumptiom that \\"a personal legend is more like getting a good job and earning lots of money).To me, everyone's personal legend (dream) will be different, and that is what this book teaches. It teaches that you should follow your heart and your dreams, and you will be fulfilled and happy. It is light and easy reading (which is personally why I really liked it). It got me away from those tedious mundane 1000 page novels with words that not even the most educated person would understand.If you're looking for a literary masterpeice, this is not it. But on the same note - it is what it is - fun, easy and a great filler if you have a spare few hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spelled Out","review":"I found the book too preachy.

I packed it for a flight, thinking it would help me kill a little bit of time, but once I started reading, I didn't put the book down and finished it in a few hours. It's a suspenseful story, and I was constantly wondering what would happen next. It is not too complicated, but you get attached to some of the characters.

If you are ready to think deeply about everyday things and how they become magically intertwined to help us live our best lives, grab this book. Its people, places, and situations are mysticly familiar, stimulating, and motivating. Get ready, you're going to the Oasis! You're going to speak to the wind! And you are going to believe that anything can be turn into pure gold!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting","review":"I was absolutely taken with this story after reading just the first page. It scoops you up and takes you for a literary journey that you didn't know you needed. Not only was this a fabulous story that brought to mind Antoine de Saint Exupery's The Little Prince, but also a refreshing reminder to never give up on your dreams. Read this story if you ever need encouragement =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple Story","review":"I haven't quite finished this book yet but I have to be honest and admit I'm not loving it. The basic message seems to be a good one: \\"If you listen to your heart and follow your dreams the universe will help you to achieve them. In the face of obstacles have faith that everything will be okay.\\" To put a different slant on it though one review I just read pointed out that this book, in its celebration of rampant individualism can actually be compared to Atlas Shrugged. It's a very apt comparison.The writing is very simplistic with the same message being repeated over and over again. This book got such a huge build up and I was expecting something special but it didn't pull me in. Personally I prefer something a little more challenging that raises questions instead of claiming to have the answers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book","review":"This book is well worth your time to read.

In an era where we employ cellular phones and computers; the internet and television; all modes of technoligical innovation, it is very easy to get caught up in our lives, forgetting that these things are intended to give us more time, not less.

Its the best book I've ever read, and I'm planning on reading it over and over every few months just to keep the inspiring story in my head. Its short, about 200 pages, but the perfect material for anyone in their teens. I'm 18, and I recommend this book to so many people. I rarely ever read books, this being the 3rd book I've read on my own, and I plan on reading more by Paulo Coelho. Thanks for reading this.

The characters were one-dimensional, the dialogue inane, the plot both dull and choppy. I was expecting, at the least, some coherent and consistent philosophy behind the events in the story: as to the nature of personal destiny, the order of the universe, the existence and/or workings of true magic, SOMETHING! But instead, it read as if different authors had written various chapters without even consulting one another - the whole thing didn't really make much sense at all. Abysmal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sugar for the misguided/confused masses","review":"Good grief...was this not one of the most simple minded books ever conceived.

Simply mindless dribble...But do read it to see how gullible people can be while seeking false and confused prophets to guide their less than remarkable lives.

First of all, either this is a dreadful translation, or this author writes in a very simple minded, grade school level. Second, I am astounded by the accolade this book has received, given that it is not but a whole lot of hooey and hokey mumbo jumbo with a touch of religeousity and trendy spirituality that is so in vogue right now.

A week ago, I decided to see what all the fuss was about. I was shocked. The writing is completely devoid of wit, elegance, or anything remotely inspiring. Any aspiring writer in junior high armed with a stack of Hallmark cards can create this, whether or not the student has any genuine writing talent at all. The lines in the story were relentlessly corny, growing ever more cloying and insufferable with each page turned. There are no new nuggets of wisdom to be found here,only a new syrupy way to convey the old ones. I desperately wanted to stop reading before I was halfway through, but felt that I needed to finish the story to credibly give it a bad review. Hands down, this is one of the worst books I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bit trite and overly played-out","review":"i dove into this book with high expectations (perhaps this was my mistake), and after giving the book a chance for several chapters, all i could think was: maybe if i spoke portuguese this would be a better book.i tired very quickly from the repeated \\"theme\\" and message of the book, which dragged on page after page. had it not been such an easy to read writing style i would have given up on it before finishing.in hind-site, it's easy to extract the main and key plot points/moments, and they do stick-out as being fun--however, these points could have very easily been wrapped up in a third of the space, or perhaps ever approached in an illustrated children's book and been much more appealing.i would never tell anyone this book was not worth reading, but to me, it's certainly not worth the hype--the english translation anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"Absolutely terrible book. the \\"message\\" was obvious. i was expecting something more after reading the reviews. the author repeats the SAME phrases over and over throughout the entire book .

Most of whom have never read neither literature or philosophy, as I assume this passes for both if you've never cracked a book. Here's the spoiler: CARPE DIEM. Seize the day. I guess this watered-down new age bunk flies with the trustafarian crowd, but it strikes me as juvenile. It takes this guy over one hundred pages to say that, and who knows how much money he's made off of this well-dressed self-help book. CARPE DIEM. There. Hopefully I've saved you a couple of hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Breath of Fresh Air in a Weary -Worn World","review":"It will be hard to read another book again without reflecting on The Alchemist. Its simplicity is profound, its writing extraordinary.This book is a must read for high school students, college students, professionals who are ever tempted to forsake a God-given life's dream, Karma, destiny, or spiritual inspiration that keeps one always striving forward to a goal or goals. I believe that each person who reads The Alchemist will identify something of themself. Thank you, Paulo Coelho for your wisdom and talent.After reading The Alchemist, I had the privilege of reading Lisa Rogak'sUnauthorized Biography of Dan Brown, The Man Behind the DA Vinci Code, and all I could think about was the shepherd boy in Mr. Coelho's book. Dan Brown is the quintessential modern day, shepherd boy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading","review":"I highly recommend this book.

A healty attitude towards life is rigourosly drug threw a mire of close-minded fatalistic views.

However, it will be a big hit I'm sure with emotionally unstable spiritualists who took a wrong turn at the crossroads of religion.Paulo Coelho must have smoked more hookas than his characters. This book spans the spectrum of \\"GAG ME WITH A SPOON writing\\" as the main character \\"listens to his heart\\", \\"talks to the desert\\", \\"becomes the wind\\", \\"understands the soul of the world\\".....and achieves countless other feats that even Jesus Christ would envy.If you like Ouija boards, believe in fate, or think that spiritual healers can slap you on the head and make cancer go away, then you might like this book. You might also need a therapist."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Personal Legend is there","review":"I learnt from this book that one should believe in himself and what he really wants to do. The author called it \\"La Legende Personnelle\\" or the personal legend. Paulo encourages each one to follow through the legend, which he wants to make true until he actually makes it real. Paulo highlights the power of using nature in order to reach what we want. Melting in the nature and using it to serve our needs requires a lot of self assurance and contemplation. Alchemy, in the material sense, is turning sand into gold, while in the spiritual sense, is using one's confidence and power to reach whatever he wants to do. For instance, one can become a storm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap.","review":"I agree with another reviewer: Quasi-religious, pseudo-inspirational seriously inane drivel. How can it possibly have so many 5 star ratings?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quasi-religious, psuedo-inspirational seriously inane drivel","review":"Contrived. Pretentious. Juvenile. That's just the introduction, in which the author discusses his amazement at the popularity this book has gained. It is equally astonishing for any reader who is able to endure more than five pages of: \\"The Soul of the World spoke to the Heart of the Boy as he prayed to the God of the Dessert who commanded the Spirit of the Wind...\\" I found myself praying to the God of Literature that the boy's beloved sheep would stampeded and trample him to death, sparing me from the Demons of Boredom. If you liked the Celestine Prophecy you'll love The Alchemist. You can read it while you're waiting for the mothership to return. Otherwise, take a pass and read something more intellectually engaging, like the tax code."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliched, sexist fiddle-faddle","review":"I read this book to find out what all the fuss was about. What followed was sour disappointment.Storyline: No more sophisticated than those shortened bible stories for five-year olds.Style: I have read microwave oven instructions with more literary flair.Characterization: Flat, lifeless \\"characters\\", distinguishable only through phrases like \\"the boy\\", \\"the girl\\", or \\"the Englishman\\".Tone: Preachy and patronizing to the point of being irritating.Message: \\"Follow your dreams\\". How deep, and original.Further Peeve: Coelho encourages men to follow their dreams, while a woman's destiny is to await her man (\\"She never asked you to stay because a woman of the desert knows that she must await her man\\" - p. 126). This is not taken out of context. Throughout the book, the whole \\"follow your dreams\\" motto is limited to male protagonists.Don't be duped by the 'warm fuzzy feeling' Coelho tries to leave you with. This book is as deep as a puddle.(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A New Age Con, Pseudo-Literature for Ignorant Non-Readers.","review":"I read 'The Alchemist' just to satisfy my curiosity about a book that has been translated to dozens of languages and has captivated its readers the world over.I found it to be a disastrously contrived, poorly crafted 'fable', the lowest comon denominator of many boring fables. It is a New Age con aimed at masses of insecure and unsophisticated globalized readers, a low attempt to extract a formula out of the truely inspirational 'The Little Prince', pepper it with 'spiritual' mumbo-jumbo and sell the result for profit to consumers who are supposed to be looking for 'transcendence, meaning and inspiration'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beating a Dead Horse","review":"At the risk of sounding like a killjoy, why has this book gone as far as it has? I consider myself a fairly spiritual person and I resented being lectured to--heck, beaten over the head with the Soul of the World. Perhaps this is a by-product of our secular existence, this grasping for anything, no matter how badly written. Jonathan Livingston Seagull and The Celestine Prophecy come to mind. The Alchemist is frustrating to readers who like a good story with their platitudes. One would do better to go back to the original Arabian Nights. There's also more to be learned there. One star for intent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly bad.","review":"I think this book must have been written for ten year olds. The language and prose, (or the lack thereof), employed was so basic and stultfyingly simple, it bored me to tears. I couldn't get through more than half of it and that took me a great deal of effort. It was like reading Dr Seuss only not fun. I was only trying to read it because a friend had given it to me for Christmas. Are we supposed to believe in this character? Gets robbed of everything, but still, look on the bright side eh? I read about ten books a month, all fiction and mostly great but I just couldn't grasp the crassness of this novel. It reads like a Michael Jackson lyric - 'Let's all just hold hands and the world will be a better place' or what....ever. This one needs a minus star rating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Reading!","review":"Paulo Coelho books beside being cheap reading and not a great literary work they sound the same and feel the same.

After reading the others reviews here I decided to take the advice of one reader from Brazil and I bought a book by Viktor Frankl and compared it with the Coelho's one. Well, to be honest, the Coelho's book seems to be a little bit naive compared with the Frankl's. Viktor Frankl had been in a really ordeal experience and he really knows what he's talking about. Although Paulo Coelho's books are a little fancy, I still think they are a nice reading to pass the time.(but I really can't see how it can change someone's life)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing you don't know, all that cannot be done","review":"A poor copy of an Arabian Nights story, this book pretends to show how to follow your inner self in a quest of self discovery.

I was not disappointed at the recommendation and I can see why people love this book so much. Based on \\"The Alchemist\\", I feel that Coelho is a wonderful storyteller that creates vivid imagery and delves in some profound spiritual and philosophical topics while using very simple language. I really appreciated that aspect of the writing. Overall, the story helps you put your life in perspective in regards to the choices you make, finding your true calling, and pursuing the things in life that you are truly passionate about. Definitely a good read when you think you could use a fresh look at your life and goals and what you are doing to progress."},{"rating":"2","title":"A treasure","review":"I consider myself an avid reader, having read and loved Crime and Punishment, Metamorphosis and The Catcher in the Rye. (Three books I saw compared to this book in a review) This book is very special. I have read here that it was written for those who don't have a brain or don't know how to think. Clearly that isn't the case. This is a book that forces you to think and feel it deeply and apply it to your own life, otherwise, it will mean nothing. The lessons taught in it coincide with my religious beliefs (Mormonism) and strengthen them, giving me a different way to look at what I have believed all my life. The language is very simple, because the message here does not require anything more. This book is not for people who go to movies just for the special effects. Those who are willing to think with their HEART, SPIRIT as well as their MIND will find this book a priceless treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"If there were ever a story that has changed a life . . .","review":"I can scarcely think of another story that has been so instrumental in changing my life (or at least my outlook on it). Coelho's gift of portraying an elabrate vision with simple, elegant imagery provides a literally refreshing immersion into a story that would at once appeal to both the amateur and well-versed reader. The story Follows Santiago, an Andalusian Shepherd boy on a journey to to find his personal legend. By far the most inspiring and uplifting story I have yet to read, and most certainly one of Coelho's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book, so many beautiful quotes!!!","review":"I loved this book.

Paulo Coelho gives his readers hope about the lives they want/dream to live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep those spirits up","review":"Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist is pretty short: just 167 pages long. Some might be annoyed by the simplistic prose or the straightforward plot. But the message in this story is what's important. It gives a positive attitude as it expresses the true meaning of perseverance when following dreams. But the book is not perfect. Aside from the simplistic writing style, there are several moments in which the story slows down a bit. The typical \\"show, don't tell\\" rule is broken occasionally, though it's not too painful to experience. And a more elaborate back-story for some of the characters would have been nice additions.I'd say that The Alchemist is a very good book to read if you're in the need to cheer yourself up. It should be given credit for being a \\"feel-good\\" story. There are plenty of flaws, but in the end, the book is fine for what it is.Grade: 7.6 out of 10"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Alchemist Inspired Me","review":"The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho is my favorite book.

However, I dragged myself through this book- continually telling myself there would be a light at the end of this bland and uninteresting tunnel. There wasn't. The writing style was childish and confusing. The characters were shallow and dull. The entire message of the book can be found in any He-Man or Smurfs cartoon episode of the late '80's.

As the alchemist himself says; \\"when you really want something to happen, the whole universe conspires so that your wish comes true\\". This is the core of the novel's philosophy and a motif that echoes behind Coelho's writing all through \\"The Alchemist\\". Coelho also suggests that those who do not have the courage to follow their \\"Personal Myth\\", are doomed to a life of emptiness, misery, and un-fulfillment. Fear of failure seems to be the greatest obstacle to happiness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"This book is an easy and fast read.

Personally, I will find it difficult to forget. Not to say that it is \\"elegant\\" literature: it isn't, and the story is poorly told most of the time. The good thing about Coehlo is that he stands aside and should stand aside, while his fable remains at center stage.

The world does not conspire to hand you things because you feel they are your destiny. The only way you achieve your dreams is through hard work.

I highly recommend reading this book to those who enjoy very delightful and possitive novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"everyone should read this book","review":"Paulo Coehlo wonderfully entices the reader into the world of Santiago, the boy who is on his quest to find his personal legend.

Dependant on where you are in your life, if you're where you want to be, on the way to getting there, or there and just want to read about someone else's journey, read this book!

Somehow people like the lure of something for nothing, thinking that if they just keep thinking of what they want that they'll get it, or the universe will provide it. You can be thrown in solitary confinement and if you sit there all day thinking of what you want, guess what, it's not coming. So this book is not real life and you can't expect to will your way into what you want, instead you have to work for it and you need some luck on your side.The book does have some good quotes but that's about it. As a whole it's poorly written with no character development and a lot of religious mishmash that doesn't really add to that \\"The Secret\\" \\"revelation\\" the author wants to provide but instead just wants to leave readers with lower intellect thinking they read something profound."},{"rating":"2","title":"The teaching about life.","review":"I think the Alchemist book was great.It thought me alot off stuf about life. And I think the good thing about it is that he traveled too so many places.And in every place he learned something new. He had his goods and bad moments during his search for his treasure. Tis book change many of my decisions in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"soul's inspiration","review":"I have read this book and it has been a big help to focus on my achievements. The Alchemist taught me that, we do not have to give up in this life. The Alchemist tells you how to find your spirit, and the most wonderful things, are around you and they are free. There is no doubt that PAULO COELHO the writter has such great feelings to describe failure and success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Infantile, stupid, presumptuous and a total waste of time. Absolute BS.","review":"I can't believe this BS had such an amazing success. It seems the world is in a serious hunger for c...p.Infantile ideas...but that would actually cause injustice to kids' stories. Presumptuous. Pompous.But... in an extremely simple language written for 3-4 years old. Allegedly metaphorically spoken. Supposedly explaining to us (the idiots who have purchased the book) the greater powers of the universe...God, the sun, the wind, the desert and a boy that masters them all... duh...NOT reading it - would actually guarantee you'll have a better understanding of the universe, life, love and ... everything in between.A TOTAL waste of time. Pure BS coated with sugary metaphysics. I would use hasher words but Amazon would not publish them."},{"rating":"1","title":"When you try to tell it all...","review":"...you tell nothing important, but in a slow manner. The reason why it takes so long time not to get anything, must be the reason why so many people are dazzeled about his naivite, simplicity and understanding of life. Read this book if you are not fond of reading, it might proppell your reading skills enough to read books worth reading, but often more cumbersome. Or read it if you are into the \\"alternative way\\" of life. Eg. its good to be good , it's bad to be sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly simplistic, but still rings true at times","review":"This book is pretty much what it says it is: a fable about following your dream. Coelho pretty much repeats this over and over and over in this book. At times, it can be pretty trite stuff...beware of sappy words like \\"Personal Legend,\\" \\"Soul of the World,\\" and other new-agey kind of stuff. So all that aside, the book was short and to the point, it can be read in one sitting, which is nice, considering that there really is very little plot. And at times Coelho does write a sentence that really does ring true to life and the choices a person makes. I think this book would be most appropriate as a high school graduation gift. If you're like me, 25, and pretty much not at a turning point, it will just seem trite."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mystical tale","review":"A fable that attributes much of what happens to \\"fate\\" and belief in a supreme being. Not bothering to search for reasons or causes of events. It is a mystical fairy tale. Such books perpetuate ignorance and blind faith in an unknown spirit. It does not compare to phisophical books such as THE PROPHET by Kahlil Gibran."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big deal about this book???","review":"A badly written (I had the displeasure of reading it in Portuguese) cheap philosophy for those who like easy readable books for the beach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, did you know, you must Pursue your Dream!","review":"In a world filled with unbearable realities, may be it is natural that so many readers find this sort of magical realism refreshing and mistake it for wisdom.

It's a quick, fluffy read.If you don't agree that following your heart is the way to go, then unless you have a sociological interest in finding out why on earth this book has sold in the millions and what people read to feel better about life, then do all you can to avoid this sentimental, incoherent, cotton-candy pabulum.It worries me to know how many people have bought and read and loved and felt inspired by this book. We obviously live in a world of evasion and denial, and a world where we are hungry for permission to do as we like, instead of as we ought to."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least it's a fast read","review":"A fast read because it contained almost nothing worth thinking about and the writing was boring.

It's about destiny, courage, following your heart, and forging your own path. It makes an excellent gift.I like the audio version in particular because the narration is excellent.

Very much in the tradition of Kahlil Gilbran and James Redfield, The Alchemist appears to be a simple read with silly self-help dogmas like Personal Legend's and Universal Language's. Yet, as much as you may feel \\"deep philosophy\\" is being thrown at you in each line, the story is delightful and it's ending - the unexpected obvious. A quick read that will rejuvenate your faith in the joy of being alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Portrait of Questing","review":"This fantasy helped me see my direction in life more clearly.

Usually, I have a pretty open mind to books. Though, this book was a disappointment. The same message is repeated over and over in a quite 1 demensional character. The actions of this book are very predicatble and flat. The message or moral used in this book is a classic, yet it shrivels in this text. It seems the author intended to only promote one major theme in this book, which becomes tiring. I do not recommend this book to those who thirst for action, romance, morals, or excitement. I don't understand the praises the book receives. The only reason I didn't terminate my studying is because this book is required."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Literature","review":"When I finally read this book (after so many of my friends telling me how great it is), I was disappointed: it is nothing but cheap literature with cheap philosophy. I understood, however, why so many people enjoyed it. It's because it speaks about finding your own way in life and avoiding failure. And everybody loved \\"The Alchemist\\" because they would have wanted to be like the boy in the book who finds his way and succeeds in life. Unfortunately, most people didn't succeed in life. However, they like to imagine how it would have been if they would have succeeded and that's why they loved \\"The Alchemist\\". I believe that a person who succeeded in life knows that things aren't as simple as Coelho says they are. And such a person knows the difference between cheap literature and real books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to see here, move along ...","review":"I found this book to be similiar to the Castaneda series or even Celestine Prophecy. It is more simplistic than both (Yes, even more simplistic than the Celestine Prophecy), but I suppose if one needed a light read to remind you of what you already know, it might be worth picking up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Novocaine for the soul","review":"Reading this book is like eating circus peanuts, it's chewy, sweet, and contains no calories. The Alchemist is completely devoid of substance and it's \\"deep message\\" is laughable. If you really want to develop a personal philosophy, don't read this nonsense, find some real philosophical and religious texts. On the other hand, if you want a rosy, fluffy affirmation of the belief that \\"everyone's dreams come true!,\\" this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I bought this book while on a short cruise because it 1.) was short, 2.) looked to be a quick read, and 3.) was about Spain. The book did what I bought it for - kept my mind occupied for those times during the cruise when I wasn't doing anything.The story was predictable at best and the characters undeveloped. I didn't really care what happened to Santiago, the lead character. The story was trying too hard to be some big inspirational block-buster, but it just falls short of the mark.If you are looking for a quick read to occupy your mind, this book might fill the bill. If you are looking for a well-written piece of literature, then look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually worse than Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"This book uses child-like prose to write an overly simplistic allegory that manages to drown itself in a teaspoon of water. Lousy from beginning to end it adds no insight, offers no imaginative writing, and is completely worthless.Many people recommended this book to me, and for that I am saddened about humanity. This book is definitely not for people who enjoy even a modicum of intellectual stimulation. If you are one of those that likes this sort of book, please do not recommend it to others. I am now scornful of many of my acquaintances because of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book in amazing condition for amazing price","review":"I got this hardcover gift edition for only $11 and it is in brand new condition.

It will change how you view your life and your journey and destiny. A MUST READ! Great purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Follow Your Personal Legend","review":"Author Paulo Coelho wrote this magnificent and simple story of a boy and his dreams. His night time dreams and his life time dreams. The boy has a dream that there lies a great treasure at the Pyramids in Egypt. After meeting with an elusive king, he sets on his journey to find not only his treasure, but to fulfill his Personal Legend. Wonderfully told, witty and inspiring. I felt I knew the character, the boy in his travels and understood his trials as well as the people he came in contact with. Coelho has written the classic story of the hero leaving his homeland to understand the world he lives in, on a spiritual adventure. This book was given to me as a gift from two close friends, and this book reminded me of the simplicity in life and appreciating each moment that comes to us, and treating each of those moments as an omen - to be fully aware that this moment in indeed a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad it is short","review":"I really hated this book. It was written like a biblical parable, with an interweaving of christian, jewish, and muslim mysticism/traditions. Utter nonsensical babble.

I'm just glad it was very short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too religious and superstitious","review":"The flow of the story is not organized. I think.the book is intended or the religous mind.

The title of this review essentially summarizes this work. While reading it, I couldn't shake the image of a church-basement bookclub discussion - but despite numerous direct and indirect spiritual and religious references, the message here is not one of love and brotherhood. Rather, it's best stated as \\"get yours\\". Of all the 'Personal Legends' (Alchemist's silly label for your life's goal) around which to center the story, the one chosen for the hero is 'find some buried treasure'. And how do we determine what OUR life's goal is? Well, in this case a 'king' magically appears to the hero to dictate it.Simple, simple-minded, and utterly disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I had been looking forward to reading the Alchemist for a long time. When I finally got around to reading it I must say it was a terrible disappointment. While I appreciate the simplicity of the story and the message it conveys, I just think this book was, for lack of a better word, cheesy. The writing is bad, often overwrought with sappiness and unnecessary capitalization of Important Concepts. The characters are unidimensional and the whole motivation for the boys journey is unconvincing. And it just doesn't work. There were some interesting bits, but not enough to carry the book. If you would like to read some better books of a similar ilk, try \\"Siddhartha\\" by Herman Hesse or the Chinese folk novel \\"Monkey\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointed","review":"After reading raving reviews and noticing record sales I decided to read the book. To make a long story short I was utterly disappointed. The author's fable about the boy \\"Santiago\\" is poorly written. I felt like I was reading a book by somone who had just completed a crash course in Philosophy 101. What the author does well is keeping things simple. I guess that's what people love about this book. He does point out obvious things, and maybe once in a while we love to be spoonfed."},{"rating":"2","title":"God's words","review":"The Alchemist reminds me of God's words. Matthew 6:21 \\"For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also\\". Finding our treasure on earth is hard, but finding our treasure in heaven is easy, that is to live with God's words. I have such a review maybe because I'm a Christian..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fortune Cookie Slips...","review":"I agree with other reviews which found this book 'simple'. Although the book itself makes a point of showing that keeping things simple is good practice.The book is apparently an international best-seller that came out in '88 and has been read by people over and over again and ... changed their lives. I read THE ALCHEMIST as recommended by a friend. While reading, I was building up to that feeling of change at several places in the book, but it passed quickly.The book is simply full of short, sharp lessons on achieving your dreams, learning from everything you experience, stopping and taking the time to actually study every bit of the world around you.Personally - I think the CHRONICLES OF NARNIA (yes, all seven books) by C.S. Lewis achieves the same journey in a much better fashion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evocative","review":"With simple prose, Paulo Coelho, provides us with a morality tale as timeless as \\"Everyman,\\" and as contemporary as \\"Forrest Gump.\\" However, like all morality tales, what you get out of the story will depend greatly upon who you are when you enter into the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book suitable for adults","review":"This is not a book suitable for adults or adolescents. The same wisdom you can 'discover' in mother goose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stale Fortune Cookie","review":"Reading this book was akin to being trapped in a stale fortune cookie for several days. The message in this book is worthy of a bad Hallmark card not a novella. There is no sense of place, no characterization, and no real spiritual depth. Readers shouldn't waste their time with this tripe. Read the real stuff instead: Hesse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two words:","review":"Skip it.Unless you want your characters to be caricatures, your literary techniques abused, and your symbolism heavy-handed.

After I saw it for half price I decided it was the time. I was excited to read what could be one of the best books I ever had. I expected this because the book has tremendous hype. The truth is that I wish I would have loved it, but I found it boring, empty, and repetitious; so I found myself speeding through it just to get it over with. The book has maybe 3 exciting spots that last at most 2 pages out of 165 pages.Many of the things the book tries to teach are things that any person with what the book calls a \\"Personal Legend\\" can derive for themselves, from just living. The metaphors are empty, and repetitious. I found myself rolling my eyes every time I read a corny metaphor.If you have an analytic mind I wouldn't recommend reading this. This book is meant for people who live life on solely a spiritual level, and believe in life's signals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"This book was highly recommended by a couple of friends and I had high expectations, especially with the teasers on the covers of the book. I was open to being inspired and I was just really not into it. Elixirs and legends are not my cup of tea. I think the overall idea was nice, but, I couldn't relate to it. I found myself skipping whole sections and skimming towards the end. At times I was able to understand and empathize with Santiago, however, I lost his mission towards the end. I almost got a sci-fi, Harry Potter & Narnia vibe from this book. Note I don't like any of those!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"It is one of the best books I have ever read.If you have ever felt as if life is not worth living for, you will change your mind after reading this book.

I wholeheartedly agree with those who raved about the magic of this book. THIS BOOK CHANGED THE WAY I LIVE MY LIFE AND MY OUTLOOK ON LIFE AS WELL. Everything seemed to come together and the world seemed to make sense after reading this book. I also thought it looked \\"weird\\" when I first saw it in the library and read the back, but for some reason it kept \\"popping out\\" at me everytime I went to the library, until I finally checked it out, positive I would never get past the first page. I can't express how glad I am that I did. Not only did I end up buying a copy, but I actually wrote down quotes from the book while I read it the first time (I couldn't underline in the library's book!) on many many sheets of notebook paper, and typed up the best ones to hang up in my room so that I can constantly be inspired by them. READ THIS BOOK, YOU WILL BE IMMENSELY GLAD YOU DID!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best I've read in a long time!","review":"I was hypnotized by the author's mastery and stly in delivering such important messages to the reader..This book is about how one should appreciate life and one's existence, how one should make the best of his/her being by following his/her dream or calling in life.This book comes with the message that there is no such thing as coincidence. Also, that one should take time to reflect and understand the simple things in life which could have very important impact on one's life"},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Day Parable","review":"What an amazing book.

I could see how this would be a good gift for a young teen, or a good recommendation to a friend who doesn't read very often, or maybe it's a good book for parents to read to their children, and I must say that my favorite part of the book was the ending, which I see some reviewers found disappointing.I don't think you can go wrong with reading this book- it won't take you very long at all, just be prepared because it gets so simplistic at points that you feel the story has stopped moving even though a lot of progress is surely being made. The characters are decent, but nothing memorable. If you're on the fence I'd say just go to the bookstore and start reading it and see how you like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life is what you make of it.....and so on and so on and so on..","review":"If you are young and need touchy-feely books, this would be a book for you.Although a few may be inspired by this book, I really didn't think it was worthwhile.

I feel that this book should be handed from person to person, not bought. I first read it when a special aunt of mine loaned it to me the summer after my freshman year in high school. I loved it then, but forgot its title later.Somehow, I forget the exacts, I remembered it was The Alchemist ths spring.I read it again, I am now a junior in college, in september. I've loaned it out to lots of friends since. Re reading this book was a magical experiance for me. The simplicity of it is wonderful. I know that there are lots of criticisms that could be made about it, but it is a truely beautiful story.

It talks of your Personal Legend, and the Soul of the World, but after finishing the book, it all makes sense. The Alchemist explains how a boy followed his heart and conquered many problems in order to realize his dream. This book explains that it is important to be true to yourself, and if you do so, good things will come your way. It does revolve a lot around omens and superstitions, but it is really a good novel. I definitely recommend The Alchemist to everyone. It will surely make you feel good about yourself once you read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The brilliance of \\"The Alchemist\\"","review":"The Alchemist is a truly believable story about Santiago, a young Andalusian shepherd boy, who gives up all that he owns in pursuit of his Personal Legend.

He gives up all he has to search for his treasure and along the way he his aided by a king and an alchemist who all point him in the direction of his treasure and help him to understand his Personal Legend.

I think it offers up sugar-coated life philosphies. These palatable, romantic ideas are great if you've never read a book containing such notions or are beginning (today) a quest to question your life.

It had been such a lovely dreamy fanciful journey that the ending was altogher too anti-climatic to make me happy. But like a life well lived, the best part being the journey itself, the best part of the book was the reading of it. I believed in omens before reading the book and I still believe in omens and felt that Coelho did a great job writing about such a subtle subject.I gave it four stars for the simple direct uncomplicated unpretencious thought provoking writing.

This book speaks the language of the soul. If you read it with your whole heart, soul, mind open to receive you will receive what you need to fulfill your personal legend. If you read it and truth does not reveal itself, you are not ready for the truth. All should read it anew each year because each year our ears and eyes and mind and soul become more acute as we exercise them.

Although the book's message is powerful when you read it the first time, I suspect this is a book that warrants multiple readings, and that one will likely get more and more from this book each time the book is re-read. I think this is an especially helpful book for a person desiring spiritual refocusing and inspiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"What dreams are made of.","review":"Anyone who would give a negative review to this literary treasure has to be nuts or just doesn't get it. It is a fable, the title says it all. There are readers who will find inspiration within these pages and still others who will find reassurance for their personal quest. The author tells the story of Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who goes on a quest to find his treasure and describes the difficulties he encounters. Aren't all of us, during our time here, pursuing our personal dream. If we aren't then this book may provide the impetus to begin the adventure. Go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"PESSIMISTS NEED NOT READ THIS BOOK","review":"THIS BOOK IS AMAZING.

Sadly this is nothing more than a children's book. I agree with the other reviewers who put it in the same class as those disdainful self-help books. I think it's a good book for an adoloscent, but hardly something an adult would derive any value from. The book is full of meaningless generalizations and stereotypes. I suspect the only reason it became so popular was because it was written by an 'Exotic' Brazilian. Had the author been John Smith, nobody would care about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book for a young reader","review":"I bought this book after reading all the great reviews about it and I'm pretty disappointed. The book has a good message but that's all it has really. The story is very simplistic and predictable, characters were under described, the message was repeated several times in the same kind of way. The language was very simple, I felt like I was reading a kid's book. This is a good book for a young reader but I don't think serious readers will find it stimulating."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Alchemist","review":"It seems as though some of the other reviewers of this book focus on the simplicity, and that somehow a book written in a very simplistic manner somehow degrades its overall quality.

I recommend it for a quick, refreshing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of the Worst","review":"Ebert is one of the best writers working today -- I think any writer could learn from his prose. His dissection of these movies is pure joy for anyone who has sat through a bad movie, only to foam at the mouth afterwards about how horrible it was. ('Armageddon' comes to mind.) It is true that the post-1985 reviews are on the website, and the book is skewed towards current reviews. In fact, I had already read most of them. But it was a treat to read the older ones ('Friday the 13th part 2,' 'Caligula') as well as reminisce about the newer ones ('The Ghost and the Darkness'). Moreover, unless you're going to print out all the bad reviews on the website, it's nice to have them all in one place. ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This book isn't anywhere as interesting as the title suggests. And worse it just isn't much fun. And unlike some of Ebert's other books, there are no additional essays that discuss for example what makes a really hateful movie.

Strange. Anyway, I was very disappointed with this book. Why? Because most of the reviews in this book are from the last 15 years. And you can download and read these reviews for free on Roger's web site!I have to wonder if Roger did this for commerical considerations, in order to have the book appeal more to consumers. If so, shame on you, Roger. It's also strange that there are a number of movies rated around ** or so - which makes calling the book \\"I Hated Hated etc.\\" somewhat inappropriate. I know for a fact that there are several \\"no stars\\" movies he didn't include here, which makes me wonder if he planned for a sequel in order to make more money. If so, shame on you, Roger.The older reviews were fun to read, but as I've indicated earlier, there should have been more of a balance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy book by an overrated hack","review":"How Roger Ebert got to be the so-called dean of movie reviewers is beyond me.I've come to use him as a reliable barometer in one way-if he likes a movie,I'll hate it,and vice-versa.He lost me forever when he gave thumbs down to \\"Full Metal Jacket\\"and then thumbs up to \\"Benji the Hunted\\",on the same show!Don't forget-he wrote the screenplay for \\"Beneath the Valley of the Ultravixens\\" and still has the nerve to criticize other people's work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessary.","review":"Roger Ebert is a great movie reviewer and he is the most famous film critics in The United States, but this book will be an unnecessary waste of money.

Well, no, I didn't \\"hate\\" it, but other than a few amusing observations about movies Ebert didn't like, this collection of negative reviews of bad flicks just isn't worth the time. Most of the movies he pans have been all together forgotten by now, even by avid filmgoers, and is anyone going to consider renting \\"North,\\" the movie Ebert \\"hated, hated, hated\\" to see if what he has to say about it is fair? I think not. Stick to the Movie Yearbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wildly Overrated","review":"Eberts proudly displays how much he hates movies in the book. Sure some of them were stinkers, but \\"hating, hating, hating\\" them is excessive. As well, his comments sometimes have no explanation for their fervor. If you hate, hate, hate a movie that much, I'd think you'd have some pretty good reasons.

Howie Long acting, need I say more?2. The main character saves the world - boring and predictable.3. The filming of the movie was horrible.4. The special effects must have been from the 1980's. The computer annimation used to make the fire in the movie was one of the worst special effects I have ever seen in a movie.5. Firestorm had some of the worst dialogue in any movie I've seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need a laugh? Buy this book!","review":"As soon as I heard about this book, I knew I had to buy it immediately. Roger Ebert is one of the best reviewers around, and I must admit that I'd rather read a savage review than a glowing one any day. This book contains some of the most hilarious writing on film I've ever had the pleasure of encountering -- check out his reviews of \\"Little Indian, Big City\\" or \\"Jack Frost.\\" There are also reviews of films he was truly revolted by, such as \\"Caligula\\" and \\"I Spit On Your Grave.\\" Sure, much of it is available on the Sun Times' web site, but I still find a lot of enjoyment in thumbing through a real book. Besides, this is the sort of volume you'll want to leave on your coffee table for all of your friends to enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pain shared hurts less","review":"One sentence (selected from many pithy observations) illustrates how enjoyable -- and cathartic -- this collection is: \\"The movie never ends, but if you wait long enough it gets to a point where it's over.\\" Many movies have moved me to tap my watch, wondering if it had stopped. Ebert, too, has felt this pain. And shared it, for which I am grateful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious Book!","review":"I loved this book!

I read William Corlett's other book (NOW AND THEN) which is a much better book (5 Stars). This is just 'ok'. I wouldn't run out & recommend it very strongly. There were a bit too many characters for my liking. It was a cute concept of a gossip-ridden little village somewhere in England--which seems rather realistic (in parts). Enjoy...if you need to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gay SitCom in Need of Serious Editing","review":"The premise of this book is funny enough...a slightlymismatched gay couple buys a mansion in a small Englishcountry village next door to a homophobic retiredbrigadier general. Unfortunately, this cute premise is diluted by theauthor's introduction of far too many characters andsubplots that go nowhere and a writing style that feelsas if the author was being paid by the page.

Boil this book downto half of its length, and it would be a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow to set-up, extremely short shelf life","review":"While the printed information says it sets up in 5 minutes, my experience was that it took much longer. Pieces being joined need to be clamped together for awhile.And unless you have a lot of gluing to do all at one time, buy the smallest size that will do the job - the shelf-life is not stated by the manufacturer, probably because they don't want you to know that the whole bottle will crystallize in about 3-6 months. I don't have any experience with Gorilla Glue, but figure you get what you pay for and will pay a little more the next time I have a gluing project that needs something more than Elmer's Wood Glue (big bottle, been in my shop for 6 years, still the best wood glue on the market)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Appreciative Inquiry","review":"Excellent, I was very satisfied with the theoretical explanation as well as the practical guides for solving the change management issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled!","review":"I doubted for a whole year whether to buy or not this \\"All The Hits\\"double CD because I already owned other Jan & Dean CD's rating their\\"The Original\\" one with 5 stars.

I'm not sure what kind of music this band plays and I can't quite categorize it but it is not contain the upbeat, latin rythyms I'm acccusomed to. If you want upbeat flamenco rythms, you're better off with Novamenco, Rumba Tres, Gypsy Kings, Jesse Cook or anyone else for that matter.

For me, that means that he comes up with lines that I want to tell people about. This double album at a reasonable price gave me 22 selections to pick from, and none of them are suitable for explaining how much I like this. I might feel this way about anyone if it was possible to know anyone this well, but it is easier to get to know this guy than I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"For The Sake of the CD","review":"Steve Earle is certainly entitled to his opinion, but comparing Bob Dylan to anyone seems kind of foolish. However, just the fact that many, myself included, consider Townes Van Zandt to be in the same league as Dylan as a songwriter speaks volumes about the late Texan's considerable talents. This is a nice pairing of two of his best albums. It's always cool to get two albums for the price of one.

This is not Nu Jazz, this is not techno, this is not traditional jazz. I found the melodies uninspiring, the beats simplistic, more irritating than calming.

The plot is confused and the characters, never a strong point in PKD's books, are one-dimensional at best. The title of the book, which seems to be related to entropy, reality, and the notion of saving grace, is given very little treatment. These notions could have made for a great novel, but the ideas are not even half-fleshed out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ubik - confusing and uninspiring","review":"I'm a bit of a Sci-Fi buff, but found this book disappointing. The characters and background were not well explained and I found the final page that other reviewers praise as being so groundbreaking a bit of an anticlimax - nothing special. I'd recomend Asimov instead any day - something like the foundation series by Asimov (the fourth book in the series is perhaps the best Sci-Fi I've read - pure quality)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor's New Clothes","review":"I've been reading Science Fiction (I hate the name) for the better part of the last 40 years, so I guess you can say I know a little about the genre.Ubik is one of those books that I've been using to keep doors ajar, to level tables. I finally burned it in a camp fire. It was a pleasure to see the book be slowly consumed by the fire, finally serving some noble purpose, namely, warming me and my family in a cold autumn night...Like most of Dick's work, Ubik is pretentious, high-nosed, the type or literary garbage that is admired by pseudo-intellectuals.And, as it is always the case, there is some evil corporation involved in the plot. No wonder so many of his books have been adapted to films. To make things worse, it is extremely boring tedious, uninteresting.I hated it with all my guts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My all time Favorite Sci Fi Book","review":"Ubik is the best sci fi book I've ever read. I've read Sci Fi all my life, but usually stick with the short stories. I get bogged down in the first chapter or two of novels, boring, but not this one. But I just finished reading this book for the second time. The first time I read it was ten years ago, I remember well, Cause it was about 100 degrees out here in Texas & I was laying in the sun... This story gave me chills & goosebumps! So many twists & turns, truely soul shocking! This evening I found it again, and as I started reading again, I had the same experiece, I couldn't put the book down. It's now 6 am.Well, to me that's a great Friday night!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and scary","review":"I can only add my own voice to the resounding chorus of praise that I see in these reviews. This is a masterpeice and amongst the greatest works of speculative fiction ever written. Its easy to see the germs of cyberpunk and virtual reality based sci-fi in this book, and years before these genres even existed! You can see the direct influence of Ubik if you read anything by Neal Stephenson or William Gibson. But PKD thought of this stuff first and in my opinion he far surpasses anything that has or will emerge in the SF genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"My introduction to Philip K.

The writing seemed amateurish and because of this I assumed it must have been one of his first novels (it isn't). None of the characters have any depth and in fact many are so poorly developed that they are hard to tell apart. The science fiction ideas in Ubik aren't especially interesting. I recommend you don't bother with this until you've read Dick's other major works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Don't believe what you read about the bookIt sucksCharacters aren't well developedNeither is the universe that surrounds themGo read something else"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ubik","review":"I am sorry if this upsets the author but I found Ubik to be a very confusing and jumbled book that makes me wonder why in the world I even bothered to read it all the way through. A real imagination went into making it, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying too hard, far from the subtlety of other works","review":"Dick once more plays with his favourite theme, i.e. whether reality is for real. But in Ubik he does so in a heavy way, far from the subtelty one can see in The Man in the High Castle for example. There are literally hundreds if not thousands of books dealing with Reality that are more subtle and smarter than this one. It's not that Dick was uninspired when he wrote it - it's full of energy, has humour as usual. But it just did not work out well that time.Age cannot have been the problem because he was just 7 years older (41) when he wrote Ubik, than when he wrote TMITHC.I am a big fan of Philip K Dick, but Ubik is simply one of his weaker books - most if not all writers have them."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a trip","review":"This is the craziest story I've ever read.

PKD at his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dense and Brilliant","review":"Philip Dick's books are full of brilliant ideas; more great ideas per page than anything else I've encountered. Then, taking things to the next level of complexity, he follows the ideas down paths that aren't obvious, and introduces twists and turns and keeps the reader guessing at to what's going to happen next.

I was reminded this evening by various Internet popup ads how commercial messages can make their way into the semi-conscious. This particular book was interesting but not as gripping as some other PKD books - perhaps the effect was more subtle (and that's not entirely bad). I managed to put this one down once, whereas other PKD books I read in one sitting. I wish I'd read this before seeing \\"The Sixth Sense\\" - it may have effected my take on the book, which shared a couple basic twists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best EVER of PKD.","review":"Some PKD books are failures and some are not. This is not.The use of technologies and backgrounds keep you wide awake (interested) to read the first bit of the book. There is one major twist from there. After that particular explosive twist (you'll know when) you're hooked.The first thing some of you may know is that \\"Ubik\\" is short for the latin word that means \\"everything\\". You will encounter some major twists and turns in the book that captivate you rather than confuse you. The uses of the beginnings of each chapter are unique and innovative and Joe Chip (from the major explosive twist onwards) is always hanging on the edge, guaranteeing that you'll swallow it in one 4-hour gulp.The use of words make you want to read it again and again.The elements just mentioned here make it the best SF ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trippy","review":"Bought this book when it was on sale. It's pretty trippy and definitely feels like the world is very strange and disturbing, like in a feverish dream. Like PKD's other books, the characters are but plot devices with one dimensional personalities. It's interesting and worth a look but I wouldn't buy it at full price. I generally prefer to be more emotionally involved with the books I read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Testing Reality","review":"As usual, Dick tests the boundaries between reality, and . . . something else. One reason I was really interested in this book is a research paper I was working on. The data came from my psychological interviews, using the ZMET method. In this type of consumer behavior study, we find that what people say and what they actually do are often very different. People even make up elaborate descriptions and explanations to justify their imaginary behaviors. Ubik really fits this context well, because here Dick references a consumer product called Ubik, that is everywhere. Everyone wants Ubik, but no one seems actually to obtain it."},{"rating":"1","title":"100 Words or Less","review":"I ran into the same problem with this sci-fi novel as I do with all of PKD's works...the idea is great, the actual process of reading his writing is torture.I find his sentence structure, word choice, point-of-view, and actually every else to be so clunky. His style is like being hit over the head with a sopping wet blanket.Yes, his ideas are great. But in the end, his novels are not worth my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"2xist but not just for underwear","review":"i wish i was no longer alive... there is no god and there is no dog either. suicide might be the cure if only i would die for real... my mom told me if i had nothing nice to say to just say nothing at all. i bought his book after he died just to spite him. buy this book then die or don't buy this book then die, it's your choice... or will you?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Job Barrino Family","review":"You know you've made it and are talented when the public starts attacking you for things in your past. No one cany deny the talent of Fantasia or Diana for that matter. Hopefully they both go on to long successful careers, they started out with a bang. It's funny how no one has mentioned the CD Clay recorded before the Idol competition \\"Look What Love Has Done\\" which is really awesome and some songs should have been included on \\"Measure Of A Man\\" or the CD Justin Guarini did with his group, they just seem to pick on the winners. I think it's great that little known talents are getting a chance with American Idol."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want a refund","review":"It's under produced, I have to agree on that. But I guess that is what you get for an independant gospel album, right? Fantasia has mad talent, I hope her real album is better than this.

But anyways, looking forward to more releases from Diana DeGarmo and Miss Barrino."},{"rating":"1","title":"F A N T A S I A","review":"Don't give up girl I enjoyed your singing on the American Idol. I will not purchase that CD that they are talking about I am just waiting for the tour. How could people talk about you the way they do, when you won on the strenght that you can sing. I would get so angry with myself when I missed the show. But my mother and I would discussed the show when I missed the show because I had to work, and the night you won I thought I was going to have a heart attack. I actually felt this way when I used to look at the Bulls and Michael would miss a free throw. Especially when they put you in the lowest group I felt that was harenderous. But look at where you are know. Take care of your child and yourself and make your child proud of you. Remember what you do in front of your child stays with a child. Also do not let a man take you down or spoil your career. I am proud of you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh oh..","review":"Looks like 19 managment and the producers at FOX didn't check their stuff quite enough this year. Or maybe they just wanted to let this one \\"slip\\" because of their biased ideas to let Fantasia win. I am not saying she isn't talented, by God's mean--- YES SHE IS.. but it isn't fair to crown her the winner if she has had a prior recording. They need to check their stuff next time.Can't wait for Diana's next single and prove \\"Idol\\" wrong. It happened with Clay, and now it's Miss DeGarmo's turn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever","review":"What is so special about this? Its very mindless and made with such uneffort.

I just purchased this cd because I saw that Fantasia was on it and I'm very glad that I did. This cd takes you back to the old gospel sound where we praised God all night long. The Barrino family do have the gift of song and praise. I look forward to hearing a gospel album from you Fantasia, I have your \\"Free Yourself\\" cd and I like that as well, but it doesn't bring you out like when you're singing for the Master. I'd like to hear more of the rest of the Family too, Diane you brought me to my knees in \\"Love In The Name\\" you're a great writer and Jo your voice is truly what the gospel is all about.

I hope \\"McBain\\" and his 87th got a lot better by novel number 50. I have no interest in finding out.

Unfortunately, this reissue, while retaining the original's cover art and sporting insightful notes on the recording, should be avoided in favor of the original LP (if you can find it) for 4 reasons:1 - it's missing a track (\\"Hurry Hurry\\");2 - the tracks that are there are featured in the incorrect running order;3 - the sound quality is really poor - one would be better served by ripping their vinyl onto CD-r with the aid of any basic sound editing program;4 - \\"We Are All God's Children,\\" a beautiful 7-minute epic on the original LP, is split into 2 parts!An extremely disappointing reissue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing","review":"I love this album but the very song I bought it for is missing. The song Hurry, hurry is mislabeled and is half of one of the other songs on the album. The tag information of the tracks are incorrect. It was recorded from a LP, you can hear the scratches and pops if you listen carefully. The audio quality is poor. I could have done a better job myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad LP Transfer!","review":"Good album, but the main complaint has to be the very poor quality of the CD!

It is produced in Canada and has been carried by Fox. There seems to be a question as to it's future according to the internet (I'm not sure why?)as it has an excellent cast and is well written. We actually could use more shows like it and less of the awful reality \\"stuff\\" we seem to be currently stuck with. I'd suggest you give it a try if you've not seen it and once you get to know the characters I believe you'll like it. I love TV that lets you \\"think\\" now and then.

WAS I ever surprised--I LOVE this show. The characters are great, the stories are action-packed, very informative technically, and very sensitive to death, family relationships, etc. I find each episode uplifting in some way, yet was on the edge of my seat while watching it. These cast members seem to work so well together--unlike other such series, where it takes a season or two for the actors to establish their characters and the interrelationships among them. I have not yet found a weak link among the cast, though I was sorry to see, in one of the first episodes, this handsome, great character, replaced by a new guy. Not even sure if there IS a second season this year, now, but SURE hope so. It's at the top of my \\"To Buy\\" list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Canadian TV series","review":"I am glad this DVD came out. Since CBS slotted the Flashpoint series on Friday, I missed most of the episodes. The story lines and production are excellent - along the lines of the CSI TV series.

Hanson W. Baldwin covered the war for the New York Times and won a Pulitzer Prize. The book is well written, covers both allied and axis points of view, and has great footnotes. Some of the footnotes read, \\"Nazi General ..... wrote to me in 1963 and stated .....\\" What I liked best was the analysis given after each battle, especially the failure of intelligence by allied forces prior to the Battle of the Bulge. He ends the Bulge chapter with \\"lessons learned.\\" The book covers Poland, Battle of Britain, Crete, Corregidor, Stalingrad, Sicily, Tarawa, Normandy, Leyte Gulf, Battle of the Bulge, and Okinawa. The title of the book does not include the word \\"Great\\", therefore other battles such as Midway are not included. However, Baldwin does touch on Midway as he writes about Tarawa. Overall, it a fine book and anyone interested in WWII military history should read Battles Lost & Won."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Happy Days 50s & 60s","review":"Although the cover is identical to the image shown, the songs on the CD ARE NOT the songs shown with the product.

Out of 8 plates, 2 had cracks UNDER the glaze, 1 had a bare spot in the center where the raw clay showed through.The cassarol bowl had a spot inside where it looked like someone used a nail or file of some type to scrape away an air bubble, which left it VERY scratched and the raw clay again showing through. The handle of one of the coffee cups came right off in my hand when I tried to pick it up, it was not cracked or broken, but rather looked like it was never attached properly in the first place.

I purchased it to replace some broken dishes from my original set. I've always gotten compliments on this set over the last 9 years. My only disappointment is that they don't \\"exactly\\" match my orginal set which was purchased in 2002. The pieces in the new set are a bit thinner and larger than the orginals from 2002. The pattern is almost exactly the same. These are my everday dishes so it really isn't a big deal, but I wanted to mention it. The two different sets don't look awkward when on the table together.The set was packaged well with no damage and arrived quickly. I would recommend this dinnerware set.

EVERYTHING is falling apart after 7 1/2 years of marriage. We only had children last year, so there has only been the two of us using it regularly. We've never had a dishwasher either. I'm shocked. I can't believe it's all falling apart, but every piece is full of cracks. The mugs are the worse. I've had them shatter on me while pouring in hot water from the kettle for tea. I'll be contacting this week to complain. I didn't expect them to last forever, but 8 years seems too short a lifespan. (Also, for 4 of these years they were carefully packed away in storage while we lived abroad.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"HOT in microwave","review":"Please don't waste your money on this dinnerware. Everytime I pass by them in a department store I get mad, because I know what a rip-off they are. They look really cool - we have them in several different colors and mix and match them. But they chip, crack and break easily. And over time we found that they get EXTREMELY hot in the microwave. Even if I heat something up for less than a minute, the plate will be so hot I cannot touch it. If we want to microwave something, we now use some old Corelle dinnerware that was passed down to us.

The rest have been through the microwave, dishwasher and oven and haven't had a problem. They are very pretty and stack well too.The bowls in the dinnerware set are a bit big for cereal, but we use them for soups and salads and use the \\"ice cream\\" bowls for cereal.My only complaints are that they are mid-weight (not light like corelle, but not as heavy as other stoneware) and so moving them can be a hassle, and that sometimes they heat up a lot in the microwave.

We received eight place settings. I only have three dinner plates left as whenever they get to near heat (just sitting on the counter near the stove while it's on is enough) they start to crack. I have had handles come off the mugs, my bowls are chipped. It's crazy. I don't use them in the microwave and we haven't had a dishwasher until just last month. What I think is more disappointing is that you can not buy the pieces individually, only in sets. I got lucky once at a annual clearance sale at a store that was selling pieces from broken sets separately. Only get these if you just need dishes for a little while until you can afford the ones you really want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not hold up over time!!","review":"My husband and I registered for these dishes for our wedding. We used them for about six months before they started to chip. Since then, they have chipped like crazy and several pieces have broken. we are not particularly rough with the dishes. We have glued lots of chipped pieces back into the bowls, plates, coffee mugs and canisters. Several pieces have been too small to glue back in. They also take up a lot of room in the cabinets. Also, the canisters have this plastic ring that seals, but it pops off every time you open the canisters. To make things worse, it pops and sends a puff of air out which spreads flour all over the counter.

At this point, the set is little over 6 months old, and more than half of the two sets are chipped. I had replaced a Pfaltzgraff set that had lasted 6 years without a chip, and these couldn't make it six months. I am extremely disappointed, and am now looking for a new set of dishes.

For the past two years or so, we've been dealing with the fact that some of these dishes get so hot that they get hotter than the food. It's pretty random. We think the finish on them gets worn to the point that the material soaks up moisture which then gets blazingly hot in the microwave. We've finally gotten to the point where we're replacing them specifically for this reason. When I say hot, I mean that I cooked something the other day and, even though the food wasn't quite hot enough yet, the plate burned my hand to the point of having some pretty pink skin. Plus, some of them have cracked during microwave use. While your mileage may vary, I cannot recommend these dishes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good, lasts little","review":"It looks nice, but within a year the plates started cracking in the middle and two of them broke in half in the microwave.

It actually bubbles out through the cracks when the plates are heated. Needless to say, I don't use those particular ones anymore. I only have 2 small plates that have held up under use.I really like the color but after looking at a variety of sets on Amazon I'm inclined to say that this seems to be a problem with stoneware in general.

I saw some of the mixed reviews, but decided on them anyway because I didn't see anything I liked nearly as much in this price range. I just lost my fifth mug tonight. I drink hot tea often and heat the water in a kettle on the stove and then pour it into the mugs. Sometimes, but not everytime, when I pour the water into the mug, the mug simply cracks all the way down the side and immediately starts leaking the water. I haven't had this problem when using the mug for coffee yet. Right now we are without a dishwasher, I am nervous about using them with the high heat of a dishwasher when we get a new one in a few weeks.

It is very obvious this is not the original brand of Sango. I already have this same set that I purchased at Macy's and it is much more heavier and the colors are completely different. I am very disappointed with this product since it is not original. The plates are not heavy like the original ones that I own which means the quality is poor. I regret purchasing this set from here and not from Macy's once again. I didn't return it since I didn't want to deal with the whole shipping deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"they cracked easily","review":"When I first bought the plates, I loved them... elegant and perfect for every day used. The sizes of the pieces are very convenient and they all stacked easily, even the mugs.... Few months later I realize they are very delicate. The plates crack and chip easily when they bump into other things and particularly during the wiggle in the dishwasher. The mugs loose the handle easily. Now about a year later, we still use the chipped plates because apart from the white chipped portion, they are still usable, although it is quite embarrassing. The reviews about getting hot in the microwave are absolutely on the spot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Donot waste your money","review":"I went through my kitchen and replaced just about all my dinner ware and serving ware with Sango Nova Blue ware. It was quiet pretty and looked terrific when serving different dishes. The blues really made the food pop visually. Unfortunately, within a year, just about all of the dish ware was destroyed. I do not have a dishwasher, so everything is hand washed, but that should not make any difference anyway. Everything was developing micro cracks within months leaving me with chips on just about everything. When the dishes started falling apart (and I do mean that they would fall apart just sitting in the cabinet, just holding them when washing, or even while serving dinner) I had had enough. I threw at all away and replaced everything. While it looks pretty, this stuff is truly junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice looking set, but breaks.","review":"My husband & I got this set for our wedding 3 yrs ago. Almost every dish & some bowls have split right down the middle. Two days ago was the latest one. My husband layed a spoon down on the dish after I just placed a pice of fish on it. Not even hot & the dish broke in two pieces. We registered them from BB&Y so are able to replace them, but it is becomming a hassle. I once had a plate full of spaghetti which broke on my hands while carrying it to the table. Sauce was all over our carpet. I'm disappointed because I really do love the look of the set. We have stopped putting all pieces in the microwave, but they still continue to break. We really don't have the $ to go out & buy an entire new set of something else since we have all the accessories to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Size difference between older and newer sets","review":"I have had these dishes for 7 years now. I have some that have little chips and scratches on them, so be aware that they're a little fragile.My husband dropped a stack of plates while carrying them to the kitchen, and two of the plates broke. I decided to order another set of dishes since we could use a couple more bowls, too. When I opened the box and loaded them into my dishwasher, I noticed that the newer dishes were larger than the originals. This goes for the dinner plates, the salad plates and the bowls. The size on the mugs is comparable, but the paint scheme is slightly different.I would expect that if I ordered another set of the same dishes by the same company that they would be the same size, so I am very disappointed. At this point, I don't want to spend my money on another whole set of dishes, so we will use the slightly larger ones with what we have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sango Dinnerware","review":"Many of these dishes arrived broken.

HOWEVER, they will all eventually show black scratch lines from silverware as our set is doing. We bought a second set thinking that it might have been the dishwasher, but now we know better.... so sad that I can't recommend this set, and wholly for this one reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mugs crack with hot/boiling water","review":"My husband and I picked out this set for our wedding registry. The plates and bowls have held up reasonably well, but the mugs have many structural issues; I had a handle break to pieces in my hand while washing it one day, and at least four mugs have cracked due to pouring hot liquids into them, even after pre-warming the mugs by running hot tap water into them. I have read that cheap ceramic cracks under hot liquids, and I think this is the case with these mugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"blotchy color","review":"I also bought the Nova Green set for four. They looked great out of the box, but if food gets left on the plates for an extended period (like overnight) then it affected the look and color. You could see where the food was. It took away some of the shine and left the color faded. No amount of washing or use of cleansers has been able to restore the original color. So I ended up with faded blotches here and there. I'm disappointed enough to shop for replacements.I would also like to mention that these plates chipped and broke quite easily. I have since purchased some Dansk dinnerware and have been extremely pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Dishes, but.....","review":"These dishes look nice with a lot of different decors in my opinion...I received these dishes in the green color and loved them...until i started washing them and actually eating on them. They claim to be dishwasher safe, but probably 25% or more of these dishes I used got permanent spots and streaks on them when i washed them in the dishwasher...it was like the finish was ruined or something. So if you plan on actually using these dishes, I'd look for something else-- the santa fe type look is very similar to these....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee Cups Crack when you pour coffee in them","review":"I am extremely disappointed in this product. I bought a set of 12 about 2 months ago and only have 8 plates left. They break as easily as bone china which is not practical for an everyday set. The biggest problem we have is with the coffee cups. You pour hot coffee into them and hear a loud pop and then you have coffee spilling all over your counter top. They split/crack right open. Out of 12 coffee cups, I have 4 left. Only 4. That's ridiculous. It's becoming a waste of time to keep trying to replace them. I will never buy a Sango dish product again. Don't waste your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice looking but not at all durable","review":"We loved the look of these plates and bought just about the entire set.We have lost all our bowls, serving dishes, and a fair amount of the plates. Many of them lost in the dishwasher, some just by chipping, and the rest in the microwave.We are very unhappy with these plates and are afraid to invest in another mistake. We are trying to see if all ceramic plates are this bad, or just the Sango.I wouldn't recommend buying these if you can avoid it"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT MICROWAVE WITH THESE!","review":"Just as others have reported... A minute into microwaving these dishes, BANG! Plate in two pieces and it has happened more than once. They also do chip easliy and not worth even the modest price they charge for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I did it...","review":"I would rate these as 0 stars if it was an option here.I bought two 16 pc. sets of this last year (along with some additional completer pieces), and was so happy that I'd finally have a nice set of dishes that all matched. The problem is after about 11 months they do not match any longer. They are advertised as dishwasher safe, but the pieces that we use more frequently are now discolored, the green is ugly and mottled. Also the acidity of foods on the plates seem to discolor them as well. We had a relish plate with many different types of pickles at a get-together, and the next morning after unloading the dishwasher you could actually see discoloration in the plate, in the shape of the pickles, it was like looking at ugly mottled green chalk outlines of dead pickles! I am so sorry I spent so much money buying these, I'd of been better off getting something cheap at any discount store. I am very unhappy with these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Six years... And I'm done.","review":"They are just not quality and after having them for six years I am back to using my older dishes. The final straw was a bowl in the microwave for 35 seconds and burning my hand when the food was still cold! Don't get these, you will regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best set ever!","review":"I originally bought this set 11 years ago (at Marshalls). 11 years later I still have them, use them often, and wouldn't replace them for the world! I absolutely love, love, love this set! Most of the pieces have lasted me the entire 11 years. (Have lost a few throughout the years, naturally). I have considered so, so many times to replace it but I love it too much. Instead, I'm here at amazon looking to buy a new set of the same. I have also bought matching pieces such as bakeware through amazon and am looking to purchase some more. Highly recommend it. The patterns is very natural and unique to each pieces; the colors throughout are gorgeous. Great quality!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous!!! Burn Warning!!!","review":"Sango coffee cups are increadibly dangerous. I have burned my hand badly after using in the microwave. The handles get dangerous hot within seconds. Much faster than anything you put in the cup. Someone really messed up designing these. Maybe they don't use microwaves in China. Throw them away before someone gets hurt!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy!!","review":"I thought that we just got a bad batch, but after reading the reviews I can see that that is not the case. We purchased a full set two years ago not based on price but because we loved the design. As others have stated, the first to go were the mugs. I think within 6 months all 8 mugs were gone. It was crazy - the handles would just fall off for no apparent reason. Then the bowls started showing spider cracks and broke apart. So now that the herd has been culled of the weak, we are left with 8 full size dishes, 5 mediums, no mugs and 4 bowls (we had bought two sets). Its really sad because dishes do have sentimental value. My parents had all the various sets of dishes from when they were first married - the old ones just got boxed up and saved for the cabin or large gathering. And eventually us kids when we were in college. Oh well. Hunt begins for a quality set."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!! DANGEROUS!!!!!","review":"Only believe the negative reviews. This morning, I almost burned my newborn as the handle fell right off my mug of coffee.... I've experienced everything from cracked bowls-exploding plates.

DANGEROUS!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, but not tough enough...","review":"We've had this set for about 3 years and after about a year they began to chip and/or crack. They are beautiful and affordable, but they just do not last. I had two plates crack in half in the microwave. A mug handle break off as I slowly turned it in the dishwasher rack. It's too bad because I really liked this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for a little while - then terrible!","review":"I received a complete set of the Sango Nova Brown dishware as a wedding present three years ago. Our first couple of years with the product were great, but year three I have lost numerous plates & mugs to breaking. I think the first thing was the plate that just split down the middle while I was hand-washing it! I don't know if heat has something to do with the issue, but I've had two mug handles just snap off during the course of normal use. Actually after the most recent incident I had to take a trip to the urgent care to make sure I didn't need stitches after the mug broke in my hands and I got cut.So, not only does this product not stand the test of time, it can also be quite dangerous! Even if this hadn't happened I was going to buy new dinnerware since I was running low on everything (owing to breakage!), but now it absolutely won't be another Sango product.If you're only going to keep your dishes for 2 years then go for it! Otherwise, beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sango Nova Brown-BE CAREFUL!!!","review":"I bought 12 place settings (3 boxes) at Macy's on clearance. One plate was completely shattered but was not put off until I just made a cup of tea, while pouring the water I heard a big POP and hot water was all over my counter! So on only day 1 I have two broken pieces! I'm also concerned after reading some review of mugs breaking in peoples hands. I would not recommend this product and I'm also surprised that these problems have been reported for so long and there have been no improvements. I will never buy without checking out amazon reviews first in the future!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect dinnerware","review":"I am very happy with this set of dinnerware. My last set had very small plates, bowls, etc. This set is not only beautiful but the size is perfect. The plates are large, the bowls actually hold cereal or soup without spilling, and the mugs are perfect for coffee or hot chocolate. Not like those little coffee cups most sets come with. If you want small dishes then this is not the set for you. But if you like quality, beauty, and space to serve your meals then this is absolutely the best set of dinnerware I have found for a quite reasonable price. I bought two sets to make a set for 8. They are fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Searching to replace some coffee mugs already. :(","review":"One plate broke in the microwave, I had 12 mugs, now I'm down to 6. It might be a problem with the Nova Brown, since my friend has them in blue and she says they use them in the microwave. We need to reheat on plastic containers and then serve the food in our plates.The coffee mugs lost their handles, one broke total when I bumped it with the dishwasher rack, bad for microwave and dishwasher. I had the complete set with accesories, now I'm afraid I need new coffee cups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sending it back","review":"Last year we bought an eight piece set and we noticed the plates were easily chipped. I thought it might be smart to buy some extra plates. I discovered that the only practical way to get plates was to buy another complete set. I ordered the complete set and it was a match as far as color and shape. Unfortunately the plates were about 1/2 inch larger in diameter than the plates from last year. They won't fit in the cupboard door so we are sending them back. Without a way to obtain addtitonal plates our investment with Sango Nova Brown dinnerware is doomed. I wish we'd never done business with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes you don't get what you expect","review":"I ordered the plate setting (my extisting set had their name and number on the bottom). I needed additional plates and bowls. They were shipped and on the box and on the bottom of the items the correct part number was displayed.The color was correct but the size of each piece was noticably larger than the set I already owned. The plates look like serving plates, over 1/2 wider than my previous plates. My kitchen cabinet door can not close with the new plates inside. The new bowls are large enough I can fit my previous bowls inside the new bowls.WARNING! when purchasing heavy items like this the UPS return shipping charges can cost more than the refund value.I could ship it back for $49, but it cost $19.95 + $15 shipping, it would cost more than my refund to return it to the seller. Who would have guessed that a replacement set with the same name and part number would now be so large!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most of it was unusable within a year.","review":"I had a set of these in blue for a while. They were heavy, fragile, and got very hot very fast in the microwave.

A little bulky on your head, but it gets rid of the cords associated with all the ear buds out there. A little more comfortable if you wear a ball cap. I use it doing yard work, taking the dog for a walk, etc. The sound isolating qualities are just average. Wind is a bit of a problem. If there is a constant breeze, there will be a lot of wind noise. Adjusting the phones doesn't seem to help. This is the only downside I've found.If you have a Sansa, you should have a set of these.

Yeats's development as a poet in particular is charted discerningly and in its full context; my only criticism is that occasionally exegesis of the poetry is over-simple.

I could pull a bunch of bible verses, draw my own conclusions and put them in a book. But that still wouldn't make me right.To see in print, Camping basically calling God and Jesus terrorists (pg. 15, 25) shows how stupid he is.

In Camping's case, he relied on Edwin Thiele's 931 BC date for the Schism, which itself was fixed by the Assyrian Eponym List. This list is not an infallible document, and the year of 931 for the Schism is rejected by many Biblicists, who favour Ussher's date of 975 (or dates close by) for the Schism. The bottom line is that 2011 is not a Biblically derived date. It is essentially a date worked out by projecting time-spans from a calendar that has been dated through the Assyrian Eponym List. Therefore, it is date of men, not of God.

After being gone for a while, All 4 One still hasn't lost their harmony and smooth R&B sound. The album provides a good mix of their well known love ballads with some more up-tempo songs. There aren't many groups out there who can truly perform a cappella like All 4 One, and \\"I Am Blessed\\" is a great example of how it should be done. If you are a fan of All 4 One, this album is a must. After having all these boy bands try to dominate the R&B scene, it is good to have All 4 One back, who along with Boyz II Men brought R&B into the public eye and made it possible for these boy bands to do what they do. The only reason I am not giving this album 5 stars is because any album they come out with has the tough challenge of living up to their first album, which is by far their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"NICE GUYS","review":"I must say these guys came back TIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!

We didn't have an inordinate amount of trouble putting it together, and it's worked perfectly since. It looks cheap as all heck, but we knew that before we bought it - and it turns out that the construction is pretty solid. The drawer action is very smooth, which is a nice feature. They don't pull out very far though, so this unit is best used for socks, t-shirts, etc - nothing full-sized that you need to identify before pulling out. For example, storing sweaters or pants in these drawers would probably be a mistake.We're going to buy a second unit today, but not from Amazon.

Unfortunately, there is no way to tell looking at the package which brackets are in the box. If you already have standards at 22 inches that you are trying to use this item with, it will not fit. Calling Rubbermaid is no help because they will not provide (even paying) any parts for this unit.Otherwise the product is a nice, attractive product that serves its purpose very well...if you can mount it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Construction","review":"I was very disappointed with this product.

Dowie is at the top of his game here, and that says a lot since he is arguably America's best left-leaning investigative journalist. Some people slow down in their 60s, but Dowie is picking up his pace. He has the wisdom and perspective and gonads to speak it like it is, picking apart the influence of wealthy foundations in helping, and mostly hurting, the cause for social, political and economic democracy and environmental sustainability. Too bad he left out an analysis of foundations and their impact on the worsening state of US media, but maybe that's the next book. This is a great follow-up to Losing Ground, his brilliant critique of the failures of US environmentalism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book -- well worth reading, before or after seeing Goodfellas","review":"As a big fan of Goodfellas (I'm 18, female) I thought I would enjoy this book.

You really begin to feel as if you come to know Henry Hill and the various Gumbas he introduces you to throughout the pages.If you've seen Goodfellas you will certainly find the combination of certain characters from the book into one character for the movie interesting also. Screenwriters will enjoy how Martin Scorcese altered aspects of the book to make the story flow on screen.Many pieces of Henry Hill's dialogue were magnificently voiced over word for word in a brilliant performance by Ray Liotta. A credit to Scorcese and Liotta. Many alleged \\"gurus\\" shun voice over in movies. But when used properly, as in Goodfellas, the results are classic.

You can find them for dirt cheap. Swiss Cakes Rolls are just not very tasty to me. They taste cheap, as if the chocolate was set out in the rain for too long. There's something about these, and it just resembles a cheap taste. The inside has creme, but not as much as Ho-Hos do, therefore they taste somewhat dry and not as fresh. The chocolate cake wrapped around tastes blank and unnatural. Then the extra chocolate above tastes just as bad.So, in overall terms, Little Debbie's Swiss Cake Rolls are just not good. The choclate tastes cheap and unnatural, and there is not enough creme inside the rolls. Do yourself a favor and pass on this Little Debbie product. 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loose yourself!","review":"\\"In Due Season plays with such enthusiaasm, you quickly loose yourself in the music.

What I liked most about the film is that it isn't your typical surf video but it's a film with a cool storyline about what it's like to be a struggling surf filmmaker. Most surf videos have plenty of killer waves but can get to be like watching a ping-pong game after a while. The director of this film keeps it from getting boring by breaking it up with cool scenes.I would reccomend this film to anyone in the market for a surf film or just anyone who loves surfing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the $$$$","review":"Pretty cool film about strippers. Gives insight into the industry and especially the dancers. All the dancers in the movie are pretty hot (redhead, blondes and brunettes, oh my!).

The film is one hour plus all the extras (probably another 30 minutes of just nakedness).

I enjoyed reading The Swimming Pool Library, a book he kept under tighter control than this one, which suffers badly from over-writing. A good editor would have helped, because this haunting story of love and obsession -- a plot that brings to mind stories like A.S. Byatt's Possession -- has great potential. Hollinghurst drops the ball, alas, with far too much description taking away from the core of the story, the homoerotic obsession of the main character, his last great love, and the peripheral mystery of who's killing young boys who hang around Le Cassette, the gay bar. There's a terrific story here, but Hollinghurst has not told it."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not enjoy it at all. I couldn't wait for it to end","review":"I am surprised by the large number of reviewers who enjoyed the book. I found the main character, Edward, completely uninteresting. He seemed just another 30'ish man, who drinks too much, smokes too much and lusts after-what a surprise-someone who is younger than himself and at first unobtainable. When the adored one is finally available, they have one sexual encounter and then he vanishes with no explanation. The ending is very unsatisfying and after having read it several times again, I still can't figure out exactly how it did end.There is too much ambiguity and no real denouement. I kept expecting Luc to be discovered and an outburst of some unspoken truth. But, he just vanishes and then it ends after a desperate search which leads no where. I found the secondary characters to be as dreary as the main characters and over all, I would recommend this book to no one."},{"rating":"2","title":"So many typographical errors","review":"I am always surprised how many typographical errors Kindle books contain.

The writing is smooth and flawless, and the everything was beautifully and carefully constructed. Despite the fact that this book is about a controversial topic, homosexuality, I believe that it should be judged by its quality, which is outstanding. What made me enjoy this book the most was the rich variety of emotions that it provoked. Happiness, anxiety, fear, love, hate; they're all in this book, and they are brought about perfectly. The ending, in particular, provokes haunting, mixed emotions that will not be forgotten simply because the book has ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but doesn't quite live up to all of its' ambitions...","review":"I was a bit more impressed with Hollinghurst's technical skills here than engaged by the actual story, which revisits aspects of Thomas Mann's DEATH IN VENICE in far more sprawling fashion.Hollinghurst is a nearly-brilliant writer, though the very lush prose I found to be a touch distracting. But it may be entirely approriate in a tale of an infatuated, youth-worshipping tutor slowly sliding into a highly inapproriate affair with a cherubic student who ultimately turns out to be not quite as angelic as he first would seem to be.Hollinghurst's tale poses a number of questions which are left hanging: foremost among them would be the youth-obsessiveness in Western culture generally, and gay culture specifically. One is left wondering what the dead end of such a sensibility would be, and as this ethereal and atmospheric epic winds down, that question remains in the air, with a frustrating lack of further elaboration.-David Alston"},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD QUALITY","review":"This was a great buy...I was hoping it wasn't a fake...and it wasn't!

This portable halogen burner took the same amount of time as the gas stove. Additionally, the burner is large enough for big pots, and it's very easy to keep clean due to its smooth cooktop. On the downside, after it is shut off, it beeps periodically until it has cooled down (about 20 minutes). This feature is designed to remind you the burner is still hot so you won't accidentally burn yourself. Unfortunately, you can't turn turn off the beeping. Given the good points of this burner, I can live with that, but if you can't you should consider a different item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Enjoying","review":"We really enjoy our Deni Halogen Burner - 16100.

We even used it for Thanksgiving and Christmas as we where in our Motor Home visiting family. It is nice to know with the beeping when the burning is cool.

Then I used the 'air fluff' cycle of the dryer. When I removed the table cloth, it was still wrinkly but didn't stink as much.

It was more organic and rockin'. A semi-Zeppelinish rock sound with a gourgeous voice to boot.This compilation is missing 3 songs from that era; \\"Magazine\\", \\"Mistral Wind\\", and \\"Devil Delight\\"....\\"Dog and a Butterfly\\" would even surfice for any of the last few tracks.....Peace anyways!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"This band has a unique interesting sound.

Granted, it misses their biggest hits, which came in the late 80s/early 90s, but truth be told, the set plays better without them, since that factor makes a wonderful case for the band's early blend of Zeppelin, the Outlaws, and Fairport Convention. Ann and Nancy Wilson's opposition to countries convicting foreign visitors on trumped-up charges, as well as their advocacy of high-school community-service requirements, make this anthology, DREAMBOAT ANNIE, LITTLE QUEEN, DOG & BUTTERFLY, BEBE LE STRANGE, JUPITER'S DARLING, ALIVE IN SEATTLE, DREAMBOAT ANNIE LIVE, and THE ESSENTIAL 3.0 HEART all essential purchases for both your ears AND your conscience"},{"rating":"2","title":"HEART!!!","review":"We went to the Heart concert a little over a week ago.

In the end, a small slip-up will probably cause me not to read any more of his books. It's like the author of Deadly Doses: A Writer's Guide to Poisons put it - if you're going to poison someone, make sure you do you homework. This should hold true for any method of murder...

As I purchased this item to setup my wireless internet at home. It sat in the box for 40 days as it took that long for my wireless company to get my satelite to me and setup. Then on the day to set it up I'm told by the Tech that this item is not compatible and I could not use it. When I asked the seller to refund my monie - they indicated it was over 30 days and they could not, nor would Amazon help me....so I am very unhappy as I am a long time customer that has spent my fair share of monies on Amazon and the first time I need help everyone jumps ship...so I rate this over all experience very poor, with poor customer service....and just over all BAD.

Many exercises are easy and invigoating at a deep level; a few of the exercises outlined here are for master level training,they take a lot of discipline to get through the first few times and a coach would be good to have,thats how I felt.Having said that,the breathing exercise set generally and the chapter on relaxation specifically is worth the price of the book.Tons of used copies everywhere.ENJOY"},{"rating":"2","title":"bath chair","review":"I can't say enough about this chair.

My only problem was with the cut out seat feature. The plug piece fits into a recess in the seat but does not fasten in.

It is just feeble. It won't allow you to backup to a Network Drive. It's also XP (Vista?) only. I LOVE the price. A home LAN subscription is perfect!.

The program includes virus protection and backup and recovery and they are great. Unfortunately, if you experience any problems with OneCare you are completely on your own. My experience with Microsoft support has been that there is no support. The help feature includes multiple ways to contract Microsoft, and they all don't work. I always get an acknowledgement that my request was received, plus a promise that I'll be contacted within 24 hours, and then nothing. Email, web and phone contacts all generate the same level of unresponsiveness.

I tried to re-activate, and though I could clearly see on the Microsoft site that I had purchased Onecare, it would not activate. Tech support is slow and the answers you get may leave you wondering if they actually read your message.OneCare also sometimes indicates that it has found viruses that are not there. I received a false positive that would have caused me to delete a file that Windows requires if I had not used several other AV programs to confirm that the file was not virus infected.Simply stated, OneCare is unreliable, too unreliable to protect your computer.

Turn your computer off for a few weeks (perhaps you have a laptop that you only use when you travel, as I do).Then - when you turn the computer on, OneCare comes on automatically and wants to do its thing - updating, \\"tuneup\\", etc. Just too bad if you'd like to use your computer for your own purposes - you'll just have to wait a couple of hours while OneCare does its thing.And, as of November 14, OneCare expects you to use the new Browser version - Explorer 7. Don't like the new browser? Too bad. OneCare likes it and wants it and you get a yellow alert warning you of marginal security if you don't immediately download Explorer 7.

Certainly a timeless classic that has set the standard for Rock N' Roll for decades to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic Classic!!!","review":"How can you go wrong. This is an epic classic rock album. This record is perfect for sparking up a huge bon fire; inviting friends over and don't forget the beer."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!!","review":"I really think Boston did to good a job on their debut. This album was so good that they could never really compete with it. This album is just amazing. It's hard to put into words how good it really is. There are no weak spots at all. Every song is a classic and just rocks. This has to be up on the list of best debut albums of all time. Must have for anyone who likes classic rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"GET THIS ALBUM NOW!!!","review":"If you have gotten this far into your analysis of this album, BUY IT.Im sure that most of what you've read already has said the same thing. Here's why...A song list like no other (non-greatest hits) album has ever provided.Every song on this album is solid, and a great rocker anytime. It is one of the most timeless albums in rock 'n' roll history, with one of the definitive songs of the classic rock era, More than a Feeling.The best songs on this album, in ascending order, are as follows...8. Something About You7. Let me Take You Home Tonight6. Rock and Roll Band5. Hitch a Ride4. Smokin'3. Peace of Mind2. Foreplay/Long Time1. More than a FeelingOne again, I'll say it gently...BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!Peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"nothing but a man.......","review":"many heartfelt prayers and condolences and appreciation go out to the family of the late, great bradley delp, in deep honour of his untimely and unexpected passing on march 9, 2007. brad had one of the most recognizable lead voices in rock and roll, and i think that there are more than enough classic rock fans out there that feel the same way i do. and sure enough, this is only going to spike a few more sales of this classic album, and get even more airplay on classic/70's rock stations all over the world. boston fans out there, start gettin' the word out on this classic masterwork, and get people to knowing to everlasting vocals of brad delp. rest in peace, brother, the lead vocalists of heaven have already welcomed you."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME DEBUT","review":"I purchased this on vinyl in the 70's. It's one of those albums that, no matter how many times I listen to it, I NEVER get tired of it! It's tough to accept the death of Brad Delp. His soaring vocals will be sorely missed. May he rest in peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Standard 70's AOR","review":"This album can be pretty fun to listen to at times, and the song \\"More Than A Feeling\\" still stirs a certian emotial resonace in many people.Problem is that this is probably the album that launced the much lamented arena rock phase of the late 70's and early 80's. The ever dreaded AOR and \\"classic\\" rock radio formats revloved around albums like this, and the music world is NOT better for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the All-Time Best Debuts","review":"This album is excellent start to finish. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because few albums are deserving of the 5 star rating. Despite being an amazing debut it falls just a hair short of being \\"legendary\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boston","review":"Perfect classic rock album. This album causes high school memories and the days of a California summer to come flooding back."},{"rating":"2","title":"You go Amazon!!!","review":"Great prices in music, better than iTunes. Awesome alternatives, and good variety. You Rock Amazon, thank you! These sales makes you want to keep buying. I was looking to update my collection, this will serve me well."},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying","review":"this cd is anoying, thats all there is to say. More then a feeling is the a boring song, and MNB, it doesnt sound anything like smells like teen spirit, either you were on drugs when you posted that, or you just hate nirvana so much that now your making stuff up about them. If your not a huge fan, do not buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brad Delp's voice ruins this album as usual","review":"Delp definitely sounds as if he has been castrated or something, and why the hell does he have to resort to periodic squeals? It dumbfounds me how anybody could respect a group that has about fifty identical cuts that feature intermittent 20 second torturing screams throughout the album. I think this album is a disgrace to the real quality rock groups like Cream and Led Zeppelin. This album started the simplistic lyrics and music that existed during the 80's hair metal fad, and the lack of artistic integrity still continues today. This CD without a doubt belongs in every bargain bin at every music store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Pathetic!!!!","review":"I'd rather listen to solo albums by Ronnie Hooper or Perry Schmidtz than be forced to hear this entire album. Anybody that says that this album is the best rock album ever must be sniffing crack because these guys and this album definitely suck. Give me a break, Hitch a Ride is joke and is full of simple lyrics and elementary tunes. Try putting this CD on then quickly switching to something by Jimi Hendrix or Pink Floyd and you'll see what I mean. 5 stars? what a joke!"},{"rating":"2","title":"commercial rock at its best.","review":"this is about as enjoyable a listen as you'll get from the world of commercial 70's rock. just the sound of this thing is phenomenal. the juxtaposition of acoustic guitar textures with electric ones, which is made use of frequently here, is particularly appealing to the ear. tom scholz guitar playing is lyrical and emotionally powerful on these 8 songs. the stuff of arena-rock heaven. the songs themselves are uniformly fine, especially the hits \\"more than a feeling,\\" \\"peace of mind,\\" and \\"long time.\\" not really a bad or dull moment on the whole recording. i was never that big on arena-rock back in the 70's, but i always did love this album. just a fantastic, completely enjoyable outting from a group of talented musicians."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best?","review":"Damn right! This is the best rock and roll album of all time. Best live show ever, too. I've worn out a couple copies of the this album on tapes - millions of years ago.... and This was the first CD I ever purchased. Timeless..... Classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Albums of the '70s!","review":"There were better albums in the '70s (\\"Layla,\\" \\"Abbey Road,\\" \\"Exile on Main Street,\\" and \\"Fleetwood Mac\\" come to mind), but no album represents the best of the '70s rock sound better than Boston's self-titled debut. Boston created a sound that combines the power and intensity of hard rock with the refined smoothness and accessibility of pop. And the first side of the original LP (\\"More Than a Feeling,\\" \\"Piece of Mind,\\" \\"Foreplay/Long Time\\") may be rock's best answer to the symphony. A masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a bunch of crappola","review":"Are you kidding me? Stereo? No multi-channel? The average sound system and listener are not going to be able to tell the difference between this and the standard CD issue. (I realize the average system and listener aren't likely to collect SACD's but thats only a statement of comparison.)The purpose of the medium is to provide a multichannel listening experience. This is just a ripoff."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a classic, love having it on all my devices.","review":"The good one's never wear out. This selection of songs is great Boston material.Wish the band would of lasted longer. Grown old instead of burned out."},{"rating":"2","title":"good until the end","review":"I really think the topic in the last song \\"let me take you home tonight\\" is a bad note to end this great album. Brad Delp has a great voice, but bad taste in his songwriting. I think it is an overall good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"To Me \\"Boston\\" was the Beatles of the 70's they have lead a following that is still strong 20+ years later,to this day all their hits are as new as if it's the first or 2000th time you've heard it. truly the definitive of what Rock-n-Roll should sound like. quite a religous experience"},{"rating":"2","title":"70s Rock","review":"Boston's self-titled debut album brings out all the best cliches in the formidable armory of music journalists. Expect to read lots of references to the 1970s; not limited to but no doubt including riffs on bad hair styles, screaming guitar solos of a type that long since died out in popular music, Watergate, and Arab oil embargos.Being of a completely different generation to my mulleted predecesors, I regrettably can't share these golden memories. I can however enjoy this album. I first heard it from start to finish aboard a transatlantic flight to America, and remember being so bowled over by the up-beat balls-out rock of it all that the stewardess had to tell me to shush, if only because my humming was waking up the deaf AARP spokesman sat next to me.I can't really find fault with this album; in my view More than a Feeling, Peace of Mind, and Rock N Roll Band are the fine tunes, mainly because they start the album with an excitable flourish. Check it out. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rock album of the last 30 years...","review":"This is one of the greatest, if not the greatest rock album of the last 30 years. It influenced music for a decade after it was released (Anyone remember Asia?) and it still sounds contemporary today.More Than a Feeling is one of the most recognized rock singles on the radio and Peace of Mind was decades ahead with its message.Boston might not be considered to have the continued success that some other great rock bands have had over the years, i.e. The Who, Stones Led Zepplin, The Beatles, U2, etc. but in this one album Boston gave the world perfection.While other bands from the 70's and 80's are fading, Boston still gets plenty of air time due to this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Classic Group That Still Rocks Today !!!","review":"Boston was the first concert I've been to at the Omni in Atlanta, Ga. This to me is the first and best performanceon any CD that I own. It is truely a Masterpeice. When theyplayed in the 70's, at the Omni, you couldn't sit still. Therewas the most memorable moment anyone could recollect was whenthey played Foreplay/Longtime,and to Listen to the Quietest timeI've ever heard in a concert. Every song will lift your spiritand have you singing or dancing. Don't just take my word, readabout the group and how the music was produced. Then see and listen for yourself.You won't be disappointed. Enjoy now likeI have for over 30 years!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not any better than the CD.","review":"This was one of the best albums of the 70's, and I really looked forward to a high-res multichannel version, but if I put the CD on at the same time and switch back and forth between the two, it sounds like an exact copy of the CD, except it won't play in a CD player. In contrast, the SACD version of 'Dark side of the Moon' is so clean, and the conversion to 5.1 is so well done that it's hard to believe it was recorded in 1972. Also, that SACD will play in a CD player."},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic that still rocks","review":"This album is old - old old old - and yet this baby still rocks, and is still just as relevant today as when it came out. It is classic rock in a real sense - since it isn't filled with musical cliches, it doesn't sound dated (musicologically, anyway). This is great song-writing - no poppish hooks, no computer generated drumming, nothing like the stupidity of pop music in it. Just a bunch of guys getting together to jam, but to jam quite artistically. I would not call the music art-rock (like Yes, early Genesis, King Crimson, etc.), but it does get kinda close. And of course, lots of heavy guitar that will have you air guitaring again like you were a teenager. One just can't listen to this music and *not* want to air guitar. If you're driving on the highway, you need this.This album deserves to be in every rock aficionado's collection. A big, bold five stars absolutely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fool me once, shame on you","review":"...This had the SACD logo sticker on the cover and the way the logo is designed, implied that this was in 5:1. Shame on you. It is in stereo. I have always enjoyed this album that came out when I was in high school and have a stereo copy already. When I saw it in the SACD section of Best Buy, I thought it would be the livin end to have it in surround sound! It was a severe disappointment to see that it says Stereo in small letters on the back after I had opened it already. If I hadn't opened it, I would have returned it. Why bother putting out a SACD if it is only in stereo???"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great rock album","review":"I still have the LP, my CD got ripped off a few years ago so I had to buy it yet again. This remastered version adds the nice clarity that's expected from music now. No reason to buy a greatest hits package, just buy this remaster and the remaster of Don't Look Back and you've got the escence of Boston."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album of all time -- pure talent and great songs, too.","review":"From start to finish, the best all-around rock album of all time. Brad Delp has a superb voice, and note that this album came out before synthesizers and remixes became the modus operandi. Best track is \\"Let Me Take You Home Tonight,\\" also dripping with talent and great lyrics are \\"Rock-n-Roll Band\\" and \\"Hitch a Ride.\\" Boston is still around and puts on a great live show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"There was only one band with this sound... one inch from perfectionThe music and lyrics are inspired and meaningful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Disc Ever!","review":"More than a feeling! This song title explains the monster ballads that flow of Boston's first self-titled release.While other folks wax elequently with a song by song analysis of this timeless album I will keep it simple.Boston will always have a special place in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE GREATEST ROCK AND ROLL ALBUMS OF ALL TIME","review":"You can't get much better than this, and Boston never did. Their debut album was their best and their biggest selling. Not a bad song anywhere. You can sing along with any song on this disk, the all are powerfull and up lifting. And just like Journey, Boston has a voice (Delp) to match the firey guitar of Shcloz. Listen to it, and you'll see why it sold over 15 million copies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!","review":"This is my absolute favorite CD! The songs are classics, I never get tired of them! Like I said, it awesome!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album, but remaster is not so great","review":"I have been listening to this outstanding album since my teen years in the 70's, and completely wore out the vinyl on my record long ago! However, buyers should be aware that the remastered CD really lacks the dynamics found on the original LP. For instance, on Foreplay/Long Time, the organ in the beginning is mixed down too low, and the once-funky clavinet part has completely lost its high end (noise reduction?). Even worse Tom Sholz's classic sliding echo-y guitar part going into \\"Long Time\\" is mixed so low that I have to strain my ears to hear it! Even though I can't bear to rate this amazing album anything less than a \\"5,\\" the remastered version is far less than \\"smokin,\\" and I would instead recommend buying the out-of-print CD copy from the 1980's or, even better, the original LP, with the overall sound as it was meant to be heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"flawless timeless perfect, what more can i say?","review":"i hate when bands start off this good becuase they later tend to crumble and rott. besides this cd and their following album boston just wasn't the same. bands like this is what made rock n roll so great"},{"rating":"2","title":"boston","review":"The product arrived on time and in very good condition. I am very satisfied with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums of the '70s.","review":"Every once in a while, you've gotta review the classics. This is a great, solid album, filled with catchy lyrics, heavy riffs, and plentiful melody. I am only 17, but I know good music when I hear it, and this is good music! All eight songs are great. \\"Peace of Mind\\" has been one of my favorite songs since I was like eight or nine. If you love rock and roll, you will love this album. The guitar work is great, too, at times there are two guys soloing at once, which you don't hear very often. Aside from the fact that these guys were really goofy-looking at this time (in the picture on the back, one of them has a 'fro bigger than his head!), they really know how to play. I think my two favorite '70s rock bands are Black Sabbath and Rush, but these guys come in third. Very few albums of the time could compete with this one. No matter what generation you are from, you should definitely check this one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"it regularly makes my head explode","review":"Whenever I listen to this album, all of the gears and springs pop out of my head and injure my co-workers. I agree with the guy who says that if stranded on a desert island, this would be the one album he'd want to have. I can listen to this album end on end, much to the annoyance of my co-workers. BTW, I was 2 years old when this album was first released. I feel like I missed something magnificent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read farther","review":"Im a sixteen year old and while i was doin homework, i needed something to listen too. i came upon this CD, which is one of my dad's favorite albums, back in the day.The guitar tablatures are incredible. if youre interested in classic hard rock music, i'd recommend purchasing this compact disc. trust me, my friends who listen to nothing but rap thought these guys were good."},{"rating":"2","title":"BOSTON..The original","review":"This is their first album from the mid-seventies. I never purchased the album in college because one of my roommates already had it. He had KANSAS, too! I bought the disk for road travels. It is nothing short of \\"Balls To The Wall\\"! If you like serious rock with a blend that is so uniquely Boston, this is a MUST for your collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still fresh after all these years.","review":"This album(yes I said album)proved that even PH.Ds can make great music. Few albums can match the consistency of this rookie effort. From the first note to the last, this album nver lets you down. Even though later albums revealed the bands lack of range, this effort has to be among the best 40 minutes to every make it on two sides of vinyl. Tom Scholtz was THE tube amp master and created sounds which seemed impossible from \\"primative equipment. On a long solo trip, this one is always in my CD changer. Do yourself a favor. Ignore the negative idiot reviews and check this one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Album Beatiful Sound","review":"I love this album it's one of my favorite's every track is absolutely fantastic, and I love Brad Delp's voice his high hitting notes coupled with the rest of the band make every song on here a classic, every song is a new experience is just unbelievably put together"},{"rating":"2","title":"Every cut a hit","review":"Bought this as present for my husband and he keeps telling me how great this cd is.

After listening to the Stranger, my mouth dropped. Billy's voice coming from the center speaker and all the other instruments and melodies coming from every different direction. Then I put in Boston and couldn't tell a difference from the cd version I already own. I think it's one of the best albums, but if you already own it on cd, don't bother upgrading - there's nothing special about the SACD version."},{"rating":"1","title":"only 2 good songs","review":"I really don't like boston that much. they are kind of overrated and lousy. One of the worst songs I have ever heard is More thana feeling and i don't get it why people like it. The only 2 goodsongs are Foreplay, and Smokin. The rest of this is junk. I love the cover anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst.","review":"I hate this band. This is the worst corporate crap that ever was, and it's responsible for the shape of current music today. Not that they're the only ones guilty of this crime, but they just get played far more than their horrible accomplices like Styx, Foreigner, and REO Spermwagon. How can anyone like the same song 8 times in a row played 1 million times in any given week on the worst stations on earth. Okay, there's nothing good about any radio station since they're owned almost exclusively by creeps like Westwood One and so forth, but if you still love bands like this and the Eagles, you are either NOT listening to the radio at all (meaning you're a hermit without electricity) or you're under 18. Grow up, get some taste, and leave those of us alone who aren't narrowminded enough to be sucked in forever by the same tired old crap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sucks to the highest degree.","review":"the only reason it gets 1 star is because amazon does notgive you the option of 0 star.

There are better albums than this one. In fact, most albums are better than this one. So, it's good to get off on the right foot. Bands named after cities usually aren't very good. Songs with names such as \\"more Than A Feeling\\", usually aren't very good either. Try and find something better. There's a lot of music out there.If you are not a newcomer to music and are considering buying this record for reasons other than ignorance of its contents, I am sorry.

I bought it in SACD format, but it's nothing like the other SACD's I bought. It only plays out of 2 speakers and my sub. It sounds \\"okay\\", but I was pretty disappointed.

When I tried to vacuum an area that had little bits of crackers on it, it only picked up about 85-90% of the mess.

I read this book in one sitting and threw it away. No scientific research was offered to support the ideas in this book. The author introduced a diet plan and offered no reasoning or support for the plan other than that American's like to take pills to cure all of their ails so why not take a pill to cure being overweight.

Keep this in mind when you order this CD. The track listing also has 1 or two other song substitutions on the CD from what is published on Amazon as well.Otherwise, great CD with lots of fun, bubble-gum trance songs from a very cute singer with a tremendous voice. Great CD insert filled with lots of color pics...and it's even got some Japanese text/inserts throughout as well to liven things up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lives up to its title!","review":"Like its predecessor, this CD stands out as a collection of all-vocal tracks, while other Ultra-Lounge CDs feature a few vocal songs at most and many volumes are totally instrumental. That's something all you lounge lizards out there should probably know, since most people I know definitely prefer either vocal or instrumental lounge music and that will affect how you feel about this CD. That fact aside, this is every bit as swingin' and enjoyable a collection as the first volume. The inclusion of the classic \\"Boy From Ipanema\\" alone makes this an album worth owning if you are a martini-swilling night owl. However there are many other classic tunes here as well and if vocals are your thing, this is one of the better compliations out there to throw on when you're trying to seduce someone in your shag-carpeted living room over a couple of cosmopolitans."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album kicks!","review":"I'm a big Ultra Lounge fan, but this album is really special. I can't resist Gorme's 'Frenesi', Darin's 'Charade', Bennett's 'With Plenty of Money and You', and Wilson's 'Lot a Livin to Do'. I can't really resist any of the songs. One song, in particular, is a real wacky, anachronistic whopper--Snootie Little Cutie. I make all my friends listen to it. The other songs are timeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kick Back & Relax","review":"It's another great addition to the Ultra-Lounge series.

When I finally decided to get it (after reading the other reviews here), I was very pleasantly surprised. The highlights include \\"Charade\\", \\"Angel Eyes\\", \\"It Had Better Be Tonight\\" (one of the three bonus tracks), and, best of all, the two tracks by Louis Prima (Oooohhh-Aaaaaahhh!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing sequel","review":"This volume of Ultra Lounge has some good songs on it but compared to Wild, Cool & Swinging, it just cannot compare.

Amazon sent me the \\"pink\\" case, altough I bought a blue console! For obvious reasons, my son didn't like at all the pink case and simply put it aside, and I had to buy another case.

It doesn't seem likely that the young adult crowd is far enough removed from such kid stuff as the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew to appreciate a fictionalized back story of the \\"authors.\\" On the other hand, the simplistic writing--especially the lumbering dialogue--is ill-suited to a nostalgic adult audience. With a less than compelling plot, this ends up a pale shadow of the books it pays homage to, and seems to exist primarily as a labored exercise in name-dropping. There's plenty of alcohol and some oblique sex--more casual \\"realism\\" for our young adults--although none of it is necessary, and little of it rings true. Based on the premise, I hoped that this might be a good read for middle-schoolers. Unfortunately, it's not a good read for anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seiko SUJ703","review":"I like this watch very much. It both looks and feels nice on my wrist and is easy to read.

The \\"approximate\\" running time is 90 minutes but when you play it you'll see that it's just five separate 9-minute segments and some additional interview material from some of the people involved in making the DVD. There's not a lot of \\"new\\" footage; maybe a very short video clip here and there and a few rare photographs. And of course each of the 9-minute segments repeats a significant amount of material used to introduce the segment, which is obviously just a cheap way to add running time to the DVD. The only good thing to be said about it is that many of the people interviewed did have some association with the Beatles at some point in their history, but unfortunately they don't really have anything insightful to say. Just stuff like, \\"Yeah, John was a bad kid in school,\\" or \\"When George joined the band he was much younger than the others.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"In it for the money","review":"Now and again, almost-famous people will think up brilliant ideas to get rich very fast by connecting themselves to succesful celebrities.The most unashamed example for me is clearly 'The Beatles: Rare and Unseen'. Alarm bells should start ringing the minute you hear almost-but-not-quite Beatles songs. Furthermore, the not-so-famous celebs being interviewed use hollow superlatives about the Beatles having 'shook up the world' or having created a 'brilliant sound'. Mm, not really mindblowing, now is it? Phil Collins (who'd been interviewed for this so-called 'production') is probably closely related to the producer, because as a professional he surely would never have had anything to with this rubbish. I got my copy as a gift, which is the only reason I cannot return it. Unfortunately.The five-star reviews for this product must have been created by the producer himself.

This is to say that I take my Beatles' collecting very seriously, and I being a 1st generation fan I can state that this is one fine collection of unseen footage... Granted it is as good as 16mm film could be at the time, but it is archival, rare and more of what made The Beatles'so much fun and great. This DVD has nothing to be ashamed of and can stand proud in any true fan's collection... The interviews are great and the silent film pieces are almost like having rare 16mm Beatles' reels in one's collection! Get it, yeah, yeah, yeah!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Small pleasures, but worth it","review":"This title is a wee bit pricey for the content, but if you're interested in all available Beatles footage it is worth it. I was skeptical that there would be very much here I had not seen. Well there wasn't really but what there is I enjoyed very much. The new footage to my eyes anyway totaled only about five minutes but chopped up and repeated so many times with different commentary that it may seem more.Some of the interview subjects are interesting both in the main feature and in the extra bonus interview segments. Some even had a little new info or angles even to a long time Beatles student as myself.If I were producing this title I would have added a separate chapter presenting all of the new footage without repeats or commentary overlaid.

I have not read a book about working the streets from a female officer's point of view . After reading this book, I still have read a decent one.From the beginning the book's prose sounded forced and fake. The sometimes stunningly flowery descriptions sounded like a college student trying to impress a teacher. I was suprised to find that Drummond had actually been a cop, as the accounts of the female officers being involved in shootings, dealing with dead body calls, ect. sounded like how a civilian thinks an officer would feel. Overall, I was disappointed by this book, and would not recommned it to anybody. There are better books about cops out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Watch","review":"Nice watch.

It seemed to be an emotionless exposition of events. None of the characters were likeable and I found nothing erotic about the D/s scenes at all.

I'd hate any man to think that women want to be \\"abused\\" or \\"beaten to within an inch of their life\\" even in a D/s relationship. I'm surprised Black Lace published it.

I should've reread 3MiaB instead.<<< SPOILER ALERT >>>AND, to top it all - Montmorency is missing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like these & eat a few every day.","review":"I like these & eat a few every day, so when they weren't in the store for awhile, I got them.Boy, I hadn't realized how many 12 bags would turn out - size included!I won't need them again for while!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Artfully Told","review":"Once in awhile, you find a book that outstrips others and stands on its' own. This isn't the glam photography of Annie Liebowitz, the sexually overt Herb Ritts, nor is it the intentionally odd portraiture of Diane Arbus. This is an artist in the same league as Ansel Adams, Richard Avedon, Galen Rowell, and Phil Borges. Simply put, Laura Wilson is a thoughtful artist, whose vision and understanding are the product of a level of artistic and a respect for history that few others show. If there is one word that stands above all it is this: craft.This book is the result of years of visiting and slowly getting to know the Hutterites, not an easy task. A friend of Richard Avedon, Laura Wilson's greatness and strength show up in her photos which depict the people as they are. If you can, buy them all! Her work is an education in the type of commitment it takes to make and pursue fine art."},{"rating":"2","title":"OH YES, THIS IS A MUST!!!!","review":"if you are into finding out where these hip hop artists get their beats from, then this provides a small, but essential source when it comes to that. i love hearing something funky from aaron neville. i also love the original version of YES WE CAN CAN. gotta love that meters thang there. what got me though was that one naughty by nature used for HIP HOP HOORAY. that did it for me because it reminds me so much of HEARTBEAT. this will getcha movin' like a good bowl of buttery grits in the mornin'. grab this and see."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],M={key:0},B={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",B,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,N)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(O,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-7d72f502"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/51.md","filePath":"library/51.md"}'),j={name:"library/51.md"},P=Object.assign(j,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
