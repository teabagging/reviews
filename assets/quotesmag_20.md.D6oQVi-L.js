It doesn't focus in a significant way on anything, and at times gives what I think is poor advice.If you have absolutely no experience on a motion picture art department and no common sense, it may be of some use. It would be better however to take an art department PA aside and speak with them for twenty minutes about their experience.

It took her completely by surprise and became her favorite Christmas present by far even though it was probably the least expensive one I bought her.Since then she has never taken it off. And yes, as one other reviewer noted, this thing stands up well against the tugs and pulls of little children. We have lots of little nieces and nephews and not one of them has been able to break the chain yet.So husbands: if your wife wants kids and you're ready to signal the green light, this is the way to do it.

Of course living in the permanent shadow of England will always draw attention away from it to more easily identifiable tourist interests such as grand museums, big shops, a wealth of historical buildings and emblematic architecture etc.The Rough Guide to Wales is indeed a joy to read and a delight to use, it follows the Rough Guide philosophy that has worked with so many other locations, and it makes Wales appear to be a very approachable and friendly place that has a welcome for everyone.If you are thinking of going native Celtic then think of Wales - if you want to know more or you have decided already then this book is for you.Regards,Martyn_jones@iniciativas.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"changed my life!","review":"Forget Piaget!

I was looking for more good content from this writer, albeit this being an earlier book. Upon reading the book I found an academic book that had to, in the pendantic style required by American academia, slog through this and that research to get to a point that I did not find revolutionary at all. Just another psychological theory that I didn't see much usefulness or relevance to the real world where we need less academic theories and more practical techniques and paths. I don't even remember exactly what the \\"revolutionary\\" part of her theory is supposed to be. I sold the book and hopefully someone will get more out of it than I did. I don't think that this book lives up to the reviews at all.

Once I got it to the car installation was a snap, I used to latch install. My son seems so much more comfortable in this than his carrier and he is only 6 months old, he sits higher so he can see out. I did have to put a towel under the base though to keep it level and to recline it I just had to raise my head rest on the front seat, but then that seemed to make it more steady anyhow. I am nothing but impressed by this car seat and recommended it to 3 other mommies! All the car seats like this had the same issues so I went with this one since it goes to 100lbs.

The descriptions of basic elements such as the planets, the caduceus, or birds are only 1-2 sentences in length and are scattered throughout the book.

I thought it would be awesome when I bought it after hearing Self-Inflicted and their best of album and reading the other reviews on amazon. Not for me.If you're into industrial like me...Skinny Puppy, KMFDM, Slick Idiot, Ministry, Pig, RevCo, Front Line Assembly, to name a few...This album is probably not for you, but I would check out some of Leather Strip's albums from the late 90's."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was hoping for something darker.","review":"I like Leather Strip, and I don't think this album lacks in talent. However, I agree with the review below, this isn't a Leather Strip album. The music is verry popish, and in some ways it brings to mind the kind of music that they often play at gay bars. Gay disco/electro pop? Anyways, there are a few moments where I get the EBM vibe such as \\"happy pills\\", even less of the moments where I get the industrial or coldwave vibe, I mostly feel that this is is a pop album. I actually hate a few songs on this album to be quite honest. Yes, it is still dark, just not verry good. There are 2 Cd's on this album, and the production isn't terrible, and there are a handful of decent tracks. Overall, it's not a great buy, and certainly a dissapointing album for Leather Strip, considering taht Claus Larsen (LS frontman) is one of the pioneers of the terror ebm/hellectro scene. This is none of that, rather, more of a pop techno record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Northwest and Railroad History","review":"This book starts with a biography of Great Northern Railroad founder, James J.

Their customer service did not return emails about that either. It's really a shame, as the author is very experienced in using Javascript in Domino, and teaches the Lotus Education course on that subject.

A lot of the applications used in my business rely on LotusScript which is very weakly covered in this book. My advice, go to lotus.com and get their manuals. You'll be better off."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent series edition...","review":"While all of the books in this series are exciting, this one I really didn't want to put down! While I didn't think it was better than the previous one, Inside the Illusion, this was definatelly worth the read. What made this book special was actually what originally gave the series it's charm, and what's been missing for several books. The hilarious interactions between the main characters! At times I was laughing out loud! Anyway, David narrates this time as the kids try to make their way back to Olympus by tagging along with a few Romans on their ship. A storm strikes suddenly, courtesy of Neptune, the angry Roman god of oceans, and when their boat sinks out from under them, they find themselves in the middle of Atlantis, caught in a war between Neptune and Poseidon. Anyway, I wouldn't recommend this book if you haven't read the others, or to kids younger than thirteen or so, since it gets pretty intense at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great, Easy Series to Read","review":"Reading EverWorld is like reading a soap opera, you know it's not great literature, but you get sucked into it and can't leave! All the books are excellent, fast reading, and a great diversion from the everyday doldrums."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow!","review":"Applegate's Animorphs are great so don't get me wrong but these books are soo much more interesting. They do not go by the same plot-line as her other books: find out plan, attack, escape, and then worry if they did the right thing. They have an originality to them. I advise everyone to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst in the series...","review":"This book is without a doubt the worst book in the Everworld series.The other two David-narrated books were really good, but all of a sudden this one just fell apart. Too many descriptions, not enough dialog, and the weakest plot of the series. The only good part of the book was his conversation with Brigid.I don't want to say skip this one, but you can probably get away with just skimming through it as I did and still be able to know what's going on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of recipes to try at a low cost","review":"Didn't care for some of the recipes in the book. In one chapter, she takes God's name in vain which is why I rated it 1 star.This book gives advice on saving money such as cutting down on grocery costs and cooking from scratch. This is how the book is organized:IntroductionFish and ShellfishPasta and RicePoultryVegetarian EntreesRed MeatsBeansEggs and CheeseBreads and DesertsStocking a $10.00 a day kitchenFor each recipe, she tells you how much it costs per serving, how many people that recipe feeds and how long it takes to make that recipe.In the last chapter, it gives advice on what kind of herbs, seasonings, canned/dtied goods should be stocked in your pantry and refrigerated goods. The book also includes recipes for condiments, flavorings, herbs, leavening extracts, sweeteners, thickeners and milk & cream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product not great shipping.","review":"I love this product but when my last shipment arrived the bottle had leaked.

Honestly, I probably have.I have been battling blemishes and acne ever since high school. I've tried expensive face washes, whole face wash product lines (ProActive, Murad), and some of the trendier face washes such as Zihr.I had a severe breakout on my forehead and nothing would help clear it up. After just using Purpose for about a week, you can't even tell that I had much of anything on my forehead! It doesn't leave my face insanely dry. I still put on some light oil-free SPF 15 lotion for my face, though.Use it with lukewarm water to open up the pores enough to clean thoroughly, but not hot enough to leave your skin dry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle, doesn't dry out your skin, washes off easily","review":"This is a great cleansing wash that my wife's dermatologist recommended. It is ideal as a face wash because it doesn't dry out your skin after using it the way some astringent washes do, leaving your skin scaly or rough. It also washes off easily and doesn't leave a thin film behind like other washes. It is very good at cleaning but also quite gentle. Highly recommended if you have more sensitive skin and need a face wash that doesn't completely dry you out."},{"rating":"1","title":"too drying","review":"dried out my skin - but i DO have really sensitive skin.i used this 3 times and binned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke Me Out Like Crazy","review":"I'll start with what I liked about this cleanser: It smells good, feels great, and is dirt cheap.Before this product I was using AcneFree's sensitive skin cleanser. It worked fine, but didn't clear my acne much. This product, however, broke me out. I had zits popping all around my mouth and nose. At first I thought it was just a purging phase, especially since all of the reviews were so stellar. So, I kept using it and ended up with a face full of cystic acne. It was all along my jawline and around my mouth--very painful too. It took me two months to finally return to my previous mild acne state, after switching back to AcneFree's cleanser.I don't know what I reacted to from this cleanser, especially since it's supposed to be mild and gentle, but I'm staying away. Far away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!","review":"I have never reviewed a product before, but this cleanser deserves it! I have struggled with acne and combination skin for the past 15 years. Within one day of using this cleanser, my skin already looked and felt much better! The redness and flakiness was gone and my breakouts are less noticeable and are healing. As a side note, I am pregnant and have been looking for something gentle yet effective to deal with my pregnancy-related breakouts (which have been awful!).

This was a horrible attempt to portray the story that has no relevance in the context of modern architecture and tuxedo. There is a lot more Jean Anouilh and very little Sophocles.If I did not know better I would say this is a project for out of work actors. I did notice that Geneviève Bujold would probably make a good Ophélie in a classic Hamlet. Not much good could be said from the half hearted narration it just goes down hill.It takes a while to get the bad taste out of your mouth.

Most of them went to sleep, that is the ones who were not talking and ignoring the video. This purchase was money wasted by me."},{"rating":"1","title":"ACHH artsy garbage","review":"Here's the scoop from a non-artsy fartsy teacher looking for a well-acted play faithful to the original: this is utter garbage.Poor audio, ridiculous acting, sets are sparse, obviously they are doing an interpretation, but it still falls flat.Example: important to the play is the idea Creon is guilty of hubris and this is no more obviousa than in the scene at the start with the guard. In this play Creon doesn;t hthreaten him, merely wanrs him he has not done his duty and schemes with him to cover it up.More like performance art, and bad art at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but less a carerr guide than expected...","review":"This book lists itself as a carrer guide, which it is to a point. Some of the best portions of this rather thin book are the portions where a \\"day in the life of x\\" is explained and listed on a timeline type of thing. These sections give good insite into what it is to be an associate (post MBA) at several firms. However, there are only a couple pages of this. A majority of the book is very basic what is investment management. There is a subtle difference between what is IM and what does someone working in IM do? There is too much explanation of \\"in a bull market stocks go up\\" and \\"mutual funds invest in a bunch of stocks\\". Vault should focus on the career aspect more. They do have some interview questions that are good, but this could easily have been 1/2 the length and 1/4 the price and still had the same impact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read","review":"This book is a must-read for anyone who wants to learn about the Investment Management business as a career. It gives wonderful pointers about not only the various job options but also provides input on interviweing techniques.I especially liked the section that described a day-in-the-life of various jobs. It gives a very realistic outline of what to expect and of the job issues with each position.This is a great book for anyone looking at getting into the business or for anyone in the business to learn about other companies.

It's true that it's harder to write quizzes on the words because of the cluster method, but that's a teacher's problem, not a student's. The clusters do help them remember words that are related.

The strap fit snugly through the eyelet that is intended for the camera's neck strap. The strap holds the camera securely and is long enough to provide plenty of mobility for access the camera controls. The only negative is that I wish the entire strap was made of the same material. The portion that threads through the eyelet is woven nylon but the hand portion appears to be a cotton blended fabric. I suppose the cotton breathes better but it has a more faded and worn look to it than the nylon portion."},{"rating":"2","title":"classy and solid wrist strap","review":"I got this for a Canon G-10 and it fits perfectly through the strap mount on the side of the camera (they enlarged it from the G-9).

Many of my buddies had G-Shock watches when I was deployed to Iraq and I decided to get one when I got home. I wanted a watch that could stand up to whatever I put it through. This piece it big, black, heavy, tough, and looks good on my wrist. On top of that, it has atomic accuracy (I don't think this feature works overseas), and is solar powered. The band is metal. The face and back of the watch is also metal. There are a few plastic parts on the case, but you can't tell by looking. It's all black. The light button and ring around the face are shiny compared to the rest of the watch. This is a subtle accent. The watch and band have a slight gloss. I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because it doesn't have a countdown timer and the alarm needs to be a lot louder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not last long","review":"I loved this watch for the first 3 years but it started shutting off because it needed to be charged. The problem continued to get worse until it was shutting off several times a day. I sent it in to have it fixed because I liked the watch so much but I was told it would cost $88.00 to fix it. It was a great watch but don't plan on it lasting more than about 3-5 years. From looking around online this is a common problem that I wish I would have known about prior to buying the watch. I would suggest one of the battery powered G-Shock watches over the solar models. Mostly I am mad at casio, $88.00 to fix a $120.00 watch kind of sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Watch!","review":"I am very pleased with this watch. It works as advertised. Nice watch band. I was able to adjust it myself without going to a jewler - you do need jewlers screwdrivers though."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST watch I have ever bought. PERIOD.","review":"WOAH. This is seriously the best watch I've ever owned. I've always loved the Casio G-Shock series because they were rugged and usable. But this model is different because it's much more professional looking with the metal-band. This means you can wear it literally anywear - it fits any occassion. Also, the automatic atomic time updates are SO useful. Best watch i've ever gotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phil Lynott rolls over in his grave.","review":"There are enough other reviews to tell you what to expect from this release.

Play TL's song \\"Mexican Blood\\", then play \\"Marie\\" from this disc. Sound a little familiar? Next, spin TL's song \\"Renegade\\", then play \\"The Thing About That\\". Don't they have exactly the same chords and progression? These aren't just three-chord, 1-4-5 songs, either. Only the words and tempos differ to my ears.Too bad. There are some great songs here.

The ends flex too much when trying to pick things up. My wife has used them more like a spatula and she is sure she can use them for things like flipping over fish etc. I would not recommend them or buy them again.

However, if you like his early stuff, you just might dig it."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's a Hot Animal Machine","review":"Ok so I bought this on the recommendation of Sean and true to his word, it kicks arse! Yes it lacks the \\"full custom sound\\" of later Rollins Band releases, but that's part of it's appeal. The lyrics are smart and edgy, the riffs catchy and overall it's a cool little album. It usually takes me a couple of listens per Rollins album to really get into it - this was the exception, I liked everything I heard first time. Best songs are Drive By Shooting and I Have Come to Kill You (why do people stare when you laugh aloud at music?!)

He cuts his wife's tongue out, yanks out all of her teeth (with no painkillers, OUCH) and then starts in on his regular patients, in particular the cute little preteen who has been waiting for a long time to get her braces taken off.I refused to even THINK about going to a dentist for about 7 years after seeing this and there is still a few parts of it that I cannot watch to this day.Excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You don't know what you're in for...","review":"This is one of those crazy, stupid scary movies that makes you a better person.

After I watched some of the dental torture scenes my teeth started to ache, but after I gave it a try. The music was really creepy and Corbin Bernsen did a wonderful job in this film. It kinda has that dark comedy tone to it. The mutilation parts aren't very pretty. Once you see them you will never want to go to get a checkup again. The scary thing is that this could happen in real life, but somethings are just dragged a little out of hand. The movie I still get nightmares about once in awhile. I can't tell why though that I'm addicted to this movie. I think it is because of Corbin Bernsen's(Alan Feinstone-The Dentist) performance. I know the dental torture is not my thing. If this sort of thing doesn't bother you give it a try otherwise stay away if you are very sensitive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Horrific, blood spurting scarey movie","review":"Corbin Bernsen is a psycotic dentist who goes off the deep end when he finds out his wife is having an affair with the pool boy.

My youngest daughter received this as a gift and I had to spend 45 minutes getting the pieces apart. The characters are not punched out of the plastic, the perforations do not go all the way through. Each individual piece had to ultimately be cut apart with a scissors, that was after many tears on the part of my daughter because she couldn't make it work and some of the characters got ripped.

Certainly the last two tracks of the concert bring life to this dvd and finished strong. If you are a long time ELP fan you will not be dissapointed. Gregg Lake voice sounds good but stage presence was lacking but did he ever have stage presence. Keith Emerson was the highlight of the concert and truely shows what a great talent he brings to ELP.

If I compare it to other DVD concerts I own, especially those recorded in the Royal Albert Hall, the sound quality is frankly just poor.

ELP sound as if they were recorded in a [bathroom]. It still amazes me how some engineers can get it so, so right and yet others are completly clueless. I am aware that the Albert Hall is not the finest venue for great sound (rock) but when you listen to The Moody Blues & The Who DVD's, both recorded there, then you can see and hear the difference. I liked the material that they chose for concert but that is all. One last suggestion to all sound engineers, Use the Sting DVD, 'All This Time', as a bench-mark.

Even when Grady is back in town and sees her, she keeps refusing to listen to the real story, and that just is not like a woman to do that. It was forced conflict.

The star of the book, the princess, is one of those whiny young people that tend blame all their problems on everyone else instead of taking credit for their own shortcomings. The book even goes on to glorify criminal activity through the actions of the Woodpecker. I would not recommend this book to people with a level head on their shoulders.

I enjoyed a little of the \\"chatter\\" but I think he could have told the story in about half the pages.

I would recommend an abridged version of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm looking into the return policy","review":"This book is about as bad as they come. The narration gets in the way of the narrative. The author gets in the way of the narrative with his pointless first person rambles. Oh and there is no narrative. No development of events, nor of (the bundles of whacky/stock that pass for) characters. There is no theme to speak of. For those of you who believe it has a theme about the dangers of dogma, might I suggest the first three books in the Dune series. They actually have that theme.Dune, 40th Anniversary Edition (Dune Chronicles, Book 1),Dune Messiah (Dune Chronicles),Children of Dune (Dune Chronicles, Book 3)And as far as it being \\"deep\\", it's not. It is not even philosophically literate. I've had students who failed my intro to philosophy classes with a deeper understanding than this book's narrative voice has.

At first the characters all seem to be either irritatingly dim-witted or simply irritating, but after a while it becomes amusing. The story, however, doesn't receive as much attention as the other two components of the book.Mostly, Robbins offers readers an astoundingly painful slog through page after page of philosophical cliches, usually presented in metaphors that try a bit too hard to be weird.Interspersed are stories from the author's past -- heavily laden with rationalizations of alternately selfish, foolish, and chauvanistic behavior."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just plain like this book","review":"I love the way that Tom Robbins writes. Sometimes he is flamboyantly verbose and other times very simple. He makes me laugh, he makes me think. He shows me things about myself that I never had consciously thought of before. It makes me feel strangely intimate with an author that I don't know. It's weird! I read this book in one day, then the next day I was sad, because it was already over. One of my friends said, \\"Just go get a different book.\\" But I didn't want a different book! I wanted to read more about Leigh-Cheri and the Woodpecker. Gulietta!

There were some I didn't like along the way, but there'll always be a spot in my heart for this book.A King's ticking heart, the Queen's idiolect, a Pricess' growth from niave youth... plus fun recipes for bombs (ingredients include playing cards and Fruit Loops cereal) which may or may not work... I've not yet played around. Its a strange book with strange characters and a stranger inner-conversation about the sublimenal designs of a cigarette package. There's also the metatextual critique of a typewriter... and how it would be better if it were red.You'd have to read it to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only Tom Robbins","review":"Only Tom Robbins could construct a story about aliens, redheads, and a pack of Camel cigarettes, and actually make it work. It is a story about being an outlaw (and not a criminal, there is a difference), the truth about redheads, and love. And it all takes place inside a pack of camel cigarettes, more or less. Traveling down the pages, the pieces to a very intricate, magical puzzle come together, until, at the end, it all makes sense. No web has been more cleverly spun than how Robbins created this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Still Life\\" crammed with amazing insight on human relations","review":"Initially a fan of such classics as \\"Anna Karenina\\" and \\"Brothers Karamazov\\" I expanded my literary horizon to unthinkable boundaries after Tom Robbins' \\"Still Life With Woodpecker\\" fell into my hands. Robbins' insight on human behavior on both a social and intimate level along with satyrical humor and an outrageous plot make for a perfect blend. Robbins tells the story of a red-haired princess who falls for a rebelious bomber and their effort of \\"making love stay.\\" The story line ranges from bizzare Argon aliens vacationing in Hawaii to Emirate sheiks building commercialist pyramids. Robbins' vivid imagination and outrageous similes paint a classic love tale in a crazy psychedelic picture. His original diction, and odd \\"interludes\\" create a truly authentic book, which makes for an enjoyable read and a crazy ride into a hyperbole of our time."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't work for me","review":"While the story is semi-engaging, I found Mr. Robbins' writing style very self-conscious (i.e. he comes across as though he thinks a great deal of himself and how clever a writer he is). A lot of his \\"humor\\" falls flat (and he seems so doggedly determined to squeeze a joke out of absolutely everything!). In both of the novels I have read from Tom Robbins, the characters remained two-dimensional. In my mind, the great pleasure in reading novels is the feelings you develop for the individuals, their personalities, foibles, etc. But I don't get that from these people."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Ooooh!\\" In the language of Leigh-Cheri","review":"I read Still Life a year ago, and needed to let it settle within my mind before allowing myself another dose of Robbin's wit.

Instead, I found myself irritated by the thoughtless lust between an immature princess and a pretentious, repulsive bomber. The repeated interludes to describe the color of a typewritter - gosh, who cares? - added even more irrelevancy to the novel. The literary wordplay which so amused me in Jitterbug Perfume seemed both forced and foolish here. The whole book seemed to me more a rambling diary-entry containing everything that happened to flow into the writer's mind than a coherent novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only I had a Remington SL3","review":"Still Life With Woodpecker was my first time reading Tom Robbins. It took me a while to get used to his style, but I loved it by the time I was finished with the book. The chracters are zany, but real and easy to relate to. The situations are crazy, but the plot all falls into place in the ending. I became engrossed, slipping into his world of princesses, aliens and outlaws (perhaps I slipped into the Camel pack). I highly recommend this book to people looking for an escape from reality, but want to walk away having learned something new."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little taste to get you started...","review":"Still Life served as my introduction to Robbins, and will always have a special place in my heart. At the very least, it made me appreciate being a redhead more than I ever did before.Another reviewer said that Robbins treats sex \\"casually\\" but I would have to disagree. If I may be so bold, I think the prevailing attitude in this book is that sex comes in many flavors, as many as you dare to create. The act itself is not to be put upon an alter but the sentiment between the participants is what decides how hallowed or shallow the act actually is. And if it's just sex to serve a physical purpose, then that's cool, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for all seasons","review":"This book is great. I would say that when you read it you should sit down and take one day to read it so that you can become absorbed in the little world that it makes. Screw Romeo and Juliet, this is the greatest love story of all time. The writing is so superb and fluid. I love how Robbins writes about the typewriter and then the story. This is my personal Robbins favorite, with Cowgirls getting the blues being close second. This is a must read! I can't even describe in words how much I enjoyed reading this book.

In fact after 5 hours of trying to get it to work right. I threw it away and put my old modem back in.when I finally did get the new usr pro in, the drivers were old, nothing would recognize the modem including usr software that came with the modem, Ctl, alt, delete, quit working so when it froze up and, it did a lot (thats never happened before or since putting the old modem back in),I had to unplug the computer. Then when I did get it started again nothing but a blank monitor.

That feature fails in XP for me and the tech support is ridiculous. To make this feature sort of work, it needs a string, but US Robotics tech support doesn't seem to know that. I had that feature working for over a year and then with I upgraded their Call Notification, it failed completely and I can't make that feature work at all anymore. I gave this modem 1 star because the only reason I purchased it was for the on hold feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"I concur","review":"I also had trouble with the call-waiting feature. Sometimes it would alert me to a call, sometimes it wouldn't. When it did, it did not let me \\"drop\\" my internet.Support from USR was very poor. First, there is no toll-free phone number, so you have to call long-distance. In today's age of customer service, this is very poor. Less than emphathetic reps are on the line, and use the script. \\"Try this and call back if it doesn't work.\\"Plus their web-site does not have an updated driver for this modem.

He now likes to put everything in there...and if they don't fit through the holes, he knows he can just remove the top piece. The drum is OK.

The other side of this toy is an annoying and very loud \\"drum\\" (which doesn't really work as a drum either; take a look at the red barbell-type thing: that's supposed to be the drumstick) with buttons and songs. My children have played with this toy a lot, but probably only because it's noisy.

She was on her belly and excitedly reached for it the minute I set it in front of her. She pulled the drum toward her and it slammed into her head. She burst out crying. This toy is much too heavy to be a child's toy. The plastic is thick, hard and HEAVY. This toy is meant to be turned on its side so it can roll but I can't let her play with this again because she will naturally want to pull the toy toward her, only to get hurt again. Chicco, being a good toy company, should have had the foresight to pad the surrounding rim.

I thought it was a polaroid filter which, for the same price you get from Sony. Firstly there are few times a ND filter would be necessary even on a beach as most camcorders have 1/2000 second shutter speeds and the other filter just protects the camera lens from dirt but puts more glass in the system.

It's hard to define what's wrong with Hidden Echoes: the idea is good, the characters reasonably original - but you can't help feeling it's lacking something. The writing is stilted and seems to be trying to describe everything and still remain slick, which it fails to do. And some of the dialogue honestly makes you cringe. Apart from that, it's a basic fantasy novel, if not a wholly original concept - this world and others will end if some mighty task is not completed by certain people - with some interesting bits and descriptions which catch the eye."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disappointed","review":"Received broken.

Sometimes God decides that ones fate is not in finding and marrying a Russian female. Get this book and get all of them on this subject because the more you know the better. Who knows?

His estranged son, young teen actor Edward Furlong (Terminator II), attaches himself, searching for a crumb of family he never had. Streetwise and antisocial, the dad dreams of a new life in Alaska, taking his son with him through the dream. Yet the harsh despair of the streets, poverty, and society's underbelly tug against the two, struggling to have a life and learn who each other is. A perfect study on the barriers which society and economics put before an ex-offender in American society. Recommended for its raw authenticity and acting, not for warm fuzzies."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...]","review":"Edward Furlong is one of my favorite actors. Jeff Bridges is one of the top actors in Hollywood, and while not on my top 10 list, he's still a brilliant actor. So, American Heart should have been an awesome film! I knew from reading reviews, that it was gonna be strange, but while most people liked it, I did not! The story follows an ex-con trying to restart his life, and his estranged, runaway son, that he just can't get rid of. The background is great, but the film sucks, seriously all you see is these people going about their everyday business! Nothing really happens, you feel no connection to the characters whatsoever, and there is really no reason to care about what is happening!?

When I went out to a country western club, the couples line dances were AMAZING, but when I tried to catch on in the club, it just wasn't working. I searched all over to find DVDs like this one, and really there aren't many. When I found this one (I've bought from Shawn's series before) I was thrilled because I knew that he was a great instructor and already taught me quite a bit. After practicing for awhile, I went out to the same club and fit in really well! I even got a few compliments from my dance partners saying how fabulous I looked on the dance floor! If you want to dance the night away in the country club, this DVD is for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing DVD","review":"Main problem was the dances are not like any they do here in Southern California (except 2-Step of course) even though they use the same names. If this is a regional issue, product should be labeled accordingly.Second complaint the DVD is full of filler, it takes ages to get to the dances from the introduction, there is copious time given to promoting the presenter, whereas the dance instruction is very brief, and the interesting parts of two step were skipped altogether.Finally the music is horrible. I assume they use copyright free music.

The only way you can get anything out of it is to watch it with the sound off so you dont have to hear the nonstop over complicated talk!

Instead this was a very simplistic look at three couples going through a painful experience. It was depressing, not informative, nor helpful. Each couple appeared to have unique stories and yet there was no background information on their medical history, ie., what was their diagnosis, what cycle number they were on, etc. Additionally, no information was provided as to what additional procedures were conducted -PGD, ICSI?This was a DVD simply showing three couples going through an incredibly painful experience with little information to help the viewer. I imagine that anyone who is interested in purchasing this DVD is very familiar with the heartache of infertility and does need to watch other couples going through the same anguish. We wish we had never seen it - Too depressing with little helpful information."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than romance","review":"It took a while for me to get started, but once I started reading, I couldn't put down the book. Christine Monson managed to create interesting and memorable characters against a complex backdrop of British colonialism, subtle or blatant racial prejudices on all sides, and in the midst of it all, two strong people who overcome so much to realize poignant love. Lysistrata is a woman ahead of her time, strong-willed and unafraid to challenge the system. Richard Harley - or Ram - is a man caught between two worlds and belonging to neither and conditioned from childhood to distrust tender emotions. Combined with all the plots to discredit and frame Richard Harley, the story weaves through rebellions, kidnapping, tense courtroom battle, and a great finish. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"If your heroine is a rich society girl and her friends are rich as well, don't apologize for it","review":"The It Girls series for Bombshell has a fun premise--high society girls as secret agents. In short, Paris Hilton meets Sydney Bristow. What should have been a fun, action packed book instead was clunky,flat and uninteresting. The beginning half of the book was cluttered with flashbacks, coincidences and a clunky attempt at showing the establishment of the Gotham Roses.Coupled with the author's unneccesary attempts to make Madison seem more \\"accessible\\" to the average person unlike the aforementioned real-life heiress, an unconvencing and undeveloped \\"romance\\"(that frankly, I found to be unrealistic due to social differences--even in the 21st Century), and a distinct lack of risk in concern to the plot, this book fell short of what it could have been.

Its stronger in the middle, and very soft towards the edges. It feels weak and disappointing even for a rain shower.In the traditional mode, there are insufficient nozzles for it to compete with a single function head like a Kohler Katalyst model.

That may not sound like a long time, but count thirteen seconds off and see if that seems normal; keep in mind, it is only your hair receiving any water at this moment.

I've used other waterpik items before but none as unreliable as this. Take my advice STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"Amazing! I just installed it (very easy) and had a great shower. It was like being at a spa. Great pressure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too bad","review":"I have purified water, which means that I have zero calcium to build up on my shower head. However, the water outlets on the shower head clog very easily, and when this happens the water will aim in irritating ways. I don't understand how purified water can cause this to happen, but I would imagine anyone with regular water will have a rough time with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect shower","review":"Easy to install by me who has no mechanical skills whatsoever. No leaks. It works perfectly and the price was right."},{"rating":"2","title":"If Tyra Banks forehead was turned into a shower head this would be it","review":"This thing is HUGE! Though it does have it's novelty, in this case, functionality follows suit. The bigger, the better. Easy install, excellent water coverage, and good pressure. I highly recommend this product if you're not satisfied with your current shower head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"This showerhead is junk. We took it out of the box and went to remove the plastic ring on the back and it broke!! Didn't even get to use it in the shower. Lesson learned - you get what you pay for :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage! Huge disapointment.","review":"I never even had a chance to try it out. As I was installing this showerhead, using nothing but my hands, I was tightening the showerhead to the fixture, turning and turning with no resistance, until the connecting nut snapped in half! Why would they make this piece out of such cheap plastic? Without this connecting piece, the showerhead is completely useless. A waste of $26.I normally rely heavily on the product reviews for Amazon, and all I can say is this one is way off. This was a real piece of garbage, and I am frustrated becuase I have no recall to do anything about it. Can't return it to Amazon because I opened the package. Just have to suck up the loss and put the old showerhead back on.Take my advice and think twice about this product. Get a showerhead made out of metal. It is probably worth spending the extra money on. Amazon, as a regular shopper, all I can say is what a huge disapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke within one month","review":"The portion that attaches this head to the stem is plastic. Every time you adjust the angle of the shower spray (which is every time someone showers if people of different height live in your house) it puts strain on this part. It shattered, and I bought a similar head from Moen that has all metal parts.As a purely decorative piece I would give it 5 stars, but for practical purposes, just 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like the elephant shower head in the Seinfeld episode","review":"It's like the elephant shower head from the Seinfeld episode (at least once you remove the flow restrictor).If you don't see huge improvements in your water flow, check your piping. I was getting poor results with this until I found a second rubber gasket stuck in the shower pipe (which was probably from a prior shower head) -- removing that made all the difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shower head.","review":"The Waterpik AST 233CC Aquascape shower head is a marked improvement over our older shower head. It delivers consistent water streams at a great pressure and makes showers even more enjoyable than before.Tilting and adjusting the shower head is generally easy, although better mechanisms could probably be put into place to avoid screwing/unscrewing to make fine adjustments.Installation is simple and requires no tools. I'm very pleased with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average, nothing spectacular.","review":"2 weeks of anticipation, i was hoping a fire hose blast all i got was an average showerhead; nothing to celebrate. those in search of some power need to look elsewhere, this is not it. after a week of usage, i have to revert back to my old shower head; what was i thinking.........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big time spray","review":"This is the best shower head in the history of shower heads. Great spray on both settings.Even if you have lousy water pressure it will still be more than adequate. It is well worththe money. Heck, buy 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate to be one of these people but...","review":"I purchased this product after much research involving different styles of shower heads. I would have to say that I am very disappointed in the product. I had it for about 20 days or less and now just recently it broke. There is a button on the back of the head that allows you to change the pressure settings. Well this broke, and when I say broke I mean broke. It didn't just come undone it actually broke from the force of the water I'm assuming. I have a cheap 5 dollar shower head that works 10 times better than this one and actually does a better job with the pressure. If you want pressure, and I did, I really wouldn't use this one. Even though it has two settings on it there really isn't anything special about it and that's when it actually works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Jet Streams","review":"Instead of having it vertically oblong, I keep it horizontal.We have no pressure problems, and the spray is even and heavenly. You can change if you want heavier more direct spray for smaller area or the greater area one. I don't want to feel like I have needles stabbing into me, so I have the wider one. Love it love it love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disappointing...till you remove the flow regulator!","review":"When I first purchased this product I had high hopes but was initially disappointed. I have owned two other models prior to getting this and this would have been my third failure had this not worked. It took me a few days to realize it but once i removed the water regulator...this shower was awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Fortunately, this was purchased as a temporary showerhead until we can remodel our bathroom.We have normal water pressure but even with the flow regulator removed it didn't measure up to many of the reviews as far as intensity of flow. When the center is on alone you only have a very small area of water and it was not strong. When it was \\"all\\" on the flow was so gentle I couldn't rinse my short hair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best $25 ever spent","review":"This really is a great deal. My shower head in the new apartment was OK. it felt like I had low pressure and the spray was narrow. This shower head far exceeded my expectations, great spray and pressure. I didn't even have to remove the flow regulator and it was so easy to install. It took me longer to get the old showerhead off than it took to install this one.Do yourself a favor and get this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shower head","review":"Did just as I expected. Love this shower head. Ended up buying one for each of our bathrooms. I love it, my son loves it, and my parents love it. Two choices in spray - a wide spray or centralized spray from the middle with a much stronger force. Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great water pressure, heavy head","review":"I love this showerhead for its design and water pressure. We weren't sure because our old shower head didn't have great pressure, but this one gives great coverage. The only problem is that in our very old building the threaded water pipe is just a little too small for it; we used duct tape while the hardware store was closed, which worked very briefly, before it fell, and then we used some teflon tape even though the instructions specifically say not to. That's worked well for us so far. If it ends up not working, I will update this review; it's only been a few weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"RIDICULOUS coverage, decent pressure considering","review":"This thing looks ridiculous, doesn't it? Reminds me of Kramer's elephant showerhead. Anyway, I owned this for about six months 'til I lost it to a bad breakup. When I bought it, I immediately removed the flow restrictor, and it was perfect. Now, the novelty of it left shortly after since I became so spoiled.That said, everyone who showered at our place fell in love with it immediately. You're also never cold with this much coverage, which is great in the winter months.Anyway, it's so cheap, it never broke, and I'd buy another one if I didn't already have this old school high-pressure, drenching nozzle at my new apartment."},{"rating":"2","title":"great showerhead!","review":"this showerhead has been a blessing for my wife and i. we both can share the same space and have plenty of water to go around!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Plastic Crap","review":"We bought this for our new apartment having no idea that it would be so flimsy. During the easy installation everything was going fine when the pipe connection cracked and sent the shower head flying towards the ground. While trying to simply hand-tighten per the instructions this product snapped in two places and is now completely useless. Fork over the extra money and buy something more substantial, we wish we had!**On the plus side their Customer Service was very responsive and are sending us a replacement so I guess we'll give it one more shot! Thanks Katie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not receive the item shown!","review":"I thought I was buying this from Amazon, but only after purchasing it does it say the seller is NorAm International Partners, Inc. The product I received doesn't match the description at all. I received a shower head that looks used, was thrown in a box with zero packaging, and doesn't match any pictures online. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after very little use","review":"I loved this shower head. It WAS great, until it broke. I brought it with me to a new apartment, went to install it and was drenched with water because the selector broke, causing the water to shoot out the holes where the selector once was. I was deeply disappointed. When the shower head worked, it was nice, but it broke so quickly that I am disappointed in this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great flow","review":"Waterpik AST 233CC, Total Body Drenching, 2 Mode, Wall Mount AquaScape Showerhead, Bright ChromeThis is a great shower head. We do not have great water pressure and have always wanted a shower with some \\"oomph\\". Both modes of this one provide good force. The wide rain shower setting is soft and full; the narrow, round setting is forceful and even good for massaging sore muscles. For the price this is an excellent choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the kind of shower I like.","review":"This showerhead was a disappointment to me. I like gentle, soft, drenching showers. This provided more of a medium flow of water, with a medium-stingy jet of water. After four months of use, the nozzles clogged up, and the stream became downright needle-like.On the positive side, the shape of the shower head was great. It provided a nice, wide, uniform coverage. It is a good design in that regard.But this one was not for me. My favorite so far is the Deluge Country Club Showerhead. My second favorite is the Pollenex Pouring Rain Showerhead."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I bought this thinking that it would be great. I have wanted a showerhead that had some power to it. I took my old showerhead off and installed this one. I turned the water on to test it, and boom...it was broken already. The plastic piece that changes the water flow had broken in half. Maybe if you get one that works, the showerhead is great. I never even had the chance. Very poorly constructed in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must buy quick install!","review":"This shower head is amazing. Easy install took literally under 30 seconds. I have zero experience installing showerheads so trust me newbies, ladies or clueless first buyers you cannot mess this up. Great pressure and looks cool. Really feels like a luxury and was under $30. Might just buy one for my guest bathroom too. No tape needed, if you find it is leaking at first just tighten it a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great showerhead,great price!","review":"This showerhead is great! First of all, take out the watersaver. You don't need this. Second, take out that cheesy builder's showerhead, screw this on, and hit the rain room. It's like being in a light waterfall. You will dig this! enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice shwoerhead","review":"Selected this showerhead for a large walk in shower and paired with a handheld unit using a 2 way splitter. Wide design allows for a wide shower area, and with removal of the flow restrictor shower head had ample water pressure. I have not used the setting for the concentrated spray in the center, but could be useful if low water pressure or need string water spray for rinsing etc. Face of showerhead is metal, but rest of unit is plastic, but not a negative as feels well made. Would recommend again due to performance for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Shower head","review":"My husband and I bought this shower head about three months ago after using a similar one at a beach house. We chose this particular model because of the great price and the larger width. The installation was very easy and within minutes we had a resort-style shower! We both love this shower head; it has great coverage and nice pressure. I come out of every shower feeling relaxed and refreshed, even after three months! Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Best Shower Head I have had yet!","review":"Honestly! My husband and I both agree on this one. We did take the water saver plug out of it. It has the perfect amount of water for a great shower. I purchased this a month ago after reading some good reviews on it and I couldn't resist trying it. If you like and invigorating shower this is the one to try. The price was great too. I did buy the extension arm with it and it works very well with it. It was easy to install too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing shower head!","review":"We moved into our NYC apartment, and the shower head was pathetic! Couldn't understand why as we have great water pressure. Did some research and checked out other reviews on Amazon. This shower head gives a high-quality spray with a wide coverage and has made a huge difference. The option to have a high pressure shower is invigorating, but too much for anything more than a shoulder massage!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Blue Guitar","review":"My 4 year old LOVES this!

This (and part B) may be good for undergrads taking an advanced course but not for grad school. There are a number of errors and important subjects are glossed over or not covered at all.

The end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Show!","review":"Sons of Anarchy is a great show, which I think really takes off after the first couple of episodes. (I don't fault the show for that, as every show has to set up characters and whatnot) The writing is amazing and doesn't feel phoney or forced, like a lot of shows on tv do. It's funny, filled with action and drama, and surprisingly isn't crude or offensive, or have nudity every two minutes, a direction most people would have taken in a heartbeat with a show like this. SoA is well acted, and makes you feel for the characters, even if they aren't always likeable. It's a fantastic show that will keep you on the edge of your seat, and one I recommend to everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This show is so addicting!!!","review":"What a great show!!

I just started watching so maybe it gets better. Where do I begin, terrible writing, bad acting and boring characters (especially any scene with Katie Segal or Ron Perlman) the main guy Jax is dull as dishwater. Why does any series on FX, HBO, Showtime or AMC that is full of violence, bad language and weird characters get rave reviews? It still takes good acting and writing to make a good series. Sons has none of these. IMHO"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid show just like its viewers... Jersey Shore is much better and actually has a PLOT...","review":"Sup sup y'all.... I love good tv shows and movies just like everyone else these days but last week someone really irritated me when they said 'Jersey Shore' was a dumb show and I should watch good tv shows like 'Sons of Anarchy'...So I hopped on my netflix account and lookd for this show...Oh lord! This should'nt even be considered a TV Series! There is virtually no plot.. just a bunch of bikers hurting other people...Violence is NOT the answer people! The acting is also bad... Peggy from Married with chlidren needs to take lessons from Snooki Pillozi if she wants to have a succesful acting career. The other biker guys suck at acting and the action scenes are so boring I yawned most of the show!Take my advice.... avoid this show and stick with good television series like \\"Jersey Shore\\" and any of those MTV teen mom shows.. if you want good TV viewing.. peace out folks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING","review":"THE SHOW ISNT BAD, ITS TERRIBLE !!!

I think it's pretty freaking ridiculous and some people just need to get real jobs and stop being a burdeon on our society, these guys would surely have all been arrested by now.edit: ok my husband DOES watch it in my house, the damn show is even on my DVR, but I still stand by my review, the show sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best show on TV","review":"Sons of Anarchy is the best show that there is! The struggle between doing what's right and what's wrong. Then realizing that what's right or wrong really all depends on the way you look at it. John Teller's manifesto may be one of the main characters as it sways jax's perspective. It doesn't always give him answers but it always gives him a look at what he's going through, through a different set of eyes. The show has it all! I especially like the somewhat dark comedy put in to break up the \\"tough\\" image of the show. I guess i like this show so much because i can see myself being one of the characters.

Ron Pearlman was great as Hellboy. Both of them are awful here. The writing is absurd. There's no balance or subtlety to any of it. Every character, both good and bad is one-dimensional. It's just a complete mess. It's a daytime soap disguised as a show about outlaw bikers. The Wire and the Sopranos have set the bar and this show is about 100 miles south. Just inexcusably awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite, unimaginative, cliche, and boring","review":"This is my first review of a series or movie. Normally I pass on the opportunity to cast my vote, but in this instance, after reading so much stellar feedback regarding \\"Sons...\\" I felt compelled to counter what can only be described as mass delusional hysteria. The characters are one-dimensional, stereotypical, and uninteresting. There's not a bit of wit or grit in any of them. The writing is unimaginative, and the scenarios trite and predictable. There's not a moment that I forgot there are actors, writers (lights, camera, action)in lieu of getting lost in a unique world presented in a dynamic and absorbing way. The acting, in this case,is wooden and never rises above the flat and uninspired dialogue as it plods along. The only thing good about it, perhaps, is that if you have any trouble sleeping it'll work better than any sleep aid on the market. My biggest regret is that there isn't a -1 rating that I could give it."},{"rating":"1","title":"sons of anarchy","review":"I think that this movie thing through amazon sucks I cant move them without having a 'device' and its crap!

And I'm very glad I have!Whether it is a club-internal dissension, keeping the authorities off their backs or competing with rival motorcycle clubs,SoA has always something interesting in store.Sons of Anarchy is certainly worth to have a look at, I don't think you'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"bill","review":"product had been opened and resealed. catches for securing disks were broken.disks played like new. would buy again from this source."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sons of Anarchy","review":"I purchased this dvd for my daughter who along with my son watch this series on cable.

I recommend this highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"SONS!!!!!","review":"There is only \\"one\\" handful of shows worth watching these days on television, and SOA is #1 in that handful. This is a perfect DVD presentation. Most importantly, the shows are uncut with no music changes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent 1st season","review":"I was really surprised by how strong this show is. Interesting storylines, terrific acting from Hunnam, Perlman, Sagal, Siff, the whole secondary cast. It's a serious drama, with a very cool setting. It's a very easy watch, keeps me interested throughout and I am very much looking forward to season 2. I would say this is one of the best tv shows in the last decade. Just caught the first episode of season 2 and it throws a very intriguing new group into the bunch, it seems to up the ante compared to this 1st season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Hit for FX","review":"To keep this as short as possible without giving anything away about the show, I initially thought this one would be a failure (which is rare for FX network). I remember seeing the commercials hyping up the first season and it really didn't seem like more than a biker gang committing crime, which is what most would expect.A couple of episodes into the first season I was hooked. Yes, it is about a club of Bikers committing crime, but it goes deeper than that. It shows the more human side to the club members while we watch them try to balance their morals on one hand and their crime-driven livelihood on the other. Violence with rival gangs, dirty cops, clean cops, betrayal between club members, and more than a fair share of hilarious moments to balance it all out. This show's got it all. My recommendation is watch at least a couple of episodes and then decide what you think, but keep in mind that the more you watch, the better the show gets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kick @$$ - SAMCRO","review":"The biker group that runs a legit business and keep drugs out of local community.

Some good comedy takes involved too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sons of Anarchy - Season One","review":"A great series! I wanted to catch up so I could hit the ground running for Season Two. Well done set with 4 DVDs with running commentary on a few episodes. Amazon's usual speedy service.

The main problem is the characters are all such lowlifes that by the end of the second disk, you're wishing for something like a train hauling nuclear waste to crash and take out the whole town. There are zero sympathetic or likable characters, and the ham-handed attempts to demonstrate the \\"good qualities\\" of the bikers and their cronies are almost laughably transparent.Unlike you're a biker, a big fan of bikers, or someone who really likes stories about white trash thugs and losers, you should probably pass on this one. At least catch a few reruns on cable before you waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have no idea why this gets good reviews?","review":"A twelve year old could write the script, poor casting, characters you don't care about.?

I mean I found it boring. It just seemed like a group of people who were trying hard to offer a show about choices and crime, but what happened to me was that they ended up with a white trash version of the Sopranos. It was not really new or innovative, just tired and desperate. Maybe you'll like it, but I could imagine that.

I used to use proactiv solution but my skin is way too sensitive for it. Then I used a litany of brand-name facial cleansing lines--but they were too expensive to maintain. I tried Stridex for a while but it just seemed to take my skin off. Nowadays I have stumbled upon the simplest solution (astringent). I wear lots of makeup throughout the day and if I don't remove all of it I tend to break out. I clean my face once a night with astringent, I put a little bit of lotion under my eyes and on any super dry areas, and then go to bed.

However, I passed.","review":"I used three books to help me prepare for the exam. The authors know their subject and reading it should help you. I also read \\"All in one CISSP Study Guide\\" by Shon Harris. Although studying with any material you can get you hands on is always a good idea, I likely could have simply used Shon Harris's masterpiece, one of the other books that I purchased and not any other books.I found \\"The CISSP Prep Guide\\" lacking friendly examples and humor which made the book a dry, technical read. It kind of reminded me of the college text books about 16th Century music history. Sleepy and boring. And we all know computer security is more fun then that!Read Harris's book first, Carl Endorf's book second and only this one if you have the time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Passed my CISSP Test today!!","review":"I received notice today that I passed the CISSP test, and this book was the main source I used for studying. It is thorough without giving you extraneous information you don't need for the test. The writing style is adequately pleasant to get through for a technical book. Having the book in PDF form as well was a really helpful plus.Thanks, Ron Krutz! I will add that reading one or two other books at the same time will greatly increase your overall comprehension of the material. This test is not about technical details, but showing that you grasp the underlying big concepts in security. I would study a domain by reading three study guides' chapters on that one domain before moving on to another domain. This gave me a great perspective.Strat"},{"rating":"2","title":"Huge amount of material, complete study reference","review":"I just got my copy of the CISSP Prep Guide 2nd Edition this week and have several other CISSP books.

I started reading it two weeks before the exam and passed (I did have extensive experience in the InfoSec field however). It covers each area of the test and introduces you to to ISC2's unique vocabulary (Which is perhaps the most important aspect of the test). Read it twice and you will pass the test. Save yourself some money and buy this book instead of all the recommended materials. The book is well organized and the bullleted lists corrospond to the material that you will encounter on the test.

Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"The right information in the right size package","review":"While \\"All-In-One\\" has a very comprehensive outline of security concepts, I feel the \\"Prep Guide\\" is a better tool for focusing on the test for someone experienced in the field. The cryptography chapter is the clearest and readable overview of crypto concepts I've seen. For example, while \\"All-In-One\\" states that for 10 people, a person will have to have 45 different keys to support the symmetric encryption method - and for 100 - you'd need 4,950 symmetric keys (page 516), but doesn't explain the calculation. The \\"Prep Guide\\" shows the formula, n(n-1)/2 (page 162).There are other examples of this, which make the Prep Guide a more useful tool for the security practitioner in studying for the exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written outline of facts- don't waste money or time","review":"Absolutely dreadful presentation of material.

I am a CISA and a security consultant for a large firm, and I can say that this will be of great benefit for those of you studying the CISSP. At first glance, I don't think it can be your only study material, but it will get you very close.

I was wrong. From the inappropriate language to the gruesome scenes to a main character deciding to \\"come out of the closet\\" for added shock value.The cover said that it was \\"for the whole family\\". Shame on the film makers for not having this film rated PG-13 and for trying to shove it on to young kids.I respect the gay right movement and have supported it 100%. However, this was not added to the film to educate children or to add substance to the film, it was pure shock value. And as a parent, I believe that I have the right to decide when I find it appropriate to sit down with my child (especially my 4 year old) and have this conversation with him.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS FOR YOUNG CHILDREN. I returned it and got my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun movie","review":"This was a fun movie to watch, maybe a little scary for very young children. There was a bit of adult humor mixed in (think Shrek) that would pass over most kids' heads. However on the end (spoiler alert), some parents may have issues with this part and that is why I decided to point it out. Norman's sister asks the older boy whom she has a crush on to go see a movie and he says his boyfriend would love that. My ten year old son turned to me and said: She just found out he's gay right! That one did not get past him. There are several topics this movie pokes fun of and if you can catch it, there is even a Scooby Doo reference. Our family enjoyed the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"ParaNorman Made History","review":"The makers of \\"ParaNorman\\" made history with this film; never before has an animated movie introduced an openly gay character (unless you count Ken from \\"Toy Story 3\\" because who was he kidding). Finally a movie studio had the guts to make this progressive move for the film industry. There are millions of kids out there who are told by a backwards society that they are second-class citizens because of who they love. These kids have been wondering when a movie might be made featuring a boy looking for his Prince Charming. The character Mitch wasn't the main character, but this is a step in the right direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I would have picked for kids","review":"I bought this movie in time for halloween for 3 boys (ages 6-8) to watch.

Another thing I noticed while watching this film, is that it seems to be a \\"Silent Hill For Kids\\" due to a few similarities I found (Little girl that was accused of being a witch, and burned, and is now taking out her revenge on the people of the town and the people who hurt her ; takes place in a small town with a small population of people ; only 1 person can relate to the witch and stop the terrible madness ; and the little girl is dressed in a school-girl type uniform)"},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"like iike like it. anyone wants a good sunday flick this is it. curl up with the kids and have a good time"},{"rating":"2","title":"This little film is a hit","review":"I hadn't heard much about this film but picked it to watch with my kids, 11 and 15, over dinner one night and this little sleeper of a film was a real hit.

There's a nice message about caring for others, being aware of your feelings, and not perpetuating a 'you hurt me so I'll hurt you' dynamic that you can reinforce with the kids.Cool enough for teens, accessible enough for middle school, and funny enough for the whole family.

But Norman isn't talking to himself - he's talking to ghosts, specters he's been able to see, especially, since the death of his grandma (who talks to him regularly at home, often keeping Norman company as he watches TV). Even his own parents and self-absorbed teenage sister don't believe him - think him odd - but when his ability to communicate with the dead calls Norman into service against an oncoming supernatural uprising that threatens his entire town, Norman gathers a few rag-tag buddies to vanquish the undead and break a centuries-old curse ... in what is a truly engaging, funny, and surprisingly good animated film complete with a few twists to the plot you do NOT see coming.

I started watching it with her and was hooked in the first 5 minutes. The previews on TV did not do this movie any Justice. Or maybe it got lost in the whole Tim Burton Franken Weenie fuss. It is a sweet, funny, feel good movie a bit scary in some parts for younger kids. Its about Norman a sweet but different kind of boy who is lost in his family and he see and speaks to his dead Grandma. The movie teaches kids about being tolerant to all different kinds of people, it touches on being bullied by scared kids who have no tolerance for kids who are not \\"normal\\". it was one of those surprise I love this movie and I loved that it was just as entertaining for me as it was for my daughter to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"paranormal","review":"paranorman was so scary and cool.

A little slow in some parts,but all around good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stop Animation","review":"I gave it five stars, because, for one, I love the paranormal and for two, I really like stop animation. It's fun. I thought it took a little bit to get going, but when it finally did, it turned out to be a fun movie. The voice cast did an excellent job and with John Goodman having a part in it, it just made it gold. I'm not going to give too much away, but I thought the climax of the film is something unique; I've never seen anything like that. And you really do feel for the \\"bad girl\\" of the film by the end of the movie. The movie has a really good message too; that bullying should be stopped. Though, it probably never will. Besides that, it was fun. Need I say more?Would I buy this movie? (I rented it): Yes. It reminded me of The Nightmare Before Christmas and Coraline, and if you liked those movies, you'll like this too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for kids","review":"I'm pretty reasonable with what my 3 and 7 year old girls watch.

Again, not as funny as I expected. But, a good movie to watch with family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good family fun","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect from ParaNorman. You have boy who sees and speaks to dead people. His older sister is the typical older sister who is embarrassed by her brother's oddities. He's picked on at school and pretty much a loner until one kid decides to friend him.The movie progresses through a story in which the boy has to save his town and along the way convinces people he's not crazy or imaginative.Overall, the movie was good and I got some laughs out of it. The humor isn't so highbrow that kids (mine are 12 and 14) won't get it. It's definitely a movie I'd buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I'm so amazed by this movie or work actually, and my main focus here is the claymation/stop-motin and the fine craftsmanship & details of those dolls. imo it was a perfect masterpiece, in some scenes I could hardly tell if it was CG or not. the details & coloring were so good, also I have to give an excellence mark on those asymmetries (Norman's nose, aggie's ears ..etc).

My 10-year-old and I were the most excited about the release. He walked away to do something else after 20 minutes or so into the movie. He was the smart one. My wife kept asking \\"Do we have to watch this?\\" I kept hanging on, hoping for some improvement. We wasted our time. The plot has been done about 100 times in various forms. The scary scenes weren't scary (we expected this or we wouldn't have let our 10-year-old watch it) but the funny scenes weren't funny and the character interaction was very predictable. If there were 10 jokes in the movie, maybe 2 were funny.

Too much adult humor and not enough playfulness. In fact, in the opening scene, Norman's mother asked him what he was up to and he replied, \\"Watching sex and violence\\". Really??? Personally, I wouldn't let any kid under the age of 12 to it. If you are planning on letting young kids watch, please read the parent's guide.

It encourages diversity and acceptance. I pray for the day that a movie intended to harbor good will and positivity such as this one will not be jeered at for having a gay character but just be accepted as nothing to be surprised at; the character will be looked at as just like everyone else, because that is what they are; just like everyone else.The erroneous and disturbing review purporting a non existent \\"gay agenda\\" etc. is particularly disturbing and the ignorance blinding. This is a family movie with a good message, the only agenda that I see is those, even those who should know better, attempting to squash and silence those who are for equality, acceptance, civil rights for all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pressure to love this movie???","review":"I find it rather amusing that people are getting upset with those of us who did not like this movie. I am starting to wonder if all the 5 star reviews are from people who worked on the film.I do give high regards to the animators. This movie contains some of the best animation I've ever seen but the story just couldn't keep me riveted to my seat or even curious as to what was going to happen next. I actually had to apologize to my wife and kids for making them sit through this.I recommend before anyone listens to the high reviews that they rent it and decide for themselves.

There are crazy teenagers, zombie-like creatures, and some awesome effects.

The story is an average one if not a little slow and boring. My biggest issue with this movie is I am not sure what audience it is aiming for. It seems a big scary for young children and not so entertaining for the older ones or even adults.

I Robot jumps off the screen compared to this production. The story itself is totally geared towards 8 yr olds but the innuendo makes it very very marginal even for todays kids. The script is really boring. I will stop here because I have run out of nice things to say about this movie.

So-so.","review":"I expected more from the animators who did the Coraline adaptation, but then the story/script this time was not taken from a fine, dark Neil Gaiman story.Brilliant technical achievement in the animation, but everything else is recycled clichés: The Sixth Sense, Frankenstein, Night of the Living Dead/generic zombie flicks, car chases, grade-school bromance, even a dash of Beetlejuice.The action is s-l-o-w, the story meandering and full of dated pop-culture references, characters somewhat grotesque (not just the zombies) and confined to narrow stereotypes, and the PC/GA burden heavy-handed and tedious.Unlike the Coraline movie, I would not view ParaNorman again nor recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a childrens movie","review":"This movie was a disappointment.

Can't say more without spoilers, but it was not what I expected, and not fun.The movie could have been much better. For example, the movie could have been a kid bullied for his misunderstood special gift of talking to the dead, then town gets terrorized by brain eating zombies (mocking zombie films here), then kid saves the day using his special gift to talk to the zombies and convince them to happily live beside the living, town prospers with tourism to see the zombies. That's actually what I expected from this film, a zombie comedy, and was disappointed that it wasn't at all that.It's all fine, I suppose, if you go into this movie expecting it to be sad, morbid, dark, and preachy, but that's not what I expected, and I wouldn't have bought it if I had known."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good movie at all and really not for young kids.","review":"Boring with a wired ending even for a animated movie.

Too silly script","review":"The animation is excellent, although there was no need to make most of the characters so ugly looking and grotesque. The plot is too silly and slim. It would have been fine on a short movie, but it is clear that it had to be stretched too much to fill a full-length feature (a common defect of too many movies). It is essentially a tale of the redemption of all the inhabitants of a small town. the problem is that their conversion from stupid and nasty to smart and nice is poorly done. It only happens in the last five minutes of the movie and it felt too rushed, forced and unbelievable. Most of the characters are too stereotypical, which is disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun...","review":"Surprisingly good. Well paced.

Archaeological and historical sites don't seem to be listed at all.I'm using the map, guide books, and the internet to find the required information. It is too late for me, but if your purpose in buying this map is the same as mine, I would keep looking for a map geared for the tourist."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Driving Scottish Roads...","review":"The Michelin Scotand Regional Map is invaluable for auto-touring in Scotland. At a 1/400,000 scale, it covers all of Scotland on one large, folded map, updated annually, yet is in sufficient detail to enable navigation from town to town. Its multi-colored presentation and simplified graphics allows the experienced map-reader to dope out a sense of terrain as a navigation aid. It includes an index of cities, towns, and major villages, and inset maps of Glasgow and Edinburgh, the major cities.It is fair to note a couple of shortcomings. The paper format wears poorly under repeated refolding of the map to get at an area of interest, and tends not to survive close encounters with coffee or tea. However, when supplemented with Ordnance Survey large scale maps for hiking or other off-the-road activities, the Michelin Scotland Regional Map is highly recommended as an invaluable aid for exploring Scotland."},{"rating":"1","title":"Map of Scotland","review":"I haven't even opened the package.

On the positive side, I must admit that \\"\\"Gesualdo consort\\"\\" are couragous, and that they might belong to the musicological period of this musical period (they started in 1978!). But the result is better not compared to \\"modern\\" interpretations by young musicians/singers in Italy. Try listen to the OPUS111-edition of Gesualdo by Alessandrini and Concerto Italiano. One aspect is the enormous significance of getting the text pronounced not only correctly, but getting it right. Of more importance is the mood, the communication of the deep extrovert message of Gesualdo madrigals. No, somebody was able to call this ASV London-Gesualdo-record a \\"miracle\\": he had to be British and musicologist (yes, he is..). This ASV-version costs less, but I recommend listening to your ears and not your pocket.

It is a school comedy/slice-of-life type anime that isn't the best, yet I found very hard to put down. The level of dirtyness of the show never goes past an argument over a girl's cup size, and the violence is very mild (until the beginning of the 2nd season where the school goes nuts.) For those who don't want the extra craziness of the 2nd season, the 1st season is a good place to stop. If you change your mind, you might even grab the season 1 and 2 box set later and shove the S.A.V.E. edition into the hands of a random friend.

Compared to Kenneth Branagh, and his amazing interpretations of Shakespeare's works, this film is pathetic.

Olivier, whom plays King Lear himself, did a wonderful job playing the part. The only true fall back that made me despise the movie was the way it was done. The actors said their lines as if reading straight from Shakespeares play itself. and while this seemed good at the beginning, i found it VERY hard to stay awake towards the middle and end. If a movie of King Lear is what you are looking for, then i suggest you view the movie \\"Ran\\" by Kurosawa. Not only does it follow the King Lear story, but it does a wonderful job of doing so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Olivier is obviously past his prime","review":"The minimalist set, an great actor past his prime and a pathetic cast all add up to a community theatre caliber production. The unethusiastic production was in need of a true star, if you are interested in seeing a better representation of Shakespeare's work watch Kenneth Branagh's Othello, Henry V, Hamlet. Even Mel Gibson's Hamlet is done with more quality and accuaracy towards the script."},{"rating":"2","title":"you WILL cry","review":"This is not the best Lear, or the most complete, but it's the one I use in my classroom because Olivier's performance is so accessible and moving. His final scene makes you marvel at the emotional power an actor at the end of his career could muster -- and almost allows you to forget \\"The Betsy\\"! The supporting actors are very good, particularly Diana Rigg as Regan and John Hurt as an empathetic Fool. The language is crystal clear and the neolithic-Britain setting gives a better sense of the historical context for this legend than do the many modern-dress updates."},{"rating":"2","title":"King Lear at its best!!!!","review":"This is for anyone who knows anything about Shakespeare.I think this is an excellent Lear...the cuts that were made are not excessive and the acting is superb pretty much all around.Sir L of course is wonderful....rising to the part and the occasion. His daughters are all well cast and the only strange acting came from Lear's Fool...a British actor who took the role to the dark and mysterious place( who's the real fool?) ...a good choice..but the play is so dark and sad anyway..why not have some humor to spice it up? Shakespeare didn't write the fool in this play with great lines or funny lines....overall the production is an utter Shakespearean success."},{"rating":"2","title":"King Lear is Laurence Olivier!","review":"This video helped my direct a scene for a Shakespeare competition for my high school theatre. The blocking was better than other productions. I liked how the characters were portrayed in this production more so than others I've seen. Of course, Laurence Olivier---what more can I say??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor performance from Olivier.","review":"While his films of Hamlet and Henry IV are brilliant, this performance was disappointing. I am not sure whether he was past his prime or if the part simply did not suit him, but the full weight of the King's character is missing. Another point I found extremely irritating is that Olivier mutters his lines on numerous occasions making it very difficult to understand his words, it left me scrambling for the remote control to turn on the sub-titles, unfortunately there is none on the DVD, so I was left miserably struggling to understand many passages. The rest of the cast were super, John Hurt especially was electrifying as the fool. But overall one to avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like Olivier and Shakespeare, but not this film version.","review":"Shakespeare wrote the ultimate tragedy with this play. Olivier's performance is sound. I liked seeing Diana Rigg as a nasty person(she plays one of Lear's daughters). The overall quality of the film is good, however, the viewer will be left feeling terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.","review":"This was produced for TV--and it looks it. A personal complaint: NO SUBTITLES are recorded and the sound is so horrible you cannot tell what is being said (especially when the rain is pouring and the wind is howling!). Absolutely no effort was made when transferring this to DVD. Have a copy of the text handy if you expect to understanding anything that is being said at certain points."},{"rating":"2","title":"Olivier is the best Lear ever....","review":"The traditional difficulties of the play--the geographical ambiguities and broad scope of the scenes---and of playing King Lear (the actor needs to be old enough to be believable and yet if he's too old, he doesn't have the tremendous emotional and physical resources to play the role the way it must be played)--are overcome in this absolutely beautiful performance.I always have thought that Olivier gave his all to this particular production, as if it were his last. The starkness of the set focuses all attention on the characters, and Olivier is exactly the Lear I always thought Lear should be. The supporting cast is tremendous and the relationship between the Fool and Lear is wonderfully developed. John Hurt creates real depth and humanity in his Fool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bloody amazing","review":"When you consider the physical condition Olivier was in, his performance is pretty damn good. The supporting cast are mostly excellent, with Diana Rigg a standout as a venal, vicious, voracious, yet strangely feline and alluring Regan, and Dorothy Tutin not far behind as a grabby and lustful Goneril. Leo McKern is the definitive Gloucester."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but I prefer Olivier in Othello","review":"This is another terrific performance from Olivier and a very talented cast. Has Olivier ever had a bad role? I really don't think so. He certainly makes this his own, but I still prefer his performance in \\"Othello\\". In terms of productions of King Lear however this is top-notch. Any Shakespeare aficionado should view this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique and brilliant","review":"This book, which is poetry, pop culture, psychoanalysis and much more, made me laugh out loud.

She kicks and smiles for a good 15-20 minutes straight!To dispel some of the other reviews:My child's length is in the 85% percentile (not legless).She doesn't grab at the toys overhead, she kicks them and that is fun to her.It's super easy to put together.There ARE English instructions, it's page 1 of a 20 page manual, each page is a different language.

So maybe it willbe good toy for baby to use with hand- rather then kick toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has hurt my little boy- I hate this toy!!!!","review":"I absolutely HATE THIS TOY!I bought it for my 8 month old boy, so he could play with it when he stayed at his cradle.Unfortunately, this toy is very badly engineered! The first time my boy played with it, we pulled the white top part with his hands, it fell back and crushed against his little face.I was absolutely terrified when I saw the skin around his left eye growing purple to the size of a berry, while the poor baby cried his lungs out.Thank God, nothing happened to his eyeball, but he's now with a big swollen purple area all around it.I am returning this toy TODAY, and I strongly advise careful parents NOT TO BUY this for their babies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok for tummy time, useless for anything else","review":"My 3 month old son is already way too big for this product. I agree with the previous reviewers, there was no thought put into the design.

The part that he's supposed to kick doesn't activate the sounds and lights or make an interesting noise.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was looking for a toy for my 3 month old Grandson who loves to kick. I remember having a toy like this for my youngest child; he loved kicking the bar and making things move. The huge difference is when my Grandson kicks the blue feet, it just makes a sound. No lights or actions occur unless you reach up and touch the items on the top (white section). By the time my grandson will be big enough to reach what is on top (the yellow butterfly, red flower, and the clear round ball) he won't be lying down on his back kicking.

Grillet writes clearly and concisely and leaves several challenging (but doable) proofs to the reader. His wry sense of humor is also reflected in his writing.On some subjects, it is more of a survey of topics (such as category theory, universal algebras, exterior products), the point of which only becomes clear after one needs to use these tools in other areas.If you are new to the subject, however, the texts by Dummit and Foote or Fraleigh, e.g., are more appropriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"A bad textbook I have read for algebra.The author seems to be complicating every concept thats simple to understand.Also most of the proofs given are not straight forward and forces you to refer to some other books for a clear understanding and definitions of the same concepts given in the book.Not at all recommended.Better buy a Fraleigh or Herstein or Thomas Hungerford even if your teacher recommends this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"In an excellent recording, the Locrian Ensemble provides a marvelous performance of Schubert's only string quintet; arguably the most enjoyable performance and recording available of this masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"A moving world","review":"A historical piece demonstrates how far world had moved from the last century seventies of which tunes still make stadiums filled with concertgoers worldwide.Nice nostalgic work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy, yet elegant bowl.","review":"The name of the product sums it up.

I am not so familiar with Ellen Guon's work.Bedlam's Bard was not an example of good writing, something of which I know Mercedes Lackey is capable. I nearly stopped reading it in the middle, something I rarely do.It is disjointed. It is redundant. It over-explains. The relationships between characters range from unhealthy to downright creepy even when you can tell the authors mean them to be positive. There is a surplus of reversed-in-the-nick-of-time near death experiences. It lacks depth and cohesion overall.The idea behind the story could be clever, but the application is very poor.If you wish to read books by these authors, I would choose something else. And I WOULD try something else by either writer before deciding all of their works are this poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good books, but they've been out before!","review":"BEDLAM'S BARD is a combination of two of Lackey's previously published books, KNIGHT OF GHOSTS AND SHADOWS and SUMMONED TO TOURNEY. Both are good books, but beware of buying them, all unknowing, under this new title. It's been some years since the second one came out; there was supposed to be at least one more in the series, but it hasn't materialized. The first two set high enough standards that I'd buy it if it did."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shame it's a repeat. I was looking forward to new stuff.","review":"The original printing, (1993) I believe, rates a 9.5 but it's very unfortunate that the publisher puts a new cover on old material. When I saw this book I was stunned. I thought 'Wow a new adventure'. After the first 5 pages it was 'Wait! I've read this before'. I would really love to see a new book with these characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE It's only a reprint.","review":"The original books are wonderful; but the publisher's idea to reprint two fairly recent books into one with only a small warning to faithful readers is terrible.

I came to this book with the idea of getting a good read from it.

Lackey brings these characters alive; You feel their pain and shock, their fear and their laughter. It's just fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just to overcome the...","review":"I'd normally give this book only 4 stars because I Never give 5, but the ... who only gave it one star based on the fact that they did not undertand the writing forced me to up it one.This book is great. The situations are realistic. One detractor complained about 'endless near-death escpaes'(something like that), but that is the one thing that I identified with. Eric is battling himself as much as any 'villian' in the book. His refusal to acknowledge his role leads, as it would in real life, to many pitfalls and situations. If you deny yourself, life seems to constantly put you in bad situations and frustrate you to no end until you get in line and follow your destiny.This book is very good and there are lessons to be learned in it. And if you don't like it, go back to reading \\"Star Trek\\" or something by Stephen King. :P"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Mercedes Lackey Book EVER","review":"Like most of the other readers to review this book I am a fan of Mercedes Lackey. I've enjoyed many of her series. I know she partners with different writers on various series and I've never noticed the writing suffer for it. I don't know if her choice of co-author is where this book went horribly wrong. Maybe it seems so awful because it was written 20+ years ago and Mrs.Lackey has dozens of books under her belt now. I just know I was excited to stumble across this series, that is until I read the first two chapters of this book. I kept going hoping it would get better and certain it couldn't get worse. I was wrong on both accounts. This is the worst book I've ever read with Mercedes Lackey as an author. In fact, it's one of the worst books I've ever read by ANY author. I expected an good story, what I got was 600+ pages of bird cage liner. Don't waste your money or your time reading the bad bard books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best yet.","review":"This is one of Misty's best.

The music manages to be both subtle and catchy, creating a mature sound that pairs extremely well with Jason's awesomely strong vocals. \\"At the Moon\\" and \\"Contagious\\" are the two best tracks, the former showcasing some amazingly addicting vocals and the latter being a great rock song that builds to a powerful finish. \\"With my Voice\\" is another great track. This is very different from Jason's previous work, but give it a chance and it will grow on you. The entire album rocks, with the exception of \\"The 21 Gun Salute\\", which is a mediocre song.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Theory mets Practice","review":"This book brings together the Kimball Groups solid work around Dimensional Modeling with Microsoft's latest version of SQL Server. While the other books by the Kimball Group have excelled on explaining Dimensional Modeling, they often fell short in giving practical advice for implementation. For example the ETL Toolkit frequently used awd, sed, etc. - although often found in legacy systems these tools generally aren't the first choice when building a new DW. The Microsoft Data Warehouse Toolkit took the hit (chose a vendor) and uses SQL Server's Integration Services, Analysis Services, Reporting Services, etc. to build very practical and useful examples. And through excellent use of references to the other Kimball Group books and a \`conformed' terminology approach this book serves as an excellent guide for building a Data Warehouse in SQL Server 2005."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Is About Process","review":"This is a very good book about the process of building a DW/BI application.

Eventually I skipped this first 43 pages of introduction plus 120 first pages of the book proper. I felt the authors were more interested in using esoteric language than actually showing how to use the product. If you're trying to baffle someone with tech-speak, this is the book for you. If you have a deadline, and are trying to actually accomplish something, I would suggest looking elsewhere. Disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok as a basic strap","review":"Seems ok as a basic strap for camcorder. My canon optura s1 did not come with the strap, it works fine with it.

Looks like cannon wants you to pay extra bucks for these features."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid performance","review":"While this is a solid performance by Jeff Lynne, Richard Tandy, and others, it lacks the energy of a truly live ELO concert \\"back in the day.\\" The string section ladies are clad in slinky black dresses instead of bouncing around the stage like the original band used to do. This may partly be due to the size of the venue - this isn't an arena performance, it's more intimate, like a TV studio audience.That being said, the music itself is spot on. They obviously rehearsed well for this performance. It's obviously live, not looped, but the performances are almost note for note. Hits are included from both the Zoom album and previous ELO standards. Includes a new saucer, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"E.L.O. still rocks","review":"Great DVD. One of my favorites. They sound exactly as if they were in the studio. Because it's a small indoor concert - you don't hear a lot of crowd noise. You feel like you are in the front row. I personally enjoy this type of venue better than large stadium events. It's like watching them live in your living room. Wait until you see the fire extinguisher - I'll leave it at that. Wait until you see the great looking babe singing backup - let's face it Jeff Lynne isn't much to look at. Buy this DVD - they will never have another as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"Zoom is rather disappointing for true ELO fans, the performance of earlier ELO material is rather lacking in substance and commitment (but not talent), the chemistry on stage is clearly lacking despite Jeff's excellent guitar and vocal talent, perhaps a link up with ELO Part 2 would have restored the former excellence of live performances, Jeff Lynne was not ELO, it was a collective of highly talented artists, the core of Zoom is in effect Jeff Lynne's tribute to ELO.The new material from Zoom is brilliant, Jeff is an excellent musician in his own right, rather than prostitute the name of the former ELO it is quite bewildering why Jeff Lynne did not go for it under his own name with Zoom, he certainly has the credibility.Verdict: If you want true ELO save you money and buy the DVD \\"Out of the Blue\\" Tour."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent sound, great songs, ok performance","review":"The DTS and 5.1 sound on this DVD are outstanding, Much better than most recent concerts. I loved the song selection-great hits mixed with solid new material. The video editting was also good. Not alot of jarring cuts or hyperactive camera motion. It had a flow to it that I appreciated tremendously after suffering through so many poorly conceived concert DVD's. (Cheryl Crow 2003 for example). The only thing missing was an exciting stage show. Jeff seems shy and very happy to be in front of a small crowd in a TV studio. Buy this one for the great songs and the superb sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ambience style and good quality","review":"I have enjoyed ELO since school overseas (Iran)! Its great getting a high-quality sounding concert. The 20+ songs versus the price is outstanding. I was skeptical due to the fact it is a 'concert' in a studio - CBS's apparently.

There is just something missing from this dvd. No energy and the sound is somewhat stale. I'm not sure if there are original band members missing on this, but it does not sound like the crisp ELO albumns that I have. Jeff's voice to me is kind of off par on this performance as well.Just a dull DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap, We are only in it for the money tour","review":"Possibly the worst concert video I have seenJeff Lynne is so bored, no wonder he wears glasses through the show, he is probably asleepThe girl next to him looks bored too. And what a place to film a concert, in a TV studio.This is probably why ticket sales were so underwhelmingThe only candidate for a worse performance is the 10CC Feel the Benefit DVD, Filmed on thier 1993 tour of Japan (which is only interesting due to the Japanes English subtitling mistakes) they also wear sunglasses and looked totally uninterested.If you want to see old rockers do it well, get the Who live at the Royal Albert Hall in 2000, or Roger Waters In the Flesh 2000At least they look the audience in the eyes!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good quality dvd, awful quality performance","review":"Why oh why was this concert issued as a dvd?

Nearly all of his hits from his ELO days are included and performed in such a way that sounds very close to the way that ELO fans know them! There are no interruptions in the show either. All of the bonus material is kept separate part of the disc as it should be.Collectors of concert DVDs will enjoy the excellent camera / production work and expecially the live concert feel of the show.

I must admit, I was once again turned on to ELO via the JC Penneys commercials that aired during the Christmas season 2005. What wonderful memories from my childhood in Lake Arrowhead, California. After watching a few commercials, I knew I needed to find their music and purchase online. I found this DVD...a great find indeed! It is simply unfortunate that their tour in 2001 was not better promoted as I would have definitley attended once their \\"spaceship\\" landed in Southern Cal! \\"Livin'Thing,\\" \\"Strange Magic,\\" \\"Telephone Line,\\" so many great hits.

It has many hits covering a span of years dating back to 1972. Jeff Lynne still has it, by gosh! The audio is the best for a concert recording I've heard in a while in 5.1 DTS and 5.1 Digital Surround. The video is crisp and is enhanced for wide screen TV's. It looks great on 65 inch wide screen, to say the least. All of the songs were played faithfully to the way they were originally recorded. This is probably the best thing besides actually being there. I still hold out hopes that there may still be a tour at some point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zoom DVD","review":"This is a Wish come true - ELO stuff has been hard to get in the past years.

But wow, what a great performance, every song done good. But one thing this concert did to me was, made me depressed. How can Jeff Lynne call it ELO without Bev Bevan or Kelly Groucutt??? His girlfriend is a fine singer but her swaying and motions are annoying. Well I guess someone had to step in for Hugh McDougall. But seriously, I only got this DVD to see Jeff Lynne sing and play guitar. If you want the REAL ELO, just get the CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding performance... but what would you expect?","review":"As with all Jeff Lynne productions, this DVD concert performance is outstanding.

What an addition to traditional Okinawa Karate. This is not another book of complicated and questionable techniques or weird physiological theories.When I first scanned the chapters and their contents I quickly realized this is a work that is needed and long time coming. Regardless of ones style or system, when it comes to discerning each move of ones kata, this is the book.I have been studying my martial art for 36 years, and this is not only the best martial art book on kata I own, but a work in a league of its own.If you obtain the book for just the fifteen general principles to identify effective kata techniques and the twelve discrete rules for deciphering martial applications, it will be well worth it.Michael E.

I was hoping for more up-beat songs like it, but was incredably depressed when the other 12 songs on the CD turned out to be love songs. If you like \\"Genie In a Bottle\\" like I did, don't get this, get the single CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Future Superstar!","review":"Miss Aguilera is on her way to becoming a superstar.

She is not just a pop icon and teen idol but she actually has good talent! () She's really good! Buy the CD! I listened to it over and over on a 6 hour trip and I still wasn't bored!"},{"rating":"2","title":"i might not like alot of the songs, but she has a good voice","review":"THe strength of her voice makes even the horrible songs on this album bearable. I was overjoyed when she won the Grammy, I think it was well deserved. My personal fave in What a Girl Wants. I think this is where the sheer force of her vocals stands out the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Platnum Blonde with Good Voice","review":"We LOVE the song \\"Genie in a Bottle\\" by Christina Aguilera but we HATE her platnium Blonde hair. I have to say she has more talent then Britney Spears who is a studio production but the hair stands out. I do agree with her though that she gets critizied for showing her stomach while N'Sync is doing disgusting innapropriate moves in there break dancing and nobody pays attention. A good Album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bye Bye Mariah Carey!!!","review":"Christina is very talented. Her voice is one in a million. She deserves the best. She's come a long way from MMC. I only gave it 4 stars because there are like one or two songs that weren't that great. She needs a little better material for a voice like hers. \\"Reflection\\" and \\"I Turn To You\\" show what great talent she has. And she is nothing like Britney Spears, how can people compare her to Britney? Britney can't sing to save her life. Mariah move over girl, Christina is going to rock the music scene!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"The CD is great.It has many good tracks.Some tracks are just cheesy bubblegum pop but they are still good.Christina Aguilera has a wonderfull voice that can be compared to Mariah Carey.And Christina Aguilera is much much better than Britney Spears, thank you very much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Christina sizzles on this album.","review":"The minute I turned on my stereo and popped in this CD, I fell immediately in love with Christina's voice. Her mature voice puts her right along the ranks of Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey. In fact, I think she does it better than they do!The songs range from modern-pop to sultry ballads. \\"So Emotional\\" had a jazzy nightclub feel to it, which was very refreshing.All in all, Christina is definitely here to stay. Sorry Britney, but it looks like you've met your match."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christina Aguilera","review":"This CD is pretty good. Most of the songs are good and rather good. Except, after a while, it can get a little annoying. The songs Genie In A Bottle, What A Girl Wants, I Turn To You, So Emotional, Come On Over, and Relflection are all great. After that, the album seems to go downward. Personally, I think Britney Spears is a better singer, with a little more original songs. But, if you want a great pop CD, buy this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BOMB CD","review":"This CD is the best! I love singing and dancing along to it!

I don't find her particularly soulful. She thinks she can be the best by oversinging and screeching.Another thing. I am sick of her and her fans's attitude towards Beyonce. I am not a fan of Beyonce either but Christina and her fans are just pure haters. Beyonce does sing better IMO. Her tones are better than \\"Xtina's\\" who tries to sing beyond her limits."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!!","review":"I am the biggest fan of Christina Aguilera, and one listen to this disc, and you'll know why. She is an amazing person with an equally amazing voice. Her first single, \\"Genie in a Bottle\\" has already topped the charts, thanks to the catchy beat and Christina's talent. She flaunts her vocal skills on the beautiful Diana Warren ballad \\"I Turn To You.\\" Her remake of the 80s hit \\"So Emotional\\" will get you feeling emotional about Christina. All in all, this album? A++!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She is better than Mariah or Whitney!","review":"Christina is probably the best singer I've ever heard; just listen to \\"I Turn to You\\". She has the greatest voice ever!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Christina lets Her Inner 'Genie' out","review":"By far the best of the batch of girl singers from last year's pop explosion, Christina Aguilera made a name for herself with the slinky hit'Genie in a Bottle'. That song remains probably her best vocal performance to date, if only to remind us that she can show subtlety and charm when guided wisely by her producers. On the other hand ,she also enjoys being a graduate of the Mariah Carey School of Vocal Acrobatics, as she displays on such tunes as 'I Turn to You' and 'Reflection'. If she can get past the hollow over-emoting that she seems to admire so much, she can easily manage to sustain a commercially, and critically, successful career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not many weaknesses here","review":"Christina Aguilera's debut album is a very solid effort. The only real weakness is the fact that the album sounds a little more \\"pop\\" than it should. But that factor certainly doesn't drastically decrease the enjoyment of listening to this album.The variety of musical styles on this album is amazing. While pop overtones covers most of the album, Christina dabbles in several other musical genre's (and quite well too). There's a bit of folk in the original mix of \\"What A Girl Wants\\", a very R&B feel to the bouncy vocal-playground \\"So Emotional\\". She proves her ability with ballads with the beautiful \\"I Turn To You\\" and \\"Obvious\\", and also does breezy pop with \\"Love For All Seasons\\" and \\"Come On Over\\". Overall, this album has solid songs from start to finish.I hope Christina does more exploring of musical genre's outside of pop in the future. I have a feeling we've only seen the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shes really not your average pop star","review":"First off, lets stop all Britney Spears comparisons here because they are not very similar at all. I really like this album a lot, and unlike the few other \\"teenybopper\\" albums I like (BSB's \\"Millenium\\" and 98 degrees and Rising) its actually the singer that makes the album great, not the writing. The songs are a cut above the average pop album because they've got more R&B in them but Christinas vocals are really what makes this album work. Her voice is really awsome, tracks like \\"So Emotional\\" and \\"Come On Over\\" would be nothing if anyone else sang them but they're awesome because of her. The ballads on here are really really good,especially \\"Obvious\\" and \\"Blessed\\". I can't wait for Christinas next album, It will be even better than this one. If you're a fan of pop or R&B, I highly suggest this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nathan's review","review":"Good cd I liked almost all the tracks except track 2 their ses arent syncronized it drives me crazy when I listen to it. She should have used a diffrent backup who can folow her lead and end insync."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great CD!","review":"Sure, she's pretty with a great voice. I can understand why she could be idolized by some, I admit her songs have much meaning and some even mean a lot to me, but she sings WAY too much about sex, and though the tune of \\"Genie In a Bottle\\" is quite catchy, and VERY-I mean EXTREMELY well written, the basis of the whole song has become a bit corny. But everyone MUST admit she's got a gorgeous voice and face and isn't likely to become a star of yesterday any time soon. Anyone who SAYS her voice is horrible is simply jealous. I didn't buy this CD but have heard it everywhere-all the songs and quite a few times. So, way to go Christina-just please make your lyrics cleaner, okay?"},{"rating":"1","title":"In all Honesty...","review":"She has a wonderful voice, and I really liked \\"Genie in A Bottle.\\" However, the song's gotten overplayed on the radio and I got sick of it. The best song on the album is \\"Reflection.\\" I love the ballads, but in contrast, the dance songs are a little head-acky (if you know what I mean)with the exception of \\"Genie in a Bottle\\" and \\"Come on Over.\\" I'm a little uncertain about \\"Obvious,\\" because it's nice but needs a little work. Maybe better music? \\"So Emotional\\" and \\"I Turn to You\\" were fantastic, but the reason I'm rating this two stars, is that I think she could obviously do better than that.I hope she will, and I wish her success."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!","review":"This is a great CD. And Christina started the blonde pop princess thing. Her song \\"Reflection\\" was released before \\"baby one more time\\", which, by the way, stinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"*great* voice, so-so songs.","review":"Christina's got a wonderful voice, no doubt about it. But I'd prefer if she put away the clearly unoriginal pop songs (\\"Come on Over\\", \\"Love For All Seasons\\", or \\"Somebody's Somebody\\") and showcased her vocals more. \\"I Turn To You\\" does just that, but after listening to that particular song many times, I've realized that it's not a very good SONG, I just really like the SINGER. Nice try, Christina, great for a debut, but next time let's show some new stuff. (I do like \\"What A Girl Wants\\" quite a lot, however.)PS> Comparing Christina to Britney: Christina has, unquestionably, a better voice, but even though their songs are made of the same material, I like the SONGS on Britney's new album (not old) better than on Christina's. Christina is also way overdue for some new stuff. And, what's with her fake Latina accent? I love her to pieces but it pisses me off!"},{"rating":"2","title":"her best album","review":"this is her best album. i like 8 out of 12 songs on this album and its amazing. a really great album and one of the best of the 90s"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good beginning.","review":"This album is not good, but it's not that bad.Christina's voice was already powerful, and songs like \\"I turn to you\\" and \\"Reflection\\" are great.But the majority of the songs are poor and meaningless.Forget this CD and buy rather \\"Stripped\\", which is so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh wow","review":"Originally, I hated Christina Aguilera. I thought she would just turn out like another Britney Spears. Then, I listened to her voice on the radio and decided not to write her off so quickly. Then I bought her CD and was hooked. She has such a great voice and a great attitude towards life. I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes the Mariah Carey type and/or the Britney Spears/Mandy Moore/Jessica Simpson type."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it NOW!","review":"My Gosh, i'm soooo glad i bought this album, where would i be without it? I love all the upbeat songs on here ('What a girl wants', 'Come on over', and 'When you put your hands on me'. The ballads are beautiful esp.'Turn to you' which shows off her AMAZING vocal talents. 'Somebody's somebody' and 'Blessed' are my faves as they stick in my head. This truly is a brilliant album, although some people don't like 'Obvious' for some reason, i personally love it. To finish off, DON'T compare this girl to Britney, they're both completely different and just as good as each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christina is the BOMB!","review":"i am usually picky on music but when i heard christinia, i loved it. if she is reading this: KEEP WRITING AND SINGING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MOVE OVER BRITNEY!!!!THIS GIRLS IS THE BOMB!!!!","review":"I CANNOT BELIEVE PEOPLE DO NOT LIKE THIS ALBUM!!! I THINK IT IS THE BOMB!!! SHE HAS MAGNIFICENT VOICE AND SHE IS ABLE TO DANCE WITHOUT LOOKING LIKE A ROBOT--LIKE SOMEONE ELSE THAT I WILL NOT NAME. I AM A TRUE R&B FAN, BUT HER ALBUM IS A MIXTURE OF BOTH R&B AND POP, GIVEN THE WAY SHE SAANGS EVEN THE POP TRACKS SOUND GOOD!! EVERYONE SHOULD CONCENTRATE ON HER TALENT AND NOT THE WAY SHE LOOKS!!! COME ON PEOPLE, GIVE THE GIRL HER PROPS, DON'T HATE ON THE GIRL!!! CHRISTINA, DO YOUR THANG GIRRL!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocked!","review":"I have to admit that I didn't think Christina Aguilera would be any good because my first thoughts were Britney Spears copy. And we all know Spears won't make it past CD2 unless she strips naked on the cover. Anyways, when I heard Aguilera, I have to say that she has one heck of a voice. Her songs are weak but her voice is incredibly strong. If she can get a stronger repertoire she'll do really well."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect..","review":"I'm Korean. I think Christina has very powerfull, beautiful voice. My English is not good, but I like her so much I'm leaving this memo.I was felt something different by listen \\"What a girl wants\\". Its begining is very special. And we also feel power and her abilities, \\"come on over baby\\"I announce that album is very great."},{"rating":"2","title":"3.5 actually; Christina does Whitney Houston","review":"Christina imitates Whitney Houston in many of her songs and two of the songs are Houston's. One is talented if they can imitate Houston, however critics should point out that that is indeed an imitation. But in all fairness to Houston Christina does not have the full range of Whitney Houstons voice: e.g. listen to Houston's \\"I Will Always Love You\\" or her earliest hit \\"Greatest Love of All\\". The various awards shows give credit to the Christina songs that are not imitations of Houston e.g. Genie in a Bottle and What a Girl Wants and I think that is fair. Other than that for those songs which she does not do an imitation she does it well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will Be Around for Some Time","review":"I remember feeling the same away about another artist ten years ago: great voice, sultry looks, good debut song, and a consistently super first album. My judgment of that performer was accurate. Thus, Mariah has been with us for a decade.Christina has the same potential! The torch has been passed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummmmm NO......","review":"Christina's voice isn't bad, but she carries out the songs for soooo long they never end. She tries to much like to be Mariha Carey and maskes her own talent. The relesed singles aren't bad but don't reflect the rest of the aweful album. If you are an interested buyer I'd pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"ROMANTIC pop queen!","review":"Christina has a ROMANTIC tone to her voice and she CAN sing a lot better than Britney Spears. My favorite songs by Christina are \\"What a Girl Wants\\"and \\"Blessed.\\" I actually like all her songs but those two are my favorites. Her cd really is the best I have ever bought. Keep it up Christina! YOU GO GIRL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great voice but..","review":"I bought this CD after hearing What a Girl Wants. While I think she's got a great voice, I was disappointed with the rest of the CD. I'm in my mid-twenties and the music is aimed at a much younger generation."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS CD!","review":"This CD is so great! It hasn't left my CD player ever since I bought it. I'm so happy I bought it too. Christina outshines all the other teen girls out there. Her voice is absolutely beautiful. When she belts out those ballads, I get goosebumps. I can't wait to see what's in the future for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Try, Hon, But Still No Trophy","review":"First, the good stuff: Christina Aguilera's debut has two first-rate singles: \\"Genie in a Bottle\\" and \\"What a Girl Wants.\\" Both songs have personality, spunk, and they nicely compliment Aguilera's powerful voice. But it's Snoozeville from here. \\"I Turn to You\\" is just a dreary ballad (it's written by Diane Warren--big shocker), and not much else on the album catches fire. It's a particularly frustrating listen, considering how vocally talented Aguliera really is. I just hope she won't go the way of 1990's Mariah and settle for goopy ballads and soulless dance tunes that do her no justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beverly Sills/Joan Sutherland","review":"Both Beverly Sills and Joan Sutherland can outsing Christina Aguilera any day. Sure Aguilera hits a high E above middle C in the climax of \\"Reflection\\", but the two aforementioned sopranos do it all the time. In fact, both sopranos can hit E naturals and E sharps. Sills can even hit a high F. Sutherland's high notes are HUGE. And both of these sopranos are masters of coloratura. If Christina tried to sing coloratura, she would ruin her vocal cords!"},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing you haven't heard before!","review":"...This album contains so much filler.

She needed to market her songs a bit more to give her fans knowledge of what they were about to buy. Otherwise it was a good CD, and I hope everyone enjoy's it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not all that","review":"The only reason I gave this album 2 stars is for effort... personally, the album needs a lot of help. All the songs are slow (except genie), so if you crave pop/dance and or beautiful ballads that bring tears to your eyes, then this is not the album for you. It just doesn't get it- some of her songs sound like you've already heard them, (i.e. Whitney, Mariah). I actually think Britney Spears' album is more interesting, and her voice drives me nuts! Riding \\"Genie in a bottle\\" 's success will be easy, but I'm sure she'll be gone before long. So better luck next time, CA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrow from a friend first","review":"I, myself, made the mistake of buying this cd first. I like(d) \\"Genie In A Bottle\\", but the rest of the album isn'tas good as that song. i found myself getting tried for Aguilera's voice. And, she really isn't like Britney Spears, who people compare her to. (I happen to like Britney's music better, it has more edge.) Some of the songs on this album sound out of place of some-sorts. But, on the other hand, there are some other good tunes. Moreover, \\"Genie\\", a good choice for the first single, in my opinion is the song stand-out good song on the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's grea........alright.","review":"Its a good album I will say, she does have an excellent voice, but she is just another artist who will be lost in 10 years. Did you see her at the VMA's she looked like she worked on the street corner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising","review":"Not exactly someone who will be around for a long time. But this album is definitely better than Britney Spears's junk. However this album lacks consistency and theme. This is one album you know you will listen to it for a while and then cold-storage it forever until someone mentions her name again in the future. However, comparing to Britney Spears's CD, this is a gem after all..."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY BORING SONGS!!","review":"Ok, fist off let me tell u that christina has a very good voice, but her songs are very very very boring...gosh i practially feel asleep listening to \\"Somebody's somebody\\" and \\"Love for all seasons\\" what a corny song. If she's even thinks she's going to be the next Mariah Carey or Britney Spears she's gonna have to start sellin LOTS more.... The only good songs on this album are \\"Geanie in a bottle\\", \\"I turn to you\\" and \\"come on over baby\\".Probably the WORST songs on this album are \\"Somebody's somebody\\", \\"what a girl wants\\" (thats such an annoying song) and \\"love for all seasons\\"the other songs on the album are better but still not good. The only song i've heard that i LOVE by christina is \\"Lady Marmalade\\" with Mya, Pink and Lil Kim. This album is a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT A GIRL WANTS","review":"THIS IS A REALLY GOOD SONG I LOVE IT MY BOYFRIEND PLAYED IT AT B- DAY PARTY AND IT MADE ME HAPPY BUT WAHT I REALLY WANTED YOU TO KNOW IS THAT I WAS SO HAPPY WHEN YOU WON THE GRAMMY I MEAN I DONT LIKE BRITNEY AND I WAS HOPING SHE DID NOT WIN AND YOU WON I AM VERY HAPPY FOR YOU AND HOPE YOU ENJOY LIFE TO THE FULIEST AND REMEMBER I WILL BE ROUTING FOR YOU ALL THE WAY DONT FORGET HAVE A GREAT LIFE"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD I own.......","review":"This really is the best CD I own.

I especially like the songs: I Turn To You, Blessed, and Love Will Find A Way."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love this cd","review":"Christina Aguilera should not be compared to Britney Spears. Sure..they are both teenage girls but Christina is waaay more talented. This cd is great! I love Genie in a bottle, What a girl wants, Come on Over, all the songs are good! She is reaally talented and I know she has a great future."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best CD on earth","review":"The first song on the album is one of her hit songs witch could get boring after a while, but the rest of the tracks are pure talented singing and is a memory of a lifetime. Her songs may sound very sexual but personally i think she is singing about passion and respect and she is my favorite singer for that reason. I hope everybody in the world could hear her voice at least once! Thats enough to get you addicted to this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She's Awesome!","review":"After I heard Genie in a Bottle I fell in love with her voice. A very strong and beautiful voice.

Genie is 4 stars!","review":"In some of the reviws, u lot say that CA didn't write Genie, but I just wanted to say that CA did write the hook in Genie, or so she says...I haven't got the album, but I do have Genie, which I like a lot, but it won't be remembered in say, 5 years. If I bought the album, I'd probably give it 2 stars because it has loads of ballads on, which I'm not fond of... although Savage Garden is 4 stars! What can I say, I have a thing for Daz!

I, personally, would not be suprised if she won every award imaginable."},{"rating":"2","title":"STRONG DEBUT","review":"CHRISTINA'S VOCALS HAVE BEEN COMPARED TO THAT OF WHITNEY AND MARIAH AND SHE MEETS AND SURPASSES THE CROWNED DIVAS.

I READ THE OTHER REVIEWS BEFORE I BOUGHT THE CD AND THEY LOVED AND I WASN'T DISAPPOINTED!"},{"rating":"2","title":"?????????","review":"This CD was pretty good. My favorite ones were the ones played on the radio, so if you liked those you will probably like the whole CD. The only reason I gave it a four instead of a five is the fact that it was all slow songs at the end, and a mix in the beginning, so their is more slow songs than fast. Some people that would't bother, I just like the fast songs best. If you are looking at this CD and you weren't sure because you mostly like adult contemperary, I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Britney Spears? NOT!","review":"Though Christina may seem like just another one of those BRitney Spearses, She's not. Unlike Britney Spears, the songs on this cd show her vocal talent, and aren't all sythesized. My favorite song is blessed, but all the others are good too. If you want a good CD, buy this one. Don't get me wrong, I like Britney, but Christina has some true talent and this cd actually shows it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okaaaaay","review":"Most of songs are just bubblegum music. However, she is one of the brave activists who has tried to stop Britney Spears from taking over the world, and I have to give her credit for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool CD","review":"This CD is really cool. It has a lot of great songs. My favorties are Turn to You, What A Girl Wants, Come on Over, and Reflection. Some of the songs are kinda slow, like I Turn to You, but some are faster, like Come On Over. It's good for people who like a mixture of slow and fast songs"},{"rating":"1","title":"Its Ok but i've heard better...............","review":"This album doesn't reflect christina's true talents. Yeah, she has the voice which is shown in the slow ballad \\"I turn to you\\" but \\"what a girl wants\\" and \\"genie in a bottle\\" is lacking in some places. The rest of the album isn't constructed well (in other words they are not shouting \\"CHART HITS!\\") and i dont think any of the songs would reach top 20 especially since \\"i turn to you\\" just got to number 19. All around i would say that she has the voice for slow songs but cannot hit the spot with the up-tempo songs (even though she trys!) Buy this album for the ballads and try \\" I WANNA BE WITH YOU\\" album by Mandy Moore and \\"OOPS.....I DID IT AGAIN\\" album by Britney Spears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmm, So-so","review":"I liked the first single a lot but since then all her releases have got less good. Much of the album is drippy ballards, which are no good at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 3 good songs...","review":"The only songs that I liked were Genie, Girl Wants and Reflection. The rest is pop filler. Christina's voice is okay but the material (other than the tracks above) isn't anything special or original. It's true that Christina sings circles around the other white teen singers (Britney, Jessica & Mandy) but her voice isn't complimented by any of this throw-away bland music. She is very Mariah Carey-isk at times and soars during breaks, but cannot completely shine on this material. The last note of the last song is is an example, but it's a shame that it's the only good part of the song, plus the music ends weird, likes there should be more. I would love to have that Christmas song included on the album to add another quality track but I guess I'll have to deal with the this 3 song album. She's no Shanice or Monica, but Christina does has potential. She just needs better material."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Next Diva","review":"Absolutely, one of the brightest talents in music today. With the strong voice and the \\"look\\", Christina Aguilera will be around for a long time. From the soft \\"I Turn to You\\" to the catchy \\"Come on Over\\", Miss Aguilera shows that she can handle any type of song that comes her way. Move over Mariah, Celine, and Britney; cause here comes Christina!!! This debut cd is a classic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"She's Getting There","review":"Christina has a gorgeous voice, no doubt about that. But I really hate her songs, lyrics, music whatever. She also is such a major copycat. Britney was here first and Christina's getting the Grammy and the credit. If you want to get the CD, then definitely listen to the clips first. Then decide. But I definitely reccomend Britney Spears' and Jessica Simpson's CD. They both have great voices but as a bonus...they're songs are actually worth listening too."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"She turns to me\\", and spray my face with her angry screams","review":"I thought she was good. I thought she was very good. She sounded great and talented in her record. But if you ever had the chance to hear her live performances. When she sang the song \\"I turn to you\\", she destroys it with her seemingly angry yells and overly exuberant energies. It is a soft love song, Miss Aquelira, I need to remind you. We want to hear your emotions and feelings, not your hard, tough notes with screams mixed in between. Believe me, they will not spice your songs up. The record sounds good, but she oversings it in her live performances Soft it up a little"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tremedous Promise for what? Being DIRRRRRRTTTYYY!?!!","review":"This Album is good in the sense of all her released songs are cool: \\"Genie\\",\\"What a girl wants\\",\\"Come on over\\",\\"Reflection\\", all the rest is absolutely boring like her next CD, yes she has tremedous talent, but when people compare her to Britney then they are fooled by what Christina is now, really dirrty like in \\"Dirrty\\" and \\"Cant hold us down\\" videos. This CD is boring 97% it will put me to sleep more than counting sheep over a fence does!Fans will NOT agree with me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing voice which needs to be heard.","review":"This girl is one of the most amazing singers on air tonight. The way she can control her voice is just fabulous. I think people and underestimate Christina Aguilera and what she's able to do. On this album she shows that she can really sing. One of her song is alot alike Mariah Careys songs. That's the one I think it's a little bit less good. It contains 12 both clatchy and sad/touching songs. Worth buying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't think so","review":"The only reason I'm giving her two stars is for trying. The only good songs are \\"Genie in a Bottle\\" and \\"What a Girl Wants\\". I asked my friend if he could bring it over to my house to see how it was, I didn't like it. Besides, I can't stand her voice. I think this CD is a waste of money, but hey, you're free to think she's the best singer in the world, but for me, she's at the bottem of my list."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"its a lot better than her recent album, but its still a bad album. only 2 songs are good. the rest is pure crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want to give it 0 stars","review":"I bought this album after everyone kept comparing her to my fav. singer Britney. Except her voice and lyrics it's crap compared to Britney's albums. Her voice is a gift she was born with and no effort of hers. Britney's voice is crap but her songs are way more better. This self-titled abum has the same sort of songs except my fav- Genie in the bottle. Britney's better anyday and has a bigger variety of songs. Please don;t waste your money only to listen to her beautiful voice. Just download the songs. Buy any of britney's albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAP AND WEAK DEBUT RECORD","review":"Undeniable is that Aguilera's voice is strong. But her debut album is simply boring, done in a rush way(no wonder after Genie all her singles releases were remixed for radio outlets), and production is weak and simple. The singles are top(except I TURN TO YOU a Whitney-a-like song), but the rest of the album is pure crap. So differenet from her sophomore album, wich surpases in every way this obviously cheap pop album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very strong voice and beautiful face on such a young girl","review":"We thought the Genie In A Bottle song would be a hitthe first time we heard it.This young lady is verytalented and I am surprisedwe have'nt heard of her sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart and Sassy","review":"Not excatally a refeshment from some of the other songs that you hear on the radio...but it is smart,snazzy, ans sassy. I have always like that in music. She is very pretty and talented, but I still think that she is young and needs to grow. I can't wait until then, but this is a fairly nice cd and not to be discouraged."},{"rating":"2","title":"A strong voice and catchy tunes make for a good album!","review":"Christina has a pretty strong voice, and she has soul. I really like this album. My favorites are \\"Genie..\\", \\"Reflection,\\", \\"Come On Over\\", and \\"Blessed\\". On some of the songs she sounds like Whitney Houston! Yeah I think comparing her to Britney is a lot of bull too, they're both good in different ways. Britney is more pop and Christina is more soul...with a stronger voice. A good album to have. I recommend it! ^_^"},{"rating":"2","title":"This girl has got mega talent!","review":"I gave it four stars cuz I didn't like some of the songs, but her voice is awesome. I listen to it so much that my sister gets frustrated when I put the CD on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great collection-really good!!!","review":"If you like Robyn, Mariah Carey, or Whitney Housten you will defitantly like Christina Aguilera. This is a very nice c-d, with some mixture of slow, jumpy and smoothe songs. My favorite songs are Genie in A Bottle, What A Girl Wants, Reflection, So Emotional, Come on Over and I Turn To U. She's defitantly better than Britney Spears sogo out and buy this c-d!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Angel","review":"Christina Aguilera is an angel...in appearance and song. I bought this CD mainly for Genie in a Bottle, but you can imagine my excitement and pleasure to hear the rest of the tracks. This is one of the best love song CDs you will find. This CD is a must.!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A music fan","review":"I love christina's music and specially the song \\"genie in a bottle\\" she has a very nice voice and hope you keep it up oh I have one question are you Mexican or Latin by a chance?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Took me some time to like","review":"This album is somewhat confusing to listen to because the music in some songs aren't that good, like in \\"What a Girl Wants.\\" The music overall in the album sounds disorganized and not properly produced. It sounds like someone just threw all the instruments in there and mixed them up. That's how the music sounds like to me. The only upbeat song I really like is \\"Love Will Find a Way.\\" This album isn't bad though. I'm getting to like it. It's taken me awhile to like it, but it's starting to grow on me. Christina's voice is strong and mature, yet sounds annoying at times. I agree with the person who says borrow this album from a friend first because you might not like it when you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful voice, Terrible songs","review":"Christina is a truly talented girl, but she is just waisting her breath on this album. The only good song is \\"Genie...\\", and she didn't even write it. Bubblegum Pop is appealing to most young people, but in the long run won't get an artist anywhere. Christina should ditch her record label and start writing her own songs... songs that come from the heart. Maybe then her voice will sound even better then it already does."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT CD","review":"I PURCHASED THIS CD AND IT IS WONDERFUL.

I CAN'T WAIT FOR HER NEXT ALBUM."},{"rating":"2","title":"christinas the best!","review":"i thought christina was such a great singer when i got her cd and tonight i got to see her live at a concert and she is the best! she sounds way better , she is so pretty and she has a lot more talent than britney spears!britney is a good singer but christina is the best singer..i have never heard anyone sing so good! CHRISTINA ROCKS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"beautiful voice, awful CD","review":"Christina Aguilera is underestimated for these reasons:1) She's skinny, blonde, and bubbly. 2) She has a rather awful pop album.This girl has a beautiful voice. (Don't believe me? Go listen to her version of Etta James' \\"At Last\\".) Her talent is undeniable. But this album was obviously an attempt by her record company to fit her into the Britney Spears mold.The differences between Spears and Aguilera? Spears has minimal talent and beauty that will fade. It's easy to see Christina in 10 or 20 years as a beautiful older woman with an incredible voice. She is destined to be a diva, as long as her record company starts giving her more control.(...)As you listen to this album, you can hear her voice wanting to come out, and it's frustrating.The closest you get to hearing Aguilera's true talent is \\"I Turn To You\\". Bleh. Diane Warren.Let's hope the next CD is better.Pray for Christina."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh God! Not another one!....","review":"Ok, first her good point. Her voice makes Britney Spears sound almost hoarse! Her voice has a clear quality about it that's even there when she performs live! I'm sorry, but some singers lose that quality, she doesn't!Know, on to the pointless stuff. She is trying so hard not to be seen as a Britney Spears clone, but when you disect her songs, that's exactly what she is. Her voice is far superior, but most of the songs don't enhance that. The lyrics of the songs are just as important as the way you sing them, and I'm not hearing any sort of variety beyond the traditional pop lyrics.So, Christine, here's hoping that you get to sing a wider variety of music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak debut.","review":"Christina Aguilera's debut album had some really cheesy and manufactured songs. She sold a lot of albums and won a Grammy for Best New Artist, and the girl can sing her damn heart out but this album is pure candy-coated fluff. The songwriting is horrible, songs like Come On Over (All I Want Is You), Genie In a Bottle, What A Girl Wants, When You Put Your Hands On Me, and I Turn To You, these songs never make you want to come back for me. Only three tracks prove X-tina can belt, Blessed, Reflection, and So Emotional. This album didn't showcase what this girl could really do, it's disposal pop and I am so glad they don't make this kind of music anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD DEBUT","review":"Whether Christina is copying Britney or not,she definately has a better voice. I like Britney too,but Christina just comes off better. Really,Christina came out about the same time. In 1998,she sang Reflection for the Disney's Mulan soundtrack long before \\"Baby One More Time\\" came out,so Christina was known first. It's like the Backstreet and 'N Sync thing. Both are good,but 'N Sync will never live up to Backstreet. Anyways,for Christina's debut,two #1 hits say it all (Genie In a Bottle and What a Girl Wants.) I Turn To You is good too,but only made it to #3 on the Billboard Hot 100. Reflection is my personal favorite. Christina displays a lot of emotion in this beautiful ballad that totally made the Mulan soundtrack what it is. All and all,a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is Christina Aguilera?","review":"While she has an excellent voice, and a great smile, I have to say that this album just does not meet the standards. Her voice is a servant to the song writers, and this comes across very strongly because the album lacks depth and style. Songs like 'I turn to You' are very Mariah Carey, and come across as cheesy starters. The album does however, possess two good songs such as 'Genie in a Bottle', and 'What a Girl Wants'. Nonetheless, Aguilera lovers should come to terms with the fact that their love for her CD is a love for Christina rather than her music. This album may touch the hearts of many fans, but perhaps they are not really seeing the true value of music created here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!A blond with talent.","review":"Like an earlyier reveiwer said,you cant compare britney and christina.Christina has talent and Britey has none.Many people agree with me,as threr are NO anti christina sites on the web,and britney has ver 50.Bravo,Britney.But then,Britney has a diamond album and christina does not...... Christinas Genie in a bottle is a great song .I also like Come on over.Very cacthy. So emotional was kinda sick,but her voice won over,and want a voice she has!This CD was my fav for a VERY long time,And I still listen to it.I think her next CD should be a christamas CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's the genie with the spell","review":"As one the latest teen sensation in the world of music,much have been talked about Christina in comparison with her former Mickey Mouse club mate,Britney,when the fact is,she is just on the edge to join the likes of Whitney Housten and Mariah Carey because of her remarkable vocal performance on this debut album.The first single went to number one but she doesn't stop there.Infact,the rest of the album showcase the power of her voice at a higher level.A blend of pop and danceable R&B forms the right chemistry to introduce the world everything that she has.My favourite cuts have to be 'Blessed','Come On Over','Love Will Find A Way' and 'I Turn To U',a track penned by Dianne Warren.Overall it might not be in the run for the Grammy,but it's enjoyable and will definitely satisfy you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Really GOOD CD!","review":"First, I want to say how much I love this CD. Even though it is a year old, it sounds new and fresh. Christina's voice is accurately compared to such greats as Whitney and Celine. True, the songwriting is not exactly stellar, but as she matures, hopefully she will start writing her own songs and will be incredible. She honestly deserved every award she's gotten (she should have gotten those VMA awards! Not N'Sync and Eminem!Most of the one-star reviews are by jealous Britney fans who can't stand that someone could be liked more than their barbie-doll goddess who can't sing and is popular because of her looks.Buy Christina's CD today, and you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"christinafan","review":"Christina'a Cd is great 1. Genie in a bottle-good and first single. 2. What a Girl Wants-second single-the remix, 3. I turn to you-ballad and third single. 4. So Emotional-A good pop song. 5. Come on over baby (all i want is you) another remix and fourth single. 6. Reflections- she did this song at age 17. 7. Love for all seasons- a all year song. 8. Somebody's Somebody- a mood track. 9. When you put your hands on me- a stay up late song. 10. Blessed- A pop song to go with popcorn. 11. Love Will Find a way- A another song to go with. 12. Obvious- the last track. If you are a Christina fan, then get this CD right away."},{"rating":"2","title":"great voice","review":"I really don't like pop music. But I think Christina is a great singer.Her voice doesn't sound as mechanical as Britney or BSB. And unlike the other's songs, they're not full of complaining and whining about being lonely and wanting your old lover back.I think she has great talent.She also is a fan of cool rock bands like KoRn who is one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christina has got what it takes....","review":"This CD is great! =) I heard Christina Aguilera sing \\"Reflection\\" back in '98 and I was hooked. SHe has such a strong, good voice. I bought this CD after getting rave reviews from my friends, and I do not regret it. I have many recent CDs from teen artists that only have a few good tracks on it, and i have to say that at first I didn't expect a lot from \\"yet another teenybopper\\". But after a few listens, I found that I was wrong, this is high-quality listening for those who like pop and hip-hop songs! =) This talented gal has got what it takes to be successful--- hope she'll keep on churning out the great songs. Best of luck to Christina! =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Christina Rocks","review":"This is an awesome cd. She has an amazing vocal talent and ability. She puts emotion and depth into her music, unlike Britney who tries to, but sounds like she's whining. If you like the song \\"What a girl wants\\" then check out the remix version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christina Aguilera is fabulous!","review":"I am a fan of both Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears, and I have to say that Christina is better than Britney. Britney has tons of makeup and had a nasal, girlish voice. Christina has more of a natural beauty and has a voice that reminds one of Whitney or Celine. \\"I Turn To You\\" is the best song, while the worst is \\"When You Put Your Hands On Me\\" (and hence only four stars). \\"Reflection\\" is awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great CD!!!","review":"C.A. is a wonderful artist!! I absolutly love Genie in a Bottle!! I really love this CD!!! So buy it!! And for all of you who think Britney does a better job,Wake up!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is AMAZING!!!","review":"Christina is the best pop singer out there right now. There is no way anyone can compare her to that awful \\"singer\\" Britney Spears. Her voice is amazing and she never lip sync's. She can belt a song like Mariah Carey and I think she has a very long career ahead of her. My favorite songs are \\"Genie\\" of course but I also love \\"So Emotional\\". I can not wait for her new song to come out!! I want everyone to buy her CD and keep her on the charts for a long time!! You rule Christina!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not terrible, but not great","review":"I mean nine out of twelve tracks sounds like a good deal. But she doesn't really put that much emotion into her songs. But really, what can be expected when someone else writes your songs? They'll get old after a while (like Britney Spears) but like I said before, you can't put your soul into something you didn't make.By the way, I Turn To You (third track) is the exact same one All-4-One sings in the Space Jam CD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressed","review":"It's hard to imagine that a teen is singing these songs.

BORING!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's Put the Genie back in the Bottle","review":"Christina Aguilera came out at a good time for \\"Teen Pop.\\" When Christina came out Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys were dominating the charts. Teen boys and girls needed another female artists. Well they got Christina Aguilera. I bought the album because of the poptastic \\"Genie In a Bottle.\\" I listened to the cd and I must say it was horrible. Some of the worst tracks were \\"I Turn To Yo\\" and \\"So Emotional.\\" At least Britney doesn't try to be Mariah Carey. My choice would be to buy a Britney cd. But here's a review of the 4 singles off the cd. One * being the lowest and five * being the highest.\\"Genie In a Bottle\\" - *\\"What a Girl Wants\\" - *\\"I Turn To You\\" - *1/2\\"Come On Over\\" - **"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great...","review":"I didn't like theses songs at all they all sound the same and sound the same as any other Pop tune. I especially did not like 'Turn To You' it was a very boring song. 'What a Girl Wants' made no sense either."},{"rating":"2","title":"All I want is Christina!","review":"Christina Aquilera is truly better than Britney! Britney sounds more like she's singing in a tin can, but Christina is a different story! I am truly blown away by Christina's powerful vocals and great lyrics. I love every song on this album, but if I'd have to choose my absolute favorite song it would probably be \\"Genie in a Bottle\\". \\"What a Girl Wants\\" is yet another one of my most highly reccomended songs. I love absolutley EVERYTHING about this cd! I love all of the catchy lyrics and the strong vocals that Christina obtains in ALL of her songs. Christina could take on Britney any day of the week!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Album Around","review":"Christina Aguileras debut album is one of the best albums around.It's actulley the best album i own.(and i own ALOT of albums)The album is filled with ballards,dance,pop and r'n'b tracks which will make you never want to turn this wonderful album off.If you are not a Christina fan,i can safely say once you have a listen at this album you will become a fan before you can say Christina Aguilera.Every single song is brilliant. My personal favourites being 'Come on over'(All i want is you), 'Blessed','Love will find a way','I turn to you' and 'Genie in a bottle' G-d,i LOVE them all.Well,as you can see from my review Christinas debut album ROCKS and i look forward to more of her upcoming releases.CHRISTINA RULES!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut!","review":"This CD is a great debut album.

All Three Copies Purchased Right Here On Amazon.","review":"\\"Christina Aguilera\\" is very juvenile and very teen, but the rhythms and lyrics are very catchy and I can't stop lisening to it. My favorite tracks are \\"Genie In A Bottle\\", \\"What A Girl Wants\\", \\"I Turn To You\\", \\"So Emotional\\", \\"Come On Over (All I Want Is You\\"), \\"Reflection\\", \\"Love For All Seasons\\", \\"When You Put Your Hands On Me\\", \\"Blessed\\" and \\"Obvious\\", although I never skip a track. Obviously songs are all 10/10 for me. I was lucky that the last two copies I got of this album here on Amazon were the copies that contained the video versions of \\"What A Girl Wants\\" and \\"Come On Over (All I Want Is You)\\" because the first copy I got, two months after the album was released, in 1999, obviously contained the album versions and none of these videos had been released. I like this edition of the album better than the first one. Christina makes AWESOME music. Can't get enough of her music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure soul","review":"When I first heard her voice, I was stunned. She shouldnt be compared to the talent-less Brittney Spears, Christina's voice is pure soul and r&b.;This album is one of my favorites. The best songs, in my opinion,had an R&B; flavor b/c that ultimately does her voice the most justice.So Emotional 10/10, Somebody's Somebody 9/10, Genie In a Bottle 7/10, Obvious 9/10, When you put your hands on me 9/10 and Reflectino 7/10 to me are the best tracks. Great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Christina Aguilera","review":"I recently saw one of those biography shows about CA and it made me really curious about her debut. At the time, I wasn't interested in the teen popsters that dominated the airwaves and so never paid her any attention till I purchased her second album, STRIPPED.After listening to it for a while, I can see why she won her grammy. This is an excellent debut which shows her vocal ability in singing pop/dance, ballads and r&b; tinged singles. I truly enjoy listening to the first 7 tracks which is a great opening in my book! The other two tracks that stand out to me are BLESSED & OBVIOUS.This is an excellent debut that did what debuts are supposed to do - produced great singles and introduced the world to a new voice in the music field."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can you say Diva?","review":"Christina Aguilera, in my opinion, is the best new female pop artist. Girlfriend has soul...I mean she can really sing and she definitely proves it. She sings all of her songs very well. So what's the problem with her album? \\"When you put your hands on me\\" , \\"Come on over\\", and \\"So emotional\\". Boo- Boo-. The rest of her songs I dig, but those just aren't good. It's not the way she sings it, I just think it's the songs themselves, they weren't strong from the start. I wouldn't describe them as pitiful, or awful, just nothing as croonful as \\"Genie in a bottle\\" or \\"What a girl wants\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT ANOTHER TEENY-BOPPER","review":"My daughter received this cd for Christmas (even though I'M the one who wanted it) and I have totally taken it over!

Her songs are creative, different, and from the heart. The C.D. is great. I like that all of the songs are different. A lot of people (I won't mention any names) have songs that all kind of sound alike. Not her! Her videos rock too. In my opinion, she's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great voice wish the radio versions were on this though","review":"THe CD is good but I was dissapointed when the radio edits were not present and the songs had a slower tempo. Either way Christina's voice shines. Reflections is worth the price regardless. Christina is more Mariah-esque where Brittney is Janet/Madonna. There is no comparing and no competing. Christina in my opinion will last because you can't find a fabulous R&B voice on a white girl easily (Jojo is close) whereas good lip synching dancers are everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yo Go Girl!!","review":"Finally, a real artist.

This girl has a vioce and nothing can stop it now! After winning a Grammy for Best New Artist she has one long, succesful career up ahead. The problem with the C.D., The first song \\"Genie in a bottle\\" is provocative. And teaches young girls to not 'wait' for marriage, but to wait until the right person comes along. The other song \\"When you put your hands on me\\" well, that kind of explains it! But the other songs I just love! She is a great girl and deserves all sorts of credit. So what if she didn't write her own songs! I bet if you were busy like her you wouldn't be able to write #1 hits! And I don't think she's a Mariah (I love her too!) copy-cat. New talent has got to come out some-time! And besides if she was a Mariah duplicate she would have come out WAY earlier!

I think Christina has a great style that I like to call \\"Natural Voice\\" because to me it seems like that in the making of this cd, the recorders and producers and what not did not have to use that much stuff to change the sound of her voice to make it sound better and make clearer tones.

Way to go girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the best!","review":"I love this cd! I listen to it every day..At first I thought i would hate this cd because i am not a very big fan of R&B, but when i finally listened to the cd, I absolutely loved it!

Buy this cd and you will love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful","review":"christina aguilera is a wonderful singer, the absolute best of the teen pop singers today. its terrible to compare her to people like britney spears because her talent is so superior to theirs. she will definitly be the mariah or whitney of the next millennium!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Potential...","review":"There's no arguing that Aguilera has talent. She's definitely got a mature, powerful voice that, when coupled with good music and lyrics, could really go somewhere. For her vocal capability, I give her two stars.Unfortunately, for the most part, the songs themselves honestly aren't very good. The lyrics don't leave much to the imagination(\\"Hormones raging at the speed of light...?\\" Where's the poetry in that?). I think if Aguilera collaborated with some different songwriters, she could produce an much better album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christina can sing but what else?","review":"Yes, Christina can sing, but she aint no songwriter, no producer or anything else more credible than the fluff on her debut album. The songs are generic, formulaic and in short, boring! With better material and a cooler image, she will do right and very right indeed. Otherwise, she just tries too hard at being Whitney/Mariah/Celine."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST!","review":"Hey everyone! I just wanted to tell you that you MUST buy this CD! Christina Aguilera is the best singer in the WORLD and she and I both know that what a girl wants is her cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You pay for half of the cd","review":"Of course this cd includes \\"Genie In A Bottle\\" which is a fan favorite. It also has \\"What a Girl Wants\\" and a few other songs that go along with the hip hop beat. The other songs on this cd are slow and very boring like \\"Blessed\\" and \\"I Turn to You.\\" She sings about things that are out of her age range. I would get this cd if you have listened to it before and like most of the songs, but if you just like one of her songs, this cd isn't for you and if you only like hip hop songs then i would recommend not buying this cd and just getting the single of the song you like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"What a shame. Christina Aguilera has a great voice, and is atrue diva...BUT, the songs are terrible. I bought the CD because ofGenie in a Bottle, which is a cool and unusual song.

She has an awsome album here. The CD is very good for a first album. She has a beautiful voice that will take her very far. At first I didn't like the CD, but oneday I decided to sit down and listen to it and it actually is pretty good. It's a little bit of pop which isn't bad! This CD is very good and I encourage everyone to buy it. It is worth the money you will spend. Just give it a chance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, Mature, and Very Nicely done, Christina!","review":"I bought this CD a while ago when it first came out, and I'll tell you, if you like Britney Spears, then this CD may seem a little strange at first, but it definately grows on you. All the songs are great and they will get your voice in shape for singing at the top of your lungs right along with Christina. I like Briney, but I absolutely love Christina. Britney always seems so fake and make up because she is. All that plastic surgery and her new set of silicone boobs appeal to the guys, but what about us ladies? Huh? Even Britney's voice is augmented for her CD. Christina is a comeplete natural and has had zero surgeries. If you can't decide between Britney's CD and Christina's, get the one with the REAL woman...Christina."},{"rating":"2","title":"A VOICE OF FRESH AIR","review":"I WISH PEOPLE WOULD STOP SAYING THAT CHRISTINA IS TRYING TO IMITATE BRITTNEY SPEARS. SHE COULD NOT SOUND THAT BAD NO MATTER HOW HARD SHE TRIED. HER VOICE IS A MIXTURE BETWEEN THE OLD MARIAH AND WHITNEY HOUSTON,BUT HER VOICE IS UNIQUE ENOUGH THAT IT DOES NOT SEEM TO IMITATE THOSE DIVAS. I WISH CHRISTINA COULD HAVE SONG IN A DIFFERENT TIME WHERE HER VOICE COULD BE APPRECIATED. NOW DAYS PEOPLE WANT TO LISTEN TO UNTALENTED PEOPLE INDIVIDUALS LIKE NELLY FURTADO AND BRITTNEY SPEARS."},{"rating":"2","title":"She sounded soulful on here","review":"It amazes me how good she sounded when she recorded this record. The only complaint is that genie in a bottle was a little to poppy for me but the rest of the cd sounds like a young r&b cd. Who gives a damn if she doesn't have a lot of fast songs on the cd, everyone doesn't do the same thing on all cds. Be happy with what she has given you. If it still bothers you, go buy the import with the club remixes of her singles, the cheapest one was like 20 dollars, not too much more than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Genie came Out of the Bottle...Then wen't back in...","review":"HI I just want to say I do like a few songs:(1)\\"Genie in a Bottle\\"(2)\\"What a Girl Wants\\"(3)\\"Reflection\\"(4)\\"When you put your Hands On Me\\"(5)\\"Come On Over\\"Thats it the rest of the cd is awful it's too slow and ballad Mariah Carey like... Over all this cd is not that great Don't purchase this cd if you want somthing a little more upbeat and not a contest to see how long she can hold singing one note. I do like ballads at times but not when it's just a person seeing how long they can hold a note I think it causes poor melody structure. So with that being said, my rating is 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"I turn to you","review":"This CD is terrific. Christina's voice is beautiful and it shows in all of her songs. I believe that her songs carry meaning to everyone, from Reflection to I Turn To You. Thank you, Christina for a wonderful album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah She Can Sing....but?","review":"What is with all these singers today? They don't do anything on their CD's other than sing! They don't write, produce or compose. Nothing! What happened to the true artist? Christina can sing, yes, very beautifully. And who knows, maybe she can write too, but she hasn't proved it yet! Anyhow, I do enjoy some songs on this CD, like 'Genie In A Bottle' 'cause its a good dance song and a couple others, but not much more. Two Out Of Five."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!","review":"Songs on here are really, really good! My favorite songs are \\"Blessed\\", \\"Reflection\\", \\"What a Girl Wants\\", \\"Genie in a Bottle\\", \\"I Turn to You\\", and \\"So Emotional\\". She has a spectacular voice that will really make you want to listen...So Emotional is an R&B style song, when I Turn to You, Reflection, and Blessed, and kind of soft, relaxing songs, and Genie in a Bottle and What a Girl Wants are pure dance...This CD could use a little bit of work, but still...She shows a lot of potential, and what's good on this CD is REALLY GOOD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing discovery","review":"This is an amazing disc. As usual with this band, the Das Neue Orchester plays their heart out, they play with verve and a sense of occasion that is unmatched by Hamburger Hofkapelle in their disc (which is also fine one, btw). The timpani and brass are captured in spetacular sonics that match their marvelous attacks and impressive power.For anyone who likes this period, who has listened to the works of Ries, Gade, Burgmüller and others, this is a must have CD.For anyone who likes period-instruments bands, this is a must have CD.I'm one of the both, and one who has played the incredible finale of the 5th over and over again, drooling after the astounding rythmic drive of both players and music.Yes, this is most highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liked author's emotions but didn't like \\"quotes\\" from dead son.","review":"I liked the first part of the book where the author shares her grief and loss of son. I did not enjoy the quotes through the book that she thinks her deceased son would say. I also did not like her visits to \\"mediums\\" in the last half of the book. There are too many people ready to take money from grieving parents. I bought many books on grief but did not like much of this particular one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to move on","review":"This book gives the reader permission to live in the past forever instead of moving on to a bright more giving future. Yes, it is okay to think about a lost love one, but goodness to do so forever just because you loved your departed son or daughter is too much. Move on with your life said the wise woman! The writing in the book is also a little clunky, shortsighted and stale, but what was most disappointing was the new age slant. What is needed here are caring people--not a bunch of hocus pocus!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One big Yawn","review":"This book is a better sleep aid than an informative read.

Friends and family mean well, but their advice and comfort rarely cut thru the fog of grief that lingers for years. I lost my daughter, age 23, in January of 2008. I read this book a few months ago and it changed my life. Each page, each paragraph, spoke to me and touched my heart. I found myself highlighting passages and re-reading chapters. So far I have read this book 3 times and it is a comfort to me each time. If I had one wish about this book, it would be that every parent that suffers a loss could have a copy appear in their mailbox. I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written, extremely helpful working through grief.","review":"I read this book within 2 weeks after my son died in an auto accident on 8/13/08. I have since shared it with other friends who have lost a child, and with my siblings after our parents died. As a Christian, I believe that the soul lives on, and after reading this book I believe that love lives on as well.

The fact that I actually had to pay hundres of dollars for this atrocity makes me sick. The chapters are not outlined in a manner that enables the reader to understand how the topics and positions related.

Lee, Philip G. Joyce, and Ronald Wayne Johnson is written more clearly... if you have a choice, buy this book. The problem with Mikesell is that he has to write 200 pages (six chapters) to explain the concept of revenues in the budget process. Too many trees were wasted in the development of this book. Lee, Joyce, and Johnson can do this in 40 pages.The greater majority of my Public Budgeting Systems class at George Mason University feels that the Mikesell book is written in a manner to lull oneself to sleep... the benefit is that one could read the book rather than using drugs to induce sleep (August 27, 2010: I see the comments on the review below... the drugs comment is obvious sarcasm).However, if you are required to purchase the Mikesell book, you should go to the Amazon UK web site and complete your transaction there... you can save yourself about 70 to 80 dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Almost perfect!The book is new,and reaches me on time.I find that the question marks printed in the book are all inverted,anyway, it doesn't affect reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Comprehensive Book on the Media and Sports","review":"The book covers so many different areas of the relationship between the media and sports and does so with so many examples, studies, etc. It's easy to read, though a couple of chapters seem to drag a little bit.

Yes, the old dynasties were swept away in the aftermath of WWI, so the names have changed, but the peoples on the Balkan peninsula are still the playthings of international capital and its henchmen in the parliaments. Unfortunately most modern reporters either hardly know how to formulate a correct phrase or have no clue about the social and economic background of the situation they write about. L.D. Trotsky, on the other hand, combined a keen eye for the complex intersection of economy, politics and religion with an expressive style. Not to forget his vitriolic humour. (And yes, I loved his snide remark about Austrian tardiness - verrry true!;-)) Despite the intricacy of the issues, these reports are easily readable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy install, perfect fit","review":"Have had these step bars for 6 months and am happy with the install and appearance.

Tossing her hair and fantasizing that she is a movie star as she is photographed in a fabulous 1930s French car is worth pages but the person who restored the car is dismissed quickly. She attends a classic car auction without getting to know anyone involved. But she paints a negative picture of everyone involved without learning anything about those people.Whenever Ms. Hazelton mentions other people, she sneers briefly and moves on.

I contacted the manufacturer - Whitehall Products - and was told there is a one year warranty and they take no responsibility for their products after that. Given the high cost of these lanterns the manufacturer should do better - both in applying a better finish to begin with and standing behind their products after they are sold.

I feel that it really is worth its cost because it offers excellent analysis on the strokes of the pros. I often hear conventional tennis instructors talk about how it is wrong to try to copy the pros. This is entirely wrong... why not copy the best, the most talented, the most dedicated? This book helps you do exactly that. The pros went through the trial and error process and the thousands of hours of practice to perfect their timing, rhythm, and feel. The pros have the best strokes and it is very obvious when one compares this to the avg club player. I believe this is an excellent book because it analyzes the strokes of the best of the game and tells you how to apply this to your game.

The book is divided into two parts, one focuses on mostly events of the 1980's and Mexico drug trafficking and secondly, the other discusses banking regulation and money laundering. Although the book dicussess in depth many of the problems associated with the criminalization of drug laws and concludes legalization may be the best route to take away the profits from the illict drug trade; the book ironically, endorses draconian banking regulation as a means to ferret out drug proceeds. Clearly, the book was written durning two differnt periods and thrown together hapazardly. The section on the Mexican cartels and money laundering do not mesh well. Avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused","review":"Well, after reading all the other reviews, I feel like an idiot. I have spent many hours trying to read this book and haven't made much progress. This book is not good for a beginner, and it requires knowledge of many other fields before the equations and applications make sense.

The book is distorted by the Japanese.","review":"First of all this book states that Yayoi is 100% Japanese however it's actaully 50% Korean, 30% Chinese, and 20% Middle Asia's culture. Also this book rarely talks about the killing of 3 million innocent Koreans and 0.8 million Chinese and torturing them by raping, experimenting and killing for entertainment when half of Japan's history was killing and robbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very perspicacious summary of Japanese history","review":"After reading Gordon's \\"A Modern History of Japan\\" which was twice thicker with longer pages and concentrate on the history since Meiji, I was a bit skeptical that Henshall would be able to tell me much more about Japanese history, as there isn't much to say about early and medieval history in 70 pages, and even less from Meiji in 110 pages. However, I really enjoyed this book. Not only was it more digestible than Gordon's, it is probably the best comlpete history of Japan from the stone age to now that I have read so far.There are lots of interesting anecdotes and facts, and Henshall's summaries of key points in Japanese culture's development after each chapters are very eficient and perspicacious. There is very little useless commentaries or wasted space, without being too dense. Very good indeed !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Overview of Japanese History","review":"Henshall does an excellent job of providing a concise overview of Japanese history. The book is written in a very readable and engaging style and while a lot of material is covered in the limited number of pages he at the same time manages to tie it together in a coherent way. The benefit of this is that while it may not have depth you finish the book with the feeling that you have an understanding of what you have read as a whole.Of particular value are the summaries at the end of each part and the tables listing key developments along with key values and practices in each period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous...","review":"This book is a superb introduction into a country that has been misrepresented and misunderstood for a long time (though not so much in the modern day). It gives a concise and interesting overview of Japanese history to the modern day, and does so while providing enough information to give the reader a solid grasp of the subject matter. From here, the reader can easily move onto specific areas of interest, because they will likely know some of the major events/people associated with that time period. Or if they are not particularly interested with Japanese history, they will walk away with a rudimentary understanding of this amazing country's history.Further, I did not detect any significant bias on the part of the author, though I am not an expert in the subject matter, so my opinion is an amateur one.Highly reccommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"love the name","review":"I had to get an album by a band named Gojira. Great name for a metal band. Pleased to report that they're actually quite good. The drumming seems to take center stage here, and that's fine with me. It's a very pounding sound and I love that. Also loved the sound of whales in the one song. These guys do indeed rock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Borderline? No.... This IS a Masterpiece!","review":"This is my favorite Gojira album, and with good reason. This has some of the best production of any metal album. This albums is so Heavy, it scares Large Children, and even Dinosaurs. Extremely melodic, yet minimalistic. I haven't heard riffs and transitions this clever since the seminal Refused album, The Shape Of Punk To Come. No matter what you listen to, I believe that this band can cator to anyone who appreciates honest heavy music. If you love your earth and care for the future, then listen to Gojira, let them be a positive force in your life. For fans of Meshuggah, Mastodon, Isis, and Neurosis, and for fans of Old School Death Metal like Obituary, and Death. Do yourself a favor and pick this album up along with their other two albums, and do it as soon as you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metal to the Core!","review":"I was completely overwhelmed when I heard this ablum. I was just discovering Gojira for the first time and I was stunned. This is some of the most Heavy and Original Metal I've heard in a while, and they mix a lot of elements of metal such as Death and heavy. My only complaint is about the intermissions of whales singing and stuff, when they could have been playing more great songs! lol Highlights on this album would have to be \\"the heaviest matter of the universe\\", \\"From the sky\\", and \\"mars to sirius\\". The reason I gave it a 4 is cuz some songs can get repetative at times, but its something i got over quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...","review":"I didn't knew this guys untill I hear this new album and let me tell you...Gojira is awesome!

This album is so unbelievably crushing it is tough to put it into words. From Mars To Sirius was a Christmas present for me this year and all I can say is Thank Goodness I am finally able to experience this brand of mind-bendingly crushing metal. As the opening moments in \\"Ocean Planet\\" came to life in my speakers, I had a permanent smile on my face for the duration of the brutality-filled riff fest that is this album. I will definitely be pursuing their other albums and I recommend that if you haven't experienced these guys yet (This was me a month ago) that your next slot of free time is filled with you traveling to your nearest record store and giving these guys a shot.

I feared the sound quality would be dull and the performance as boring as Eric Claptons too famous acoustic rendition of \\"Layla...\\" What a shock. \\"Voice of America\\" is performed with Wetton playing a grand piano and his voice is possibly the strongest it's ever been. Even the new songs (at the time) from Battle Lines blend in with the old perfectly, plus he performs the first part of UK's best song ever, \\"30 Years\\" with his voice and a synth. He even manages to pull of the Asia rockers such as \\"Don't Cry\\" and \\"Only Time Will Tell\\" in a tasteful manner. The sound quality is among the best I've heard, crisp and clean... If you're a fan of Asia, King Crimson, or UK, check it out. Those who are too old to rock and roll may enjoy it also..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very pleasant retrospective!","review":"This album has to be one of the cleanest live recordings I've ever heard. It literally sounds like Mr. Wetton is in your living room playing for you. The opening track, Voice Of America, shows the former Asia/King Crimson/UK leader's voice has only improved with age. This disc is well worth the price for the last 4 songs alone: Battle Lines, The Simle Has Left Your Eyes, Heat Of The Moment and You're Not The Only One. All are immaculate presentations, and show him in great voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too silent, too simple","review":"As a teenager, I was a big fan of Asia. Since John Wetton left the band, its music became uninteresting.Akustika - Live In America can be considered as a kind of Unplugged Greatest Hits from Wetton and the bands he has been part of.So there he is, on stage, a man with a nice and emotional voice, a guitar and a piano. Everything is nice and clean... but it is kind of boring. These silent versions of rock hymns like Voice Of America do not come near the power and the intense soul of their originals.The exception is Only Time Will Tell out of which John Wetton makes a good Akustika. The album as a whole is something you put on when you invite your new girlfriend up for the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of crap","review":"yep, like I said above, you get what you pay for and this was like a giant stuffed animal hammock.

If thats true then they must be really bad. Barrier received with package poorly taped, etc. Plastic knob broken and it wouldn't fit my SUV (too short) .Needed two extensions -more wating and more money. Very poor instructions and no shippers packing list.

My mistake that I didn't check it out before.I'll go to a store and see it before I buy and I'll throw this one in the trash. I am surprised that Amazon works with someone that won't accept returns."},{"rating":"1","title":"My dogs figured this out in 5 minutes","review":"I bought this to keep my two dogs in the back of my Rav 4. Within minutes, they realized they could take their noses and slide the bars in and go around the barrier. I even tried to get the trombone arms flush against the windows/doors. Then, my younger dog realized that there is a gap due to the way the legs tighten and he would squeeze under the barrier (he weighs 70 lbs). So, then I bought the extension, but due to the height of my ceiling, the gap is still large enough for him to squeeze through. So, then I flipped it over and he was able to squeeze between the ceiling and the bar. Now, I am looking for a different product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Working For Us","review":"Just letting folks know I just installed this in a 2001 Land Cruiser. It fit perfectly behind the 2nd row of seats, which was our goal. If it can also install behind the pullout 3rd row seats that'd be a bonus, but was not part of our purchase decision. Anyways, if you space the main pillars as wide as they'll go, and then position the horizontal things to suit both the size of your dog(s) and impact on your rear-view mirror, I doubt you could do better than this product - at least for our truck and our 2 70 pound dogs. Removable in minutes, but I plan to keep it there until I need the extra space - If you want it to be perfectly vertical and horizontal, it just takes more time to deploy and remove. Installed tightly enough, our bigger dogs respected it, didn't really even test it much. Our dogs are a Ridgeback mix and a Labrador Retriever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well with 3 big dogs in Infiniti FX","review":"I have this, with the extension bars (60012), in my '03 Infiniti FX35.

With my seats folded down, I have it set up so they can stick their heads out the window but not their bodies. The barrier was easy to assemble, super easy to secure, and even shortens enough to put in the very back with the rear passenger seats up. This was a wonderful investment, for me and my dogs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad product, bad experience","review":"product wasn't delivered with all of the required parts for installation. the instructions also start assuming that 3 steps have already been completed, which made it tougher to identify that the issue. bad product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steer clear of this barrier","review":"Does not work as claimed in the product advertising, i.e., it does not fit all vehicles as it claims it can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased","review":"I recently purchased this item for the purpose of transporting a dog I adopted.

I thought the directions were straightforward and I had it set up and secured in the back of my car in no time.My dog (80 lb. Rott) tested it, but didn't seem interested in trying to get out, therefore I don't know how the barrier would hold up with a more determined dog...that would be my other dog, and I haven't tried him yet.

Every thing else is uninspired and some of it is downright awful. ThE song by Ocean sounds like it is off-key (or they didn't tune correctly). The NY Ska Emsemble would be just a run of the mill smooth jazz band, except they added a ska beat, which, with them, doesn't add much. Run Away by the Slackers is a song that celebrates being a coward - ugh!

I could not finish it. Authors who set out to write a book, should have the intention that it should be read. Sorry, for all the gems it might contain , I just think it is a poor job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems to be a fake","review":"This book looks like pure advertisment of Wang Liping who is said to be chosen as 18th generation transmitter by one Taoist sect. Difficult to read because every second page I stumbled over direct or masked praise on Wang Liping / sect abilities. In the end (as expected) Wang Liping finishes with giving lectures to hundreds of students of Qigong. Special pages dedicated to how simple Wang lives, etc. Taoist teachings are scattered all over the book and don't give the impression of integrity.One quote from the 1st page: \\"Over the preceding years the three Taoist masters had been engrossed in secret consultations about the matter of utmost importance, not only to them but to the world at large... trying to find a successor ...\\". Well after this matter important to the whole world I already assumed that money spent on book was wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"The story that never was","review":"I found it very laborious to attempt to read this droning tale. Perhaps I was expecting something like 'The Wandering Taoist' trilogy.....I didn't come anywhere close to finding it. Having studied Daoism for the past decade, I found it utterly lacking in this poorly contrived story. The story itself was boring and had no fiber. There are a lot of boring stories, but few as poorly written as this. If you insist upon trying it, try the library or get a used copy. Don't waste yor money on this one. There should be several used copies available.....cheap. I was not able to get to the end of it, as there are so many good books to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close the Dragon Gate","review":"Great disservices to people whom are searching for information and enlightenment on Taoism. The authors used a map of china and a few books on Taoism to take the reader on an almost 300 page fairy tale coated to read like a biography. The characters shift personality quicker than a chameleon does color. I think there is a story in the book but the contrived situations get in the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, eccentric","review":"If you're intertested in Taoism this is worth a look. It purports to be a tale of four accomplished Taoists on the road during the Cultural Revolution, and is more fun in part because of its claims to truth. I would give it three stars, but for some reason can't change it from five - has Wang Liping co-opted my computer through his mastery of distant Chi transmission (hmmm...)?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a good tale...","review":"This book is along the lines of Deng Ming Dao's \\"The Wandering Taoist\\" series - it tells the tale of how a contemporary Taoist Master learned his art. In this case, it tells the story of Wang Liping's journey from ordinary youth to Master. Along the way the reader is treated to an overview of some of the trials and tribulations people used to undergo _before_ Masters would even consider teaching them the most simple technique.The story mostly concerns the initial training (some very interesting techniques here...) and then subsequent journeys of Liping. As the story approaches its close the Cultural Revolution begins and the tale takes a twist similar to that in \\"The Wandering Taoist\\" - a complete break from tradition.I have read this a couple of times since it came out and the trials endured by the young Liping never fail to amaze me when compared to the easy access we now enjoy. I suspect anyone who cultivates will enjoy the tale too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Opening the Dragon Gate","review":"This is a wonderful book that I would definitely recommend to anyone interested in Taoism and esoteric taoist practices. This book is a must have for people currently practicing or interested in practicing meditation and mind cultivation as it explains in depth the secrets of the mind. Martial Artists should definitely purchase this book due to the in depth explanation of the internal systems which compliment and enrich the external styles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Briliant story","review":"Amazing story.Hard to put book away.Truly inspirational.This is not book for beginner on Path of Tao.Greatly recommended for those seriously studying Qigong Meditation or Taoism .One of most influential books .Pure joy to read ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep Story","review":"This was a very good perspective on Taoist miracle working. It briefly mentions many techniques, without explaining them, so this is not a manual for learning Taoism. Some of it is unbelievable, but as a story it is excellent.

I prefer inserting bags into a vacuum and this is possible with this vacuum. Fantastic for carpets and bare floors. Being refurbished has not been one problem. GREAT PRICE.. I see no reason at this time. Glides very easily on carpets or bare floors...even though it seems heavy..no problem. Really do not need to even push..it glides itself.Recommend highly"},{"rating":"1","title":"Refurbished is Really Risky!!","review":"I ordered this through Amazon, from a company called Allergy Be Gone. Turned it on for the first time and the brush rolls won't turn on carpet. From the research I've done, probably the carpet/bare floor switch is broke which is very expensive to fix and common for these machines. NO WARRANTY on refurbished vacuums. Thank goodness it was already broke when I got it, so I can return and buy a new one which at least has a warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASN'T REFURBISHED","review":"The vacuum I received wasn't apparently refurbished. Right out of the box, it had problems. The brushes didn't have the strength to vacuum carpeting. The foot peddle fell off with each use. I purchased this same vacuum new last year for my girlfriend and she's loved it. This one's going back. My learning is pay the extra 50 bucks and get something that works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy refurbished!","review":"While this Eureka Boss vacuum cleaner is powerful, sturdy, and self-propelled (although very heavy), I would not recommend buying it refurbished. I thought we were getting a good deal by saving $50 off the retail price, however, the mechanism you push w/ your foot to release and tilt the vacuum cleaner does not working correctly. This was clearly the reason the vacuum cleaner was returned by the first owner, and nothing was done to \\"refurbish\\" this malfunction before it was shipped out to us. We need to basically hammer the part in order to recline the machine. Also, it was missing hoses and attachments, and I needed to call to request them. So think twice before buying refurbished!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never underestimate","review":"Purchased a Refurbished Eureka vacuum and it works as good as new for less money, so never underestimate saving a buck!

This seemed to work well at first, but after about 5 uses it choked on carpet fibers and stopped, and will not start again. I repeat: It broke because it couldn't handle vacuuming on carpet! The whole thing filled with carpet fibers and was impossible to clean out, which is a moot point since it stopped working entirely. Biggest waste of money I've ever spent. No wonder all my friends tell me to buy a Dyson (which I did)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought 2 - 1 Great, 1 Junk","review":"The price was so good we bought 2. One is everything we expected.

But, the extension wand was not included and no \\"power paw.\\" I called the 800# and was told they could not do anything since it was refurbished. When I pressed my point that refurbished is not \\"unfurbished\\" they agreed to send the extension wand. I had to buy the power paw at $14.99 plus over $8.00 in postage and handling. It's the last time I'll buy refurbished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does a good job, Powerful vacuum hose","review":"The Eureka Boss sweeper has been in use for about two years. I use it to sweep two to three times a week. No repairs to date. It is very heavy and not an easy item to lug to the upstairs. The vacuum hose accepts 1 1/4 inch accessories. I have added an old Shop Vac hose and can reach most of the bare floor in each room. The bare floor roller off lever is not easy to use. While the sweeper is running tip it back until the roller is off the floor then press the bare floor lever until it locks full back. Re-engaging the roller is much easier. This sweeper will probably outlast me, but in case it dose not, I will choose a lighter weight model the next time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not 100% Satisfied","review":"Firstly, I don't want to say this product is all bad. It's a great vacuum cleaner I'm sure for most people. The problems I've had are listed below:1 The belt is way too fragile. This could be an issue with thick carpet and low floor settings, but I really don't think it should only take a minute of running on the wrong floor setting for the belt to snap.2 On delivery, the end of the hose had a crack in it that greatly reduced suction. I didn't notice the crack right away and just assumed it was a problem with the suction of the host itself, but then realized this later. I'm not sure if this is still under warranty but I wonder if I can get a replacement.3 If you have a furry dog that sheds a lot, this is not the vacuum for you. I have an Australian Shepherd / Lab mix, and he sheds often. This vacuum does not deal well with that, make noises, and ultimately just leaves behind larger clumps of hair from the hair it's collected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price for a great vacuu","review":"When we purchased the vacuum, we were impressed with the value that it appeared to offer. It did not disappoint. Assembly was very easy and took about ten minutes. The vacuum worked great right from the start. It had a nice long cord and was easy to handle. It has the bag and belt information written on the vacuum, so if you can't find the manual you are still able to easily get replacements. The only small issue is the release lever for the handle, a bit stiff, but that is better than too loose. Overall a great deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"third time is a charm","review":"This is the third boss we've owned. Product works really well, but the quality is a tad bit lacking.. The attached hoses do not last as long as they should, have ordered at least three since we've owned them, the good news is that since this is our third, I have plenty of spare parts.. If the accessories were better built, there would be no reason to buy any other vacuum . Considering the price it is an overall great machine..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Vacuum I've Ever Used!","review":"I LOVE this vacuum! It's quieter than my old Dirt Devil and so much more powerful, got up debris that must have been in my carpet a long time, as it pretty much filled a bag after the first 2 times vacuuming. My other vacuum was that bad and this unit is FAB! No more pet hair worries! EZ to use and to switch from floor to hose. Lot's of carpet height selection to chose from too. Nice attachments and storage of them! It's not hard to push, like some others claim....they must have broken arms or extremely weak to say this! I'm a petite woman and have no problem with it! It glides across my carpet and bare floors. You just need to have it on the right height! Arrived Super Fast! I actually enjoy vacuuming with this Eureka. I would definitely Recommend this Vacuum to ALL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"works great...until it stops working","review":"the reviews are true--it's louder and heavier than my previous, more expensive hoover, but it got the job done. however, 8 months and about 20 vacuumings later, only the suction from the hose works! the refurbished warranty has lapsed, and forgive me for not wanting to clean a 2500 sq. ft. house with a hose from a heavy vacuum! i thought i was getting a great deal with the refurbished price...but $12/month for a vacuum that's now worthless isn't that great of a deal after all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the last time I'll buy \\"refurbished\\"","review":"This vacuum doesn't suck. It worked okay for awhile, but soon lost suction and now is the equivalent to a 20 lb dustbuster, but too unwieldy to use like a dustbuster so, overall, it's pretty much useless. I did so much research before buying a vacuum, but then got sucked in to the loooow refurbished price. Don't fall for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Very Careful with this Rebuilt Product","review":"I received vacuum within 1 day of ordering. Good. I used it for about 20 minutes when I switched from Floor to Hose suction...motor stopped immediately and never restarted.

I took machine to Eureka authorized service center noted on their website.....they refused to honor warrantee and service the product and advised returning it to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eureka Lemon","review":"Don't think of buying this vacuum.

In fact, nothing works as well as it should."},{"rating":"1","title":"The roller brush stopped","review":"I've had this vac only three months and suddenly, the roller brush stopped working and the motor heated up. I shut it off, removed the plate, and found that the belt was loose and melted in places.

I would recommend this vacuum. My previous vacuum was a Electrolux I received as a hand-me-down from my mother. I would have loved to get another one but they were way out of my price range! I thought this was about as close as I could get since either Electrolux makes Eureka or vis versa. I am happy with this product. I don't know if it will last the 20+ years the Electrolux did but we shall see!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great at first, then belt kept breaking","review":"I buy a vacuum every 8 years, so I need something that is very powerful and will never break down. This one is quieter than all the others I've had. All the functions work. It was easy to assemble and insert the bag. It's still a little tricky pressing down on the pedal to release the handle, but I'm getting the hang of it. I would buy another one in 8 years if they still sell them. It seems to me that this technology is perfect for my house - mostly hardwood floors with some mats, carpets, and one wall-to-wall carpet. The vacuum does a great job on all of them.UPDATE: December 2010 - After about a year, the vacuum ceased to pick things up and it demanded a new belt every three months. After over a year of arguing with the vacuum over whether it would turn the brush or not and spending a lot of money on belts, we finally trashed it and bought a Hoover."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOISY!","review":"This vacuum is noisy! Especially when using the bare floor mode. When using the hose just for corners it functions well, and is not quite as loud, but regular vacuuming with this thing requires ear plugs. And the regular vacuum doesn't pick up that well. You have to use the hose to pick up small particles that you've gone over several times with the vac.All in all, I know this was refurbished, but for the money, it should work a heck of a lot better than this! I wouldn't recommend this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"refurbished Eureks NOT!","review":"I immediatly noticed that the handle release mechanism was very hard to push. I called the local Eureka repair sight and they said this was normal. The spring was just stiff. Well it surely was. Just out of warranty, the release mechanism flew off the machine. I took it to the FACTORY local repair store. The entire base of the machine needed to be replaced at a cost greater than what I paid for it to begine with. Great purchase for a sucker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinky!","review":"After only a few uses with a new bag, smelly odors blow out the HEPA filter compartment. The filter's clean & doesn't smell, the bag's not full. We don't have pet or other carpet odor issues, so we can't figure it out. Only remedy is to change the bag, so we go through them way too quickly. Also, the switch for bare floors no longer works. I'm very disppointed in this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"On Time","review":"Received item most quickly...Christmas present...less then one week...seems to be working as it should.

We could tell right away that it outperformed our old vacuum hands down. It's rated as one of the highest by CR, and for good reason. The only complaint I have is that it is very hard to take it out of it's upright position. It feels like you about have to break it sometimes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prepare to spend a lot on bags","review":"This is a great vacuum cleaner and we use it regularly. After many years, we have not had to replace the belt. However, we have gone through bags like crazy. Perhaps that is a good sign that the vacuum is cleaning up a lot. However, the regular bag purchases do add significantly to the ongoing cost of the vacuum.The \\"cleaning\\" tools attachments work quite well, and have a significant reach that can be used to vacuum out cars or reach hard-to-access areas.The only complaints we have (other than extensive bag purchasing) are minor design issues:The storage area for cleaning tools is a little awkward to access, and some of the tools have a tendency to fall out.The \\"hinge lever\\" (to move the upright portion of the vacuum in to vacuuming position takes a bit of force to access. (This could also be viewed as a plus...)The plate to access the vacuum bag seems to be flimsily attached."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't use near small pets!","review":"Wow, does this vacumm suck! Without a doubt, it has the best suction of any vacumm I've ever used. Just don't get it near any of your small pets, they may disappear into the Hepa bag. The only drawback is the weight of the sweeper. However, it's worth the weight to have the suction. I would definitely buy this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"He sign the book to her but i brought it and read it first","review":"M.W Moore came up to DC for blackpride in May 2008.

After all, probability and statistics should involve heavy use of matehematics at higher level.On the other hand, if your maths background is not so strong, I would suggest a less technical book first, such as Mood, Graybill, Boes, which is easier to follow.

And, let's not forget the \\"Super Hummers\\" LM001's and 002's! It is well written and chock full of information and statistics that Lamborghini lovers will find interesting. Who knew that for all the glory the Miura and Countach brought the company the best selling model was the four-passenger Espada? Photos of Ferruccio, the factory and its assembly line are included.

However, the rollercoaster of extreme-ups and downs made it a season worth remembering by any standards. This DVD manages to take every main point of the season and pack it into a 25 minute video.As long as you don't mind paying $12 for a video that is less than half an hour long, this DVD is a must have for any big-time Birds fan. The video is crisp, and just like any other NFL Films video, the music is amazing and fits every highlight perfectly. The end also concludes with a few highlights of the most memorable moments of Veterans Stadium's history, leaving any Philadelphian to be proud of what we've left behind.

The unit easily disconnects if you maneuver the iPod in the car, for example, and I don't mean a drastic movement.2. The remote control, it says up to 150ft.... yeah right, that is NOT true, even within the car (I have a small car) if you don't point the remote directly to the unit, it won't work. It also is kind of slow when you push the button to change a song and when the iPod actually change it.The reason I rate this with 2 stars is because the unit, when it works, takes away that uncomfortable task to change the song by touching the iPod itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"if you HAVE to buy it","review":"If you have to buy it for a class then it is a great reference book, or even if you LIKE this sort of thing then yes it is well written and informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste","review":"I had this footstool for about a half a year and then one day out of the blue I was playing and it just snapped, the wood surrounding the metal bar just split.

But Beatles '65 is miles from either Meet The Beatles or, in the UK, Please Please Me.You'll notice the umbrella on the cover, and indeed, this is a great album for a rainy day.

Good purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather outdated book for beginners only","review":"If you know anything about assembly programming (for Intel or other CPUs) skip this book. It spends entire chapters covering very basic stuff (binary/octal/hex numbers etc).A large part of the book explains the difference between 8086, 80286, and 80386+ CPUs, and entire chapters deals with the the old 16-bit memory model and the strange segmented segmented memory model from 80286. Most examples are in 16-bit mode. Interesting maybe, but fairly useless in the year 2000, given that 80368 through Pentium-4 all are 32-bit CPUs.The \\"Programming for Linux\\" chapter is actually decent, but it is only 50 pages or so at the very end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor choice for the linux user","review":"I bought this book with the expectation that it would assist me in learning assembly for linux. The book provides only minimal background on linux, significantly the book largely ignores how to make system call within linux. If your looking to learn assembly for windows using NASM, this may be the book for you. However, the author in my opinion includes a lot of useless background information, for example the author spends an entire chapter dicussing how to use his own assembly tool built with pascal."},{"rating":"1","title":"For absolute beginners.","review":"I bought this book in the hope of getting to know assembly language a bit better. Unfortunately I regret buying this book. The book starts by using God's name in vain - something I've never seen in a programming text. Furthermore, pages and pages are spent explaining and elaborating even the simplest of concepts. I guess this book might be of some use to an absolute beginner - but then again? Which beginner programmer starts with assembly language?I can really not recommend this book, especially if you have a analytical mind. However if you like long elaborated stories and you like skipping all the important detail, this book may be useful. I would rather recommend Kip Irvine's book \\"Assembly Language for Intel-based computers\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginners beware","review":"I'm taking assembly language as part of my CS courses. If you need to learn assembly language don't buy this book.

It's a freakin dos editor for pete's sake. A waste of 40 pages.Chap 6, 40 pages to cover memory architecture, boring. Have we coded yet? Nope!Chap 7 Finally he covers the assembly language syntax.Chap 8 - 11, Actually covers assembly language programs, but the examples are lame.Chap 12 -13 is coding for Linux, about 200 pagesMy advice if your professor sticks you with this book is to search the web or buy another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Assembly Book","review":"The author starts this book out very strangly, but once you get into it you find that his craziness is well deserved. Programming is very difficult, but learning the basics is even harder. It starts out helping a person understand the numbering system of computers and then moves on into the meat of Assembly Language.I would recommend this book to anyone who has an assembly class or anyone who wants to learn how programming language like Java, C, C++ or others translate their code to instructions that the computer understands. Those instructions are in assembly and the other languages use assembly to assess computer parts to make everything work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great introduction to Assembly Language","review":"The problem with learning Assembly Language is learning everything you need to know before you learn Assembly. This book starts you at the very beginning by showing you how memory is addressed, how the internals of the computer work, and numbering systems. Although he doesn't really get into programming until later in the book, by the time he gets there you actually understand what is going on at a low level. And let's face it... if you don't understand the low level of the computer, you don't stand a chance at really understanding Assembly Language. This book should be the starting point for anyone who wants to learn Assembly. Once you've mastered this book, you should be able to pick up any more advanced book and understand what is going on."},{"rating":"2","title":"very informative","review":"The first couple hundred pages review number bases, computer architecture, and for the most part answer that perplexing question, how does a computer work? The author then covers assembly language in DOS, which is kind of outdated but still very informative. At the very end of the book the author covers assembly language in Linux. Even if you are not looking to learn assembly language I recommend this book. It is very informative and a must have for any programmer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird Book!","review":"I dont know how to rate this book! It's one of the oddest computer books I've read, and not really in a good way.The first 150 pages explain how to use the NASM editor in excruciating detail. Not things like how to code macros or map segment addresses... no, things like, how the Backspace key differs from Delete.Surely, if you are buying a book about Assembler programming, you can be assumed to understand how a computer keyboard works?The parts that DO talk about segment addressing and so on are well written though, and the latter half of the book is not bad at all. So, I mentally tore off the front chunk of the book and gave it a good if somewhat perplexed rating.One other irritating thing is the author's apparent obsession with Pascal.

But after that, it bored right down to the same old tedious drivel.If I'd wantd a Harlequin romance, I would have purchased one for a lot less money than this book cost.

They help mold character.We're reminded of ultimate reality as Dr. Peale writes, \\"in the last analysis, only the God-directed life can attain true and basic success.\\" The work ethic is stressed also.

Love will be the one in her repertoire that most of the pop influenced culture will turn to in effort to say that they have read one of her novels. They will even laud it as one of the best because this will be the only one they have read or mostly comprehended.Love is an easy read, but Ms. Morrison's use of language and her power of description will still make any reader reflect on the profoundness of the story. Her characters are so captivating and so strong they almost scar you with their complexities. Yes, they do live. That is Ms. Morrison's strength; making her characters live. The story was simple, but told with a grandeur that only this author can tell it with. The scenes were full, the plot was complex, and the story well put together.Ms. Morrison has done it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love","review":"This was my first time reading a Toni Morrison book.

How that instantly changes her, breaks down her wall of defence, and in the process probably also leaving her less mysterios and therefore less attractive in that darkly sexual manner.For me that was one of the highlights while reading the book. It is very insightful of Toni to write around the event the way she did.Overall, and compared to other books by her, it's a story that left me feeling warm, almost the same way Song of Solomon did, not too depressed the way Beloved did. It is also much easier to read through, not becasue it's a simple and easy story to tell but maybe because Toni really wanted readers to enjoy the book and at the same time take something from her thoughts.So thumbs up to love.... and to South Africa for winning the soccer world cup bid, if you don't mind!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Papa's Dead, Who's Got The Will?","review":"That's about all I could get from this tedious story.

If you are very familiar with Malaysia politics and business, it makes a great read. Otherwise, only of interest to academics in politics, political economy, and perhaps 'Transparency International.' The only caveat is that it mainly applies to very large business efforts - while something of the entire patronage culture obviously permiates many transaction levels here, only the really big (nationally important) stuff draws the kind of attention discussed in this book.The book basically presents a slightly pessimistic but fairly accurate view of major business efforts and their effects.

The scope of his research and factual grounding is impressive, and his writing stlye is entertaining enough, for a history text. However, it is very easy to tell that Mr. Kirschbaum has an extremely biased pro-Slovak view of the nations history, especially as regards Slovakia's involvement in World War II and the Holocaust. Astute readers will pick up references to a Jozef Kirschbaum who was, for a short time during the war, a government official in Slovakia; This Jozef Kirschbaum is presumably a close relative of the author's, due to the fact that the author has edited a book in memory of Jozef Kirschbaum.

I could not get through the whole book due to the fact that no quotation marks are used by the author. Found too many other errors as well. It's a shame because I think the author has good intentions and this could be a good book if not for the editing. I bought the other 2 books as well and will be returning them.

This was a great book. It provided mystery, humor, small town closeness and strangeness (snake festival).

Don't miss out on this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great!","review":"I bought this hoping it would work as well as my Mr. Clean Autodry System because that too has been discontinued. It did not. I've washed my car 4 times with it and each time I end up with lots of spots. Oddly enough, when it rains on my car after a wash the spots go away. Weird! Unless, I'm using the product wrong it does not leave a spotless shine without wiping the car down with a chamois afterwards(which I haven't tried yet). I do like the way it soaps up the car. I will probably save the unit and refill it with car soap when I wash my car in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drastically reduced price is misleading","review":"Although this quilt is okay for the price, the quality is such that I would never dream of paying more than $35 for it.

Marsh criticizes Springsteen's fans for resisting elements of Born in the USA and its accompanying hoopla, but never fairly addresses the possibility that they may be correct in assessing the album's failures. Other reviewers are right that in Marsh's mind, Springsteen can do no wrong, both musically and personally. The low point of this book for me was his fawning over not only Dancing in the Dark (one of my most depressing moments as a Springsteen fan was the disappointment I felt when the long awaited new single turned out to be this synth-driven throwaway), but the dance remixes of the Born in the USA singles. Yuck! Even more frustrating is the fact that Marsh never questions the judgment of Jon Landau as he pushes the reluctant Springsteen towards superstardom. It was clear to me the compromises Bruce made to gain such popularity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bitter, cynical fans trash this book unfairly!","review":"This is not an awful book, as other reviews have suggested. Dave Marsh's unabashed enthusiasm for Bruce's music should not be taken as gospel. Do you believe everything you read? Heck no! As with any rabid fan's writing, \\"Glory Days\\" contains its share of deification, but a closer look might reveal things of which you were not previously aware. \\"Dancing in the Dark\\" does indeed possess a rather dark set of lyrics, but I, like many other Springsteen fans, had dismissed it as synthetic fluff. What a mistake! What insight on the part of the writer, in this and many other instances!

Production and songs are perfect for her voice and delivery(not too popish or discoish). I'll never understand how the Britney's and Christina's and Mariah's and Janet's would be so much bigger than this girl. She's got it all and then some: If you haven't heard her, try to hear in your mind a melding of Patti Labelle, Jean Kennedy (from Mother's Finest), Chaka Khan, and Taylor Dayne - all at their creative and vocal prime! My favorite female R&B CD since \\"Rapture\\" by Anita Baker."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a voice!","review":"Where has Anastacia been all these years! Finally a bluesy singer with incredible range has made it into the mainstream. It's about time! It's hard not to be impressed with Anastacia's vocal abilities! I love listening to her vocal range and am always dazzled by the fact that the back-up music is only that - \\"back-up\\". She definitely dominates with her talented vocal range. If you like powerful blues with a bit of funk (Janis Joplin/ Patty LaBelle) -I would recommend this CD. A great CD for listening to in the car."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd give it 6 stars if I could.","review":"I've never heard her played on the radio, but a friend caught her 'I'm Outta Love' video on VH1 and recommended her. So after listening to the samples I got the CD -and was blown away. I've been listening to it non stop. The music has a unique instrumentation and her voice is incredible. The songs are a great mix of mellow -even jazzy - and upbeat rock. An even blend of get up and dance, and sit back and chill. My favorite picks are 'Why'd You Lie to Me' for upbeat; and 'Who's Gonna Stop the Rain' for mellow (great lyrics too). I have an eclectic taste in music, but I don't know how anyone -whatever tastes- could not like this CD. There's not a bad song on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"She is NOT that kind!","review":"She's not... this blond & amazing woman is the hottest thing in the music industry these days. If you expected another good looking blond woman who can't sing- you are SO wrong. Anastacia is different. Not only she is pretty; she has an amazing voice & amazing vocal qualities. This mix-up of good looks instead talent reminds Christina Aguilera- beautiful & vocal talented. Like Christina, Anastacia has a great R&B album, & she even wrote some of the songs. Her voice is so strong & unique & that is something you just can't ignore. The pearl of this album is definitely the beautiful & so-very-special balled, Who's Gonna Stop The Rain. Not only that the music & Anastacia's voice are both amazing, the words are very deep, special & makes you think of this world. Other great tracks are Black Roses, I'm Outta Love, Not That Kind & lots more. Conclusion, buy this album. I guaranty that it will be one of the best buys you'd make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disco Diva","review":"First off, I love Anastacia. She's got an amazing voice, one that really knocks Jessica Simpson off the block, but unfortunately, this album didn't deliver quite what I expected, or like so much.

While these influences are incredibly apparent, they are never taken for granted. On \\"Turning Into Small\\" the band blends surreal pop ether with eccentric electronic loops and twitches. The faded, whispy vocals floating inside the warm textures are reminiscent of MBV but are used to different purposes, which are more playful than passionate. This album in compared with their others, offers a more \\"electronic-heavy\\" approach, while it doesn't outweigh the atmosphere the band often possesses, it is a little more direct on this offering. With the right ears, this is one album that will not disappoint, instead bringing you back to further and ultimately enjoyable listenings."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT undervalued gem of an album","review":"This is a great album for lovers of the \\"shoegaze\\" sound, for fans of layered, warm guitars and blissed-out headspace.

They follow the same chapters and format, and provide little new information, maybe some code. But once you start to get into Spring and use it, you'll want a reference that is more in depth.

For people would like an introduction book, \\"Spring In Action\\" is good one to begin with, or get Johnson's \\"J2EE Development without EJB\\".The only thing I don't lile about the book is that there is no code download (although it claimed you can download from Wrox site), and also there are typos in code, which I believe it is from Wrox not Johnson.

Let me explain, the big flap you see is the velcro part. And you simply place the flap onto the shoe. Sounds simple enough, but the problem is you can't tighten the velcro. The Velcro doesn't go through a hole/loop initially, so you can't pull on it and then set the velcro down. Even if you hold the shoe really tight and then drop the velcro down, it is still loose. So what I had to do was set the velcro down without my foot in it. Then I use a shoe horn to get into the shoe so the shoe will fit snug enough so you won't slip out of the shoe, otherwise, you feet will come out of the shoe. The problem with the simple fix of shoe horning my feet in is that the shoe has a tongue, and the tongue gets shoved down. So after getting into the shoe I have to dig out the tongue and pull it up.As for looks, even with velcro it can easily pass off as a comfortable dress shoe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really comfy shoes","review":"I ordered these for my brother in law who is diabetic and has lots of problems with shoes.

It's like a child playing with with toy soldiers. There is no point to anything that happens in this series. The good guys and bad guys have no goals or allegiances. It seems like they have a simple code: \\"Wow! Another mecha, lets blow it up!\\" They simply fight for the hell of it.

The chapter on photography was a serious let down, and focused on only two photographers who are amateur at best in regards to their talent.

Unfortunately, Mr Palmer displays a thorough lack of historical perspective in this very weak presentation.Palmer's protrait of Robert E Lee as lacking all the necessary mental capacities when it comes to undertaking offensive warfare is completely devoid of historical understanding of the campaigns involving generals such as Hannibal, Caesar, Frederick the Great, Napoleon and many others who commanded numerically inferior armies. And of course, Palmer offers absolutely no supporting evidence to prop up his claims because in this book the outcome of the campaign is proof enough.I agree with another reviewer here that this piece is very agenda-driven, simply because of the thin presentation, no supporting evidence, which could only come from a lack of understanding of the campaigns involving the Great Captains."},{"rating":"1","title":"Factually challenged, agenda-driven history","review":"Mr Palmer's \\"work\\" is a factually challenged, agenda-driven piece that cannot standup to common sense, much less proper historical analysis. His \\"criticisms\\" of Lee are such that one is left wondering what background in military history Mr Palmer possesses. As a consequence, Mr Palmer misunderstands the strategic situation facing a numerically weaker side, what a numercially inferior side MUST do to have a chance to win, and how Lee reacted under these circumstances. Without a doubt, Mr Palmer's most laughable assertion is that Lee went North in the Gettysburg campaign without any clear cut objectives. Clearly, Mr Palmer needs to do a lot more reading. I suggest two different books if one wants to gain a much better understanding of the Confederate strategic situation: these are Richard Tanner's \\"Retreat to Vicotry?\\" and Scott Bowden's \\"Last Chance for Victory.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a joke","review":"Having read several books on Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia, and having a very high opinion of General Lee, I decided I should try and be objective by reading some books that were critical of General Lee.

Unfortunately, Eddie's not totally funny in this crass update. If you're into flatulence or fat jokes, then this movie is right up your alley. But its threadbare plot takes second place to Eddie's mugging not only of his title character and alter ego, but also all of the Klumps as well. Jada Pinkett is the customary African/American woman who does her best (Like Halle Berry or Vanessa Williams) to look as Caucasian as she can. The late James Coburn as a cameo role as a hotshot millionaire out to fund Murphy's research project, and Dave Chappelle has a bit as a stand up comic who is not all that funny either. While the intentions are good, THE NUTTY PROFESSOR of 1996 doesn't capture the manic charisma of the one and only Jerry Lewis whose mugging was more charming than obnoxious."},{"rating":"1","title":"hey eddie? howzabout making a movie about washed-up black comics who dig transvestite hookers?","review":"an amazingly bad movie. eddie murphy (who was funny in the 80s) manages the near-impossible: he makes jerry lewis seem sophisticated. now dont get me wrong; i love stupid comedy -- when its funny. murphy never convinces an iota here in the role of the HUGE professor klump. there is scads of humor to be mined in the struggles of fat people to fit into the normal world (take my word, i know about THAT) -- just recall oliver hardy's girth getting him stuck in a doorway during his attempt to escape bogeyland -- but murphy is merely contemptuous and nasty. well, contemptuous and nasty in a comedy i can accept, but it better be funny. this movie has a high spot on my list of the 10 worst i have ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Murphy film","review":"Eddie Murphy does a great job in this film playing various members of the Klump family.

A la carte it tastes a lot like your typical Chinese food sweet and sour sauce, but with a very spicy Chipolte punch.

Furthermore, the mixture is such that when grilling with it, the sauce caramelizes and chars if the heat is too intense. That's a whole different mess.

Over all I found it a great balance.I tried their suggestion of serving it with cream cheese and crackers and it was okay, though it wouldn't have been my first choice. However I added it to some barbequed beef and the difference was astounding. It really added a depth of flavor that everyone seemed to enjoy. I've already started to plan future experiments to explore the sauce's versatility.I have to say that the price of the sauce seems a bit high, but I suppose it compares to other high-end gourmet sauces.

Next I'll probably just slather it on some crackers, but I'm sure that my lovely wife will soon apply it to a more exotic concoction.

This spicy, seedy, tangy sauce will give new meaning to the word \\"heartburn.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A great combination of flavors!","review":"This Roasted Raspberry Chipotle Sauce is really good. The sweetness of the raspberries, the spiciness of the peppers (both jalapenos and chipolte are listed as ingredients), and the smoke flavoring make an outstanding combination together.The sauce does have raspberry seeds in it...if that bothers you, you can always pull out a strainer and get rid of them. The sauce is good on Bar-B-Que meat, but should be spread on when the meat is almost done. If it's put on too early, the sugar will burn and you'll end up with a charred mess. It can also be used as is, poured over a block of cream cheese and served as an appetizer with crackers. I recommend regular cream cheese, rather than the low-fat variety, as the fat tones down the spiciness a bit. The neck tag on the bottle also suggests adding it to a balsamic vinegar salad dressing. I haven't used it that way (yet), but imagine that it would be pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Flavor combination, but it works.","review":"I really had no idea of what to think of this product. A coworker told me it was great stuff, and recommended I try it over cream cheese on a cracker. So I did. I was expecting a strong raspberry taste, but it's probably equally mixed with the chipotle pepper taste. You get a nice taste of the raspberry and a nice, what I would consider almost perfect, taste of the pepper. I am not a fan of super hot things, and while this left a slight burn, it wasn't much at all.Package says to try this with fish, chicken, beef, or mix with vinegar and olive oil for a dressing. I'll try the later, although I'm not too keen on strong 'sauces' on my chicken/beef/etc. Although it may be the perfect compliment. The only reason I marked this at 4 stars instead of 5 is that I feel it's limited in it's usefulness. An item that my wife and I enjoy, however we probably won't be able to finish one small jar much less a 6-pack of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good at all","review":"I tried this out on a number of people with varying tastes ranging from those who prefer sweet to spicy barbecue sauces. Nobody liked it at all, and nobody would give it another shot. With that said, I'll stick to masterpiece and doctor it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yum!","review":"This Fischer & Wieser Razzpotle sauce is sweet and smoky, just like it says. There's some bite too it; not too much to overpower the raspberriness, though. I've used it now with both steak and chicken and have to note the following:1) It's pretty sweet, and this high sugar content means that it can turn to carbon pretty quickly. For that reason, I have learned that the best way to use this is to barbecue your meat almost to completion, than put some on top of the meat and let it cook a minute or two more, without turning over the meat.2) A little gives a lot of flavor. You don't want to overdo it.3) Add a little to your plate to swish your meat around in. Delicious.4) Great on sour cream, with rice crackers. Again, you don't need much.I'd recommend this and I'll definitely buy it again. One caveat, though - a pack of six 20 ounce bottles will last you quite a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly tasty","review":"I made garlic meatballs and used this as a glaze. It adds an interesting note to beef, have not tried with chicken. It is sweetly raspberry and chipotle just as described. I wouldn't use it as a dipping sauce as there is both a bit too strong in sweetness and pepper flavor, but its perfect used IN a dish or as a marinade to add a special touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"smokey sweet goodness","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by how much I like this sauce. Some reviewers commented on the sweetness. To me, the sweetness is about the same as many commercial barbeque sauces. The amount of heat from the peppers was fine for me - however, probably not hot enough for those individuals who like to have their eyes run and their sinus cavities seared when eating spicy foods.I tried out this product by sauteing a firm white fish and topping it with the Razzpotle and feta cheese. It was terrific! It is also extremely good on a fresh turkey sandwich.The downside is that it is expensive. I don't think that I would choose to spend fifty bucks for a case of barbeque sauce, no matter how good it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raspberry Chipolte","review":"This Raspberry Chipolte is the best.

I've been waiting to do this review until I really got into this sauce and I find myself using it more than I ever expected. I treat it like a lean meat flavor enhancer and use it on certain things. Mind you, expecting this to work on hamburgers or veal is expecting too much. This fruity sweet sauce has a slow burn from the chipotle. I am a spice nut and I didn't find this too spicy at all - mind you, I have no problems with jalapeños or habaneros or fiery BBQ sauces, so if you cant take most spices, you might find this to have a bit more heat than you expect. I recommend this to marinade chicken in or slather on pork chops."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderfully tasty sauce","review":"A total yummy experience. The tangy, frest fruit scent and taste of raspberries including the seeds; the smoky chipotle and zingy bite of spices and peppers make this sauce fabulous on every level.

That's the only thing that explains the endless, pointless descriptions of alien animal life. Every dialog is three times longer than it needs to be - the author says the same thing three times in different ways, adding no insight.I'm a big fan of Jude Watson's Jedi Apprentice series. This book is nothing like those. It has no plot and offers no insight into the Jedi world or the political situation that leads up to AotC. It doesn't even focus on Obi Wan and Anikan. Rather, it focuses on a different, superfluous, obnoxious, condescending Master/Padawan team.If you are going to read this book, you can safely skip chapters 7 through 14 (inclusive) and miss absolutely nothing important. Better yet, read all of the Jude Watson books instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secession threatens tottering Republic control.","review":"Alan Dean Foster's first Star Wars novel in almost twenty-five years is a direct lead in for Episode II: Attack of the Clones, so it reads more like the first part of a trilogy rather than a stand alone novel. The story begins as Obi Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker are sent out to aide another Jedi Knight and her Padawan in negotiations with the planet Ansion,... Readers expecting a more action packed Star Wars adventure might be disappointed with the amount of world building that Foster does in the narrative and the conclusion leaves the reader hanging (like I said, it's meant to flow right into Episode II), hopefully Foster will write a sequel to this tale and interpolate the narrative events of Attack of the Clones, thus creating a book-movie-book trilogy within the arc of the prequel trilogy.

At one point, the four Jedi involved take turns entertaining their hosts with singing, dancing and storytelling. Foster spends many pages on this. It was boring and meaningless, other than for character development, and why is he developing characters halfway through the novel?Foster doesn't paint the inhabitants of Anison very well.

They go on a journey that lest a couple of hundred pages, they encounter every form of wildlife they can, they get to the tribe, the tribe signs the treaty, end of story.This awful plot is supplemented by bad characterizations and horrible humor along the lines of a Jedi apprentice telling individuals who have implants in their heads that may explode that they have \\"explosive personalities\\".

I saw misspellings and typos in this book!!!The way our four Jedi work with the Force is inconsistent; the characters are all one-dimensional; the plot is predictable; the dialog is terrible (but Lucas is just as guilty of that); the story is too neat and clean and not nearly compelling enough to warrant 350+ pages.

The book is incredibly predictable, and you know what is going to happen long before it happens.Personally I would recommend this book only to die hard Star Wars fans. If your looking for suspense and action try the New Jedi Order books."},{"rating":"2","title":"two and a half thumbs up","review":"I found this book very creative and immersing. A must read for any star wars fan. Though the book is much more political than it is action, it is still a very good book. I feel when fans finally see ATOC they will be able to appreciate this book a lot more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Foster have a ghost-writer???","review":"I expect FAR better from Alan Dean Foster, given that the original STAR WARS novelization, along with SPLINTER OF THE MIND'S EYE, were excellent stories.The plot is threadbare, the villains cardboard and boring, the dialoge and what pass for \\"action\\" scenes repetitive, the phrasing poorly written and edited, and Foster also committed one of my pet peeves: switching points-of-view within the same section, literally from paragraph to paragraph in many cases.Badly written; badly edited. Obviously rushed to grab sales before the new movie comes out. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greencards score again!","review":"Another solid album from this young and talented group. Delicate vocals with matched harmonies, driving bluegrass coupled with Americana roots folk music. The Greencards continue to evolve and attract new audiences, but this CD will continue to satisfy their dedicated fans around the globe. Hard to pick a favorite, but rest assured, you might find it eventually, but in the meantime keep listening to this great CD in its entirity...it's hard to imagine that anyone could get tired of listening to this CD over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all the pieces arrived","review":"Not all the pieces arrived.It took a long time to be delivered.I am disapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun break from the traditional pregnancy books","review":"While some of the items they discuss are pricey and may not be realistic for everyone, this book is definitely written for those of us who don't necessarily want to wear the same clothes everyday or squash our personal style. It's a fun read and does have helpful info."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less helpful than I expected","review":"I should have looked a little more closely before buying this book. It's totally brand and celebrity focused, sprinkled with quotes from the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow to Kimora Simmons, and product recommendations including brand new Jimmy Choo stilettos to accomodate your swelling feet (seriously!). Also not sure I needed to buy a book for earth-shattering advice such as: \\"if you're hair becomes dry, switch to a more rich conditioner meant for dry hair\\". No kidding. There is an extensive list of websites that sell stylish maternity clothes, and I am sure if you go through them all you are bound to find stuff you like. Overall, I felt it was a little over the top, and not very practical for the average woman but I guess that's what rock star means. You've been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written by a rock star's wife---keep that in mind!","review":"This book was written by the wife of Mark Hoppus-of the rock band Blink 182. If you're expecting this book to be for \\"normal folk\\", you'll be disappointed. If you have an unlimited income and aren't forced to peruse the racks at the local mall's Motherhood Maternity store, then this book is for you! I mean, Kimora Lee Simmons and Gwyneth Paltrow are 2 of Hollywood's most egotistical women. With these 2 giving you style advice, it's no wonder you're going to be told to drop $450 on a pair of pregnancy stilettos. The book sucks. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of 2010","review":"Most of the best matches of matches of the year all on here can't get better than that.

We've been reading it to him since he was 4-5 months old and he turns 1 next week and he still wants us to read this to him every day.

I suspect that this size will be so ungainly to handle that the child that I ordered this book for will not be able to handle it or hold it in bed, as did ours. I suspect also that because it is not a board book, it will not hold up very well. There was no way of telling when I ordered the book, that it was such a gigantic copy, but I would not have kept it had the date that I needed it for was too close to return the book and get another of the right size."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"Maybe not quite the level of a \\"Goodnight Moon\\" or \\"Runaway Bunny\\", but an absolute delight.

I looked at the book after he opened it and was pleased with the text and pictures. It is just the right size for him and it was exactly what I wanted it to be. His mother says he enjoys it and I'm sure he will enjoy the story as he gets older. Perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We love this book!","review":"A beautifully written book that captures my children's attention, yet doesn't underestimate their capacity to grasp new words like \\"weathervane\\" or \\"clutch (of eggs).\\" I read this to my daughter at 18 months and she wanted me to read it again and again. Within a month she was reciting it. After reading it so much I memorized it and started using the story to lull my newborn son to sleep. He is now nearly a year old, my daughter is 2-1/2 and they both still love the book. I have yet to tire of it. This is my favorite Margaret Wise Brown book, including Goodnight Moon and Runaway Bunny. Another MWB book that's a big hit for our family is My World."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"My youngest just loves this book. Super pictures and simple story. Animals are always great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great learning book!","review":"Our 18 month old daughter loves this book. Easy to read, easy for her to follow. We enjoy it at bedtime. Words and pictures teach animals, some numbers, colors, etc. Much to gain from this book! Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BEDTIME READ","review":"My 2-year-old daughter loves this book because of the farm animals and likes pointing out the scarecrow when he appears. It's a great book for bedtime because it's calming and toward the end it gets dark and the animals start turning in for the night. The illustrations are beautiful and it is an enjoyable read for all. If your child likes animals and the moon, this is a must-buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son's favorite","review":"My 3-year-old son picked this book out himself and loves it. The rhyme is enjoyable, and he has fun looking at the illustrations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a favorite of my sons","review":"My son loves to read books, but this one does not keep his attention. He likes Goodnight Moon, the Boyton Books, and others, but this doesn't keep his interest. I do like that it shows various animals and their noises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually a bedtime story","review":"Margaret Wise Brown succeeds again in creating a story that parents love to read and children love to listen to.I love to read this story at bedtime. As the story takes us through a busy day on the farm, it ends gently and quietly with the barn animals retreating to sleep in the big red barn. The illustrations are wonderful too because they darken at the end of the story, and finish off with the moon sailing high \\"in the dark night sky.\\" The last picture of this book enchants even me. As I get to the part where dusk settles in, I start to lower my voice and end in a whisper. Both my children- 2 and 6- love this. I'm sure you will enjoy reading it to your darlings at bedtime as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mother from Menlo Park, CA","review":"From the author of Goodnite Moon, the Big Red Barn is a terrific book for babies through preschoolers. It is a wonderful story of donkeys and cows and geese and goats living in a Big Red Barn.

I didn't even know about this book until I saw that my husband had picked it up at the bookstore. This book is illustrated by a different artist, Felicia Bond, and her work is sweet and uncomplicated. The story has that same rhythm and beat you follow when reading poetry, but it is also gives a peaceful feeling to it's readers(and the ones being read to).It's a day in the life of kind of story about animals on a farm, while the children are gone. It is a perfect addition to any child's book shelf and makes for a perfect bedtime story with it's calming effect.I highly recommend buying this for toddlers! If you already have any of Brown's other books, this one will be a welcome addition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a great book!","review":"The story is so cute and supports interaction and elaboration on every page.

It has been a favorite of many of my 2-3 year olds so our copy has long ago worn out. I came here to order another one and didn't think to check the dimensions of the book. Out of all the books I have purchased online, I have never checked the dimensions and have never felt the need. I don't plan to make that mistake again!

Or maybe they planned to read it in a stadium and wanted to guarantee the kids could see the pictures from far the back row of seats. Geesh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obviously not a M.W. Brown book!","review":"The illustrations are simple and lovely in this book. The text, however, is very poorly written with a tense that changes randomly. The book contains whole sections which do not fit the flow of the story - a rather sorry accomplishment in a board book. This book was a manuscript that M.W. Brown left when she died unexpectedly at a young age. The co-author then edited the manuscript and the publisher put it out.

I sat right behind Booger, aka Adam from Camp Crystal Lake (see above). Adam used to post as Booger. He was real snotty during this game. On top of that, he picked his nose throughout the entire game, and was flicking his boogers (hence his name) on Alabama fans sitting near him. I didn't think that was a very sportsmanlike thing to do. This game telecast has a shot of Booger with his index finger buried deep into his nostrils, scooping out a big green sticky mass of hardened phlegm from his nose, so it is worth buying just to see that shot. The funny thing is, later in the game some Alabama fans, fed up with getting boogers flicked on them, gave Booger an atomic wedgie right during the game. Its just too bad this video didn't capture that epic moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete guide, not detailed","review":"The guide was complete.

This gets listed as metalcore mainly because they are on the Prosthetic label. They, like many of their counterparts, infuse a decent amouont of Swedish-style riffing and leads. Cannae are obviously at least somewhat influenced by At The Gates. One thing you won't find here is any punk sounding parts with pretty emo vocals. This rips all the way through. The drumming is also a high point, for me at least. \\"Horror\\" is a good CD in most regards, not really original, but good.

The reader can hear Mr. Simon's distinctive and familiar voice when reading the pages. The book is not intended to be a comprehensive history on baseball's integration or a biography of Jackie Robinson, as noted in the opening pages. Rather, it provides just the right amount of background on Mr. Robinson and Mr. Richey, as well as the context surrounding events. Mr. Simon's notes and examples stimulate readers to learn more about particular people and events. I particularly recommend this book (and possibly the series from the list of forthcoming books) as a quick read for adults and teenagers who desire to read about the people and events that shaped our nation, yet must balance the responsibilities of family, work and community, which may prevent them from reading longer books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book / series","review":"This is the second book I've read in the series (after Columbus in the Americas by William Least Heat-Moon). They are both vivid, concise accounts of extraordinary moments. I came to this book without knowing much about Jackie Robinson. I couldn't put the book down.

It's a wonderful idea, to get great authors to offer their insights about a particular historic event in a pocket size book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative and amateurish book","review":"This book offers nothing in the way of original research or new conclusions about the integration of organized baseball; it is full of errors, special pleading, and misplaced nostalgia. It also fails to acknowlege its debt to the superior work of others, especially Jules Tygiel (*Baseball's Great Experiment: Jackie Robinson and his Legacy*) and John C.

Purchase either of the latter books (or both) and give this misconceived vanity effort a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alibis for the Red Sox","review":"Mr. Simon is an esteemed radio journalist, but this book hardly qualifies for even the low standards of sports journalism. Many factual errors, and Mr. Simon spends almost as much time coming up with excuses for why the Red Sox were the last team to integrate, as he does celebrating Jackie Robinson and those who spurred the re-integration of \\"Organized Baseball.\\" This dashed-off effort completely overlooks that Blacks WERE previously in Organized Baseball, but were booted out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good effert !!","review":"Good cd, but not his best!

Lynn Eib is a cancer survivor and she tells the stories of about 20 people who also faced cancer. As a pastor, I find that cancer brings many questions about faith, Jesus and healing. I have given away about 25 copies of this book to people in our congregation, both those with cancer and family members who also struggle with their faith in a time like this.This is a witness to the presence of God in the midst of some of the darkest time of a person's life.

I wish I hadn't read it, as it took me a while to get out of the depressed mood this book put me in.

All around great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage, Trash, and Useless","review":"Where do I start. Out of the box, the stock was cracked. Within two weeks of use, the bipod falls off, the light won't stay on, the stock is completely broke. Oh! Did I mention the usage problems?Suppressor screws on crooked, clip notoriously loads more than one round, that is of course you hold it perfectly still and in a perfectly horizontal position (O.K. plus or minus a few degrees). Don't bother using the scope, since it points enough off of center that the target better be within 2 feet of the muzzle.Had bought another gun for another son who experienced the same type of shoddy workmanship and poor quality so the makers can't blame it on the child. I won't buy another thing from this store or from these makers ever!Bought this as a Christmas gift so I had it for 30+ days. No refund available. Buyers beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Poop!!!","review":"This gun not only smelled like a piece of poop when i got it but it also performed like one!!!!

The next day (i am really into airsoft) the silencer fell off and was no longer silencing!!! 2 days later the cocking mechanism snapped and that was the end of the short life of this piece of POOP!!! I would NOT recomend this gun. The box claims that it can shoot fifty feet, i wouldnt even give it ten!?!?!?! The scope was basically a paper towel tube! Even its Butt fell off!

Not particulary well researched or well argued - embarrassing, really.Anyway, it doesn't matter what I think, just ask yourself this: If we really are awash in oil (at about $130/barrel today) - don't you think someone would have found it by now? Even just a little of this oil the authors claim to know about??? Yes, there could be cause for 'hiding' this fact to keep oil priced, but how could so many independent companies/countries/scientists collude on keeping secret such a valuable resource?And, yes, the authors don't really understand centrifugal vs. centripetal force. Google exactly that and see for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After reading the claims that this book would turn the world on it's ear, I was expecting a whole bunch more. There's been more than 50 years of scientific research into fossil fuels, I find it difficult to believe that all of a sudden everything we know about oil is wrong. A few quoted technicians versus 1000's of teams of geologists and research specialists doesn't seem like a fair match.This book didn't prove it to me, oil is fairly obviously becoming harder and harder to drill for, and more expensive to bring up. The Canadian Shale takes almost as much energy in natural gas to produce the oil as it's worth, and they can only generate a million barrels a day. Hardly enough to make a difference in a world that uses 89 million barrels of oil per day.For another book in this category I highly recommend Michael Ruppert's \\"Crossing the Rubicon\\". THAT book makes sense, and scares me as a see the effects of our diminishing cheap oil supply."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bullturd","review":"This movie was not even good.

Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon Levitt are usually very engaging to watch, but this story also seemed to hold a lot of promise.

Hard to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very creative, original sci-fi action thriller. New twist on time-travel plot.","review":"I loved this movie! It has all the elements of a cheesy blockbuster, but somehow succeeds in avoiding all the tropes and cliches. It's a completely original concept even though it's futuristic-police-force-of-mercenaries has been done (poorly) before in The 6th Day, Minority Report, and Total Recall. I loved the new take on time travel and liked how the filmmakers handled the obvious logical problems associated with having yourself and a future version of yourself in the same present moment. It was a mental stretch, but I had no trouble suspending my disbelief.All in all a must-watch movie. Bruce Willis is totally great and actually doesn't overwhelm the rest of the cast, who all got a chance to act along side the superstar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time well spent","review":"After reading some of the not so glorious reviews, I decided to give the movie a shot anyway. I was pleasantly surprised. I think some people expect too much from a movie. movies are made to entertain and this one did just that.

It has been alleged in the past that when going back or forward in time you needed to avoid making contact with yourself. Apparently this is not true as Spock revealed in the latest Star Trek and now in Looper. This is good to know for when I make the trip into time myself. Looper is exciting and action packed coupled with thought provoking concepts. A fun movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't enjoyable","review":"I personally did not enjoy this movie.

I was astonished at the bad reviews for this flick. It was imaginative, well scripted, directed and acted. What more could you want for a good sic-fi flick.

To me, this movie was a letdown. Violent (I'm ok with violence done well), and not at all original even with time travel being the main theme.

First, incorporating time travel into a movie or television is always tricky and Looper has a lot of glaring holes in logic. Second, Bruce Willis' character is on a mission to kill a mob kingpin when the kingpin is a child. Because 3 childen were born in the same hospital at the same time, he has to try to kill 3 young children. I didn't really care for this plot line. Third, there are quite a few actions scense but there are also large portions of the movie that are fairly slow moving.

But I can't help but wonder though whether the more fragile in the world who watch this sort of stuff don't get bent by it.Maybe it's just bad timing on my part but I saw little to like about Looper.

Not just disappointing. I mean ... why did this get to production stupid? How many Hollywood big-shots does it take to be really really stupid stupid. It's not a \\"smart but confusing\\" sci-fi film as the promoters describe it. It's confusing because it's wrong ... illogically wrong. The ending does not actually make any logical sense at all.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt deserves an Oscar for his performance, and Emily Blunt is nearly as good.

This movie is quite the opposite - there aren't any effects to speak of, but the acting is fantastic and the story is very engaging.

There were a couple spots were I got lost, but I didn't become frustrated, which is typical (at least for me) with time traveI movies, et al. Hilariously enough, one of the characters states pretty clearly that the movie isn't going to be a lesson in time travel.Pretty good action scenes, a little sex (G-rated, which balances out the R-rated violence), good dialogue, and a good plot. The makeup artists did a bang-up job making Joseph Gordon-Leavitt look like a young Bruce Willis, and Gordon-Leavitt does a good job of apeing Willis' known mannerism (at least for the beginning of the movie).Would recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"Garbage.

This was nothing as clean as the commercials for the movie. Bruce Willis and others were frequently taking the Lord's name in vain. There were murders with plenty of blood done by different people - even by a young child - without any sense of remorse or loss.The only really good parts were1) changes in the memory of the older version of the character (played by Willis) getting stronger and weaker as the younger version of the character did normal actions or actions he did not do the first time.2) how the movie ended.

The script invites you to stop thinking about it and get on with the plot. Which itself is pretty thin: Gordon-Levitt's character Joe, without knowing it, is assigned to kill his future self (Willis as Old Joe). Willis thinks this is a bad idea. He's already gotten rid of the team sending him back to be killed, and isn't about to put up with any fuss from a puppy half his age - not even himself.From there, the chase is on. Joe is in deep poo with the criminal organization for failing to complete the assignment. The criminal organization is in deep poo with Old Joe for messing up his future life. Needless to say, the criminal organization fares badly against a massively peeved Willis.It's an enjoyable action flick with a few surprises, including the final one. A good script and great performances save it from the basic inanity of its premises. Still, it's commodity entertainment and utterly forgettable.-- wiredweird"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as previews","review":"Can't say this movie was all that riveting or even worth 2 hours of your life.

An innovative and complex plot unfolds in a violent and almost surreal landscape. Without repeating the details of the plot, suffice to say you need to play strict attention to absorb the twists and turns.Joseph-Gordon Levitt is barely recognizable with his prosthetics designed to make him into a younger Bruce Willis. Levitt is very good in assimilating Willis' mannerisms and persona. Willis, the senior citizen's resident action hero, acquits himself well, although there's no real surprises with his performance. Emily Blunt displays her versatility once again in a scene-stealing performance. Jeff Daniels, Paul Dano and Garrett Dillahunt round out the talented cast.LOOPER is an innovative and engrossing film, a nice change of pace from zombie and post-apocalyptic disasters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun film","review":"I enjoyed this movie.

Very frustrating experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close this Loop","review":"Yeah this is a mess of a movie. It sets up many rules only to drop them at the earliest convenience. It's hard not to spoil the movie and make my points. I found it the work of an auteur out of control or at least surrounded by \\"Yes\\" men. The script is atrocious and the one hit premise of chasing down your future self could have been cool, but the muddled time travel and crowded suspended of disbelief is stretched too thin, especially when we're dealing with \\"TK\\" sensitive people as well. It looks kinda nice at times, but the logic of the story and world doesn't hold together no matter how \\"cool\\" the movie thinks it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"What!?! No Way!","review":"That's what I kept saying the whole movie. I don't want to spoil it, so, all I can say is that the whole time watching the movie, I just kept wondering what would happen next.

For me it became more predictable and sadly that says it all. It really didnt go in debt with the characters. I like plot stories so if the story is predicable then the characters debt sometimes help really carry the movie balancing it out. It really didnt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"I thought it was a great movie, but was a little thrown off by the approach they took to time travel paradoxes. It diverged from the norm I've seen in other movies and shows. This of course made it interesting, but also a little odd at times (\\"Hey! they can't do that\\"). As a sci-fi lover, I would have liked to see more of the Rainmaker plot line, but that would have distracted from the main theme of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little slow in the beginning, but we enjoyed the movie!","review":"It was an interesting story.

Don't waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspend Your Disbelief","review":"Time travel movies require a certain amount of acceptance on the part of the viewer. Paradoxes abound, and to paraphrase one of the characters in the movie, thinking too much about it will turn your brain into a fried egg. Once you stop worrying about the contradictions of time travel, this is a well-made, enjoyable film that has elements of \\"Terminator\\" , \\"12 Monkeys\\" and \\"the Walking Dead\\" to name a few. The performances, especially Joseph Gordon-Leavitt, are solid. There are some dead spots in the middle, but overall it's very good film."},{"rating":"1","title":"So So Sci-Fi","review":"Story undeveloped, violence senseless, no direction.

Those trying to solve the mysteries on non-linear time through plot details of this movie are way over-thinking it. This is entertainment, not physics, and at that it succeeds. And let's face it - if your a guy - you could watch about any movie with Emily Blunt with the sound off and it would still be pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting letdown","review":"This film had some unique and original ideas, however, it felt like the writers were trying so hard make the ending an unexpected twist that they forgot to make sure it made sense. Much of the action happened so fast that there wasn't enough time to make the plot fit to the action. The first half of the film was interesting and neat the second half felt like the plot was abandoned to make room for action sequences and child murder.*Spoiler Alert*The end of the movie happens abruptly, and, stupidly. JGL kills himself to make sure his loop cannot kill the boy and complete the cycle. There is really no reason why he couldn't have waited and explained to Willis why he cannot kill the boy. The way the timeline works, if JGL killed himself at any point after Willis attempted to kill the child Willis' actions would have ceased to exist and the child would never have died."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looper pooper.","review":"Started out like it might just be the excellent new sci fi film i read reviews for here. Less than an hour in,I realized it was getting real boring,real fast. What happened? Don't know. Don't care. This movie was all over the place,too much going on . Then,not enough.

No sir,it's a pooper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot holes have turned me into a hater.","review":"I liked this movie right after seeing it. But the more I thought about all the plot holes, the the less i began to respect the writing in this movie. Now that I have had some time to think about it, I can say I hate this movie, and never want to see it again. I wont get into the confusing arguments about \\"this happened because, the younger self did yada yada yada\\", but I will say that after the last act of the film... NONE of the events prior should have happened -- but it did happen even though \\"Character XYZ\\" NEVER EXISTED. People still remember \\"Character XYZ\\" even though he/she NEVER EXISTED. This movie makes up its own rules to avoid paradoxes. These rules violate basic causality. This movie had some nice effects, and JGL's performance was really cool, but the lack of logic behind the basic premise if the movie is maddening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Hard to Follow...","review":"Great effort, lacked real possibility... Too complicated to watch and understand. Found this story line hard to follow on every level."},{"rating":"1","title":"As many others stated before.....","review":"The acting and action are good, but the writing of this story is horrendous. The author clearly didn't research time travel very well, and the telekinesis bit came out of nowhere. I don't need everything spelled out for me, but some explanation would be nice. Sorry, but it takes more than action and good acting to keep me interested in a movie.

I found the movie to be much better than the reviews suggested. Some elements of the story don't really make sense... Why does organized crime have control over time travel for example? Who knows. If you can get past those elements, it's a solidly acted and thoroughly entertaining movie.I feel the ending makes up for any mediocrity in the middle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Predictable ending, but nice","review":"We hadn't heard of this movie before, but with Bruce Willis and a semi sci-fi twist, we thought it might be interesting. It was interesting and entertaining, if a bit disutopian. There were also several open paradoxes left around, but that's ok, It's a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Fantasic story with great characters and a very emotional ending.

One of the best sci-fi movies of the decade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"Anytime you set up an assassin as your protagonist, you'll have to work a little harder to engage the audience.

The only redeeming act, of course, is that the looper commits to ending the loop, producing a possibly favorable outcome in the future; IF, that is, the kid grows up under the loving care of his mom and does not become the evil actor hinted at. The premise is clever, but one-note overall. Not living up to its potential development. But then I am a fan of more \\"mainstream\\" sci-fi: Serenity, Star Wars (original), and that ilk. Geez, I wish they'd make movies of Time Enough for Love and Foundation and THAT ilk.

Reason when I sit and watch a movie I just want to be entertained I do not want to try and figure out who is who, what is what. If your going to do a time travel film you better do it right this was far from being done right. (Example Back to the Future Excellent series) The action at times was going so fast dont know what the heck is going on, a choppy movie, a poor sound mix! If you set your sound so you can hear them speak and a explosion goes off you it is way to loud I was having to constant adjust volume for dialoge and then diff volume for action.

Its not a new story by any stretch of the imagination. However it is a good one. I won't go into too much detail because movies like this are best seen without too much knowledge of the plot. However I will say the story is engrossing somewhat, and while not too deep on an intellectual level it is fun from a \\"fun\\" level. Its well acted, Willis is on his game, Jeff Daniels is believable as the ruthless mob boss, and the cinematography is at times beautiful. A lot of rip off from blade runner at times, as most of these movies do, but all in all its one I plan on watching again, probably more than a few times. And that's probably the best thing I can say about any movie. If its worth rewatching, its worth seeing. Sci Fi fans will love it. So will fans of the movie \\"TimeCop\\".Watch out for the violence though. There is more than there needs to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool science fiction type movie","review":"Great acting.

Powerful ending. there some parts where they could've added more detail but I guess they left that for your imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, but it falls apart pretty quickly...","review":"Watch the trailer if you need a synopsis, I'll get to the point. It was a pleasure to see Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt play the same guy. They both brought enough of themselves to the role while also adopting mannerisms unique to each other. This was nice, and at first the movie looked to be promising, but then it just got confusing and never recovered. The action was fast, gritty, and intense, the dialogue was clever and exactly what you expect from a Bruce Willis film, but none of it made any sense half-way through the film. It's a shame. There are much better sci-fi action flicks out there. Don't waste your money on this one unless you just feel compelled to watch a perfectly brilliant conceit go completely to waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Poorly conceived, badly executed -- a real waste of time despite the slick trailers.

I think people are underrating this movie. Worth taking a gander at this one, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make Time for This One!","review":"For those of us that are intrigued with the concept of time travel, we rarely contemplate what we would do with that ability. Loopers forces us to reconsider the implications of such possibility. Although the movie lacks all the glitz of previous science fiction classics like \\"Total Recall\\" or the zanny humor of \\"Back into the Future\\", it does have a deeper plot that few would have guessed until the very end. The dark setting of the criminal under world and the senseless killing makes one believe it is just another blood bath with a time travel twist. I found it to be a much more human story. It begs the question of how we confront ourselves in a world full of temptations. Some take the easy way out. Yet somehow a small boy teaches us in the end, what is most important in life! Very good movie. I only give it four stars because it was only intriguing and compelling, but not completely entertaining. Still I would recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"liked it alot... only fear was that my 2 year old would start to develop telekinesis... I am going to have to invest in a safe."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunning, and hard-hitting movie!","review":"To break it down to you, this movie is (Total Recall 2012) meets (In Time 2012) -Justin Timberlake, all in one. This combination of similar ideas makes for a very interesting movie. A-list actor Bruce Willis gave a very good performance which helps to anchor the movie. This movie was very well made and surprisingly good. The storyline is a new concept, which is produced very well and with a very nice ending. The romance and bedroom scenes are well done; they leave you with just enough to use your imagination without offending anyone. That’s the mark of seasoned producer, and I really appreciate that. The cinematography is stunning. Acting, wardrobe, and props are very good. The CGI effects are to A-list standards, very good. There are no dry or dull areas in this movie, it keeps you on edge and holds your interest all the way through. This is quality entertainment. I recommend purchase on Blue Ray. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like \\"Pooper\\"","review":"Bruce Willis couldn't even save this craptastic movie.

Where has it been hiding? The story was great. I like time travel stories. The acting was over the top.One minor complaint, I knew the ending about 30 seconds before the end came because the background narration gave it away. Let the viewer watch the movie and figure out why it ended like it did. We are not dumb. But most other movies explain things we don't need to know. (Resident Evil Retribution is one of the worst movies I've seen because the narrator spend half a day explaining what the movie was about. Besides the fact that R.E.R. was ridiculous.) One other small complaint, this movie at times had the actors speaking so low that I could not understand them. I hate that. But it still gets five stars from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie!","review":"The actor who played the young Bruce Willis nailed his part, and I always love Bruce Willis!

From about 5 minutes in until the very last scene this movie is loaded with irreconcilable paradoxes that the writers/director selectively do or don't recognize based on how it moves the characters closer to the predetermined \\"cool\\" or \\"freaky\\" outcome that they had in mind.

Directors and screen writers are so lazy that instead of attempting to write an original story that will bring true intrigue, they continually push the envelope of movie making to darker places, as in this movie where A CHILD IS SHOT or at least implied to be killed.

There is absolutely no darkness, evil or negativity on the other side. If you hear dark or negative voices, telling you to do things which are wrong, these are definitely not from your spirit guide or guardian angel. These voices originate from within your own mind and nowhere else. Spirit contact always comes through only in goodness, love, understanding and healing.If these voices persist, one should seek the aid of a qualified medium or a competent psychotherapist.Hopefully this book is the result of a major misunderstanding or miscommunication on the author's part, and not yet another display of spiritual bigotry, intolerance, narrow-mindedness and misinformation which is so characteristic of FBOR's (Fear-based organized religion), particularly christian fundamentalism."},{"rating":"2","title":"awakening","review":"This book also mirrors the likeness of Schizophrenia.

But on this collection you'll get their 3 albums in chronological order plus some remixes of their well known hit-single. Also on this one is the 1982 single Don't Look Back and it's b-side Xenophobia. It's very cheap for the music that you get on 2 CD's. All digitally remastered.

I particularly like this model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice-looking smooth-slipping and portable","review":"This CD wallet is easy to use inside of a moving vehicle because it is thin, zips and unzips easily, and the CD's slide in nicely from the top. The back material is not plastic, but some kind of soft woven material that will not scratch your CD's. I compared this at a store with some of the cheaper Cdprojects one that had some kind of plastic bumpy material on the back of the sleeves. All in all, I'm highly satisfied with my purchase and ordered it from Amazon because it had a better price than the store. The only thing missing is any inside pockets, but for that, you can buy the larger 64 capacity one. For me, this one holds enough and is small enough to fit into a map pocket in my car when not in use.

In fact it doesnt say much at all; just endless amounts of prose that add up to nothing. Rather than doing any reserach on his own, Kenner just takes his historical information from already published books on animation or from interviews he has done with Jones.The problems with interviewing Jones, however, is that he can be pretty self serving at times. So dont expect getting any real insight into Mike Maltese and Maurice Noble's contributions to his films, and certainly not any comparision to the work of Bob Clampett, who Chuck Jones hates with his guts. (They had a lifelong feud) For real insight into the work of Chuck Jones, try the articles written by Richard Thompson in Film Comment in the seventies, or Michael Barrier's book Hollywood Cartoons"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous!","review":"These are great String covers, they chose the songs well.

My hardwood floors looks so much cleaner after using this (on a very lightly dampened microfiber mop) instead of Bona hardwood floor cleaners, and it is so much cheaper too. I use this in my bathrooms too, including the travertine floors. I did not have soap scum build up to start, so I don't know how well it would work for a very dirty bathroom, but it is great for weekly maintainance cleaning.

It's worth it.The cd contains many raster scans of tables from the book and links to commentary that you can find elsewhere in greater detail. The links to industry aren't anything special, considering you can find them many other places for free. The interface is clunky, and hard to read. Access to the data is read-only off the CD rather than allowing you to load it and access it from the hard drive. The vector CAD drawings are simplified and generic - suitable for instruction, but certainly not for real work. You won't save any time trying to use them for anything but reference, so why bother?

They only guaranteed the product for 30 days and of course, it suddenly stopped working after 6 weeks. I paid $60.00 US dollars for the product and they are not refunding my money. Purchasing this product is a big waste of time and money and is a rip off. Naturally Good Enterprises does not stand behind its producta and what they sold me is subpar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Worship CD!!!","review":"This CD is awesome for worship, for quiet time, for prayer time, for anytime. I love this CD simply because it is so soothing that I feel Gods presence just listening to it. Highly Annointed Music for all ages.

Great gift or even for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best CD Ever","review":"I bought this CD as a gift. I also gifted two more earlier in the year. I have owned one for about three years and it is so great to Praise and Worship with, I cannot express enough appreciation to Terry for making it.

But I never could get the microphone to work. It came with some dorky battery-power for it; maybe I already destroyed it when my mixer gave it 48v phantom power.

This is not the product it appears to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price!","review":"I bought this for doing high school sports on the radio. It was everything that I hoped it would be.

You have an option either to leave the cover open or break the box when closing it.I'm disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yamaha CM500","review":"Headset for $40-$50 with noise cancelling and a mic. It's a good deal, and it's comfortable. The only problem is the bass. It's horribly out of control. If I change the equalizer on my computer, then the headset either sounds worse, or very dull. After 10 minutes my ear drums hurt from the spew of garbage it produces. I would only recommend this headset for casual music. The mic has a bit of a buzz, but it's still good. 2/5"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for listening, bad for phone calls","review":"I work from home and am on a ton of phone calls. Most headsets are small and wireless, which is great but they sacrifice sound quality and comfort (think 90 minute calls) for convenience. I thought these would give me great sound and comfort at the price of being bulky and corded, which is fine for me.The reality is they will work with my droid ... kind of. Sound is great most the time, but occasionally it's super faint. Most of the time the mic works almost too well as I had a co-worker point out I should mute while making tea because it was audible - something my two bluetooth headsets never picked up. But sometimes the mic just doesn't work, or I'm so faint no one can understand me. Also the sound only plays in my left ear. I suspect the converter is mono and there may be a workaround for this but I haven't investigated yet.Overall the headset works fine about 90% of the time, but that's just not good enough so back they go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this!

I decided to splurge and get a name brand- one of the more expensive ones available. The first time I used it, I plugged it into my bathroom electrical outlet- and it worked, but then blew the fuse in the bathroom. (I live in a new house, not an old one so I don't know why this happened.) I thought it must be a fluke. I moved to another bathroom- plugged it in. Same thing. I moved to the kitchen, same thing. THREE plugs.Aside from that weirdness, the water pik leaks everywhere. Water just sprays everywhere. Use this if you want to make a mess all over your bathroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT PRODUCT AND GREAT PRICE","review":"Our dentist recommended the Waterpik for even better dental haelthcare and it really does a wondrful job.

But it works as advertized.I always floss first, so I don't see how much cleaning can be accomplished, but this kind of product is best used for cleaning under the gums and messaging them. Often an overlooked chore.My only criticism is that the water reservior is too small. At the highest setting, a full tank will be depleted in maybe a couple of minutes approx. You need to be near a sink to refill it.I recommend that waterpic provide information on length of time a full tank will deplete, and also whether or not adding some hydrogen peroxide and salt to the water would damage the pumping mechanism."},{"rating":"2","title":"All positive except..","review":"The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser works great. I was very satisfied with the first one purchased through Amazon about three years ago. The tube going from the tank to the handle eventually developed a crack and leak. This tube is somewhat ridged to facilitate the coil for storage. However, the constant motion and this lack of flexibility caused the leak. Still a very good product for the price. I recently bought the same product as a replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicer than earlier models","review":"I have used waterpiks for many years and this model is much nicer than the earlier ones. It is smaller in size than my last one, which is nice if you keep it out on the bathroom counter. The reservoir is also smaller but is still sufficient for a single use. It is much quieter than my last one and I like the water pressure dial. The only problem that I had with it is that if you are not careful using the rotator on the pik, the pik will pop off while you are using it. On the other hand, my previous model required removing the pik after each use if you wanted to close the unit. The older piks were difficult to remove."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job for a very good price!","review":"I have a lot of dental work, and I've used a lot of \\"water jets\\" in my life. They generally last only a year or two. So far, this one is the best yet. It's heavy, so it doesn't \\"walk\\" when being used. It has a lot of water power (keep it low!). The water reservoir holds more than enough for several trips inside the mouth. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"I have an extreme case of Periodontics and my dentist recommended the water flosser to help with my daily routines. I love how my teeth and gum feels after using it, I sometimes use my medication in the water and be sure it will be delivered to every part of my gums.the only reason I gave it 4 star, is because it is a bit messy. if you are not careful the water will spray all over.

The new one looks nice and fits on the sink better than the older model (very small pedestal sink). It is also quieter (though the older one might have gotten noisier over the years). The different types of picks that come with it seem a bit too specialized, though. I would gladly turn in the tongue scraper (the only one that seems useless) for another standard pick. I am very glad I purchased another Water-Pik .... this product rocks! I would give this produce 4.5 stars if possible, subtracting 0.5 star because I think it should come with 2 standard picks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as stated","review":"This works really well, but after I told my doctor that i was using this instead of flossing he advised me against it.

Recently I purchased this new model that comes with various tips. The tip equipped with a tiny brush is a genius idea and does wonder to clean between teeth. I do not floss any longer except may be once a month. Even my dental hygienist complimented me and said that I had very little plaque. It is a $50 very well invested."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Once Reliable Toothbrush - Now Unreliable","review":"I have been using the Oral-B Pulsars for a while now - probably since the product launched - but for some reason, the past three Pulsars I've bought died on me within a couple of weeks of owning it.

Sits nicely on my bathroom vanity. It's AC powered, so I also get a good stong water stream. Comes with several cool attachments, though I find that I never use them. Water tank is big enough so that I can gat my whole mouth done with one tank. (Portable one I used to have had to be filled up several times)Only downside is that I can't take it into the shower like I could witht he portable device.

She recommended it because of all the features and we've been very happy with it. My daughter enjoys using the special braces attachment to quickly clean the food out of her braces before brushing her teeth.

I never forget to spray with waterpik every morning and night. It was an awkward feeling when I used it for the first time, but after several months, I got addicted . A great device and plus it's practical. I still confuse why some people complaint on how fragile this device is; from leaking bowl until broken tip. To be honest, I use it regularly and clean it every time after I'm done, and so far everything works just fine. Quick tips, don't leave the water on the container. Keep it empty and most important don't over use it. Just remember that not only do your teeth need cleaning, but your Waterpik also. Be gentle and don't crush the tip with your teeth.

I was told that they would send me a new part that I could install. I considered that, but I didn't want to wait the five to seven business days they said it would take. I wanted and needed one now.

I bought another Water Pic (no model number but looks just like the Ultra) and it didn't work at all and I returned it the next day. I wanted one so bad, I tried this model a third time from Walgreens but still had to return it as the water would not flow.

The Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser is so simple to set and ready to use. Using it for the first time will quite make a water mess but it takes practice! I was pretty impressed on how much small food debris it got out of my mouth and all around my gums after brushing my teeth. It really proves that brushing my teeth wasn't enough! It's no wonder that I have had periodontal disease for a pretty long time. I can't get enough of this amazement. My periodontist recommended me to get this after I had my treatment. The scraping treatment wasn't fun. To make my future dentist appointments much easier, I got this. My goal is to make a significant improvement in my gums and teeth.

Then I read the reviews and saw some that mention it leaked and didn't perform well. I almost decided not to buy it but I am glad I did. I have had it for over a month and absolutely love the operation and handling of this new waterpik. It works like a champion and is much easier to use than the Classic was.

This pictured version exceeded My expectations. Compact, Easy to use, Easy to clean. No muss no fuss! On the other hand, the hand held version isn't worth the money at all! Unfortunately they are packaged together at places like Costco and Sam's... Probably to find some lucrative way to get rid of the hand held model! Buy the cabinet model and rejoice! Leave the hand held model on the shelf! Overall, this review is cut and dried and doesn't require a lot of verbiage! Cabinet model: Exceptional!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for gum disease","review":"I just had to write on this item. My dentist didn't say much when amazed on how my gums had changed for better after being his patient for 10 years with gum disease. He saked what I had done, and I said I used this particular brand of waterpik. I just knew before going for the quarterly treatment that all gum pockets are gone and he confirmed in amazement. Pay $50 to buy this and you will save thousands from surgery. It's the most amazing thing I've seen. And, from what I've heard this model is the best. I started with number 5 and am on 8 now which is more than enough for me. Use it at night before going to bed or in the morning or both. It's so refreshing. You can add mouthwash or salt to the water. Just make sure to rinse and dry it after you're done. It's worth the effort. I think no words can explain how I feel about this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"The waterpik works great. The real test will abe my next hygienest's reports.

Noisy, messy and obnoxious. We broke one of the tips right away. Went to the water pik website to order replacement parts. That was a real maddening experience. They charged me $12 for a cheap, tiny plastic part and ended up sending the wrong part. Then they want me to pay to send it back, even though they agree it was their mistake. No phone number listed on their website so good luck getting to speak with anyone and the email takes about 2 days to get a response. The only thing worse than this product was the customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly cheap plastic holder.","review":"In many ways this is an acceptable unit. It holds enough water to give a good cleaning, easy to dial up water stream strength. My big complaint is that the bracket that holds the wand is made from incredibly cheap and brittle plastic. My daughter tipped it forward onto the counter when she was using it and the tip of the right side bracket snapped off. Without the full bracket, the wand will not stay in place. Now it takes up quite a bit of room on the counter since the cord will not stay nicely coiled and the unit is much less attractive. Annoying that something so little can diminish the value and usability of an entire product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Health Hazard","review":"I purchased \\"Waterpik Ultra Dental Jet 100WP\\" in Sept.

I was concerned that was a definite HEALTH HAZARD, I emailed the company with my concerns they didn't respond so I called the company spoke to a Secretary she said will pass it along to her superior \\"if he is concerned he will contact me\\" He NEVER returned my call I would NOT/do-NOT recommend this product & to add to that it leaks.

They always sounded so messy to me but I decided to give it a try. I loved it so much that my husband started to use it too since it came with extra pieces and now he is hooked also. I was amazed at what you could still get out of your teeth and under the gums after using an electric toothbrush for two minutes and then the waterpik. After I am done, my mouth feels so clean. It has a pause button on it which I like because I think it makes it easier to have control of the water. It also has multiple settings which is great. The tips fit inside the lid when not in use and I have found it easy to use and keep clean. Wish I had started using one years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"Bought it a couple weeks ago at Walmart for $60. This is my first try at water jet picks. It's not that loud. I rinse with Listerine after, to get a nice clean feeling. The tank is big enough for one cleaning. The power is more than enough for me; I have it set to a little more than half the power. If I set it too high, it actually hurts. Overall, I'm satisfied with no complaints. I've only tried the normal attachment and that's all I really need. Hopefully it'll last long. There is a 2 year warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damage control","review":"I didn't have problems with the noise, amount of water or anything like that. My issue was that it destroyed my gums. The only times this cleaned my teeth where my toothbrush couldn't, was after eating popcorn. Other than that, it did not help and it destroyed my gums. I kept it on the lowest settings and have very healthy gums otherwise, but they became torn up after using the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser. I have family members that have used them in the past when they had braces, but other than maybe in that instance, I wouldn't recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teeth Feel Really Clean","review":"Although I use \\"Go Betweens\\" as floss, I always finish up my teethbrushing routine with the Water Flosser.

Maybe So, but It's Still So Worth It","review":"I've been using a waterpik for many years now including the time I had braces. I think this machine is indispensible for cleaning your teeth. At my last regular cleaning a couple of months ago, the oral hygenist gave me raving reviews. He told me \\"I knew you had to be using something because there's no way your teeth could be this clean.\\"No cavities. No tartar.So I hear that the quality has gone down or is not that great. I purchased this new model about 9 months ago and it's still working as good as new. I discarded my old one after the plastic water hose got brittle and broke into pieces. I just decided to discard it and buy this new one which is quieter and has more features. In any case, the way I feel, if these units only lasted for one year, even six months, it would still be worth buying. We only have one set of permanent teeth (well, most of us do)!If you've never used one, try it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, but use with caution","review":"Works as advertised. Amazing how much \\"stuff\\" this gets out, even after a thorough brushing. One word of caution: this flosser can blow or force plaque or debris up under the gums, resulting in infected gums which require a dentist's attention. Happened to both my wife and I. I am still using it, but am very careful when I do. It is NOT easy to use this in such a way as to prevent forcing plaque up under your gums. All in all, I gave this 4 stars because it does work great, but I would probably NOT recommend it because it is so susceptible to causing gum problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Known Product Defect","review":"I received my second Water Flosser today. I had returned the first one as it had tripped the GFCI in all of our bathrooms. The second one did exactly the same thing.

It would have made it so much nicer to clean in between the brackets everyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"I have used an old little Philips water jet for many years and I really liked it. Having moved to a new place, I tried to find something similar for the bathroom and was disappointed to see lack of competition on the market in this area. After reading the reviews I decided to get this model and I am very happy with it. I picked mine at Walgreen's for 55 on sale.PROS:Good looking, not too large, relatively quiet, right size water tank, good range of water pressure control, ergonomically designed, tips are super-easy to connect and to remove, attachments and tube are nicely stowed away.CONS:Too pricey, but that's what lack of competition does, the tube could be a little longer in my opinion.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Just a great product.

It's also much gentler on my gums than regular flossing.I just went to the dentist for the first time since getting this product, and was complemented on how well I took care of my teeth. It is the first time ever I didn't get a lecture about flossing. That was proof enough for me that this actually works.

And I've been using it twice a day ever since. I love it! My teeth feel so much cleaner than before! I really see and feel the difference.

I have been using my previous model for about 6 years and loved it until the tubing broke last week. I ordered this one even though there were lots of complaints, because I saw no other choice. I LOVE the new model. It's a hair more powerful on the highest setting than my previous model. Fits plenty of water in the basin for a full cleaning. So for performance it is great! On top of that, it is more compact so it doesn't take up so much cabinet space, neatly stores the heads inside the top, and even has a pause button (this is my favorite feature!). I'm very pleased! Good job waterpik for taking a good product and making it better. I'm so glad I spent the extra $10 for the new model! After all, I expect this one to last me for another 6 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"The Waterpik Ultra product is pretty much as the description says. It is more compact than previous Waterpik models that I've had and takes up less counterspace. There is storage space for 4 tips, but the machine comes with 5, so I've had to just leave the 5th one loose in the storage compartment. As a long time user of these devices, I am used to having it produce a lot of pressure in the water stream, and this model seems to produce a bit less pressure than some of the larger, previous models.

The only sink is in the kitchen. Now, if I was in a normal house I don't think it would be an issue, but there is only one plug that is somewhat near a water source. In the bathroom, near the tub. Event though the room is small, it doesn't reach far enough for me to be comfortable using it...so I do not use it as often as I'd like because it gets water all over the bathroom.When I use it though, it's great. It gets things out of my gums that brushing didn't do, nor do I think flossing would find. Maybe someday when I move to a new place, I will use it more diligently. I guess I'd better shop for a good extension cord in the meantime. Until then, I reserve it for when I eat something that I know will get stuck in my teeth.Since most people have normal bathrooms, I'd highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"very bad!!!doesn t work and didn't answer my mails!!!!

I had heard that a waterpik was more effective than flossing and an electric tooth brush was more effective than a non-electrical one. I switched to both. It really makes a difference.This product has a bit of learning curve to it, but once you get the hang of it it's pretty easy to use. It comes with 6 different heads so there are lots of ways to make it work for you (braces, crowns, getting below the gum line, etc). It's not as big as I thought it would be so it's not taking up your whole counter. It's quiet. I've got nothing to complain about at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY GOOD FLOSSER","review":"I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.

After less than a year, the tube that connects the base to the handle developed a hole. If I could open the handle, i could cut the hose and reattach with the hose slightly shortened.

I should have contacted this company to see if they would have done something about it. It finally died last week (exactly like a year, so I suppose I am out of the standard warranty).

Within days many of my teeth became perceptibly loose, and my periodontal disease is minimal, with healthy gums. I've come to realize that my improper use of repeatedly shooting significant pressure down the gum pocket must have separated the gingival connective tissue and even irritated the periodontal ligament that holds the teeth to bone.

While using the actual waterpik spray device the force of the water, and I only had it set on THREE caused a chunk of my gum to come out. I bled everywhere and was spitting out tissue. I have very healthy teeth and gums and the force from only being on a low number was shocking. I couldnt feel it on one or two, and a three was so forceful it caused damage.

It works just as well as traditional flossing, but doesn't cause me any pain. It is, however, incredibly loud. I will also note that \\"pausing\\" the flow of water is kind of a pain. They should have reversed the function so that you push the button to release water flow, instead of holding the button to pause water flow. My finger has, on occasion, slipped from the button, spraying myself and my bathroom with water.

When set on \\"10\\" the water stream is very effective. It's surprising how much remains between the teeth after a thorough brushing: flossing makes a big difference and except for really hard-to-dislodge particles that may be stubbornly wedged between the teeth, this Waterpik does a very good job. The real test, of course, will be how well this product is still working 2-3 years from now."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love clean gums","review":"I have been using an electric toothbrush for a while (Braun) and I love the clean tooth feeling. I tried a waterpik recently and was amazed (and disgusted) what came out from between my teeth after brushing. I've always been too lazy to floss, so this is great. I can absolutely tell that it is making a difference. If you are like me and too lazy to floss, get a waterpikI wish it came with multiple regular heads instead of the mostly useless variety pack of heads.The pressure dial goes from very soft to holy %^&* hard. I would warn people to be careful putting the dial past the halfway mark. You can do some damage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"I like this one.

Every time I brush my teeth, they easily just bleed. And since my dentist told me to keep using those with softer bristles in order to prevent them from bleeding, he has also advised me to use gentle teeth cleansers as well. it was a good thing that I found out about the Waterpik. They can be tough on dirt, but then they are completely gentle on my gums. Also, it cleanses 93 percent more than brushing and using dental floss. It really is effective, it is worth all the money I spent on buying it. All those who have teeth and gum problems should definitely use this product. It is very easy to use, you won't even have certain problems in cleaning up your teeth even if you're wearing braces because the kit is complete."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waterpik Ultra","review":"Very nicely package with lots of attachments.

Particularly from the hard to reach places between the rear molars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three months have passed & it is still working","review":"Doesn't take up much counter space, easy to fill, easy to maneuver, powerful pulse - so powerful that I do not have to turn it up any more than about half way. Not only does it wash away food particles, I can direct the water pulse into my gum pockets, thereby washing out harmful bacteria that lurk and infect. I use it at least once per day depending on what I eat. The residue from some foods is so irritating that I remove it sooner than others. They say flossing is better but I am not convinced that it is. Flossing hurts, the floss hangs on my fillings and crowns then shreds. I dread flossing so I do not do it as recommended. I would say that daily [plus] use of this device translates into much healthier hygiene than dreaded sporadic flossing. This water pik is what I need and I am glad I bought it. Five stars if it lasts 3 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slight pain at first, but great a week later","review":"At first, this product took some getting used to (the jets are no joke), but after a week I was used to it and I actually looked forward to using it.

The pressure control dial is accurate, and the reservoir tank is the perfect size. You have an ample amount of water to do a thorough job for your entire mouth. I use this in addition to flossing. Adding a mouthwash to the water is a good idea. I have owned mine now for a few years, and it still works just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Should Have One","review":"Of course, I've seen the ads for Waterpik for years but had never tried one.

I use the dental pic twice a day and I am amazed what it can dislodge. At it most powerful setting it can damage your gums so be careful. I mix a little lystering in with the water also.

Great unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best $50 I ever spent in my life","review":"It takes a bit of practice for me to get the whole coordination-thing down with handling the water and all the attachments, but I never thought a mouth could get that clean. I started out on the lower numbers just to get the hang of it and worked my way up. On 5 I used it to brush my teeth only and they were gleeming! On 10 I used it to brush my tongue and I had no idea a tongue could feel so clean!! Toothpaste seems like overkill. An absolute must-buy for anyone who doesn't floss and brush regularly. Bonus: it makes brushing gums and teeth fun!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a blessing.","review":"Got this yesterday and what a blessing to me. I have braces and it makes cleaning so easy and wonderful. My teeth feel so clean. I just can't say enough about it. It is a little messy but I think as I use it I'll learn the best way to do it. I am really enjoying it so far. This is a great gadget for anyone with braces (I'm old so they are more difficult for me) but hubby uses it and it works great on his bridge also. We love it!

I would award this zero stars if I could. The device jams up nearly every night. Essentially, no water comes out, and no amount of toying, coaxing, or wiggling will get it to work. Many nights, after 10 minutes of trying, I just give up on seeking healthy gums. I could get better results with an ice pick."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than dental floss","review":"Our dental hygienist's recommendation narrowed the search to this brand. It was difficult selecting a model, though, because there were so many to choose from on amazon and on Waterpik's site.The flosser works well, but even if the intensity is only on the #4 setting, the water reservoir empties out too fast. Using a higher intensity setting requires adding more water once or twice. A larger tank would be helpful. When we're finished flossing we turn the reservoir upside down to dry out but there's nothing to cover the base unit. The tank cover would be a reasonable thing to put over the unit, but it's not shaped to fit. The base, the upside-down tank, and the cover take up a lot of counter space.We found nothing in the instructions about how to clean anything before first use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works just like the dentist had prescribed","review":"It works. As part of preventative maintenance on good oral hygiene, I use an electric brush, floss, waterpik and mouth rinse. All compliment one another. The accessories our nice but I only use one. Easy to assemble and operate. I do like the dial for controlling water pressure. A couple of improvements I would have is a more secure lid for the water compartment and a button that can actually stay in the off position until you press it again. If you are to let your finger off the button on the current design, water is free to flow. This works out well if the pik is in your mouth and under control. If not, you can get water everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"I bought this item to replace my broken flosser. It works just fine...better than the other company's product.

The other is still working but not very well. You have to turn it on and off several times to get the water to flow. It works for my husband but I have to then bang it on the counter to get it to work. We empty it every use but it still grows mildew under the top cover and under the well.

This all lead to some costly dental repair. I purchased the Waterpic hoping that it would help in getting the job done. It has done all of that. In a few short weeks I have see a marked improvement with the color of my gums and the cleaning of a recently installed bridge. The pump has more than enough pressure and with the addition of some mouth wash to the water, it feels like your mouth has just went through the car wash. They offer several attachments to the pick unit. I have only really used one of them to any extent. One word of caution ... keep the pic pointed down in the sink when you start the unit unless you need your walls washed. I highly recommend this unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does The Job","review":"The product does just what it is supposed to do. The reservoir is just the right size.

The first ones were great then in the intervening years, the design was not very good. Now this new design is very nice and well thought out. It has a button to cut off the flow; great. It's pressure is set on the unit not the handle; great. It comes with 5 different points; great. It has a lid to cover the reservoir; great. However, the reservoir is smaller than I would like but it is adequate. One will just have to fill it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"Item works great. Cleaned out between the teeth as claimed. Add mouthwash and it gives your mouth a nice clean feeling.Only cons? A little noisier than I expected.

I contacted the manufacturer and after a couple of weeks they sent me a replacement handle. That worked well up until now (a year later). The handle broke again on the inside where it fits the attachment and can no longer hold it - a small spring came off along with a small plastic part that broke. Anyway, this model is a good concept but must be made of cheap materials so don't expect yours to last too long, look for better options."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Problem","review":"Within only a few days of my waterpik purchase, the pump motor failed. The return went smoothly, and a replacement device was sent.

I hesitate to purchase another."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a terrible product.","review":"We made the mistake of buying 2. Both leaked at about 3 months.

Then (after I had tossed away the packaging and other paperwork) it just up and died on me mid-floss. It's 46$ - so it's not worth calling customer support or amazon. I'll just have to chalk this one up to poor quality control and bad luck on my part I suppose.Update - I did not want to give up on this, so I bought another. This time I kept the packaging safely. And of course - it has been working like a champ for the last 3 months. While having one die within the first week is rather irksome - I'm going to upgrade the rating to a 4 star because it's just so handy and effective at getting those annoying little bits out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable, dead within 2 months light use","review":"I just use it no more than two minutes every day and usually at scale 5-8.

But it broke after less than three months of usage. The water leaks from the button on the handle, so the water pressure becomes way too low to clean the teeth.

Although the pros say not, I find them to be more effective than flossing. A combination of both is probably the best preventive program. My only wish is that Waterpik would allow slightly higher pressure on the pulsating water. It seemed to me that the original versions had a little more \\"oomph\\" than the newer models. Aside from that, they do a great job. A word of caution...they are not wired for use on 220v power (found in many European countries), and do not work well with a converter.

The coiled tube reseats itself very nicely after use, and so far we have had no problems with it at all. It features a nice assortment of tips, though our hygienist has directed us to use pocket tips. I have recently acquired a five-tooth bridge and occasionally use the bridge tip instead.

We've never had one before, but this has been wonderful to use. Your teeth get that fresh-from-the-dentist feel to them.

My first one lasted about 20 years. Since then I have gone through at least 6 more. The pumps just don't last on the newer ones. This is the first one that I have used with this shape/style. It produces a weaker stream and is not as effective at dislodging debris between the teeth as the older style. That is why I gave it only 4 stars.

We've had the same problem with other counter top irrigators and got tired of buying and disposing of them so we switched to a redipik which simply attaches/detatches to and from bathroom faucet easily and takes up no counter space.

The multiple heads included give it great versitility, and allow other family members to use the machine also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waterpik Handle Not Durable","review":"The handle is awkward and the coiled plastic hose does not safely extend far from the unit forcing one to place the unit at the lip of the sink. The on/off button on the handle frequently sticks in the off position. It is easy to inadvertently push the tip release button. The tip locking mechanism breaks easily. I have owned the unit for only 3 months and the tip locking mechanism is already broken. If one purchases this unit I highly recommend you save the receipt for warranty claim as early handle replacement seems to be quite common.

I highly recommend it to all those who care about their health -- gum, teeth and overall general. Ridding oneself of plaque and other disease borne irritants that lodge in gums where regular brushing does not touch them is very important. Get this device. You won't be sorry. I love the just professionally cleaned feeling that it leaves me with, and it cleans so well around my crowns. I use just a splash or two of hydrogen peroxide in the tank of warm water. Simply wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have....!!!!","review":"Great product for all family members..even my 4 and 8 yr old kids loves this...it really cleans teeth much better than just brushing and mouthwash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tubing broke on two separate models","review":"On two separate models I purchased a hole opened on the tubing between the machine and the pik, without my putting any kind of unusual pressure on it.

It has a little stopped button, that will stop the continuous jet of water that comes out, but it still dribbles out even with that button held down. Came with a lot of attachments, I played around with em, but landed right back with the first one, the basic one that gives the fine jet of water to get between gums. I do like the intensity setting on it, so I can turn it down and blast the back of my throat (tonsil stones) Overall, I'd recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Replacement for an older model.","review":"I have been using a waterpik for many dozen years.

Not impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"my gums dont bleed anymore","review":"This was recommened by my dentist because my gums bled every day. He said this was from a plaque buildup. Since I had my teeth cleaned and use this almost daily, they do not bleed anymore. The reservoir holds enough water for multiple uses even when using for 1 minute of cleaning. I use it on 3/10 for cleaning. It gets really powerful if you want that. It does take up a little space on the counter, but Id rather have plenty of water in the reservoir instead of refilling. I would recommend to anyone who wants to clean their teeth thoroughly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"brand new, but does not work at all","review":"I got this as Christmas gift. Just spent an hour trying to figure out how to use the thing. I hear the motor buzzing, but there is absolutely no water flow. Guess it's just a defective unit.

As a satisfied customer, I ordered 3 more for my sons and one for me. What a disappointment.The machine goes from #2 to #9 or 10, I don't remember but it doesnt matter because the only speed that makes sense and that barely would clean your teeth is the highest one, the 9 or 10. My question to the manufacturer. Why bother with numbering the speeds when you know very well that the highest is the only speed that would barely clean the debris between your teeth.Sometime next week I must return two.

The only complaint I have is that they give you 6 attachments with only 4 holders, and then the pik itself holds one. What the hell are you supposed to do with #6?? My number six just ends up being placed all around the counter top to get it out of the way, I guess I could just put one anyway and then never use it, that seems stupid too.

I am 72 years of age and my gums and teeth are still \\"hanging on.\\" I think my regular use of a Waterpik has helped my teeth and gums stay healthy.This new model is quieter than the old one I had. It does a good, steady job of pulsating, getting any small particles out of the teeth.The only negative I have is the top storage lid that covers the water container is not as easy to use as older models that hold the pics in the base. Its functions work great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waterpik Blues","review":"This is my very first waterpik and either I got a lemon or the product is really BAD!!

Got it today and it's a gonner tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had previously owned a Water Pik, but I was extremely disappointed with this model which is one of their better if not their top-of-the-line model. The motor which drives the water pressure to remove the plaque is significantly less powerful than my previous model. Setting the water pressure on 10 (maximum pressure) on this model is comparable to setting it on 5 or 6 on my previous one. I have serious reservations about the new model's ability to effectively remove plaque since the water stream is so weak. My previous model more closely emulated the water stream pressure one would experience at the dentist's office. Also, if you have a pedestal sink such as I, keep in mind that this model is big & bulky and will take up quite a bit of room on top of the sink. In fact, depending on the size of your pedestal sink, you may not even be able to place it on the sink unless there's sufficient flat surface to support it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I love it, I have had absolutely no problem with this product, I even used it with mouth wash instead of water and it worked perfectly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinky water after 3rd use!","review":"This was a waste of money.

I'm glad I didn't buy a long term supply of replacement pick heads, that's for sure.

Directions indicate that beginners should keep it at the lowest point in pressure at first. I did and the water dripped out. Cranking it up a notch did nothing but empty out the water container quickly (maybe 20-25 seconds) although I'd filled it to capacity. There is a steady stream from the pik, the handle and the around the area where the pik attaches. It was a mess. Could be that I got a lemon, nevertheless, it's definitely going back.

Luckily I looked on Amazon and found it for a price I was more comfortable paying for something I had never tried and for which I didn't have recommendations from my friends. I'm glad I purchased it - it cleans my teeth really well, it has good power at the highest levels and more comfortable pressure at the lower levels, it's easy to maintain and doesn't take up too much space, and really enjoy having it. The only detractor would be the attachments ... in my opinion they're not really worth the fuss unless you have orthodontics, perhaps. I find that I only ever use the normal attachment. I tried the tongue-cleaning attachment once and found it not particularly helpful, so I just keep it stored away. I didn't pay any extra for the attachments, though, so I still give this product five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"good choice","review":"I am still using this.

Very good price at Amazon. I'm a first time user and have been wanting to try it for a few years and has been recommended by my Dentist. . I went with the Ultra. I read where some people have trouble with water spraying all over the place, well they just don't know how to use it. With a little practice there is not a problem. I use the Gum fitting, and it works great as far as I'm concerned. The particles of food come flowing out with ease. My only problem is my Bathroom sink, I have no place to set the Waterpik down on a flat area, so I have to hold it on one spot of sink with one hand as I use the other to use the pik. Works for me and have no other choice at this time. Next month is my Dentist appointment and I'm curious to see if they notice a differents. So, you can say I'm VERY happy with my Waterpik Ultra."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact Waterpik","review":"This unit is compact with a handy accessory containing top. The down side is that it holds less water than a full size but has a water flow control on the handle that stops water flow to the pik until needed. This saves water and makes up for the units smaller volume. Comes with a number of accessories some of which I do not use such as tongue cleaning tips. If you use them your ahead of the game if not, there is only so much room in the storage top and not all the tips will fit. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"A better product","review":"This Ultra Dental water jet has better features than the original Water Pik. I was happy with the original until I broke the end pulling it out of the holder. There's no replacement for it. This model comes with 3 ends, has an eject button so you don't have to struggle it out, is quieter, has replacements if needed. And the power dial is on the body and not on the part where your fingers rest so you don't inadvertently change the water strength. There seems to be 1 of 3 reviews of the original where the motor stops working. I hope that isn't the case with this model. I've had it a month, so far, so good. A good water pik."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product! Powerful and very quiet.","review":"This is a great product. I hate flossing, and this helps me compensate. My old Waterpik lasted 10 years.

Well worth the money, especially if it lasts 10 years like my old one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected","review":"I bought this due to a review I read and they were right. Even though the water container is a bit small, I have a plastic container that I use IF I want to refill the water container while irrigating my gums. I love the holder that I can slide the wand into. The plastic cord memory makes it easy to lift out and easy to slide back in for storage. The white lid on top stores the tips and will keep contaminants out of the blue container when not in use. I never take the blue tank off the unit. I just add water with my plastic cup and when finished I just lift the whole unit up and dump any residual water out. It is small and easy to use and looks nice and clean sitting on the counter. JUST DON\\"T TWIST THE WAND/PLASTIC CORD. Be sure to twist the circular head for movement of the tip. The cord does not yield to the stress of being twisted. It is brittle and will split if twisted. That is my only caution. I trust this unit will last me a long time.

I tried the Waterpik based on the reviews and the features. I have been pleasantly surprised by how well it performs and the ease of operation. Several points--the tank holds much more than my Interplak and is sufficient to for the entire irrigation process, the OFF/ON toggle switch works well when there is fluid in the tank, but, when the tank is empty, care must be taken to turn it OFF because the entire Waterpik likes to \\"walk\\" because of the decreased weight when you put pressure on the switch. I found the Waterpik must be fairly close because of the relative short connection between the pik and the tank, however, one learns to work with it.Overall, a good irrigator and one worth the cost. I'm looking to many years of use and would recommend this to any potential buyer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Alternative to Flossing!!!","review":"Purchased this unit after having the hand-held unit.

I like the way the handle for the jet stands and the cord recoils. My only suggestion is that the lid should have a lip around all of it so that it cannot fall into the water container. I have to make a point of hooking the little lip on the back before I release the lid but then it works all right. It is a good dental tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"Overall, I am satisfy with Waterpik Jet.although the tank is small, but I don't see that as a problem. just adding water few times in 1 use, other wise it works great and makes me feel good about my oral hygiene. I like it alot"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thumbs up from my hygienist","review":"I use this flosser every night. My hygienist was very appreciative at my six month cleaning after I started using this flosser. She recommended that I use the flosser after brushing instead of before and I have changed my routine slightly to make this change.The flosser sits on the bathroom countertop in a corner and does not take up too much room. It is easy to fill and use. I had to play around with the attachments until I found one that suited me best. It also takes a little getting used to if you have not used a water flosser before. But once you get used to it, it becomes an easy part of your routine. I am almost thinking of getting the portable one for trips. Highly recommend this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"waterpik ultra","review":"Recomended by my dental hygienist. Works great!

I GIVE IT 10 STARS BECAUSE IT WORKS TWICE AS GOOD AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD & AFTER READING THE REVIEWS OF OTHER CONSUMERS, I FIGURED IT WOULD ALREADY BE A 5 STAR PRODUCT. IN ANY CASE, THE VESSEL CONTAINING THE WATER IS WAY MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR A NICE DEEP CLEANING SENSATION EVERY NIGHT! MY DENTIST TOLD ME TO FLOSS, BUT FLOSSING IS SUCH A HASSLE COMPARED TO THIS UNIT.

I wish it could be turned up a few more pressure setting but overall it works. The tank could stand to be a little larger too but refilling it is not that big of deal.

Initially I had a little difficulty not spraying water everywhere, but after a couple of trys I have it down now. I use it on one of the lower pressure settings and it provides plenty of vibration and cleaning. It's also fairly easy and quick to set up, use and clean. I'd recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent tool for teeth maintenance","review":"I have been using this product for the past month and can say that it's been a worthwhile product for me so far. I use the Waterpik after flossing and brushing. Even though I think I do a good job on my teeth with just the floss and brush, I find I still have particles leftover that Waterpik catches. I'm sure my dental hygienist is going to have alot less work to do on me the next time I see her.I like the product's feature of being able to dial in the strength of the water jet. So far, I've only been able to select a jet of around 2. Even at that rate, the flow is very powerful. So I would imagine that one will be able to grow with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, but could be more efficiently designed","review":"I got this product because my son's orthodontist \\"required\\" it. I had braces when I was young, but my orthodontist didn't require this. I resisted at first, but relented after lots of complaining. The device works very well and gets out all the bits of stuff stuck on the orthodontic appliance. It's quite easy to use with only 2 switches. The attachments seem spot on for getting all the nooks and crannies in the mouth. My only wish is that the device was more aesthetically pleasing. It occupies a lot of space on my bathroom sink and caused me to relocate the soap dispenser and the toothbrush charger. I also think that there should be a warning on the device about proper cleaning and handling. I am concerned that the wet spot in the device are great for growing bacteria if it's not properly cleaned and dried after use. I shudder to think of it's high pressure water jet shooting germs under my son's gums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets the Job Done","review":"This product works very well once you learn how to use it. I admit that the first time I used this, I managed to spray more on my bathroom counter, mirror, walls and my 9 year old son than I actually did on my teeth. But once I figured it out, it works like a charm. I have braces and this works very well at getting all the nasty left overs out from in between your teeth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really clean gum.","review":"Waterpik doesn't need advertising.

You'll never have to floss again, but the extra heads are kind of hit or miss.... most of them miss haha i only use the original jet type head which works perfectly so no complaints there. But if you are buying this version for the added heads only i feel you will be dissapointed buy this thing because of the size of the water tank. I can't imagine how annoying it would be to have to refill the smaller ones atleast 3 times per use sometimes with this one i will use 2 tanks 1 water and 1 water and mouth wash mix works good. Another common complaint i hear about this thing is its loud i was very impressed when i got this about how quit it was compared to what people had said. Some people even claimed you couldnt use this at night because you would \\"wake up the kids\\" completly not true.

I've never used one before, and there was a lot of splashing at first. But it works great, especially with a about 1/3 Listerine in the tank. Just make sure you rinse and run a cycle with just water afterwards to clean out the plumbing.After using this flosser daily for about a month, my dentist noticed a major difference. They also advised me to use string floss at least once a week, but they said it's really just a formality."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO FAR, SO GOOD!!","review":"I'VE BEEN USING THIS ONLY TWO MONTHS NOW AND SO FAR HAVE NO COMPLAINTS OR PROBLEMS.

I hope this will help alleviate my periodontitis as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save the box for the return","review":"After five uses within five days, the On-Off switch went \\"Pop\\" and the unit was dead.

Because it did not work well, we decided to give this new model a try. The pluses include the compact size, see-through reservoir, quiet motor, and easy to turn adjustment control. The water irrigation works well. Two problems, though. Every time the water is used up and the unit is turned off, the reset switch at the outlet is tripped. This did not happen with the other brand and it has caused frustration, since someone (an aide) must then reset the bathroom switch. Also, the on/off switch seems to be difficult for an older person to use. The up/down switch on the older model Waterpiks is easier for shaky fingers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my waterpik 100","review":"I loved mine so much that I purchased a second one for my husband.

Waterpik's response was fast with no questions asked.The new unit works great. The pressure is more than enough. I tried to use my new unit on 10 and my gums bled.

My last model had great water pressure and large water reservoir; but it's performance started to decline.The Ultra comes with a smaller reservoir and the highest pressure setting does not match my previous model.

The old one had a cover that you turned upside down to become the water reservoir. After all those years, it started leaking somewhere inside.I like this unit much better. They put a lot of thought into the design. The implements fit nicely under the fold-up lid and the water reservoir is dedicated to that purpose. No more waiting for the reservoir to dry before putting the thing back together and stowing it away.The only downside is that this unit is not as powerful as my old one; however, you have more precise control over the intensity of the water stream.UPDATE (7/6/09) - Well, the power switch no longer works.

It runs out my mouth, as the directions say it should, but it splashes on my hand and all over the sink--sometimes onto the floor. I keep using it because it does a good job of flushing out particles between the teeth, and seems to invigorate the gums. I wish the base was only five inches deep instead of five and one-half, because the depth of glass bathroom shelves is just five inches. The Waterpik would be five inches deep if the cord were attached to a side instead of the back. I also wonder why Waterpik furnishes six different kinds of nozzles when most people probably just need the basic nozzle. I would have been happier if they had provided a couple of extra basic nozzles.

Be sure to follow instructions about shutting off the stream before you take the tip out of your mouth otherwise you will have water all over the place, or zap yourself with the waterstream which can be pretty strong.

My husband and I have been using the waterpik for a short period of time but can already see some results - our gums became healthier and our teeth look and feel great.

I just got it today and used it for the first time after I ate 4 slices of pizza. I used the waterpik and tried out the toothbrush tip, jet tip, pik pocket tip and tongue cleaner so far. The tongue cleaner worked great and cleaned my tongue really well. The toothbrush is great too, however i think im going to put toothpaste and brush teeth first before i start the waterpik cause it washes most of the toothpaste away, but that's my first try and experimenting. I put some listerine with the water too. The tip i like the most though and reason why i bought it was because of the pocket pik to get rid of built up food between my teeth from eating. it worked really great. After everything, I wanted to see if they got all of the food between my teeth so i used floss to see. I noticed that there was no residue on the floss. It's an amazing product! I would recommend it to everyone! It is worth the price for healthy teeth and gums and no gingivitis! :]"},{"rating":"2","title":"An improvement though smaller capacity","review":"I have used this for about a month now. Owned three of the full size versions prior. While they worked when they worked, lifespan was short (2yrs). One of the three was a warranty replacement.This newer version appears much more robust. It is quieter and the connection to the base and various tips appears to be more substantial and possibly less prone to breakage. It also occupies a much smaller footprint on the vanity top and the lid storage for tips is a big improvement. So thus far it is a great unit.That said, the reservoir is much smaller than the previous version (20oz vs 35oz) and so I have to refill it each time I use it. I kept the previous unit's reservoir and use that to refill.Dental irrigators are high pressure units and the longevity of consumer (e.g. cheap) versions is likely to be short (although this has a 3-yr warranty). But these things are great for your teeth and I will keep buying.Bonus--it looks like an Imperial Storm Trooper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Use","review":"Easy to use and works great.

It works as advertised and I can definitely see and feel a difference in the cleanliness of my teaath. Much easier than flossing and I don't have to worry about using a floss threader to get around and over my bridge. I have not experienced any issues with the tip rotating on its own like some have mentioned.It comes with a wide variety of tips, though I would have preferred a few less of the specialty tips, which I am likely to never use, and more of the regular tips to have some spares or to have one for me and my wife.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I think the button control on the handle is backwards. They should have made it so that the flow is stopped until you press on the button versus the other way around. That'll help avoid some unwanted spraying in the event you turn it on before you have the tip fully in your mouth."},{"rating":"2","title":"morrisoc","review":"This is the fourth WaterPik I've owned and it is far superior to all of the others.My first WaterPik lasted for 10-15 years and finally had to be discarded when the tubing wore out, so I was very disappointed when I ordered a new one and found that I needed to keep rocking it on the base to get it to seat properly until the water would start flowing. I complained to the company and received a replacement that worked only slightly better, but lasted for about 4 years until the tubing broke.The company has solved the problems I found most annoying on the older models: A cord that never retracted properly (this one folds up compactly at the front); a reservoir that never connected properly to the outlet (this reservoir is held firmly in a 1\\" deep well); a hole that was difficult to get the pick inserted into (the clip on the front of this model works beautifully).

Looks better, and is smaller than previous Waterpik flossers, but does not do as good of a job, and the previous models were only average products with a lot of reliability issues.

I like the dial that lets you change the pressure of the water. There is a special tip that is supposed to help clean gum pockets, but you must use it on the lowest pressure only. I find that the regular tip is what I use most often, along with old-fashioned flossing. Even a WaterPik can't reach between the teeth on the sides if they are tight.

We tried every thing in the manual to make it work. After an hour of doing whatever we could, I am sending it back. Motor sounds bad with a beeping sound that would start every time it was turned on.

Then it began to leak at the point where the nozzle attaches to the handle and would eject the nozzle.

It really works....","review":"Bought this not just to clean out food debris, but because my dental hygienist said it would clean debris AND plaque from the \\"pockets\\" around the gumline better than floss alone. I agree with the people who say it sounds a little like a cement mixer, and it is a little messy, so you'd better be leaning over the sink, BUT it does a fabulous job at removing not only debris, but plaque as well. I used to be able to scrape calculus (hardened plaque) off the back of my bottom incisors about three days after a professional cleaning. It has been weeks, and I still have no buildup.

The water pulse is strong but the unit is unwieldy and very difficult to use effectively, and even when used properly leaves plenty of plaque and bits of food between teeth. The water flosser it replaced (an Oral Breeze) didn't work very well either, but at least it was cheap and easy to use, convenient, and didn't require daily cleaning or severe caution in using a pump motor with a full tank of water near an electrical outlet. Forget letting your kids use this thing -- it'd be dangerous. And whose bonehead decision was it to make the unit pump water freely as the default action, with a button needing to be pressed to stop the flow? I've made so many messes because of that lunacy and I've only had this thing a week.

It has a compartment to hold the extra picks and is awkward to remove to add water. I tried to leave it off but the pump vibration spays water all over. The shape of the lid and the little lip that has to align with the reservoir makes alignment to put it back on very precise. Makes you feel like your assembling a puzzle or a clock instead of a lid just to keep the water from splashing out. Remove the lid to add water the wrong way and the storage compartment opens up and one or more of the extra picks and attachments fall out. The fitment of those is another mystery puzzle.

I called the 800 number of waterpik and told them of the above. The gal that I talked to was rude, nonresponsive to my concerns as if I were an idiot.

From the git go, I had problems with the lid. It is not hinged and it easily falls into the water tank. The clamp that holds the water pik is plastic and it eventually broke but I always had problems with it holding the pik. Whenever the pik is laid flat which happens sometimes when it falls out of the clamp, it leaks water. Apparently, there is a gravity flow. If properly designed, water should eject only when it is pumped. This could also be alleviated if the switch on the pik had to be pressed in order to get the water to flow. As the pik functions, the button can be pressed on the pik to stop the flow but when it is released the flow commences. Personally I would prefer it if the water did not flow until I pressed the switch on the pik. However, what finished the pik off was that the hose began to leak where it comes out at the bottom. Poor design having the hose underneath the pik."},{"rating":"1","title":"First impression - Ignore this product","review":"If first impressions make lasting impressions, then this model of waterpik has failed miserably.

Doesn't have batteries, has more power (you never use the top power), and you don't have to refill the water reservoir (it's the perfect amount of water for an excellent cleaning). If you are only buying one, and for your home, you should buy this one. The portable one is good for travelling or to leave at work (that's what I am going to do).

This is very disappointing. We are going to have to trash it and find an alternative product. Personally I find it simply scandalous to market such rubbish products.

It prevents ordinary flossing. Sure, there are work-arounds, but most are time-consuming and annoying.

Plenty of water power, sturdy construction and all in all, a good tool to minimize the annoyances caused by the braces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waterpik","review":"Works Great!!

The only things I could say that are slightly negative are: the water tube could be a tad longer.

Also, it come with so many attachments that I will never use and only one classic jet attachment. Since there are two of us, I will have to buy another classic jet attachment. It would have been better to leave out the toothbrush and tongue cleaner and give extra jets."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all hype! No way better than flossing!","review":"I purchased this product based on the manufacturer's claim that it removes 99% of all plaque along with another claim that it performs better than traditional flossing.Well, if it really truly performs better than flossing, then I shouldn't be able to see anything on a string of floss after using the Waterpik. Wrong! After using the Waterpik at the highest setting, I tested its effectiveness by using floss, and there were enough plaque and debri that the floss picked up AFTER the Waterpik to deem it not adequate. I performed this test multiple times over a 2-week period and got the same results.Just think about it. How can it be possible for a stream of water to reach certain places under the gum line that string floss obviously can? Thus, the claims by Waterpik were all marketing hype!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful dental aide","review":"I have used Waterpik water flossers for years. This is the first one I have seen that permits you to use the tool kit container as a cover for waterpik basin. I like that. It is also much smaller than the last Waterpik water flosser I had. That flosser was a huge clunker that took up lots of space. I get rid of it less than 12 months into purchase because the Ultra Flosser's description seemed to have all the qualities I had always wanted in a water flosser. I like everything about the Ultra Water Flosser except the water pressure at the highest setting is not strong enough when using the standard pik. It can become annoying having to stop and switch to one of the piks with a smaller hole to allow increased water pressure. All-in-all I am happier with this waterpik than with past waterpik products and recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, read the directions","review":"I find this water pick does everything it's supposed to. I've had it for about a month now.A couple tips:If you let the hose hang on something hard, that contact will make more noise. The way my machine is set near my sink, it needs to rub on the sink. I placed a washcloth between the hose and the sink and the noise was reduced significantly.As another reviewer suggested, keep a glass of water next to the Waterpik and filling it when it gets near empty. This will allow you to quickly fill it if you want more time than one filling requires (I do).Yes, water will drain out of the tip when the machine is off if you have the tip lower than the machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected!","review":"My old Waterpik finally gave up the ghost after only about 35 years.

I LOVE IT! My mouth feels fresh after using and feels clean like I just went to the dentist for a cleaning. I use it on a 7 setting, my wife likes 4.

In the earlier days, there was no replacement hose, so I had to buy a new unit. The newer ones have a replacement handle, but it is not inexpensive either, with the freight to Hawaii.As for getting the job done, it is marvelous. I use a sonic brush, brushing for that 2 minutes, rinse out, then use this unit on my gums, with an ounce of hydrogen peroxide mixed in with a full reservoir of water.Always, always, always, no matter how well I brush, there is debris flushed out. I do have deep pockets and there is probably where the problem lies. However, it beats having to go to a dentist and have him clean out those pockets. I do see my dentist twice yearly, and he still has to get way down there and scrape.It would be much more painful, and longer, without this tool. It's just a shame that the hose has to keep breaking on them. ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flossing is Fun again","review":"Get ready, what I'm about to say is gound breaking:Flossing is Fun!But seriously, this thing is really cool. I'm actually okay with flossing now. My gums don't bleed yet I feel like my teeth and gums are twice as clean and fresh when compared with normal flossing. This thing has 10 speeds so you can start out low and work your way up. My only gripe lies within the upper speeds. Once your on speed 8+, you don't have much time.

The Waterpik still does not mechanically remove as much stuff as string floss, but it gets out a lot of stuff that brushing alone will not.MY TIPS !!!1 - hold the handle in your right hand, keep your left thumb on the on off switch. the button on the handle is not that great. turn it off once your mouth gets full of water so you can spit out the water in peace. this thing can be a real mess if you are not careful !!!2 - remove the lid and throw it away.3 - remove the tank after each use so the parts can dry.4 - use this before you brush.5 - install an under sink water filter so you can brush and water floss with clean water.6 - start at a low power setting and move your way up as your gums get stronger."},{"rating":"2","title":"works well","review":"This waterpick does a great job.

All they needed were acoustic guitars and their voices to overpower an audience. Sure they were stoned, but they weren't stoned to the point where it affected the music in a negative way. If anything it added to the experience. Everyone was burning. But to enjoy this music you don't need to be stoned. You just have to listen.

I watched most of it and loved it. I got to see a few Dragon Ball episodes as the series began to run on Cartoon Network but didn't really didn't give it a try. As I was collecting Dragon Ball Z box sets I noticed these sets for Dragon Ball. They were fairly inexpensive and game with a great amount of episodes per pack. I gave it a try and loved it! It isn't the super action oriented anime that Dragon Ball Z was (don't get me wrong though, it has action!) This anime was what lead to the action juggernaut that is Dragon Ball Z. Using the story of Goku as a child and show is fun and adventures! Something to be noted: This maybe a cartoon but it is not wise to let children watch it. It contains adult themes which are unsuitable for children."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"I ordered this from amazon and recieved it a few days later (had prime) and I absolutely enjoyed it!I love dragon ball z but now I love dragon ball maybe even more! Its much more realistic! Goku is one funny kid and keeps you laughing throughout the adventure, this season is the best out of the 2 that ive gotten, season 1 & 2.

I have a multi-regional dvd player, so when I heard that FUNimation was releasing the first season of Dragonball I was very happy with the news.So even though the boxset is region 1, my dvd player can play it no problem. As for the tv show itself, a great watch, I've been a DB fan for many years now and this is very entertaining. It showcases the beginning of Son Goku & Buruma's friendship over the dragonballs, and they're journey to collect them all. It's also the first time you see the introductions to; Kuririn, Muten Roshi, Pu'er, Oolong, Yamucha, Lunch, Chi Chi, & Emporer Pilaf!Anyone who has the Dragonball Z Remastered boxsets, and loved them, then this is definitely worth your money. This is where it all began.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Great show! I'm really happy with this set! Unedited shows are so much more fun >;). Arrived on time.

I like how in Dragon Ball it's more of an adventure and about how they grow and focuses more on their training. So I decided to purchase the first season, but I was afraid to since I heard that since 2011 Funimation decided to go green and stop having the season booklets in the Dragon Ball season sets. Thankfully when mine arrived it did come with the booklet along with my Season 2 set which came last week. So just to let some buyers know the booklet may not be included. I know it's uncut but I wish that some of the perverted scenes were left out, to me the show is better with less of it. Overall though I would recommend this product to any fan of the Dragon Ball franchise."},{"rating":"2","title":"really good and worth your money","review":"if you have never seen dragon ball i would highly recommend it is my favorite tv series by far i have watched every episode hundreds of times and they dont seem to get old it would be great for some kids although the followed up series dragon ball z might be questionable in some parents eyes for children with the blood and cursing but pick this up as soon as you can you will not be disapointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"I am an advanced Adobe Premiere user and I wanted to try my hand at After Effects.

I expected it to be similar to other Gregorian music I had heard, but was very surprised when I heard the Monks belting out popular music.I had to double-check that this wasn't some secret Wierd Al Yankovic project, but it appears to be on the level.It's really sad when a resource like the Gregorians are forced to try their hands at singing classic Rock Songs. The Pink Floyd tune \\"Wish You Were Here\\" was really quite amusing. When \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" came on I nearly crashed my car. I wiped tears from my eyes for about 10 minutes after that song.I would not recommend this CD to anyone unless you have a wierd sense of humor and enjoy hearing talented groups flop badly."},{"rating":"2","title":"nail head trim","review":"These work really great.

Other hand can't hold a phone & I remembered the big old things they used to use with old time hand sets. I just couldn't find one that saddled over the shoulder. This one wasn't really what I was looking for but it had decent reviews, so I got one.The two sided tape works fine. It's almost like welded to the handset. Be sure it's positioned right before sticking on. You don't get a 2nd chance.But it just doesn't work very well for me, because it's too smooth. It slips too easy on fabric so it slides right off my shoulder all the time.

What can I say, it works well. It shipped very quickly to our office and the install was simple. All you do is just peel a sticker and attach it to your phone. You actually stop having to crunch your neck against your shoulder which is nice. Although it is bulky I find myself still holding the phone once in awhile. I don't think I'm used to it yet but I can tell that when I'm typing and talking I don't shrug my shoulders like I used to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I've only had this a few days and it is such a relief to my aching shoulders!

It is the same old ahistorical modernist rant: market capitalism destroyed real community, real meaning and, for that matter, reality iself. Whatever you make of its politics, or its lack of originality, the most damning criticism is that it exhibits a visible lack of contact with the anthropological or material culture record. It makes no contact with social history. But, being careful really doesn't matter much when you are on the side of the angels: beating up on McDonald's and modernity usually requires little more than the will to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Explains a lot of things about America I never understood","review":"The learned Mr. Ritzer presents a new paradigm for understanding the way America has become structured.

It's sarcastic, witty, very thorough and well-written.The main part of the guide is a walk-through of the game, with maps of ALL areas, info on enemies encountered in each area, and full explanations of the way your choices affect the game. Also included in the appendixes are information on the various enemies and what \\"goodies\\" they drop when you kill them, info on all the weapons and armor in the game, and info on the tokens, artifacts, and tunes you acquire. There's a quick interview with the game's creators and a couple of pages about the original Bard's Tale PC games.All around, it's a great guide, very easy to follow and set up logically. Well worth the low price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY HELPFUL","review":"I bought this game and game guide for my husband last year for his birthday, he LOVES it. In the game it gives you the chance to pick if the bard will be snarky or nice, and depending on what you pick will vary the outcome of the game, and the plot. He has replayed the game serval times. Who doesn't love a game where you can be nasty to a person that deserves it? The game guide was a help for finding routes, the map was a blessing and it has all of the locations of the secrets. worth the money I spent for the guide and shipping. It was delievered nicely, not damaged, and on time. I was thrilled!! This game is not for children, it is a bit too violent, for teens it would be okay. A great game and a must have guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slightly flawed, but worthwhile","review":"Prima's guides have saved me many a headache during a difficult portion of a game. That having been said, I was slightly disappointed with this guide. Several pieces of information were inacurate. I'm not sure if this is due to the fluid nature of the game or not enough product testing. A world map would have also been helpful. On the other hand, if you're stuck in The Bard's Tale, this guide is a worthwhile purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sense of Style","review":"The Boutonniere Style in One's Lapel is a great book. It is lovely just to page through. It is interesting to read . And it looks great just laying around the apartment. There are so many great pictures of famous people, stars and royality, all wearing a boutonniere. You seldom see boutonnieres any more and that's a pity. Such a small addition to the clothes a man wears but such a great fashion plus. This book helps you appreciate the boutonniere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystery of Burnt Hill","review":"This is a great read whether you grew up in the 50's or 60's or not. This was one of the first books I read growing up; and I was able to buy a copy a sometime ago and read it to my sons when they were younger. They really enjoyed the book too. Invisible ink secret messages, homing pigeons, suspicious characters and a little bit of history too. An easy read that is not too long. Takes place during a time when life for young teens was a lot simpler. This book was not available at the library and was out of print. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want to learn Tarot this is a must have book.","review":"I have been using this book for over two years, and I found it very useful when I started to learn Tartot.What I like the most about this book is that has an overal description of every card (that is the Rider-Waite) and then the meaning of them in their natural position and reversed.The rest of the book teach us different readings (Horoscope, Tree of Life, Keltic), a lovely summarized definitions of the cards in their natural position and other aspects as the Kabalah, numerology and astrology), which is fun and challenging to use when you can master the meanings of the cards (or even when you don't).

This book is a testament to that legacy. Her insight to the tarot is nothing more than warmer over Pictorial Key by Waite only \\"vaguer\\" and her ability to write is questionable; no wonder she spent countless hours in her Mt Kisco home answer angry letters and since she died at 98 in 1999, so you can't be one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best pocket-reference book on Tarot","review":"This book is a great choice. Eden Gray takes you through the paths of Tarot with sense. The descriptions of the cards (major and minor arcana) are one of the most accurates.

Forget the low price, this book is a First Class choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use guide","review":"I like this book. Its well worth the cheap price. It starts out with an introduction. Then, there are two pages for every card in the deck. On page that describes the card and its meaning, an a picture of the card on the opposite page. That is for the bigs ones. Then it has a page for every other card. There is stuff of how to read. There is stuff on horoscope signs and numerology. There is a glossary of symbolic terms. The tarot defined, History of the tarot, The major & minor Arcanas How to read the cards, The tarot and meditation Systems of occult though that illuminate the tarot: the tarot and numerology, the tarot and the kabalah, the tarot and astrology Its about 250 pages, semi-small print.

This is my number one references, and I have many references that sit on the shelf and collect dust. If you read this book, you will understand the tarot. I recommend buying this book with the rider waite deck (if you don't have one already), and if you're a total newbie at this, I also recommend you buy \\" The Everything Tarot Book\\". Read that first to gain knowledge about the Tarot, which will help you to remember at least the basic meanings of each card when your playing tarot.

If you are a senior manager, this book is for you as the vast majority of the book covers how you need to structure your organization, but not much real discussion of Lean or Six Sigma. This book provides a brief discussion of six sigma tools and almost no discussion of substance on Lean tools. It is a bad sell to tell a reader that a Black Belt should save $1,000,000 per year.

Additionally, this novel is very well written, superbly so, and makes for an excellent read.In this story, our evolved human is born into modern society without anyone knowing his nature.

Not only is it NOT inevitable, but it is probably the WORST and most philosophically contestable (for the same reasons that most educated theologians would never argue for God's existence from the same ground). The book is a scientistic - that is, a philosophically \\"unround\\" - embarassment both to science and to the integrity of atheism.

Perhaps to an experienced fish tank owner that's an obvious requirement for this product, but should be specified.

But it's a great story - a planet out of space is hurtling towards Earth, and there is no way to thwart it like we would have today. It is discovered that the 'new' planet will bump Earth out into the cold of space, and it will then take over the old Earth orbit. So a plan is hatched to launch a 'Jules Verne' style rocket ship to the new planet, and most of the story deals with the building and staffing of the ship before the 'big day' when Earth gets right-English into the side pocket. Great story - fun to read it all its dated glory. The sequel, After Worlds Collide, deals with the 'Adam and Eve' story on the new planet (convenient that the lead lady is called Eve in the story).

The strange part is that it comes from Adema, a band who didn't set any fires ablaze with their debut album but still managed to make a capable and respectable effort. There is no Giving In or Speculum here on Unstable though. Instead listeners are subjected to trash like Stand Up, which is easily the worst abuse song ever recorded. Other tracks like Codependent and Needles fail to even have sensible lyrics, revealing the complete lack of effort the band put into making the album. While some tracks like the title track and Betray do show a little promise, it's impossible to seperate them from the garbage surrounding them. Cliched riffs and lyrics dilute the cesspool further. In the end, Unstable is nothing more than a textbook example for other nu-metal bands about how not to make their album. As for Adema, perhaps they would be better suited to stabilize their future efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"What can I say this cd just flat out sucks. Im sure the only way these guys got any attention in the first place was because of the lead singers relationship to Jon Davis. The lead singer, Mark or whatever is an absolute terrible writer.

Sure it may be considered \\"nu metal\\", but id say alternative rock is just as good.

The hoochie-coochie chatahoochie song is a good example of his uniform style which sounds just like the song \\"Summertime Blues\\" which is a very poor re-make of Olivia Newton-John's original 1975 version, and this song sounds just like about 12 of his other songs. The first time that I heard it on the radio, I thought it was another of his songs with just an excerpt of the Olivia song in it. He could make a Jimi Hendrix song sound just like one of his. Truly talented for that, I guess. Whatever."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best from the Best","review":"This CD is not only full of Mr. Jackson's previous hits, the two new songs are already adding to that long list. Just as 'Where Were You When The World Stopped Turning' was for the country and 'Home' was for his mother, 'Remember When' is for his wife. Incredibly touching wonderful songs. He is constantly raising the bar for great country music. This collection proves without a doubt what an extraordinary singer and songwriter he is. A must have for every country music lover. And if you're not a country music lover, here's a CD to change all that!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Darn good movie","review":"This movie is great.

Enter Stevie California-cool, eats veggie burgers and quotes Neitzche. Tony may not agree with Stevie's style, but he has to complete his training so he can go back and kill the Mafia's accountant, who's about to turn state's evidence. His final test: kill whoever is randomly picked out of the yellow pages. His target: Angel Chaste. Angel works the graveyard shift at a mortuary. She thinks a doll is her baby. Her mother left when she was little. Basically, Angel has PROBLEMS. When Tony, Angel and Stevie collide, it will change all of their lives.Reactions to the movie: The character and plot development was rather slow and the movie seemed to wander. The charactures, for example, Stevie California,seemed to be rather formulaic. (Let's piece these elements together and make a character out of them.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is below Kyles acting levels","review":"This was so disappointing. When I see Chandler acting I usually enjoy him but in this movie, he is very disappointing and I find that this is a turkey movie or as they used to be called. I hope to see him in some good movies. The acting is so bad and for Jim Belushi, all the actors are very disappointing to watch. I expect great things from both of these actors and I did not get that with this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small Screen star to the Wide Screen","review":"If you have ever seen Early Edition, you will definitely love this movie. Early Edition was a Saturday night drama starring Klye Chandler as Gary Hobson. - A guy who gets tommorows newspaper, today. He used this fortune telling information to save people's lives. And since Klye Chandler is such a talented actor, he transformed Gary Hobson from a cardboard superheroe to a real human being, who people enjoyed watching for the last four seasons. Unfortunately this great show was cancelled at the end of this season (2000), but you can still catch this talented Actor in Angel's Dance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"James Belushi and Sheryl Lee are quite good in their roles.

However the basic's of capturing the light, composition of the photo and the steps to recording the countries, cities and inhabitants don't (it just how they're recorded).Bob Krist workflows that he outlines and the tips provided in my opinion are well suited to the beginner and enthusiaist photographer. In fact, it would be a great idea to copy the simple steps down onto a card and slip in the camera bag for a checklist when travelling.This book precedes my copy of Lonely Planets Travel Photography but is simpler and more anecdotal. A good read and recommended even if your capture is digital.

Especially \\"Still Breathing\\" and \\"Killing Me\\"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn.","review":"This CD didn't do it for me. Granted they do have a few catchy songs recorded on this album, there is nothing original about it whatsoever. I found the lyrics boring and repetitive at times, which happens frequently with copy and paste style \\"emo\\" (pop) groups like Cauterize. The problem is that the singer (even though he definitely can sing) can't pull off the somewhat tame lyrics with any sort of real EMOtion or conviction. Worth a listen? For sure. Worth two listens?

Whether you come from a more punk background like myself or a more rock/ alternative background, give this cd a try. Cauterize does such a great job of combining all their influences into their music. Different songs, you can hear where the rock comes in, the punk, the pop punk...whatever...it's all in there.

Thoroughly researched, this story is based on the true tale of Marguerite de la Rocque. Elle (her name is never given in the novel) is deposited by her uncle with her lover and nursemaid. The reason for this rather cruel treatment is that he has discovered her with her lover and disapproves, to the extent that he sentences her to an almost certain death. But Elle doesn't die. She survives the deaths of her lover and nursemaid. She survives the oncoming winter which bring ice, snow and bears. She survives a clash of cultures, and...but I won't say more so as not to spoil this wonderful novel for you.If you like tall tales, mesmerizing writing, and a spunky heroine whose voice possesses a sweet wryness, then this book is for you. It won the Governor General's Award for Fiction, and it is easy to see why. Five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful book!","review":"This is a detailed description of Ackerman's views about dermatology, dermatopathology and surgical pathology.

I was looking for something I could afford. I ran into the ASICS Men's Hyperdistance shoe on Amazon. The cool looks were indeed enticing, and it seemed perfectly within my price range. I went on and bought it.Its the best I could have asked for the money I spent. Comfortable and really well cushoned, you feel like you are stepping on cotton--seriously. It is really light which allows me to use it for both long and short races.A wonderful buy overall. Highly recommended for both the beginner and pro alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Printing!","review":"I will perhaps update this review later to reflect the content of the book, but I first want to state that the typesetting and the physical printing in this text is HORRIBLE. It looks like someone literally made this book by taking blank paper and photocopying an existing edition of the book into this one. There are black lines, shadows, 'ghosts' from page corners and all sorts of horrible markings on nearly all the pages. It looks like a bootleg or something, honestly.I love the content so far and the book is no disappointment there, especially for the seasoned programmer looking to stump themselves on some difficult trivia. This issue with the printing though, it detracts from the whole thing. Such a shame, because I really wanted to like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Haute for me","review":"I have lived in and have travelled to Maine for over 40 years and have a pretty good idea of both the local restaurant scene and the new commers. However, in a travel format I think the book should have focused more on the wonderful Seafood, Lobster Pounds and Clam shacks dotting the Maine coast. Yes they have some but give too much space to new wave cooking. If you are going to visit Maine I think you want the flavors of Maine, not spaqgheti alla carbonara.This book missed the mark and excluded several of Main's best well known Lobster Pounds and Clam Shacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy guide","review":"The idea of such a guide is great...but the result is lousy not to say something worse. This is supposed to be a food guide but you have no ratings! in addition you have no signs enabling you to know at first sight if a place mentionned is a luxury restaurant, a casual lobster place or a family hamburger cafe.In addition to the negative side, no mention of wine list.Out of the tens and tens of restaurant guides I have bought, this one is certainly the worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very durable, perfect for storing LEGOS!","review":"Believe it or not, I bought this tackle box so my 4-year-old son could store all of his LEGO pieces. The fold out trays are perfect for those small hard-to-find pieces, while the large bay at the bottom holds the rest. He's even able to open and close it by himself quite easily. Moving it requires a grown-up since it's heavy now that it's filled, but that's to be expected. Acceptable price, quick delivery, satisfied customer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For the fisherman who has too much","review":"This is one of the largest tackle boxes that I found for my husband. He really likes having a hard case tackle box that opens up to easily show all of his tackle. The design on top when closed allows him to keep a few lures out without slipping off as it is a cuplike indentation design. This was a problem in his last tackle box that lasted 25 years but the handle broke - thinking it was because it was leaned on in the opposite direction which this new box has the same design flaw issue with the handle. When filled, this tackle box is heavy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The fertile Chandler","review":"I agree with the reader, Chandler is fertile like a rabbit.

And I am - quite honestly - tired of the pro-British portrayals of historical facts. It is NOT OK, and is NOT FAIR!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Significant errors abound","review":"How can anyone supposedly study a subject for so long and make so many errors?

BUT the info in the book is amazing. you will learn about so many things about your body and exercising, and be astounded. so that is why you should STILL get this book. b/c really, you can formulate your own diet from Michael's info. that is what i've done. i found the book very well put together, and Thurmond very conversational, real, encouraging, and nice throughout it...

It looks well-researched and seems to have some great menus put together that are nutritionally sound. My husband followed the diet to a T. And yes, two days into the diet, he noticed about a pound come off and had more energy.Unfortunately, three days into the diet, my husband began having charlie horse-like spasms all over his body. The book fails to take into account that not all sodium is bad for you, and that your body requires at least some sodium to function properly. After three days, my husband stopped this diet and reverted toThe Zone: A Dietary Road Map to Lose Weight Permanently : Reset Your Genetic Code : Prevent Disease : Achieve Maximum Physical Performance, which works much better, is suited for long-term use, and is nutritionally balanced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused ?","review":"I originally purchased this book as my daughter wanted to buy the 6 week makeover package for $300.00.

Neither my daughter nor myself could decide what body types we were - the one I chose was to eat meat 4 times a day - I am almost a vegetarian !!!I am glad that I purchased the book, but found that the body typing was not consistent- too many choices, that lead to different diets."},{"rating":"2","title":"loosing weight","review":"The book gave alot of usefull imformation, so far I've lost 25 lbs ,recommend to any one with extra weight to loose fast without being hungry.

It does require some prep work, but it is extremely helpful in teaching about portion control, food combinations, and easy exercise techniques (45-60 minutes of light cardio is NOT hard). And seeing fast results is a great motivator to keep going. I realize that I will not continue to lose so much so fast, but I really think I can drop another 21 lbs and get to my goal in 2-3 months using what I have learned from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nearly starved!","review":"This programs promises you will eat more and exercise less. NOT TRUE! For my body type, the diet is basically chicken, tuna and salad all the time every day 7 days a week. And not only do you have resistance exercises to do two days of every week, they also recommend that you do an hour of aerobic exercise 6 days a week. That doesn't sound like more or less of anything to me. The fact is, I couldn't stay on the diet. After 3 days I was sick to death of chicken and salad. And the fact is--if you exercise 6 days a week for an hour, it doesn't matter what you eat--you're going to lose some weight. Too expensive a program. You can get the same info. on the internet for free. It's also too hard for some people to figure their body type with this program. I answered all the questions and could have come under two body types, but it gives you no information about which diet to follow if you fit two profiles."},{"rating":"2","title":"This works but it's hard to do","review":"I have done the 6 day body makeover twice. The first time I was stuck and couldn't lose any weight (I am trying to lose baby weight). I lost 4 lbs the first time I tried it. This is really fast weight loss. I actually lost 2 more pounds afterwards too. The diet is really strict and gets quite boring with just chicken, vegetables and rice. But if you want to lose weight fast, this really works! And if you are impatient as I am, the few pounds you lose is a GREAT success. I am on my 4th day of trying the makeover a 2nd time. I have lost 4 lbs already. To be honest, I haven't stuck to the diet 100% but I am still losing. This is great to try if you're in a rut, it just takes a a lot of discipline!"},{"rating":"2","title":"6-Day Body Makeover Review","review":"I thought this book to be very informative and have incorporated some of the suggestions in my day-to-day living. The only problem I have with this book, like all of the others I have bought or thumbed through, is the food suggestions. I am a mother of 2 grade school children, take care of my mother who has Alzheimer's, and work a full time job. It is time consuming, overall and the grocery list is costly if you are cooking for 4 instead of one.

Plus I lost 2 inches off the hips, one off the waist, thighs and arms. The food is bland and there is a lot of it. To me it was simple, here is what you eat, how much and when.

My sister and a friend did the same! With continueing to exercise, like we should, I have kept it off.Great program. I will do it again.

The exercise bands are available all over ebay. Once you know your body type it's pretty easy to follow. I believe the $1400 cost mentioned by a couple of people covers the cost of a week at Thurmond's facility. The 6-week BODY makeover is also available at many sites, including web auction sites. Thurmond knows his subject and the plan will take the weight off; be advised, though that this plan (like his 6 week plan) is restrictive and low-calorie. Also, if you buy the 6 week plan, the 6 day mini makeover is included...not the book, but an audio cassette or CD and a pamphlet."},{"rating":"1","title":"6 Day Body Make Over","review":"This may indeed work, but it does take some planning and some work to organize the food.

THIS IS JUST ANOTHER SCAM!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Starvation","review":"Basically, this book tells you to cut out all salts, sugars and fat, eat very small portions, and excercise moderately. The author goes so far as to tell the reader not to participate in strenuous exercise like weight-lifting, elliptical machines and martial arts. This is because the diets are so spartan you won't have much energy to workout.This is a horrible idea: starve yourself, and then gain all the weight back when you go off the diet. Avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just save your money","review":"I will say I have not tried this diet so I can not speak about the success or failure of it - it might work. Any diet would work that requires you to eat no salt, no suger, no fat and drink 100 oz of water a day. My plan was to basically eat meat and fruit or \\"greens\\" 5 times a day. Sorry to say - I couldn't imagine choking this down for a week. Each plan for your body type is different but do not vary too much from the one I described. It is an interesting concept, but I have had more success with South Beach - a diet that provides much more variety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Threw in the towel after the 1st day.

This way of eating is very foreign to me because two servings of meat a day is my usual max. I stuck to it though and now jeans that were too tight last week fit again.

It sat in the original plastic packing on my flying bridge for several months before I aquired some tackle to store in it. To my dismay when I went to load it every zipper had corroded and broke off when I went to pull on them. Every piece of metal was rusted and corroded. The nylon was fine and the straps were OK but the pockets were unuseable because I can't open or close them. Plano should state on the packing or the tag that this item is not meant to be near a sea water environment. Now I am out the $65 I paid for it and still have to get a new tackle box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book yet","review":"This is book 11 in the Everworld series. I think I like this one the best so far. They've all been great though. This one starts out with Christopher in the mouth of a giant. He is able to escape with much struggle and is helped by a half elf/half human lady named Etain. They are taken to her town which is much like Ireland. Here they find that they have discovered primal forms of technology. Like electricity, cable cars, telegraphs, etc. Christopher soon falls in love with Etain. Everything crumbles when the giant (who is actually there to protect their island) is killed by a gun and Senna evades them. She brings many of her followers from the real world to Everworld armed with weapons and soon the war begins. Want to know how it ends... you have to read the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"Fantastic. That the word that comes to mind.

Sad.","review":"I have never written a review where my title was probably all that was necessary to describe the book. Yes, there are many books written by Young Earth Creationists who have no understanding of the science and even less knowledge of the scriptures. But this book manages to cram so little factual information into some 1300+ pages of weak quote-mining and even poorer reading comprehension on the part of the author--and I can scarcely describe the sadness I feel that we as Christ-followers are being judged by such poor quality material.Of course, one should rarely expect top quality material when there is no peer-review and a work is self-published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Tired Old Arguments","review":"I've read this book online. It presents the same tired old arguments that have been debunked decades ago. This includes the moon dust argument, which doesn't even have anything to do with evolution. Most of the time this book tries to disprove evolution instead of proving their young earth claims. Only the scientifically illiterate would be convinced by this book's arguments. I recommend this book for those who are majoring in any scientific field, only because it's a good laugh.I used to be a creationist, but now I see no problem integrating scientific facts with my faith. This book obviously does absolutely nothing in bringing me back to a belief in biblical literalism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creationist point of view: a very annoying, unreadable style","review":"This is not a review of the actual content. This review is based strictly on the National Enquirer-style of type set, which made this book unreadable for me. At least one-third of it is either bolded, italicized, or underlined. I tried to read it anyway, but got the impression the author felt I was too stupid to decide what was important, so was leading me around by the literary nose, hence the font style. Further, everything was so crammed together, it was difficult to see where one topic ended and another started. I bought this book based on two enthusiastic recommendations. The style was so juvenile, however, that I would be embarrassed to hand this to a non-Christian trying to get a view of creation science. TryGenesis Floodby Dr John Whitcomb orIn the Beginning: Compelling Evidence for Creation and the Flood (7th Edition)by Dr Walt Brown instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old creationist hogwash...","review":"I really wish creationists would at least have the intellectual vigor to come up with something new. Even if you exclude the usual misquotes and other dishonest arguments, Ferrell's book contains absolutely nothing that hasn't long ago been refuted by mainstream science. Frankly, I found the book to be a sad, pathetic diatribe that seems to have ignored the advances of 20th century science, let alone the discoveries of the 21st century. Even worse, books like this only make Christians look foolish in the eyes of rational people and are a big part of why a majority of young people today reject Christianity as a backwards, crackpot religion run by people who refuse to accept modern science. Ferrell's book isn't just bad, it only hurts the cause of the very people it is aimed at."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good look into the insanity of creationist thinking.","review":"Let the reader be warned that Vance Ferrell is no scientist or doctor and yet he writes books on placebo medicine.He does not even attempt to handle evolution according to a scientific standard or method. He writes off evolution as a religion and creationism as science when in reality creationism is clearly religion.Ferrell does not once address evolution in a scientific matter but merely applies a tactic of flooding the reader with so many questions (which he does not answer by the way), lost quotes and garbage the whole matter is laughable. The only reason one should buy this book is to look into the insanity of a creationist that is grasping at straws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good short humorous book","review":"This book is about a boy named Roger who claims he is a rat. When a couple named Bob and Joan find him at their door, they don't know what to do. Could he really have been a rat? He certainly does have some rat-like habits. He shreds his bedding and bites his teacher. He goes into the sewer when he has to escape. When he finally gets captured, he is brought to trial to decide if he should be exterminated.

Grimm wrote 'em one way (usually, grim!), Disney disnified them, then today's authors reality them up again.This is a twist on cinderella. The story itself is the story of the rat who was turned into a page-boy for the would-be princess. He's a boy now, but, he was a rat.It's also the story of society. From civil service units that are anytyhing but civil to tabloid journalism at its yellowist, we see the nasty side of society as it turns this innocent yet rat-like child into a \\"monster\\".The language may be a bit confusing for some young readers, but in all, I think it's a great fit for the age group. There's lots of tension, but no real threat. And, there's a fairy tale ending.(*)>"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mark Welsh is a loser","review":"If you've never heard the album, don't leave a review.

Michael Chance sings Incassum Lesbia Rogas beautifully. My particular favorites are \\"Hark How the Songsters\\" where they switch parts so they each the first counter-tenor part. \\"In Vain the Amrous Flute\\" is a lovely piece also. Two entirely different voices which blend together perfectly. The secong half of the disc contains folksongs sung by Alfred Deller and his son Mark Deller, though Mark is only heard on a couple of duets. Their voices are an aquired taste for many, and the recordings are old, but the simplicity of the pieces is remarkable.

This Australian pianist turned my attention in these years of the middle seventies when I bought his available recordings of the genius of Bonn.Concise articulation, whole understanding of the Beethovenian lexicon, prodigious use of the fortissimos and absolute commitment were part of his excel virtues.This set is a striking evidence of this statement. His vehemence, sense of melodic unity and knowledge of structural cohesion, allowed him express with meridian clearness the oneness and genuine significance of the musical legacy of L.V.B. just like a few.For many listeners and newcomers it's absolutely necessary to acquire this album.

This season has improved over the first two seasons because the venues are different and more interesting (not just the L.A. area), there are more interesting, complex case studies, and Cesar seems to be learning more and increasingly being more intuitive, often imitating his trusty pitbull, Daddy, and continues to make use of the Dog Psychology centre.

It looked easy to control and seemed to have good range on tv, so I ordered it. Well, they must have been using a different car than the car we received. This car is very cute, and the kids instantly wanted to play with it, it seems fairly durable, but you have to stand basically within 3-5 feet of it to make it go, so the kids have to follow it around to make it drive, lame. the batteries die very quickly. And the general controls aren't that great. I got this as a Christmas gift for my son and was pretty disappointed. Over all, they don't play with it much because it's hard to control and they have to follow it all around, which sort of defeats the purpose of a remote control car. Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"cute toy, stopped working","review":"My son loved this toy when he got it less than a year ago. I agree the battery life is terrible.

After Anywhere But Here, and her short stories, I kept looking at the cover to make sure it really was a Simpson book. None of the main characters pulled me in, and I never really got a feel for what this novel was about. The narration seemed clunky and uninspired - and much of it read like a first draft, the important parts having not been figured out and clarified yet. This had no energy to it, compared to her other work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a regular Mona Simpson novel.","review":"Mona Simpson's spare writing style was often confusing. I couldn't keep the characters straight and had to reread passages. I struggled about a third of the way through and finally gave up when my mind began to wander. There's too many good novels on my reading stack to waste time on this one. Too bad. I liked Anywhere But Here."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Irregular Girl","review":"Reading this book felt like some sort of punishment I inflicted upon myself. I kept on reading, waiting for it to turn into a real story, worthy of the beautiful but empty prose within. I get the Owens/Jobs connection - I worked for Jobs for some years, I get it. However, it read like knowledge uninformed by insight, compassion, objectivity - only opportunism. And perhaps betrayal - does Simpson feel somehow she was entitled to share his life, his oddities? Clearly she does, or did. I'd say that at least at the time it was written, Simpson had some of her own personal issues to work out about her birth, her relationships, her perceptions of women. How would she feel if someone inflicted such a roman a clef on her?I don't blame Lisa Jobs for being pissed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book was a Book Club reading assignment.Half the group read this book and the other half the Steve Jobs book.It was quite evident who the book was aboutbutthere was not one character in the book I cared about and it was a read I could easily put down.Tedious is the best word to describe it and the characters had no character.I am \\"Steve Jobs\\" out."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOVELS ARE BY DEFINITION, FICTION!","review":"Ms. Simpson has a very loose definition of \\"fiction\\".

(see also my review of his CD SINGLE\\"Open the door\\", where I have described my sensations during a live performance that I saw in Milan-Italy 1 year ago).Well Roger is the sound of Supertramp and the true Supertramp don't exist without him!!Recommended for the lovers of tasteful, dynamic and aggressive pop!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Roger needed to do this for himself and his fans.","review":"Just like Roger Waters can't escape Pink Floyd, Roger Hodgson can't escape Supertramp, and this album is his attempt to deal with his Supertramp past versus his solo future...the only problem is that he didn't include more of his post-Supertramp solo songs, but it's still a very good live album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing compared with Hai Hai and his Supertramp days.","review":"Great to see a release after so long - \\"Hai Hai\\" was a great album that should have been followed-up much earlier. But, IMHO, this latest album is musically very disappointing when compared to Hai Hai, but even more so when compared to original Supertramp masterpieces such as \\"It's raining again\\", \\"Dreamer\\", \\"Take the long way home\\". And as another reviewer said, it all sounded a bit \\"rushed\\". Some suggestions to RH: 1. Reform with Rick Davies and the boys - would be sensational. 2. Rumours (in the early 90's) of a project between RH & Trevor Rabin (guitarist/vocalist from Yes on the \\"90125\\" and \\"Big Generator\\" albums back in the) never happened - it's a must."},{"rating":"1","title":"new car decal","review":"This was not exactly what I thought it would be.

I've learned to adapt to what the current singer John Payne has to offer just like learning to live with Steve Hogarth after Fish jetted from Marillion. I was excited when I purchased this album, Steve Howe playing with the band and an interesting track listing, plus I was curious to hear Payne sing the older songs. The actual song performances are nicely done and it sounds like the band infuses a lot of energy when performing live... however, stay away, this is for die hard collectors only. It is an audience recording, and a bad one at that. Why they couldn't take the effort and release sound board recording is beyond me..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just for fans and completists","review":"Asia-Live in Osaka is part of the John Payne era Asia official bootleg series. Of the three official bootlegs in this series, this is the least I'd recommend because the sound is not that good. It's an audience recording from the 'Aqua' tour recorded during the first leg of that tour and one of the first shows with John Payne as lead singer. The performances are good, especially on \\"Who Will Stop the Rain\\" and \\"A Far Cry\\". But the sound of the recording is not that good, making this album just for completists and hardcore fans of this band (like myself). Of the three official bootlegs in this series, the better sounding (and your best purchase) is the 'Live in Philadelphia', also from the 'Aqua' tour. And if you need a concert recording from the 'Aria' tour then 'Live in Koln' is the only known concert and the recording is passable.

After all, that's how the book is marketed. I found that it is only loosely tied to math concepts and it was the same concept repeated with each fable. There are a number of animals working on a project and a subset of the group works on one portion of the project and a subset work on another part until the project is complete. The only change is the numbers used in each project. I also wasn't anticipating interwoven religious concepts and that was frustrating as this is not marketed as such.

The Janick Gers (of Iron Maiden) cowritten song with Fish song \\"View from the HIll\\" is top notch. Actually, all the songs here are terrific. If you like Fish or a great voice with equal lyrics, then this is the album for you. I don't know why he went away so much from this style, but he did and has really disappointed me.

Over the years, he has successfully managed to mature artistically without losing his legendary youthful exuberance. On Suicaine, he clearly displays that he has mastered the craft of songwriting, leaving contemporaries in the dust. The album opens with a song that is absolute essential Westerberg, \\"It's A Wonderful Lie.\\" After one full listen to Suicaine, you can't help but notice that his vocal range has grown over the years, as well. Other notable tracks include \\"The Best Thing That Never Happened\\", \\"Looking Out Forever\\" and \\"Self-Defense,\\" which may be Westerberg's most excellent departure ever.

Mixing \\"New Age\\", \\"Oriental\\" and a \\"Mid East\\" feel into one disc shows her range as a progressive artist not a pop artist for the 00\\"s. \\"Anything\\" is a fine Progressive/Rock track and \\"The Longing\\" is an excellant \\"New Age\\" instrumental track.

This album has no such parts.

Took place on September 23, 1967 at the semi-famed Middle Earth Club. Reason I'm giving this CD a two-star rating is because of it's poor sound quality, YET most of the lyrics here are somewhat understandable.

Yo tengo este disco tanto en LP como en CD y es excelente pero no esta disponible aqui en Amazon lamentablemente. Recientemente hable por e-mail con el que era manager del grupo el señor Stephen Campell y el me comfirmo la informacion que les estoy dando. Este Raw se trata de otro grupo al parecer tambien llamado white tiger pero que no tiene que ver nada con Mark st.

Robert Keck integrates his revealing life and health experiences with his very important research into the emerging deep value trends of Epoch III as it relates to health and healing. In \\"Healing As A Sacred Path\\", Bob Keck truly shows the possibilities that lie in walking our talk. The honesty in his personal journey combined with the possibilities of healing by walking a sacred path once again give hope to those budding Epoch III values with which I can identify.The brilliance of defining wellness as \\"the balance of being and becoming\\" feels comforting while simultaneously challenges me to be me. In addition, \\"Healing As A Sacred Path\\" challenges us to consider who we put in charge of our health care. In the end, I recognize how Keck exemplifies the courage of taking back one's own innate power and wisdom to restore personal health."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"We bought this to use for scanning ISBN bar codes on books--what a disappointment!

This book was such an inspiration to me! \\"The Good Life\\" has made me yearn even more for a healthier, and fruitful lifestyle. I'm thankful that Helen & Scott were such generous people and willing to share their experiences and knoweldge. I only wish that I had the opportunity to meet these beautiful souls and share a few days labor, meal and conversation with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book helped change my life","review":"These books have inspired me to start my own farm and live a life of simplicity and hard work. I share some of the strong principals that Scott and Helen Nearing had. I only wish I had their courage.Once you have read their books do some research on Scott and Helen then you will learn why they were the way they were. Scott was a real Pain in the *** to a lot of folks prior to the great depression. His ideas on child labor were way ahead of his time. Helen was his soul mate and partner and a darn good writer in her own right.They both lived long lives Scott 100, Helen 91 she was killed in an auto accident. With their strong beliefs and not always endearing manners they weren't always appreciated by their neighbors and friends.However, they were right about so many things and inspired so many people they became cult heros during the sixties and beyond. These books are about them as much as about their farm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a how-to book","review":"I was very interested in reading about a couple who took the plunge and homesteaded. I found the references to why they moved to the homestead interesting, but unfortunately, the rest of the book is interweaved with this philosophy as well as social issues. The practical is overshadowed or not explained in detail. The detail that is there focuses on what they did not how they did it. If you are looking for a how-to book, you should look elsewhere. I did find the section on health interesting and helpful. Also, the second section, \\"Continuing the Good Life\\" had some practical ideas on gardening. Overall the book was a disappointment, since I expected a how-to book not a philosophy book."},{"rating":"2","title":"...","review":"This is a very good, mellow, drum and bass cd...I bought this when it came out in 1997 or so; just got around to reviewing it now (sue me)...There is nothing real physically heavy or techo-driven here (like Dieselboy or Dara?); it's all pretty laid back..which is cool.

It's my second SM7b and the 8th one for our radio station. I've been using them for 13 years now with complete satisfaction. It is perfect for any type of voice so if you using it for on-air broadcasting, a podcast or for voiceovers it is perfect. The internal air suspension is great and there is no need for a pop guard as the foam pop-shield that comes standard works like a dream. Knowing that this model was used for Michael Jackson's vocals on his Thriller album is an added confirmation that this is a superb microphone. The shielding on this microphone is also topnotch. Overall this microphone will outperform some microphones in the $2000 category.I will continue using this type of microphone far into the future. If you are not sure about what mic to buy then order an SM7B for peace of mind and quality recording.Listen to some radio programmes recorded using this mic.

And if you don't have a partner to help in stretching(which I do not), you may as well cut out half of those stretches. There is a few good stretches in here, but most I already knew.

It's typical big corporate produced music, not creative or original in the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"I really wanted to like this album. Hearing Hamilton on the nappy roots album made me excited about making this purchase. Hamilton's voice reminds me of Charlie Wilson (though nowhere near as seasoned). The problem with this disc is not vocal ability, it's good song writing that this cd is lacking. Maybe if he gets a chance for a sophmore effort, JD will spend the money on some good writers and producers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped","review":"I bought this CD mainly from the other reviews here on this page and pre-release press hype. That's why I was compelled to write my own review to offer a dissenting view. While Mr. Hamilton has talent and surely shows promise this record leaves a lot to be desired. His vocals are killer but the songs are filler and the production, which Jermaine Dupree puts his name on as Executive Producer, is truly horrible. It sounds like it was recorded and mixed in a basement and the mastering didn't help either. Harsh frequencies abound and some mixes sound thrown together in haste. Possibly this album was done in a project studio and simply put out without the benefit of another set of ears. I will look forward to his next album to see how he's grown but I sure wish the record label put a little more time into this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Darrius Rucker Meets Tracy Chapman","review":"Anthony Hamilton has that Woodsy Vibe going for Him.I like the Presentation but I can only vibe with it for so long.Lyrically He is Challenging in places&Vocally He can make His point.but the songs on a whole while having Moments don't quite add up to what He is Bringing thus far.the next album will be the make or break for Him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent cd - A MUST buy","review":"Excellent cd.

I'll admit, I was intially turned off by Mr. Hamilton's aesthetics, therefore I never payed him or his first video much attention. But lately I've been hungering for much more musicically so I bought 5 new cds from some \\"less well know\\" artists. Mr. Hamilton really stands out!

If you remember Alexander Oneal from the 80's, then you'll feel Anthony's voice, if you liked the soul that Otis brought to the table, then you'll feel Anthony's vibe. If you don't like this CD, then you really should see a DR."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS OF THE YEAR!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This cd is DOPE!!!! From top to bottom, front to back, it's flawless! His voice sounds like he is like 60 years old and has lived three times that. From his Nappy Roots feature to his own single \\"Comin'...From\\", he is definently one of the most talented and soulful singers out today. He isn't exactly the most marketable appearance wise, but that's what makes him great. He has one song \\"Charlene\\" and it sounds like the girl just \\"ripped\\" his heart right out of his chest or something and usually singers will try to be cool and sing lines like \\"I messed up but what will be will be\\", but Anthony is literally begging her to give him another chance and not in a sappy Keith Sweat way. Either way, my point is Anthony Hamilton has a solid album hands down and I'm not even a big R&B fan and I'm waiving the banner. *Also, the other BEST ALBUM is Calvin Richardson's 2:35PM*"},{"rating":"1","title":"CD doesn't work in all players","review":"I was excited to get this new CD yesterday, but I struck a problem the moment I got to my car. My car CD player spat out the CD immediately and refused to play it. When I got home I found I couldn't load the songs onto my MP3 player either. The only thing in my whole house that would play this CD was an old boombox. If you look at the fine print on the back of the CD, they have done something to this CD and it only works with certain types of CD players!!I don't know what an up and coming R&B artist like Anthony was thinking when he allowed this to be done to his new CD. I will be sending it back tomorrow because in my opinion it's faulty!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An OK Disc - copy protection is BS!!!","review":"I purchased this album and found it to be perfectly OK. It's not a stunner, but it's good enough to listen to. Unfortunately, the copy protection makes it unusable on my home media system and too difficult to bother with for making discs for the car or my portable. Too bad for the artist - a little file sharing might actually get him the exposure he needs. As an aside, I've returned the disk to Arista to ask for a refund because the media and copy protection keeps this disk from being useful for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Soul has been Touched by God","review":"I just bought this album yesterday and am listening to it now! I can't get past track 10 \\"My First Love!\\" The minute I opened it, I forwarded to that track, 'cause I had a feeling it would be hot! I fell in love with this man's sound when I first heard him on the Orlando Jones show. Just recently he performed \\"Change is Gonna Come\\" on the BET Gospel Celebration and it brought tears to my eyes. This man sings like he's been through some things. His pain oozes from his heart and soul through his voice. I can't really rate the album 'cause I haven't listened to the whole thing yet...but I'm sure it's the bomb!

At one while I had some concerns about the music being released today. Alot of it isn't what I would actually call music, not to mention, the singing (NOT !). It is as if GOD was answering my prayers when Anthony Hamilton's cd was released. This cd is off the hook. Literally. There isn't one song on this cd I can bad mouth. Each song sends a message and also put thoughts in your mind about your life. My favorits are\\"\\"Coming From Where I'm From\\"\\"Charlene\\"\\"Since I Seen't You\\"\\"Cornbread Fish and Collard Greens\\"\\". As I write the songs I feel are my faves, I realize, I could go on. It's been a looooooooong time coming for some one of this man's talent and style to hit the airwaves again. Very soulful and touching. His voice, I can't explain it. Just trust me, get the cd.

This isnt a bad thing, when i first put this on and heard the flow of this guys voice, i was taken back to the first time i heard jaheim, that smooth soulful voice and the \\"kick back & relax\\" beats that are fluent throughout the album . My verdict is go get this album definately one for the summer and definately one for fans of funky old school flow"},{"rating":"2","title":"At last a male vocalist with voice","review":"This album for me was refreshing. Finally a male vocalist with talent and originality. I think so many people think that if a male vocalist doesn't sound like Stevie, Michael or Donnie he can't sing but Anthony proves that wrong. Like Andre3000, this guy has the guts to buck the system and be himself. The duet with Latoiya Williams should be released as a single because it is hot. Good writing and instrumentals with the had bobbing beats to match. This album goes best with a 7&7 (smile)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Anthony Hamilton!!!

I wasn't immediately feeling \\"Coming from where I'm from\\" or the acoustic version of \\"Cornbread, Fish and Collard Greens\\" that VH1 Soul played every day. So, I simply wrote this artist off. I stand corrected. \\"Charlene\\" played on the radio one day and I budged a little, but when a friend played \\"Since I Seen't You\\" for me I was moved! I'm feeling every track on here except \\"Chyna Black\\"- I don't know where he was going with that one.

How much did Mr. Hamilton pay you to write a good review of this crap? I bought the CD based on the first 50 reviews I read and I AM SO DISAPPOINTED!! When I heard, \\"I'm a Pimp, I'm a Pimp\\" in the middle of the cornbread song I couldn't believe my ears. Then later, in \\"Lucille\\" he sings \\"I didn't mean to hit you\\" or something to that effect. It's very low and subtle, but it's there.

Why bother?Incidentally, if you buy this and the place you buy it from says that it's a \\"Compact Disc\\", return it.

My favorite track is Charlene. He reminds me of the leader singer of the Gap Band. His voice is pure, rough, soulful. I wouldn't let him take the CD out of the player. My CD player consists of Alicia Keys, Anthony Hamilton, Jahiem, and Usher. He is phenomenol.

His song writing is some of the best I have ever heard, and his singing has true emotion and feeling, not to mention his guitar playing. If you get the chance, don't pass up seeing this guy live, he is one of the best in my opinion! Pick up this CD, you won't be disappointed. A HUGE FAN!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant","review":"very few people have a mastery of the true country style anymore, robbie fulks is one of them. if there is any justice in this world, he will go down with the greats (johnny cash, hank williams, steve earle...) what more needs to be said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item was not as represented","review":"I chose this item partially because of the on board duster. The vacuum works well but did not have the on board duster. The number on the box matches the model number, but it is a different item than pictured and described."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great machine!","review":"This vacuum sounds like a jet engine when you turn it on. We have a Black Lab and he's shedding like crazy this summer, so we really needed something that worked well. It does a great job and you can see all the dust/dirt that gets vacuumed up as well when you're emptying the canister. We're definitely happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give a negative 5 stars if I could","review":"This is THE WORST, most high maintenance, poor quality, constantly clogged and messy excuse for a vacuum that I have had the misfortune to own. I've been more happy with the $50 vacuums from Walmart than with this piece of garbage. The duster attachment stopped working after being used one time, the hose always manages to get stopped up right where it should enter the dirt bin and proceeds to fill up through the hose before we even know what's going on. What a nasty mess to clean up! Micro-fine dust and junk I've just sucked up are NOT what I want to be getting all over my hands and in my breathing space. Then the filter gets clogged so quickly that it needs to be cleaned out after each use. Give me a vacuum with a bag any day! I'd much rather throw out all the crud in a bag than to have to deal with the plume of who-knows-what that flies around when trying to clean it out. We bought ours new, not refurbished, so there is no excuse."},{"rating":"1","title":"On off switch broke!","review":"Beware! On off switch broke machine would not cut off unless unplugged. The place they recommended based on my zip code still has my vacuum and it's been about 2 weeks. :-("},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Vacuum that works well","review":"A few scratches on the wheels and here and there but looks new overall. It works like new. Probably not a perfect vacuum but works well. Parts are available if you need them. Not a top of the line but neither is the price at $60-$70 with free shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for 5 minutes!","review":"Heavy machine, looked durable, almost commercial. Put her together and began. Within 5 MINUTES of use the belt for the rotating brush burned up and the brush no longer rotated!

Why?","review":"This book is something I was excited about......till I opened it up and started to read it. There is no reading it. For $2.95 I could have bought a magazine and got the same effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much ado about Photos","review":"I guess I must have read a description of the contents and completely misunderstood what this book can offer the reader. I'm not sure why anyone would want to \\"write\\" (That's a generous verb) a book about the junk they have purchased and take pictures for all to see. There is very little written content, lots of pictures and, generally, of no conceivable use to anyone. I had thought the book would track \\"junk\\" purchased and then fixed up, painted, decorated with plants, etc and then used cleverly in the garden. Wrong, wrong, wrong! It is nothing more a collection of pictures of the \\"junk\\" purchased and a few comments about each picture of the \\"junk\\" . Extremely disappointing and, for my money, will become JUNK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty pictures but no substance","review":"I must agree with \\"npowers\\" of Vermont: I, too, was expecting at least a little more prose and some helpful advice on acquiring desirable garden junk, but alas, I was disappointed. The photos are great and perhaps this would make a good coffee table book but buyer beware if you want substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garden Junk Book","review":"This is a really cool book. I like the way she describes where she bought the items and how she displays them at her home. Gives alot of examples too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent handlebar wrap, but not cushy.","review":"The Fizik is excellent handlebar wrap. It gives a more responsive feel to the bike and lasts a long time. Just know that the responsiveness means less \\"cushy\\" or padded feel. The tape does a good job of vibration absorption."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Tape but not what I ordered","review":"Overall, this is really good handlebar tape, but it's getting 2 stars because it's not exactly as advertised...The main problem I had with this is it was not what I ordered, specifically the color. On the order page, I chose \\"black\\" as the color, expecting it to look like in the picture. What they sent me was \\"soft black with white logo.\\" The tape is black with the \\"Fizik\\" logo printed in white all long the edges of the sides, which I think looks really tacky. I didn't bother returning it because it functions well enough and I really needed the tape due to me having already taken off the old foam I had on my handlebars. But if I order black on the product page and get sent soft touch with fizik logo then I'm not going to be happy. It looks stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tape, imperfect quality control","review":"I've wrapped several bars with this tape. It has a great feel, a bit of cushion (less than cork but more than cloth) and looks nice. I've always had way more than enough length, even on fairly wide bars. Those who complain about length must wrap with a pretty serious overlap, or perhaps the length varies from roll to roll. I did have one package (sid blue) that tore along the edge repeatedly when I wrapped with it, no matter how little I pulled the tape. I returned it and received a new one which was fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite bar tape but...","review":"After using many different brands of bartape I have settled on the Fizik as my favorite. Its easy to wrap, doesn't tear easy, cleans up quick and last for a long time. The only down sie is if you usually ride with softer tape this tape might be a little rough on your hands at first. It can also get a little slick if you're riding bare handed and sweat a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tape, great feel","review":"I really like this bar tape (the regular one, not soft touch). It's smooth like cloth but not slippery, and it looks great. Installation was simple and easy, and it is easy to put a lot of tension in the tape without ripping it; much better in terms of this than cork tape, which I have to be more careful with.However, this tape does basically nothing for padding. The thing is, I like this, so I'm not going to penalize fizik for that. I came from riding with shellac-ed cotton tape, which has about the same amount of padding. If you like lots of padding, then I would probably not use fizik tape unless you buy the gel inserts for underneath the tape. Otherwise, I like the lack of padding and thinner tape - my hands and arms are fine.Can't say much about replacement, though - I don't intend on replacing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to remove.","review":"The tape looks great, but if you've had it on for any considerable amount of time and want to replace it, plan on spending 3 or 4 hours removing it. The adhesive causes the small amount of padding to separate from the tape, sticking to your bars. The gooey residue resists solvents. To avoid scratching your bars you will not use a file, but will use your fingernails for a good hour-and-a-half. That's the left side. Another hour-and-a-half on the right side. Then you'll spend another hour (or perhaps days) returning the new tape and exchanging it for a different brand because you will never want to go through that again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product pictures are not at all accurate","review":"Unless you like advertising for fizik 100 times on your bar, this bar tape is not for you. The pictures fail to convey that the tape has fizik fizik fizik fizik fizik fizik fizik fizik fizik fizik fizik fizik written all along the sides. Ugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply good tape","review":"It is one of the most attractive bar tapes. If you wear gloves, bar tape doesn't need to have much texture. Once you get the proper wrapping technique down Fizik tape stretches well and lays flat. It is as durable as most tapes I have used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it....","review":"This is the one of the poorest excuses for bar tape I may have ever used.When you do get it to lay flat it looks nice. But dealing with backing tape that won't pull off cleanly, tape that is REAL work to wrap so it lays flat. Bare minimum length; just enough to get the bar covered. No stretch whatsoever. Installing it over their own gel? Adds considerable frustration and difficulty.Surface is a little smooth and in the rain....be careful.So inferior to so many other tapes. Cannot believe it's a product from this company. If they're trying to make a tape that's cheaper than real leather, they missed.I'll rate an excellent product and provide positive feedback when it's called for. Middle of the road - maybe, maybe not. But when something is so poor and so inferior I can't hold in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I've been installing bar tape for over 25 years and I've never had the tape tear before. This tape (Fizik) tears very easily. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rips easily on installation","review":"I bought this tape for my wife's bike yesterday because she liked the yellow color. I very nearly bought some for myself because of the more durable 'vinyl' feel to it. The bar tape ripped along the edges in countless spots. I was discouraged that I had just wasted 18 dollars on a product that was crap, but finished the job so my wife could still use her bike in the meantime. I am a discerning cyclist, and admittedly picky about how my bike looks and feels. I think the Fizik Microtex tape is downright acceptable. It might work for a straight bar, but not for drop bars with curves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not buying again","review":"Had only 4 wks......poss. washed 2x (and hung dry) and underwire is coming out of side and poking me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"Very uncomfortable because the wires were longer than the cup. Left marks each time I wore it so it has been replaced. Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"These are a nice shape and size, and the handles catch drips. But they have a major design flaw--the part of the stick that is frozen into the pop is too small, narrow, and smooth, so when you try to pull your pops out, the handle comes out and the pop stays in. I had to semi-melt the pops under hot water and use a flat spatula to pry the pops out of the base. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Waste of Money!","review":"These were horrible! I needed more molds bought these and they were impossible to use! Had to use a butter knife to remove and the \\"stick\\" part still came out of the pop! Sometimes it is not worth saving a penny or two. I do not recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"$3.00 at Target and ice pops just won't come out","review":"I almost ordered several of these last night, just forgot to checkout. And today I ran into these exact molds at the Target store, their price is $3.49. They are nice basic molds, but definitely not worth $7Update:And it is nearly impossible to remove the ice pops from these molds. I would change rating to 1 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top notch performer","review":"Jimmy was with the Stater Brothers for 21 years and when the group retired, he continued on his own. This CD is Jimmy's first release as a solo artist. It contains 3 of his #1 hits that he wrote and performed with the Statler Brothers as well as new ones.I believe that Jimmy's voice is one of the best in the business. His music appeals to all age groups and I believe that you will not be disappointed in any way in this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another biased review","review":"I am a patient of Dr. Moore and he truly is delightful. He is all that a good doctor should be and more...(no pun intended). His book is a pure joy to read - you will be thoroughly entertained. There are not enough adjectives in Roget's thesaurus to describe how much I enjoyed reading this book. I hope he writes another one...soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it what it claims to be?","review":"Considerable (and maybe correct) research on history of physics which collects huge amount of (somehow) arbitrary selected citations.Ball unfortunately does not go further than cite, repeat himself and draw mostly tautological conclusions. Not to mention his chaotic presentation of basic physics with no clear link to the murky ideas presented.This book had no value for me. Too bad I have spent time getting through it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Popular science at its best","review":"Books about complexity and self-organization might be a dime a dozen, but this book by Philip Ball is unique. Underneath its popular style is a serious analysis of the science that underlies the concepts of complexity and collective dynamic phenomena. The analysis of specific examples of self-organizing systems (e.g., traffic models) is quite professional, with good referencing of the original literature. At the same time, the writing is clear and understandable to a non-specialist, and the examples given in the book will stimulate the interest of most readers. Another strength of this book is its historical approach; the author shows how the dynamic concepts evolved from 19-th century thermodynamics, to non-equilibrium thermodynamics, to the science of non-integrable dynamic systems. I really enjoyed reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fields of Electronics","review":"I really wanted to like this book. Truly. But it fails. Miserably. It does not represent a comprehensive approach to circuit and field theory. What I mean by this is that there is absolutely no method or application of field theory that provides insight into the quantitative design requirements of electronics to be found here. There is some solid construction advice concerning shielding and grounding, but this is probably better covered in the author's previous works. The numerous mistakes, not just typos, should have been caught in editing. The \\"fields\\" of schematic circuits... I wish they were laughable.The graphics are not even good enough to make this pass as a good con job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for younger toddlers","review":"I agree with the other reviewer that the range is more limited, but I've seen 2 at work, and they both had a range of about 12-20 feet. More than enough for a toddler of 18 months or more. The remote is simple and easy to use, and yet moves the cars in 4 directions (my son is 17 months and figured out the remote right away) We have fun stacking cardboard blocks on it and running it back & forth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this book listed under \\"Ted Bundy\\"?","review":"I checked out this book because it was included with a list of books about Theodore Robert Bundy. Then I read the customer reviews on this site, and I discovered it's a novel. Given that none of the reviewers so much as mentioned Bundy, if you're looking for more recent books about Bundy,the real-life serial killer,this is not the book you want. It may be a perfectly good novel, but there doesn't seem to be any reference to Bundy in it. I don't know why it turned up in a specific search for Theodore Robert Bundy.I gave the book only one star because it was listed as a reference to Bundy. The one star has nothing to do with the novel itself; I haven't read it. I would have preferred to omit a rating altogether, but that's not an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I got to around page 100 and they still had no leads. Not a hint.

Not truly iridescent or sheer but a nice lightweight fabric. 18\\" length makes it perfect for a bed that is high off the floor.

Cartoonish characters, bad acting, horrible writing, over-the-top violence, a story line that is absurd, need I continue. There is nothing redeeming about this waste of 131 minutes. When I see names like Oliver Stone and Salma Hayek I should know better than to waste hard earned money."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it","review":"I loved the action and especially Taylor Kirsh and Blake Lively. I watch all Oliver Stone movies and allthough I dont necessarly believe in his politics, I love his movies. This one was right up there with Natural Born Killers. It is well worth the rental price. It is not a movie for children at all as there is strong sexuality, drug use and heavy violence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a look","review":"Fast paced and well shot, Del Toro is perfect as the menacing villain. Shows off the California coast and baja as well. Entertaining!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty much a film I'll never remember","review":"This is one of those films you see and then promptly forget. Not only does the casting of Blake Lively ruin any hope for watchability (with a grating narration from her throughout), most if not all of the other cartoon characters in it are laughable and/or pitiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good action and story","review":"Good story, loved the ending.

It had potential, I thought it would be an incendiantary tale, with mile a minute visuals as Stone crafts in his films. The actors were the cream of the acting crop, but their roles and the whole thing was just so lame. When this movie ended, I felt like \\"is that all there is?\\" A true stinkeroo. I wish I could get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think savages may have made this movie.","review":"I was shocked how bad this was. I mean really bad. Do not waste your time. You can guess what happens from the trailer, so save yourself about 2 hours!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries to hard to be hip...","review":"Think of pulp fiction, less than zero, swordfish, and Beach all mixed together into one. Trying to compete with anyone of those great films (OK swordfish was not great) is a giant risk, but trying to be all of them is, well, not really doable. Now the movie itself. cliche, predictable and unauthentic. The film puts too much weight on the characters and they all become larger than life, with a modern cutesiness that makes you cringe. The idea that these heartless murderers are quirky and likeable just like me and you is deeply flawed and it doesn't work on screen. Finally the narration by the girl throughout starts off well, but as you get to know her character on screen, her narrative doesn't match her personality at all. It becomes annoying to hear her voice after a while.There are beautiful people, soft porn moments, and some funny lines and situations, that make it bareable to watch, but this is no classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb blonde goes shopping and gets shop-lifted","review":"An inane plot about unlikable characters with a few moments worth watching: birds flying and waves dancing.

I did not enjoy watching the movie as there was too much pixelation.I have no problem when I watch movies on Netflix on the same tv.
