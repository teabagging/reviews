The answers that you seek will be given by study of the Word and prayer. The KJV itself ultimately proves it's superiority to those that take the time to study and cherish it.There are no shortcuts.

White defends one very popular Bible version that replaces the word \\"Lucifer\\" with name of Jesus. Effectively making Jesus, not Lucifer, fall from heaven in Isaiah 14. So do you believe Lucifer (everyone knows who Lucifer is, even satanists) fell from heaven or Jesus as White does?The King James is trustworthy having been used for 400 years. New Bible versions are copyrighted and can only be printed by the certain publisher. Anyone in the USA can print the KJV even me.

His statements lapse far too freqently into emotionally-charged harangues belittling his opponents (attacks on their intelligence, guilt by association, etc.). Very infreqently did he seem to endeavor to comprehend their viewpoint. Regardless of whether I agree with his view, this alone is enough to render his conclusions suspect. In failing to crawl outside of his own paradigm -- even for a moment -- White has created not a text which refutes KJV-Onlyism but a slim justification for his own opinions (which are sometimes unfounded). Better books already exist on the topic, so don't purchase this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Facts....?","review":"Upon reading this book, I thought, \\"How can any King James Only person stand in light of his arguments?\\" So, I went in and tried debating with a staunch Ruckmanite and... I lost. It seems as though many of the \\"facts\\" that James presents were too great, because I was caught off guard several times, especially concerning 1 Peter 1:1 & 1 Peter 1:11, where I found out that the King James' Text is actually different that what James White quoted. The Johnannine Comma for the KJO group is a hard one for them, but apart from that, I am almost convinced that \\"monogenes theos\\" in the modern translations has some influence to Gnosticism now, because of lack of evidence on White's part. Beware, and make sure what you use out of his book is accurate-- or you, too, will be caught off guard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Want To Know The Truth?","review":"If you want to know the truth about the King James Only Controversy, start here.

Thanks for a job well done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Argued","review":"The book claims to be a refutation of those who believe the King James Bible is the only English Bible properly translated from the proper texts. Instead he erects straw man arguments and knocks them down. Only the intellectually weak will be influenced by such a poor work. An online demonstration of his faulty reasoning can be found at: http://wayoflife.org/fbns/examining01.htm; Perhaps White should have read Revision Revised by Burgon or the actual writings of Westcott and Hort. Apparently research is not of interest to him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revelation ch22v18-19","review":"This book was junk. It is easily pick apart by anyone that knows there bible. Mark Sommer(reviewer) is for any book that helps satan with his deception. I recommend \\"New Age Bible Versions,\\" by G. Riplinger. Many gross misinterpretations between the KJV and the new age versions are pointed out. Here is one example the NIV refers to satan as the Morningstar. The KJV refers to Jesus as the Morningstar. Jesus is the Morningstar. The devil wants to decieve you. Check for yourself don't take someones opinion on it.

Dr. James White does an amazing and thorough job assessing their views and completely dismantling them in short order. In fact, Dr. White has done SUCH a good job at destroying the KJVO arguments that not one KJVO promoter will dare debate him. They all run away or, at worst, use some of the most ungodly and corrupt language to describe him.

He attacks passages those who believe in biblical preservation use, but offers none to support his view. Certainly, his belief in inspiration is supported with Scripture. As would be his belief in biblical inerrancy. But when it comes to biblical transmission, no passage is provided.

Filled with half truths and outright lies, this book successfully convinces only people who have done no reasearch of their own that versions like the NIV and NASV are reliable and that the KJV is not.

Another writer said that James SHOULD name his book, \\"Ruckman/Riplinger Controversy.\\" I read this book and found James' spurious comments in his book. James is a Calvinist himself. He refuted Ruckman, Riplinger and other KJV onlyists concerning their belief upon the KJV only. He is wrong to refute them concerning the KJV superiority.

Considering the huge financial savings possible by implementing these tips, the book is a bargain. But considering what's at stake, the financial savings are irrelevant.

They eventually merged, but not in 1630. The main group of the Massachusetts Bay Colony didn't even arrive until 1630 when this story supposedly takes place. The logistics are also bad. I find it unbelievable that two men from the Blue Ridge in Carolina (can't find any history of white men on the Blue Ridge in 1630) could have been found and have made their way to Massachusetts overland to help rescue kidnap victims.

Maybe because it is a part of the world I never knew, who knows. No one who has any kind of adventurous spirit could dislike this book. It has everything, the wild Appalachian Mountains to the open seas and tropical ports full of pirates and swordsmen. Barnabas may be my favorite Sackett and Kin Ring is definitely a fitting son.

Now Capra is not the most subtle of directors but he is really wearing his sentiments on his sleeve here. Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck are fine here but not outstanding. Walter Brennan is, well, Walter Brennan. The presence of Edward Arnold as the newspaper magnate with political ambitions telegraphs the ominous direction the film's story is going to go. I kept thinking that what if an actor with a little more subtlety who doesn't wear the black hat so prominently was cast instead, like say, Claude Rains. I also thought to myself while watching this how the Coen brothers were influenced to some degree by Capra in films like \\"The Hudsucker Proxy\\" or \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\\". This is a good film but not one of Capra's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Film's a Five the Print's a Two","review":"This is my favorite Capra film.

The poor quality DVD that I bought has a cover that looked like this: [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Quality DVD","review":"Love the movie, but the quality of the DVD put out by Alpha Video was so bad it was very difficult to watch. The sound was scratchy and muffled and the picture looked as if the brightness was turned all the way up. If you don't want to be disappointed and feel like you've been ripped off, wait for the remastered cut before you buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality DVD, but like the movie!","review":"I expected a lot more in quality in this DVD after reading the Amazon description. Picture dark (had to turn contrast and brightness way up to watch), sound not level (had to turn up and down during movie), lines on picture like in an old film (which could be made better nowadays). I taped this from the TV once and it turned out much better (brighter, hardly any lines in picture, better sound).Like the movie though. Someone has to make a better version of this. I would like to see a color version with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"an eye-opening introduction to perfect society","review":"Considered as the most famous philosophy book of all times, it indeed is a true masterpiece. However, readers are not to be mistaken by Plato\`s ideal but drastic measures to strenghen and protect the polis, since every era has its means and ways.Besides, the allegory of the cave remains the best philosophical metaphore ever, as every single day some people embody those who only see the shadows;this is especially true when you are a foreigner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has great insight for philosophy but...","review":"Tends to be very circular in reasoning. I had a hard time understanding most of what was being said. I believe that there are better books in the PHIL department.You decide"},{"rating":"2","title":"Monumental - Excellent for first-time readers of philosophy!","review":"One of the most reknowned books of all time, The Republicis a transcription, by Plato, of Socrates dialogues.Socrates shows the epitomy of brialliance by philosophizingon a level that first time readers of philosophy can understand,yet arguing so brilliantly that he is still studied by thehighest level of intelectuals. A MUST READ for anyonewho is interested in broadening their horizons!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great- from a students perspective","review":"I read this book in conjunction with Utopia for my Senior Thesis and was expecting it to be very difficult. Thank god it wasn't. Through dialogue, Socrates proves many interesting philosophical ideas that are easy enough to understand by most high school students yet complex enough to have entire college courses dedicated to their study. It seems to me that there are few books written that have had such profound impact on their field. Plato's Repulic is the defining book on the philosophical field, and is the beginnings for all Utopian literature. Any student or avid reader who is interested in understanding where modern thought started should read The Republic before anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest of the Socratic Dialogues","review":"To disagree with \\"seth,\\" this is one of the best translations of Plato's greatest work I have ever read. The Penguin Classics translations make the works accessible to the modern reader because at the time they were written they were accessible to the average educated person. Plato did not write his \\"Republic\\" in an obscure, confusing style, and it should certainly not be read in a translation of that type. Of course, to be ultimately truthful, one should always read the original. As most cannot do that, I suggest taking an easy-to-read prose translation of all the great works, which the Penguin Classics series provides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Preferred translation","review":"I looked at the Penguin translation and the Bloom translation. I prefer this one because it is more concise. The Kindle version is good: hyperlinked footnotes are useful, but it could use page numbering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dialogue","review":"The dialogue in the book provides an excellent forum for introspection into one's own political and moralistic values. A great read that keeps you thinking..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something every person of society should read","review":"If you are a member of POST 'personal property' you should read this book as a beginning of opening your eyes to the real world. It should be mixed with the introduction of \\"Sophies World\\" by Jostein Gaarder to open the \\"common\\" person's eyes to reality to see why our pety existence is so un-important to the real picture of 'mother nature' and will open one's mind to knowledge and appreciation of history and science."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falsification of History","review":"The book is a very sad example how an author can misinterpret historical facts. It is unique in a sense that it was written by a non-Romanian (?) but still author's view is perfectly matching with the nationalistic view of the Romanian historians. The book plays a close attention how the Hungarian repressed the Romanians in the middle age, although nationalism did not existed until the french revolution (XIX century). Beside that between the fifteenth and the early nineteenth centuries Transylvania was ruled by either the Ottoman or by the Hasburgs indirectly.The book almost disregards the Saxons (German ethnic group) who played also an important role in history of Transylvania, but after the second world war they were fully expelled from the country. Since such a fact can be quite awkward for Romanians they simply disregard them from history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ceasescu propanganda","review":"This book is completely misnamed, as it reflects neither history nor reality. It is less a Romanian viewpoint than an anti-Hungarian viewpoint. According to the thesis of this book Hungarians existed only to torture Romanians. Apparently the author only used information fabricated by the Ceasescu regime and its minions to expel Hungarian-Transylvanians. This book is neither well balanced nor well researched, and should not be considered a valid scholastic work. For a book on Transylvania actually worth reading try \\"The Nationalities Problem in Transylvania 1867-1940\\" by Sandor Biro."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a review, but a question.","review":"Why is there a picture of the classic Aviator debut from 1979 on this page, when ALL the reviews are clearly referring to a completely different band? Were the reviews here before the picture? How or why would someone add a picture from an unrelated artist to what was obviously a review page for a different band? I don't know the band that these reviewers are referring to, but they're obviously fans who enjoyed the album. The album that is pictured is the original Aviator, which was a spin-off from Manfred Mann's Earth Band. It featured ex-MMEB vocalist/guitarist Mick Rogers and ex-Jethro Tull drummer Clive Bunker. This page could certainly confuse people, because I almost ordered a CD here thinking it was the Aviator with Mick Rogers. Thankfully I read the reviews first!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classy and comfortable","review":"The wonderful size and coloring of this ring, makes it dressy enough to wear out, but it is comfortable enough to sleep in. I was impressed by the high quality of this piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Knives","review":"These knives appear to be of excellent quality. They have an excellent finish on all surfaces. Grinding marks are almost invisible. I have several sets of various brands that are 30 to 40 years old ( back when quality was important) and these look much better. It's cheaper to buy new knives than to sharpen old ones and the quality of the sharpening is far from satisfactory. The only negative feature on the Freud blades is the burr left from sharpening. It will be an easy task to hone these which I expected I'd have to do when I ordered them. I'm sure they will perform as good as they look. I'm very pleased with these and highly recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Will Survive After Death","review":"Hello,This was the first time I've ever ordered anything from Amazon. I ordered this book for my friend who has been anxious to read it for awhile. She is VERY disappointed with the extra small print, the possible missing pages, and the \\"cheapness\\" of the entire book. We noticed that it was printed right after I ordered it. I doubt if I will order another product from Amazon. There should NEVER be missing pages in a book no matter what. And WHY couldn't the print be larger??Barbara Stilp"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rate it 0 if I could!","review":"This book has less than a handful of pages of information followed by pages and pages of his personal lab results and blank diaries. The author is self absorbed, self serving and condesending. For someone who lives in the REAL world with a REAL LIFE including a spouse, career, and children and actual long term documented thyroid disease this book is less than worthless. A low or non-functioning thyroid needs replacement therapy, not green algae for heaven's sakes! Check out other books which explain differences in replacement therapies and syptomactic treatments if you really want to feel better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"my hashimoto's was reversed not because of this book","review":"I read about a gluten free diet and hashimotos' and i tried it for 2 months.

Poorly written and researched no deeper than a few fad diet books and some heresay, the content of the paultry 42 pages of text could be summarized in a line or two, such as \\"Take garlic and some digestive enzymes and exercise, but not too much.\\" My guess is the author's disease went into remission, not that this seat-of-your pants style of self-medicating was a cure-all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't write any more books!","review":"This read like a book report from a 5th grader. No new real information, things you can find in any nutritionally oriented book. It's a vague story about what supposedly worked for this guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honesto e inspirador","review":"Definitivamente recomiendo este libro, ya que aporta información muy importante desde el punto de vista de los pacientes, con muchos tips y recomendaciones para quienes vivimos una situación similar.Felicito al autor por su sinceridad y honestidad al tratar el tema. Hubiera querido que se incluyeran más explicaciones sobre el método de nutrición seguido, con indicación detallada de alimentos consumidos en desayunos, comidas y cenas. A pesar de esta falta, a mi juicio, es un excelente libro"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended!","review":"I highly recommend Bob Dirgo's book on Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. His remarkable healing journey in recovering from this autoimmune illness provides a testimonial of the power of the human spirit, when well nourished. Best, he provides inspiration and practical guidelines for fellow sufferers to follow their own recovery. The amazing healing benefits of microalgae are only now becoming widely recognized....Jeffrey Bruno,Phd.,author of Edible Microalgae: A Review of the Health Research"},{"rating":"1","title":"useless crap","review":"20% of Hashimoto's patients go into remission - it's an auto-immune disease, like lupus or MS, so some lucky people can do nothing or do totally stupid things, and still get \\"cured\\". This means that the experiences of one person who got better are anything but proof that what he did will make *you* better. You'll do much better to look at books by Mary Shoman or Ridha Arem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. To start, there is not much too it. The main chapters of the book comprise a total of 42 pages. Pages 43-102 are a personal health diary which the reader is supposed to fill in. The remaining pages, all 18 of them, are a conclusion, resources and a chapter about the author.There is very little information in the book that can't be found on most web sights about hypothyroidism. The diagrams, especially of the author's test results, are mostly unreadable. They looked like copies of a fax.I cannot and will not recommend this book to anyone. If you want a good book about Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, get Mary Shomon's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"I found the book to be devoid of any real medical information. While his antibody count went to zero, his TSH was still in the hypothyroid range. I wouldn't rely on this book to help you - find a good doctor, naturopath, etc. and get your blood tested! Don't waste your time or money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Dr. Kharrazian's book instead if you have Hashimoto's","review":"It's called \\"Why Do I Still Have Thyroid Symptoms? When My Lab Tests Are Normal?\\" and explains everything about hypothyroidism and Hashimoto's Disease. It's written by a doctor and is much, much better than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This was a huge disappointment. About a third of it is blank pages, ostensibly so you can create your own \\"log\\" of various things. He doesn't follow any scientific-based methods or pinpoint any particular reasons for his \\"cure\\". It struck me as a \\"throw everything against the wall in hopes something sticks\\" sort of solution. I would also suggest to anyone suffering from Hashimoto's that they work closely with a healthcare provider experienced in treating the disease (like an endocrinologist) save their money and skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous book","review":"Oh my god, do not buy this book! What a waste of money. It feels like it is written buy a kindergartener and there is absolutely no science to back up any of the claims. I have never in my life been so disappointed by a purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive pamphlet","review":"About half of the page count of this book are blank pages you are supposed to keep a diary with, as if photocopiers didn't exist. The rest of the \\"book\\" (i.e. about 35 pages) is 90% background story, and there is one page with a bulleted list outlining some seemingly shot-in-the-dark steps he took to get over his Hashimotos, which I'm not convinced he did completely.All in all, this has less information than the two page pamphlet I got from my endo's office. Two things I do agree with from the book are 1) Primary care physicians on the whole have no idea how to treat hashimoto's and 2) Managing hashimoto's does not require drugs in many cases.If this were a long blog post it would have been more accessible and more useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disregard the only review with 5 stars","review":"If you read the only review of this book with five stars, you will see it is really a one-star review; perhaps the reviewer did that accidentally. His/her actual review explains how awful the book was.I hate to dog on a book, but I've never seen a book with so many disparaging remarks. I want to learn more about the disease I have, from a competant writer. There's even a reviewer who read all the reviews and *still* bought the book, only to give it also a one-star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"I gave it one star because it is about Hashimotos","review":"The book is 49 pages of the same stuff you can find anywhere else about Hashimotos,A better book is The Thyroid Source book.The are more outline pages in this book,than writing.Maybe he did reverse his.And I hope he did.I bought the book hoping it would have answers,even after I read the reviews.WRONG MISTAKE.Save your money,there is a reason there are bad reviews,this man is making money on other peoples misery!!!!I will use the book to build a fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"If there was a no-star rating this book would earn it","review":"Almost nothing in this book. Drumroll, please, the author took...co-enzyme Q-10! The author also had nothing like the misery those of us who've had low thyroid for decades have experienced. This book hit the trash can."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I was hoping for","review":"Ok ..I read all the reviews, good and bad and bought the book anyway. After reading his book I don't know if this guy actually had Hashimoto's syndrome. Anyway, he does give some food for thought in the direction of diet,etc. and what to add and to avoid. Since he doesn't give much in the way of sources to prove or support his claims of why his life style changes will work, I'm a bit skeptical of his claims. Still.. like many of us who would like to get off synthroid, I thought, ok .. I'll give it a shot.I have to agree with the other reviewers who criticized him for not giving dosage amounts for the suppliments etc., and for the 'diary pages'. The number of pages listed for the actual writing IS misleading. Don't waste your money buying this, browse it in the book store first. If you think it's of value to you after actually seeing it, then get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"argh","review":"Very underwhelming. If you knew *nothing*, this might be a mediocre starting point, but there are so many other great resources on thyroid disease. You deserve better than this book.

Also \\"Mood cure\\" is a great book worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad book","review":"I don't know who wrote the 5 star reviews of this book, but they're like those actors in bad TV ads claiming that they lost 100 pounds in 8 weeks. Those rave reviews are hard to stomach. This is a really bad book--I agree with the person who said that they would give it zero stars if they could (half the book IS empty blank pages for your journaling). There is not much that's helpful in this book. Much better and thorough are (1) The Thyroid Solution by Ridha Arem, (2) Living with Autoimmune Disease by Mary J. Shomon, & (3)Thyroid Power by Richard L. Shames and Marilee Halo Shames. These books are better researched and are compassionately and well-written by M.D.'s and/or persons with personal experience with thyroid problems. Skip this book by Dirgo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in the lack of content.","review":"This small book (120 pages)has 40 pages of content and 80 blank pages to record your personal history.

There is no way, he had Hashimoto's and was able to perform as a normal person as he stated in his book. And the other reviewers are right - 60 pages of journal space?! And the other 40something pages are basic knowledge about Hashimoto's - not cures. Obviously, he decided one day to write a fiction book about Hashimoto's. Read the reviews, do not buy this!! I wish I could get this book ZERO stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"This book is very misleading. Hypothyroid means your thyroid doesn't produce enough hormone to work efficiently, however, once one's thyroid is gone, it never comes back.

The dead don't come back nor will your thyroid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How I Reversed My Hashimoto's Thyroiditis Hypothyroidism","review":"I felt totally ripped-off by this book. Over half of it is blank with 59 pages of space for the reader to record her or his personal health diary. We get advice such as eating some health foods and supplements, drinking lots of pure water, exercise, sleeping and managing stress. Duh. One of the worst problems with Hashimoto's Disease is the alternation between over-production under-production of the thyroid hormone until the devastating health results until the disease finally settles into under-production of the hormone. I found no mention of this in Dirgo's book. If there was, I didn't see it before I tossed the book into the garbage. In doing so, I noticed that it is a thinly disguised self-published book from iUniverse.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money -","review":"As mentioned in other reviews, this book has no more info on Hashimoto's than you can find anywhere on the internet for free. It's mostly empty \\"diary\\" pages.

I suppose this is a testament to digital publishing; low cost and low standards. I'm sure the author had a desire to share and help, but I found it unhelpful and disappointing. As I reached the middle of the book, I was surprised to see that after several disorganized repetitions in the first 50 pages, the final 50 were a fraud in the form of a repeated \\"journal\\" template, repeated for ~50 pages.Recommendation: Look elsewhere and apply your time and money to something useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Since I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis 15 years ago, I was excited when I came across this book since I was searching for new information; something that might help reverse the disorder. Unfortunately my excitement was short-lived as the book contains little substance. It is obvious that the author was wrongly diagnosed. It's hard to take him seriously when he says he felt like running a marathon! What??? If you have untreated Hashimoto's, you surely do not feel like running a marathon! The author had none of the classic symptoms: fatigue, weight gain, thinning hair, cold intolerence, etc. Also disappointing is the 40-50 blank diary contained in the book. The one positive: the author points to alternative and Ayurvedic treatments which do help."},{"rating":"2","title":"A complete learning tool","review":"The book contains good material for learning and is a good reference to go back to again and again.

We the audience are intended to relate to her somehow and I simply can't,nor would I want to.No one in the film really shines. It is just a collection of cliches that we are not meant to care for anyhow (aside from Colin Forth in the father role. He is written as tired soul that we are coaxed to care for...Eh. It all seemed forced to me,as if I am automatically going to take \\"their\\" side against the \\"empty\\" lot.)One thing I truly hated was the unoriginal and heartless Whoops-Dead-Dog storyline.

No fault to the ensemble cast. They did their job with as much vigor as the screenplay had to offer them.It's boring. It's not that funny. Even the dog is not very amusing.There have been many period pieces brought to film that successfully deliver and accomplish the British upper and lower class mentality.This is not one of them.It's cold, disconcerting, and not very satisfying.But, once again, a great cast capable of much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy Virtue","review":"I went to see this movie and wanted to like it, the problem is it's just not that good.

Jessica Biel is not a good actress. She can pull off garbage roles in movies that don't require a whole lot of range but in a movie like this she stands out. She stands out cause she has a great body (seeing her dance with a next to nothing on white silky clinging gown was great) but the other way she stands out is that she seems like an amateur actress compared to everybody else in the film.

Jessica Biel's character, Larita, has a captivating personality and Jessica plays it to perfection. Colin Firth was reported to say before the movie was shot, on [...], that Larita was going to steal the show. Naturally, Colin Firth and Kristen Scott Thomas played their parts marvelously but it was Larita that makes the film great. Kudos therefore to the screenwriters. My only regret was that Kristen Scott Thomas' character, Mrs. Whittaker, was not developed more and softened a bit; her bitter and irascible behavior came across as caricature. How wonderful would it have been to watch Larita and Mrs. Whittaker dueling in even more developed dialogue?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Virtue DVD","review":"This movie was shown on TV and I wanted to see it again as my time permitted sans commercials. The Noel Coward story is excellent. The cast is accomplished. The characters are well developed without tedium. The setting is ideal. The music moves the story forward. Especially the final \\"gobble gobble\\". I didn't recognize the Director Stephan Elliott. Now I shall look for more of his work.Special Features option on the DVD enhance the experience and provides a better understanding of how the preparation for the film is time well spent to create an authentic perod setting and the illusion of Ben Barnes' and Kristin Scott Thomas' riding in the horse race."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"While there is some useful info, the vehicle technical data listed were somewhat inconsistent, an unhelpful factor in making comparisons. Armor thickness was inexplicably omitted. Most disappointing was the poor quality of the photo reproductions, with contrast so bad as to make many shots of very limited value to the modeler.

If you've never heard anything about buddhism except the name, this may not be the best place to start. What it did for me was to clarify some of the concepts I had read about in other books that those authors did not elaborate on, either for lack of room or their belief you already understood the concepts. I did find this to be a fascinating read. Some of it in other ways gets repeated in other books on the subject to varying degrees, but this is a bit more simplified. Well worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry!","review":"The book is very dry.

Thus I was very excited to find this book, it is a great resource for a game collector. It is quite light on text (and the only reason I can't give it a 5 star rating), but the strength of such a publication lies in the pictures, which are marvellous.I doubt I will ever own many of the items here, but it doesn't matter, if you are interested in the universe of board games you will love it, if for no other reason than to enjoy looking at the vast array of games that exist."},{"rating":"1","title":"O.K.,But Tiresome","review":"i purchased this c.d.after i heard the song \\"Thank You,Jesus\\".that song is good.for the rest of the tracks,it sounds to me that he is trying to sound like the old blues greats of the past.he tried to hard.the songs just sound forced.the musicianship is good.sorry,jr.,you are NOT a bluesman.listened to the c.d. twice.haven't listened since.not worth the price they are asking. at best,it's O.K."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK.","review":"I bought this book to try understand how I could help a friend of mine out with her crack addiction.

This is the best consumer radio avaliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"I purchased these radio walkie-talkies as a fun way of communicating with my brother, who lives 4 miles away. What the description doesn't mention is that you cannot communicate with anyone in an urban setting more than about 10 blocks away (@ 1/4 mile) ESPECIALLY if there are houses and hills. I'm sure you can communicate 15 miles away if the radio signals had no landscape interference in between, but these are really worthless if you live in a city and the other walkie-talkie is more than a few buildings away. We even tried standing on the rooves of our apartments to give the radio waves a clearer shot, but that doesn't work. The batteries die within an hour and you can charge them for days and days - the batteries still only last an hour. And withing 5 minutes of using them, the battery indicator shows you that it's already low!!

Maybe my ear canals are just small, but even with the smallest included silicone eartips these don't fit. With the included foam tips they don't fit in my ear canals either. With a good seal - from a proper in-ear fit - they sound pretty good (and I haven't even done the break-in the gentleman with the video review suggests, and he expresses surprise that he had to step down in eartip size to get them in his larger-than-average ear canals).

Audio quality was amazing, until the right piece broke apart. Yes, they were getting about an hour's usage a day at the gym - but these are static items (once secured in your ear), so I'm sure how it even fell apart.Again, wonderful while they work. They really knock out outside sound when you purchase additional foam ear buds, but then - they break. They did last a little over year before this happened, but I expect something this expensive should last at least 7-9 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not buy these","review":"I bought em a month ago went to gym for for cardio.

While the price is attractive, the sound is tinny and lacks depth and richness. I tried to break in the earbuds as others have suggested, but heard little improvement in the sound. I think the issue is fit. While there are 4 different ear attachments included with the package, none of the them fully block the ambient sound which affects the base level.Though I paid $40, if the headphones are not fully usable it's $40 too much. I see the price fluctuated from $35 to $100, I would avoid the headphones if it's over $40. Not worth the investment and I would look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"great sound but won't stay in ears","review":"Anytime you move at all wearing these headphones they fall or pull out of your ears...I don't know if it is the unusually stiff wire that the company used or the odd angle of the earphones design but I found them impossible to actually use...I went through all the different ear fittings that were furnished to no avail...I had some small success by stealing the fittings from another unused brand of headphones....don't get me wrong...these headphones sound great...just don't expect to actually do anything but lie down and listen with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont buy it..","review":"i bought this earphones because i got a good deal and i had read some good reviews on it.I thought it would be a good catch but this pair of headphone turned out to be a total mess.This earphones has weired design and very difficult to manage.The sound is also poor.I own several other pairs of earphones like Altec lancing UHP 306,JVC,Sennheiser.

The problem is that they broke after about 3 months. The weak point is the area where the wire meets the earbud. This is the where you are able to separate the wire from the bud to replace the main wire incase of failure. This area broke and the small wire from inside the bud came out leaving the bud dangling, was not able to fix. They are not very comfortable either. The wire that wraps around the top of your ears hurts for awhile and they are not very comfortable in the ear even with the proper sized rubber pieces. Maybe this is why they are $40 now instead of $130. My advice, for what it is worth is look for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead on arrival","review":"Dead on arrival.

I was just looking for something else, a new toy I could probaly introduce to the musicians at church or just have an extra pair and at this price I just couldn't pass up. All I can say is WOW!!! once I learned how to put them in my ears. I had to turn the volume way down because it was too loud for these ears to handle because they isolate the ambient sounds, So all you hear is the music crystal clear and beautiful to the ears. You cant go wrong with Ultimate Ear Technology. Do yourself a favor get a pair check it out!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fit is Critical","review":"These earphones have super sound and are pretty rugged. The sound is clear, crisp and only slightly biased toward the base. However, you must get these to fit just right or the sound will change. Even opening your mouth will change the sound.

These are really great earphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO...NOT...BUY","review":"I go through a lot of ear buds every year. I typically love Altec Lansing but these are the worst designed ear buds I could possibly imagine. Looping the cord around your ear? Are you kidding me?

The only good thing I can say about these earphones is they sound good; otherwise, they don't stay in the ear no matter what I do. Even using the Comply foam ear tips doesn't work. The only way I can get them to stay in the ear is to not move at all. I can't imagine trying to jog or even walk while wearing these.

I listen to classical and some vocal. I was disappointed in the quality. It improves somewhat with volume--but there is a limit to this.To another, perhaps more educated ear, these may be just the thing.

So far it's been a month and I still don't have my earphones. The worst of it is that they lie about when they'll be sending a replacement. My three customer service calls have all yielded the same assurance that a replacement will be sent immediately. They said the same thing today. I've rarely come across such terrible customer service and despite the excellent audio quality of these earphones, I will never purchase another product from Altec Lansing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bass is missing","review":"As per most of the reviews. The Bass is missing from these earphones. I you don't like base at all; then these earphones are made for you. I tried to \\"Break in\\" the earphones as was mentioned in the video review.

The earphone extends out of your ear and hardly fits in position when you are moving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I hardly ever write reviews, but it was that bad.The sound quality is good for the price and just what I was looking for. That is the only plus. The cord is rigid so it holds the form if you wrap them around an ipod. Folding the cord around your ear is annoying and after 9 month of adjustments, still was unable to get them to sit comfortably.I use them causally at my desk and working out a couple times a week, and the right ear piece already severed off because of the metal used to form the shape to your ear. The buds them selves are borderline painful to get used to. And once you do, good luck getting them to stay put in your ear.$50 should last longer than 9 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"UE Studio 3/Altec Lansing UHP 336","review":"These are identical to the Ultimate Ears Studio Fi 3, at more than 1/2 the cost!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Altec uph336","review":"They do not sound any better than the cheap ones I had and the cheap ones are much more comfortable.

(They are exactly the same as a pricier Ultimate Ears set, BTW, just re-branded.) I found a way to get comfortable with them, by making my own foam tips. But the problem remains, THEY BREAK. Either the wires break at the connection to the ear piece or the connector itself comes unglued - and THEN the wires break. It is impossible to repair with a soldiering iron, because the wires are tiny, and they get lost in the sealed earpiece cavity.I have bought two replacement sets, both times thinking I could make it work if I were just a little more careful. I won't be getting a fourth set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are You Kidding??","review":"These Earphones are so complicated to put on your ear. It takes me at least 1-2 minutes to wrap these wires around my ear properly/comfortably so it wouldn't get loose in my ear. Most of the times I avoid the hassle and let it dangle just like regular earphones (but they fall out easily). There is absolutely NO BASS at all but the treble and the clarity is pretty decent. I listen to a lot of hip hop so I'm very disappointed by the lack of bass on these earphones.

I purchased in April 2009 and I've had them replaced 2x with no problems at all.The sound quality for the price (I paid $40 in April 2009) is great. *These buds need to be broken in* Plug your ipod in and let it run at low volume for a few hours or more. You will not get the bass quality right off the bat if you just stick them in and crank it.Fit quality is good, not great. I use the foam, and they're version is just \\"alright\\". There are other foam tip you can buy that may be a better fit for your ear. Foam is the best way to go for isolation and comfort, imo.Don't let the bad reviews fool you. There are so many earbuds that are just awful and these are a great value for the money ($40)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for heavy use","review":"If you plan on using these everyday and use them often, I do not suggest purchasing these.

Too much money to pay for a month of light use. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the bass?","review":"Did my research and settled on these based on the recommendations and price point of <$50. The over-the-ear fit was also very attractive. Neither of these attributes can make up for what I perceive as a total lack of deep rich bass sound that I was hoping for. I have tried all of the different plugs and while the foam inserts are best, the base sound they provide still do not compare to the standard iPod earphones. While the sound is clear, there is no depth and certainly no bass even when listening to reggae and HIP-HOP jams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Altec Lansing quality is suspect","review":"I bought this product at a reduced price-from $99 to $39, and now I know why. The cable pulled out of the right ear speaker and is not repairable. So maybe the price was reduced because the product quality is not good.

Changing the buds themselves seems to help a little bit; I went from the tri-flange silicone attachment to the single, rubbery bulb. After doing this, I noticed that there was more of an \\"ear-plug\\" feel, which made them less comfortable. After doing this, the bass went from a 0.3 out of 10 to a 1.0 out of 10.So in my opinion, totally not worth it, I'll gladly stick to my default Zune earbuds.Oh, but the highs and mids did sound nice, I will admit. But bass is equally important to me, so I'm giving these a 1 out of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get The Foam","review":"If you are looking to step up on a set of Earbuds the Altec Lansing UHP336 are just something else.

Beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little bass","review":"I thought this would be a great bargain but I am disappointed with the sound quality. I've always bought in-ear monitors, and out of 8 different sets I have owned, this one has the least bass. The highs and mids are clean, but the bottom end is missing entirely. I have let them play at high volume for several days to see if that would improve the sound (as suggested by other reviews), but it did not. I used the several different types of ear pieces included, and I have also tried using ear pieces from other headphones. Still the bottom end of the sound spectrum is missing.I cannot recommend these.I ended up getting Klipsch S4 and am very happy with the sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke","review":"These headphones sounded great while they lasted, which was only about a week. One day I put them in and one side was just dead. The stiff wire was pretty cumbersome too. The little cylindrical plastic inside foam ear tip that came with the headphones fell apart immediately. I purchased a nice set of foam ear tips that made the headphones sound a lot nicer for the short time they worked. I now know the reason for the steep discount on this item.On a different note I just received my Razer Protone m-100 in ear headphones and they sound phenomenal. Same price range and way better sound. Here's to hoping they have a better lifespan than the item on this page.Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give this a miss.","review":"I bought this thinking that it would be a good replacement for my Shure in-ear monitors. This pair is rather rigid and inflexible. It doesn't fit comfortably around the ears. Its length is way too short. Quality of product, I'd say it meets bare minimum function. Its sound clarity is good, it block out ambient sound, but not totally.If given a choice, I would have given this a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the most durable headphones","review":"I was really excited about these headphones. They were the first real upgrade from whatever I picked up in the drug store or already came with my iPod. I used them daily for working out, listening to lectures, or just listening to music walking to and from class. However, after a month the leads disconnected from the right ear bud. I was expecting a little more in the durability department. That said, the sound was fantastic, the noise cancellation effect was perfect, and they were quite comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"My goal is to have earbuds for my iPhone which are more comfortable and sound better than the set that came with it. When I received these, I \\"broke them in\\" as advised for 24 hours and then popped them in for a listen. They sounded okay, but switching between these and the standard iPhone earbuds, the Apple earbuds had far better sound and range. I used them a bit longer, but no matter what they simply do not sound as good as the Apple earbuds which I find terribly uncomfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple Mind and Simple Text","review":"THREE EASY WORDS.

I found this book to be only a good story. I was desperately wanting to see him expose more of the characters hearts, and feelings. Although this book is creative and interesting, and is written in a style that is fresh in today's fiction, I was constantly wishing that he wouldn't have made it so cold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage.","review":"Overblown, overwritten, and dripping with contempt for its subject matter, this is a triumph of stilted vocabulary over storytelling. Faulknerian? Please! Faulkner, like Toole, actually had some understanding of the human condition. Egolf can't write a female character and only barely a male one. People impressed by this need to read more. Another flash-in-the-pan, as a spoiled kid takes out his rage on the poor. Littered with racism, classism, and snobbery, none of which bother me half as much as Egolf's poor writing. Go back to school, kid, and leave Appalachia to the Appalachians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written, but very bitter","review":"I must admit, I stopped reading this book about half way through. This novel was well written. However, the bitterness in this book towards American culture seemed to be without basis and without any thought-provoking social commentary. I can see why American publishers wouldn't publish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs TOTALLY down","review":"Unless you are someone who gets twisted gratification out of completely destroying a town, I cannot understand why anyone would 'honestly' like this book. In my opinion the story goes no where and Egolf has to rap it up by overloading his text with unwarranted self-appreciation and importance. I find it hard to believe that reputable publications compare Egolf's style with the likes of Pynchon and Toole. These were brilliant writers - Egolf was not. In fact, do yourself a favor: before buying this load of boring crap, pick up a copy of Toole's Confederacy of Dunces. Or, if you have already read that masterpiece, check out Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow. They put Lord of the Barnyard to shame. Insightful readers know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steinbeck on Prozac","review":"I had stumbled upon this book when I had volunteered at my local library one summer. Ok, so there is no dialogue in this novel, but who says that a novel has to have it? John Kaltenbrunner is an original character. The last time I read a novel where an author had created a semi-autobiographical character was The Catcher in the Rye. This is a novel of intelligence and emotional energy. I had read his second novel Skirt and the Fiddle and while it was not his best work, I know that he can write. Even if he never writes another novel, this is sure to be a cult classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Wonderful","review":"Best book I have read in years. Hilarious. I could not put itdown. I have since lent the book several friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging","review":"Since people should save 5 stars for enduring classics. I chose four stars. Rarely does a novel hit such a range of emotions in a reader (at least in my case) as did Egolf's book. I found myself hating and rooting for major and insignificant characters alike from beginning to end. Tradgedy of biblical proportions became uncommonly comic throughout the novel. To which made a highly enjoyable suprise. I chanced upon LOTB in a new writer's section at a local bookstore. What I consider a find should be read by all who find themselves lucky enough to find themselves readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dense in a good way, like Cryptonomicon","review":"This book reminded me of Cryptonomicon in a number of ways. The first is its density. It feels like an author's book, not an editors. Since the man can craft such visually appealing descriptions, I figure he's entitled to use as many words as he pleases.Also like C., there are no female characters to speak of.Finally, it made me laugh out loud a number of times. I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"As the twig is bent---extraordinary first work!","review":"Remarkable first novel with its own magma flow. The international praise for Tristan's LOTB would thrill his late natural father, political writer & incendiary bad-boy, Brad Evans. As a Hoosier from the probable \\"Baker\\" scenario, I agree that the Midwest milieu isn't easily uploaded by the outlanders. Tristan wickedly cracks a few eggs! There must be a screenplay morphing soon---"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful start to 1999","review":"I was given this book for a Xmas by a friend whom I'd introduced to The Confederacy of Dunces, that other comic masterpiece.Tristan Egolf's first novel is brilliantly written, over-the-top funny & a wonderfully satitical portrait of Middle America. A rare treat, highly recommended !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Wow! Wow is about all I can say to give you an impact on how awsome this book is. Even the way it is presented is different from most types of fiction. The story of John Kaltenbrunner basically centers around his incredibly bad luck and his unique way of solving it.First off, the way it is written is as if someone is telling you the story. There aren't any direct quotes in the book.Second, as you read through the book, watch for certain sections and stories that are told such as John's evaluation and the \\"unfortunate deckhand\\".Third, always keep note of how blatently outrageous the story is as that is part of the entertainment factor.All in all, a great read and well worth getting a hardcover as you'll find yourself refering to it and showing friends your favorite parts. So you'll need the extra staying power with the binding."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very thorough volume for the serious student","review":"Livingston's book is very concise and dense. It contains a lot of information, but is not the kind of book you could sit down and read through from cover to cover. It is excellent as a reference, a sort-of knot theory encyclopedia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every book lover will enjoy this one......","review":"I have used this book to check out titles I have yet to read. ANd the authors do a very good job presenting the book and the author in such a way, that you will find yourself wanting to put down the book and pick up their recommendation. Any reference book that can achieve that effect is worth its price.What will appeal to a wide ranging audience.....is the wide range of books they've profiled. Every thing from the Hobbit to Aunt Mame...classics as well as some modern authors.Frankly, I hope the authors will do another book in this genre...the possibilities are endless. In the meantime, get started on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Recommendations","review":"I heard these brothers speak at an evening event at the Library of Congress. They decried the chance nature of book publishing, where good books disappear and bad books make money.Their own book is itself a great read. A Desiderata for essential reading. Take it with you when you pick through flea markets. Thank you, David and John Major."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring books","review":"I found many of these titles to be extremely dry. More like classical literature than anything else. I wouldn't consider them the type of books that you get through in one night. They are the type that you savor slowly. Some included titles: The Education of Oscar Fairfax, Breakfast at Tiffany's, The Secret Agent, Write if you get Work: The Best of Bob and Ray, The Great Gatsby, A Short Walk in the Hindu KushThe Major's narrative style is lengthy and full of unecessary fluff.However, if \\"classical literature\\" is your thing, this book may interest you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull Dull Dull Why would I want to buy dull blades?","review":"These blades are so dull, I couldn't even cut my finger with these.

The template has a strike though, that you can clearly see in the picture above, it was intented, i guess to be a \\"stop\\" for the door, but when using it on the jamb,it stops the template from doing it's job and that would be to let you route out a matching cut out for the door's othe hinge flap to fit into, instead it blocks you from doing a jamb cutout, so it will only work on a door, not the casing Jamb.Since i needed it now and did not want to return it, it got out my anvil and mini sledge hammer and knocked the protruding stops flat with the rest of the hinge, and not i can screw or nail it to a jamb and make a perfect cut.

The End. :p"},{"rating":"2","title":"A steal","review":"This has been a good year for soundtracks. First \\"Oh Brother...\\", now Snatch. A great soundtrack should not carry the movie, but the mood, and the eclectic, shall I say, whimsical, nature of this collection really brings out the scenes. Even as one listens to the soundtrack alone after seeing the flick, details of the relevant scenes pop up. There is an incredible amount of energy here, and there has to be, to keep up with the disjointed, parallel-plotted movie. This soundtrack has the feel of a road-trip mix made by a friend of diverse musical tastes."},{"rating":"2","title":"a snazzy mix o' tunes...","review":"i like this soundtrack even more than the one for LOCK, STOCK & 2 SMOKING BARRELS. it's a fantastic mix of frenetic techno (Overseer's blistering \\"Supermoves\\"), '80s New Wave (The Strangler's mellow \\"Golden Brown\\"), and old school R&B/Funk (Maceo & The Macks), interspersed with soundbites from the film (i loved that they kicked things off with Brad Pitt's unintelligable babble). this is awesome driving music. my only complaint is that i wish they had included a few more soundbites from this oh-so quotable film. if you dug the movie, buy this soundtrack now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reality 4.5 stars","review":"This is an awesome laptop.

Perhaps its because I'm from Phoenix and am used to things being hot :o) Or more likely I got used to my Acer and my Mac is not even close to the heat that the Acer gives off.2. The sharp edge of the Mac is uncomfortable. Darn near hurts after a few hours. Problem solved :o) Took my husband's dremel tool and sanded the edge down then polished it. Looks as good as new and has a softer edge that doesn't hurt and the profile is unchanged.Love the Mac so much that I bought one for each of my children for Christmas, and bought a laptop for hubby.

The Macbook's compact size and light weight make it ideal for people on the go. The battery life is not bad either, I typically get about 4 hours on a single charge. I've had no compatability issues, and run many of the same programs I used on my PC... Microsoft Office, Internet Explorer, and even Windows Media Player.

Highly recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful!","review":"Since I had signed up for a workshop by Claudine Hellmuth, I was eager to have her book beforehand. I was so delighted with the book(and later with her class)....the book is filled to the brim with great ideas and illustrations for making collages. I have been an artist for over 25 years, and have seen about everything, so this book was a revelation, impressing someone who is hard to impress at this stage. Her instructions and suggestions are so clear to read, that one who had not taken the workshop could do as well as one who had. I recommend it most highly and would give it more than 5 stars if that were an option!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, love, love Claudine","review":"I first came across this book while browsing Ink it!, one of my favorite rubber stamping/altered art stores in Gilbert, AZ. I picked up Claudine's book and just stood there dumbfounded in the asile for a full 40 minutes. I bought the book and soon after started writing a column on paper arts for MEHC. I KNEW I had to feature Claudine in Paper, Scissors...Crop! (June/July 2005) She is an amazing college artist and a sweetheart of a person. This is seriously a great book. One of my favs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH THE PRICE.","review":"Collage Discovery WorkshopThis book is not worth the price. It is very limited in information.

I would highly recommend this book to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly Informative Guide","review":"Claudine's information is so inspiring, I wanted to stop reading and try each technique immediately.

Good collage books are hard to find, but Claudine has done a wonderful job of explaining some of the more \\"artistic\\" techniques in collage. I especially liked her encouragement to experiment with your design. Most instructors tell you you must have a \\"theme\\" even before beginning a collage; I like Claudine's idea of letting the elements in the collage guide your design. Can't wait to get started on some of the transfer techniques!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I have ever read","review":"This is a very well-written and inspiring book. I felt like Claudine was in the room with me, walking me through each project, I could SEE clearly everything she explained. I love project-books and this is the best I have ever read. She uses everyday items, you don't have to buy anything special to make these projects. I highly recommend this book! Can't wait for the next one!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Claudine rocks","review":"New techinques that will make the old hat at collage sit up and take notice but the instructions are so easy to follow that a beginner can learn them adn wow her friends and family.

The areas where the axles are welded to the stoller have come undone and are beyond repair.My daughter is very gentle with her toys and never has broken any of them. It is quite clear that the problem lies in the construction, not the wear and tear from my two year old.I called the company that makes this stroller, Badger Basket, and they were of no help whatsoever. I would love to buy the stroller again because there's nothing out there that compares to it, lookswise, but I am VERY hesitant to do so. I doubt it would hold up any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby Pram","review":"This item is okay. The \\"Lay down\\" stroller does not stay on the base that well.

I would not buy this one again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful stroller!","review":"My daughters LOVE this stroller. We love that it comes apart so easily so that they can carry around the doll carrier.

It was easy to put together. It looks really nice too considering the price is very reasonable. I looked @ several toy stores & boutiques . I didn't find one that looked as classy without paying a high price. Our daughter loves it! A great gift for any little mommy."},{"rating":"1","title":"On the market for a new doll carriage","review":"OK, so this carriage is not bad for the price but after less than 2 years the removable bassinet no longer stays in place to the point my daughter just can't use the carriage, and in general it is pretty flimsy. I am currently out on Amazon looking for a new pram to give my daughter for Christmas. That having been said, I like the fact it is navy and my daughter did have fun with it. If you are looking for a stroller that is going to last, however, this is not the one to buy. If you want one to get you through a year or so (while you determine if your child is truly going to play with a carriage)then this might be a good option.I will give Badger Baskets a thumbs up however in the customer service department. I recall our first bassinet piece had some flaw when we initially purchased it and they replaced it right away. I didn't have to send anything back. It was a completely painless process."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay for a few laughs, but that's about it.","review":"If you're into cute little songs with corny lyrics, than the Danielson Family is for you. Other than that, don't bother. Most of the songs are based on acoustic guitars, and all of them feature hilariously squeaky voices. I liked \\"Rubbernecker\\" and \\"Pottymouth\\" the best, but they stick in my head until I'm sick of them. They're nothing more than a novelty band at best. They are most appropriate at three o'clock in the morning when I've had waaaay too much Mountain Dew."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"The show is horrible.

It contains all the necessary references you will need to do beginner to intermediate level DHTML development. However, it lacks anything beyond fairly superficial coverage. For the novice to intermediate developer, this book is probably for you. If you are an advanced developer you won't learn anything new (I was hoping for some nitty-gritty detailed stuff). I would have really liked to see a reference list that not only listed major version support/compatibility for DOM/CSS/JavaScript/Etc. but for all the minor version support.

But I have to add that I've never seen a book as poorly edited as this one. (There are a lot of poorly edited books out there, too.) Variables change their name from one line of code to the next; typos abound; and on p. 184 a query by the editor to the author has been duly set into the code!

The fact that it is like a monument to River Phoenix and a momento of his friendship with Reeves just makes it all the more interesting to those who love actors and the movies they make."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving","review":"I originally saw this back in my Keanu obsessed days (1997). However it got me interested in River Phoenix. He was an amazing actor & he really made you feel for his characters. If a character he was portraying was in pain you could almost touch it. This is a darker film geared towards some of us aimless youth. It contains homosexuality & is not for the squeaky clean set. For lighter Phoenix fair check out I Love You To Death & A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must See Movie....","review":"This movie is one of my favorites. It is hard to put this movie in a category such as \\"comedy\\" or whatever. But it's an interesting movie about two fictional 'street hustlers' who are male prostitutes. The filming is great, the script is great, the actors/actresses are great. Everything about My Own Private Idaho is just right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Overrated&average","review":"aside from River Phoenix there's nothing interesting here.this film had a chance to be interesting but then went downhill into nothing clips.Keanu Reeves still can't act.Gus Van Sant has done far better material than this before&after."},{"rating":"2","title":"very different","review":"this was a very diferent movie.i loved it but it is defenitally not for everyone.keanu reeves and river phoenix are great together.it has lots of very mature content,and very serious situations,but it also has parts that i couldn't stop laughing through,and then other parts that made me cry.it's a really nice drama an actual good drama not one where they go way over board with it like inCruel Intentions.in my opinion this is one of the best movies ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart-breakingly weird on a few levels","review":"Hmmmmm. This is a hard one to review, I mean if you lean towards having little or no affection for lost souls, gay young men, and the American underbelly, than this is probably not for you. Plus, it is a weird movie. I mean this is Gus. And it is not so much weird, but kinda trainspotting freaky. There are a lot of uncomfortable scenes, on every level. River Phoenix is submerged in this character and radiates in the presence of the camera. Generally, it is a sad movie about messed up kids, looking for that great evader, LOVE. It's one of those movies that I can only watch it when I'm in a state. For somewhat happier Phoenix viewing, I prefer Dogfight, but, alas, it is also a bit sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"terrific movie and even better cast. i think the \\"ian\\" reviewer could have gotten his point across in his review in three sentences. who's he trying to kid with his long-winded expression? we know, ian, you're a lit major."},{"rating":"2","title":"Connoisseur of Roads","review":"City youth living on the streets with no cares or obligations, squatting in old buildings, hustling on the side to bring in a little extra cash; drugs, occasionally if they can score some that night. \\"Whenever, whatever\\" attitude set to Shakespearian dialogue. Take-out Chinese joints where one can play 80's Madonna hits on the jukebox: narcolepsy, loneliness, time that makes it inevitable that they grow up, unrequited love, barren roads, dilapidated houses in the country-side, Hans, the german dancer, Portland, Seattle, Boise, Roma Italy and revisited memories."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest actor in the greatest movie","review":"My own private Idaho is on of a kind movie, it is so great and so tuching it's hard to believe. The movie is part based on real life, and it brings the world closer to us, makes us realise that the world is far away from perfect... River Phoenix had it all, he was goodlooking(or..he still is in our hearts), he had the talent and he was a helpful human being, he cared not only for his family and friends but also for Mother Earth, he knew she needed help and he gave her that help.... But he is in a better place now, and I'm happy for that ....I'll miss you forever.."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of River Phoenix's Best Performances","review":"What is so remarkable about this film is the performance of River Phoenix. The issue of gay hustling is something a lot of people shy away from because they're scared of what they don't know or they're uncomfortable in dealing with their own inadequacies about the subject. But if you can step through that issue then you won't be disappointed with this film. River Phoenix won the Best Actor Award from the National Society of Film Critics for his performance in this film and he certainly deserved it. The whole film is mainly about acceptance and just wanting to be loved. It's as simple as that. A few notable scenes are around the campfire between River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves and in the trailer home between River's character and his estranged father. Please don't shy away from this powerful and provocative film by Academy Award-nominated director, Gus Van Sant (Good Will Hunting)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary, beautiful, heart-breaking!","review":"I hadn't seen this film since it was released at the cinema (I was MUCH younger then) and only recently sat down with it again on DVD. What an incredible movie! Although I'm not a massive fan of the Shakespearean monologues (they seem a bit forced at times), that's not enough to detract from what is a brave, extraordinary and beautiful film. This is truly a unique work of art. River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves riding on a motorbike through Rome is one of cinema's most captivating images. If you haven't seen this movie before, watch it. If you haven't seen it for a long time, watch it again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe!","review":"I just cannot believe that there are so many great reviews for this movie. I had a very hard time keeping my eyes open because it was so boring. River Pheonix was pretty good in acting, but you just get so sick of him suffering from cezar after awhile. I guess he has an issue with his mother, so every time he encounters some stressful moments, he goes into this cezar which happends a lot throughout the movie. Another problem I have with this movie is that, it seems like all the other male characters are given directions to kiss and do other things with eachother. Keenaue and River seems to avoid having to do this, so good for them to just collect their checks for being in this movie, when others had to do more of the work to make it more believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"This film tries too hard to be sublime and just ends up confusing and stupid. Don't bother.Keanu Reeves has not improved much over the years, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I couldn't MAKE myself sit through this movie. It was sick and depraved. I have no idea why River Phoenix is hailed as such a great actor with as little talent as was displayed in this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have A Nice Day","review":"An interesting film that looks at the lives of two street kids and their travels to find a true home and adoration. The cast is wonderful with River Phoenix (Mike) giving a heartbreaking performance as a nomad in search of his mother, and the deep longing for love and acceptance from a slumming rich kid, Scott (Keanu Reeves). The direction is mellow and passive in rich oranges and pastels with shots framed on the subject matter in bare form. The film never bows down to a perfect ending nor does it make victims or violators of the characters. It was a breakthrough art film that has aged well and avoided stereotypes immersing itself in the human characteristics everyone shares."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Journey Has Beginnings and Endings...","review":"Philip starts the entire concept as a physical journey through the various aspects of his local landscape. Adding to this journey is the manner of processing the deaths of two people that he had great respect for. Further into the journey comes the addition of a newborn child to his family - completing the motif of endings and beginnings that comprise the concept of making a journey. Interspersed throughout the chapters are various concepts on religious belief, local history, and Philip's own insights into weaving the daily processes of life with the mysteries that we all carry philosophically deep in our own being. Not only was it an enjoyable read for me -- it also helped me process an understanding that life's journey has endings and beginnings strewn throughout it. Personally, I cannot recommend this book highly enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was a big dissapointment.","review":"The Druid Way had nothing to do with traditional Druidism with the exception of the historical sites visited within the book. This is my first book that I have read by Carr-Gomm, and it will be my last. The book is filled with too much Psyco-psychology. By reading this Book I find that Carr-Gomm is overly obcessed with Sexuality. If one wishes to follow the tennents of Wicca, then this is a good book. If you want to read about traditional Druidism, stay clear of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good book on Druid Path","review":"I have been studing the druid path for 11 yrs and this book is one of the best i have read so far"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Travel","review":"Bought this for my wife a few years ago and since then we've brought it to over a dozen countries and states as its ability to fold and fit in a carry on or small bag make this cane very utilitarian.

I rate it right up there with Berri's \\"Jean de Florette/Manon of the Spring\\" epic and personal favorite \\"Fall\\", by American Eric Schaeffer. Certainly, every moment is heartfelt, and the screen adaptation of the urgently exquisite novel by Djian is rather well rendered.

She was right and she was wrong.Yes, the guy (Jean Jacques Beniex) is a very talented visual director - there were a number of shots that really impressed me, and the lighting was great. But the story grew to be so ridiculous and unexplained - mainly Betty's \\"craziness\\" - that I lost almost all interest and actually found myself fast forwarding it to the very end, which was, as I'd feared, ludicrous. At least to me, my old boss apparently loved it.Would I recommend it? Jesus I don't know.

It is a highly censored rip off of a very good movie. I saw the shorter version on VHS years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. Why anyone bothered to release this in this condition is beyond me, and most likely borders on, if not crosses into the territory of deceptive and misleading advertisement. It should have been clearly stated that this is the Unedited but Censored Directors Cut.

What a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Forget The Music!","review":"I respect all of the reviews on this movie, which has to be one of my all time favorite foreign films. I cannot add anything that the other reviewers have not mentioned, other than the fact that this movie had the most haunting and wonderful musical score. The film came out at a time where not much was known about bi-polar disorder or depression, so to watch the film in 2008 will leave you with a much different feeling than if you had seen it during the 80's. But the haunting simple sax music will make the same indentation on your heart now, as if you had first heard it back in 1986. I had to buy the cassette tape in Paris years ago because I could not find the music anywhere in the U.S. Wherever you have to search, if you have seen and loved the film, you will love the soundtrack even more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of censorship.","review":"The movie is ruined by censorship with \\"modesty\\" blurs.

It begins good-naturedly with Betty seeming to relish the life Zorg represents in a run-down French coastal town, but when she finds how many houses he has to paint, we see the first sign of Betty's explosive nature, that both fascinates and frightens Zorg. The two embark on a whirlwind love affair in an untypical French fashion, as Betty tries to promote Zorg as a writer, while Zorg revels himself in Betty, with even more sex in the director's cut than was in the original theatre release. I think Jean-Jacques Beineix lost himself in this lusty romance, ultimately not knowing where else to take it, although one long foresees Betty's tragic end. Still, it is a mesmerizing film, or at least was so in its time. It hasn't aged as well as I thought, but for first-time viewers it should still be a startling experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aspect Ratio: 1.33:1?

From the reviews it got, I was a bit apprehensive, but went ahead and bought it anyway. I'm glad I did. It is warm and definitely keeps the wind from whipping through you. It even keeps you dry as long as it is not pouring cats and dogs. I'm not sure how well it would work in the depths of winter; that remains to be seen, but for fall, it has been extremely helpful. With a sweater or sweatshirt underneath, it will probably work well for winter too. It is also very nice looking as well. It has a classy look to it. I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't like the bulkiness of winter clothing, yet wants to stay warm and dry, and look good doing it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are much, much better resources out there","review":"I was very disappointed with this book.

I have read Possessing the Secret of Joy by Alice Walker and this is a better book by far. I wouldn't waste the time to read or buy Warrior Marks and recommend you start with another book that actually deals with the topic. What a terrible follow up to Alice Walker's great start at educating us on FGM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great find!","review":"I was so happy to find this book at a reasonable price. This will be a great help with my genealogy. It's a wonderful addition to any library for those interested in Colonial American History, specially Virginia frontier."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING book on the Virginia Frontier in 1700s","review":"This is a VERY comprehensive book on the Virginia frontier in the 1700s. Reference is made to many, many records concerning the settlement of the lands in Augusta and Botetourt counties, although because of the changing of the county boundaries, some reference is made to Orange, Spotsylvania and Caroline counties. Identification of many prominent people and families are contained throughout as well as reference to many skirmishes with Indians and the fates, by named individual, of participants. This book is worth far, far more than it costs, as many tens of thousands of dollars in expenses would be required to gather this information beyond that of the value of your time in doing so."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is no catch!","review":"I have owned a 6\\" open stand Jet jointer for a few years now and I finally reached that point where a new set of jointer knives was unavoidable. After calling Jet customer service and learning that it would cost me alot (one might even say a ridiculous amount) to order the knives from them, I turned to Amazon. I soon discovered these Freud knives for about a third as much as Jet wanted for their knives (and half as much as Amazon wanted for Jet brand knives). I ordered, received, and installed them, and so far I have been happy with the purchase. I have jointed a fair amount of nicely figured, quarter sawn white oak and have no complaints so far. I am a big fan of Freud cutting tools and these seem to affirm my feelings.I recommend these to all who want good quality knives at a reasonable price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed!","review":"I received my jointer blades today and noticed the edges are defective on two of the three and even a bit rough on the third. There are small nicks along the edges (slight but noticeable). I am replacing the original Jet knives for this very reason. I have two Jet knives that are quite new, and one badly nicked one, so I took the best Freud knife and simply replaced the Jet with it. It's acceptable I suppose. For the cost, I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning. The difference between the Jet and Freud knives are 5 grams or 1/4 oz. so no biggy as far as balance goes. I wouldn't recommend their purchase!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised","review":"I was let down by these jointer knives for two reasons: 1) There is a healthy burr on them which required honing, 2) worse yet the blades have a bow in them, which then require firm pressure to the honing plate to knock down the burr. Otherwise only the ends of the blade back would get cleaned up. In fact there's enough of a burr that the bevel-edge will require honing as well.Due to the bow in the blades, I'm not sure if my Veritas honing jig will straighten them out to clean up the bevel.If I wanted to screw around with tuning up knives, why would I have bought new ones?Hope you have better luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"FREUD KNIVES WORKS","review":"The knives works great they cut like razor.

I ordered these blades to have a fresh set of razor sharp knives ready to go to work. Instead, what you receive is a set of three blades the seller picked up from the local metal scrap yard that cut nothing. Had to sharpen them myself just to get a decent result. Ridiculous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Danielson Famile are Rad.","review":"Good stuff. If you put a lot of value on creativity, Danielson will not let you down. As a follower of Jesus Christo, I am impressed with this band.

I was extremely impressed with how many of his predictions of the future have actually come true. A visionary is good way to describe him. I was not aware of his work with Citicorp but it would be interesting to hear what he would have predicted for the financial services world. He barely talks about it in the book. Too many predictions to mention but you will be impressed at his track record. In summary, because of the age of this book many of his predictions have already happened so you really can't capitalize on many of the ideas. However, it's a short read and a very interesting one at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential For The Brothers Karamazov","review":"Notes are essential for this great russian novel. It will take anybody at least a few hundred pages to reslize who evybody is, with those wierd russian names, but the notes eliminate that.

This album has it all, melody, uplift and vocals that are sure to play in your head long after you turn off music. Full appreciation and support for the music they have brought to this world, in this ever \\"drifting\\" apart world.This is one of those albums that you can sit back, relax and unwind and listen to the entire album with a feeling of enlightenment and a \\"thirst\\" for taking on the following day in a more positive attitude.Tracks like \\"Clocks\\" really are classic tunes, which will test the stand of time no doubtFantastic, let's hope they can continue this excellence in the years to follow.Iceblue"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply fantastic","review":"This British band has so much to offer with their latest CD filled with fantastic beat, rich melody and voice. Every time I listen to ColdPlay, I am amazed at the powerfulness emerging from their music. One could easily get lost in it. Difficult to say which track is my favourite: \\"Clocks\\", \\"God Put a Smile Upon Your Face\\" and \\"In My Place\\" stand out. It is by far the best album I have heard from any band in ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even slightly better than Parachutes!","review":"Wow, what can I say. Coldplay's new album A Rush of Blood to the Head completely blew me away. When I first heard the song Yellow from Coldplay in 2000 I decided to check out Parachutes. That made me a devoted fan! Spies, Trouble, Don't Panic, Yellow and most of the other songs were just incredible in my book. Now with their new album they have truly shown how talented they are with the hypnotic Clocks, the rockin opener Politik, their first single In My Place, the outstanding piano-laden The Scientist (Which is probably the best song) and Amsterdam which was amazing. The only song I didn't really like was Daylight. Besides that, this album is a masterpiece. In the direction these guys are heading musically I expect them to be around for a long time. Buy this and Parachutes ASAP!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does not have the bonus track advertised","review":"Great CD, though different from Parachutes - at once darker and less romantic. The Japanese liner notes and lyric sheet are interesting - if you read Japanese - though there seem to be a couple very minor mistakes in the transcription of the lyrics.Unfortunately, the bonus track is not there. I haven't been able to get an answer as to why..."},{"rating":"1","title":"180G Vinyl.","review":"The three stars is not for the music itself. That's a five star.It's for the pressing quality of the vinyl. This album has a HUGE amount of background noise, pops and hiss, and has a muffled sound.I've sent it through my Spin Clean several times and it helped the noise a bit, but still a lot of noise on this album.I'm going to send this to a friend to have it cleaned better (VPI system) to see if that helps at all. But a brand new \\"Limited Edition\\" album should not be this poor fresh out of the sleeve...For the music itself, it's fantastic. A solid start to finish album. The music will bring you through just about every emotion throughout the playlist."},{"rating":"2","title":"great music... poor production","review":"I think the music is really great. I think the sound quality... well, sucks. I have many cds... no matter what system I play this cd on it sounds like bleep. If its just me, I apologize, but hard as I try I cannot give this CD a 5 star rating even though the music in my opinion is worthy of that. If you don't mind listening to poor sound quality from a cd, or don't have much of a stereo system to begin with then you won't be bothered by the lack of sound quality here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will be a classic CD, talked about 100 years from now","review":"I own thousands of CDs, but this is first time that I have written a review. After a year of listening to this CD, it still just amazes me. Every song is it's own unique masterpiece, and it far exceeds the quality of Parachutes. Can't wait to hear their next studio recording, it will be hard to live up to this one though.If you are looking for good CDs to add to your collection, whether it is big or small, this is a must have. Check out John Mayer's \\"Room For Squares\\" and the equally excellent \\"Heavier Things\\" too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Catchy, Philosophical, and Moving","review":"I absolutely LOVE this group! They always churn out catchy mellow tunes. Every song on this album makes the listener think deeper. The lyrics contain wonderful messages. My favourites are \\"In My Place\\", \\"The Scientist\\", and \\"Green Eyes\\" (the latter which is incredibly romantic and I get chills when the lead singer hits that long note - God, I love his voice!) This album takes off from where \\"Parachutes\\" ended. Chances are, if you liked their first CD, you'll also like their second. The whole group is talented and I can't wait for their next album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid pop album.","review":"There are really only two tracks on this LP that I dont like, 'Clocks' and 'Daylight'. The rest of the album is a very good alternative/pop album. Interesting, well written songs.My favourite tracks are Politik, Scientist and Warning Sign."},{"rating":"2","title":"Euro Music at it's best!","review":"Quoted by Oasis as the band who will save rock music, Coldplay is the new age Beatles, mixed in with a bit of Oasis and American influence. Definately one of the greatest pieces of musical art today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhhh....","review":"It's alright and semiwell-produced (i've done better in my basement). The music is soundscapish but....the words are plain dumb and this album doesn't have good replay value. It's quite the typical pop machine. If you've not heard many musics....then I think this might sound a bit better. In a world of heavy music accessibility I wonder why all these reviewers have not found anything more profound then this album to call it 'mind blowing' and 'orgasmic'. It's got some contrived 'style' but it's not deep. I, like others have found that the design of these songs are about identical. I understand the notion of the sylistic pop album that sells to the masses but man...it makes me want to drool after two listens..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and Refreshing for the Pop/Rock Genre","review":"Coldplay is one of my favorite bands and their latest album, A Rush of Blood to the Head, is definitely one of the better I own. In my opinion, Chris Martin's voice is good, but it is the beautiful instrumentations that make the album. The lyrics are simple and sincere, an excellent and rare virtue in the pop/rock these days. Refreshing and unpretentious love songs with no lofty ambitions make the album what it is. Overall, \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" is soothing and mellow and if you're in the right mood for it, can send you soaring. Some of my favorite songs include \\"Amsterdam\\" \\"Warning Sign\\" \\"Green Eyes\\" and the obvious \\"Clocks\\" and \\"The Scientist\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I didn't know Coldplay very well,before.Just one day,I heard the song\\"In My Place\\"in a CD shop,and I bought the Album\\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head\\".That night,I played this CD again and again,and I almost listened to it all night.And now,it's still one of my favorite album.I also love their debut album \\"Parachutes\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Excellence","review":"I first heard Coldplay's Clocks as a tribute to former SF Giant manager, Dusty Baker at Pac Bell Park. I had to find out who this group was and emailed the baseball team directly. The entire album is AMAZING. In particular, I enjoyed the piano heavy ballads: The Scientist, Clocks and Amsterdam. I'm not usually a big CD buyer of alternative rock but this was a MUST HAVE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coldplay Gets Hotter","review":"While it would have been easy to dismiss their first albumat first listen as another Radiohead rip-off, there was something undeniable in its pop driven falsetto simplicity.But on \\"Rush of Blood to the Head\\", melodies at once brave and familiar pull you in and hold you in an irresistable embrace and surround you with solid guitar hooks and pulsating bass figures. Prominent on this record are piano- laden mournful pieces that threaten to inject long lost emotion into a pop music arena that no longer knows those words. I'll play this one for a long, long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an incredible album","review":"Wow, folks. This is THE album of the year by far. It will be hard to find something more honest, surreal, sensitive, and melodic. It is by far the best sounding brit album since Kid A form Radiohead. It is destined to become classic. Pick it up, and catch a piece of history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than anticipated...","review":"It seemed to me that all the songs on the radio by Coldplay were slow and really seemed to focus on lyrics rather than the overall music. So the first song came out and I wasn't blown away. But when I heard \\"Clocks\\", something just clicked. So I listened. There are no songs that make you hit the skip button, and it's easy listening. I had one of their earlier albums, and you can see how they have progressed musically. I think that one day, this will be the album that pushed them over the top - kind of like Radiohead with \\"The Bends\\". It won't be their best, but it pointed them in the right direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums of the year","review":"A Rush of Blood To the Head is one of the most meaningful albums I've ever heard. It's one those albums that you can listen to from beginning to end, because every song here is great. Chris Martin's singing is amazing, and he's one of the most talented musicians out there. Anybody who can play the piano, guitar, and sing deserves your attention. This is a solid buy, one of those true emotional albums that you don't see very often. My favorite songs on this disc include politik, the scientist, and Amsterdam, but everything here is a winner. The only thing that bugs me about this cd is the group's political agenda inside the cover, and how they list several websites to help their cause. Besides the fact, this is a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply amazing...","review":"I first heard Coldplay when ABC featured their (quite annoying, in my opinion) song \\"Yellow\\" in one of their commercials. I was not too impressed until I heard their next single \\"Trouble\\" on the radio. I bought \\"Parachutes\\", but was somewhat disappointed. When \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" came out, I was tempted to pass, but fortunately I did not. There are almost no words to describe how fantastic this CD is. I don't like to think of this CD as music. I think of it as an experience. Coldplay has managed to bring their music together in such a way that it feels as if the actual composition is surrounding you. Some particular bright spots on the CD include \\"The Scientist\\", \\"Amsterdam\\", and my favorite song of all time, \\"A Rush of Blood to Head\\", which was featured recently on a commercial for HBO's series, \\"Six Feet Under\\". Actually, my advice to you, the buyer, would be to buy this CD to experience the title track. Amazing, that's all I can say about this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Is For Living","review":"The first song I heard from this album was In My Place. After hearing this breathtaking song, I was compelled to buy the album. For the past year, Coldplay has been all I have listened to. As many times as I have heard their powerful riffs, moving bass lines, and masterful melodies, I am still asking for more! The album begins with 'Politik' which begins the CD with a bang and propells you on a journey to the end of the album. Every song on this album is unique in its own way. People who can't appreciate or even perceive the differences in their songs lack the musical ear to understand them.I have played this album for all my friends and have literaly been a flashing billboard for Coldplay. Most reactions are unsure at first but then they find a part in a song they like and they become hooked.The whole sound of Coldplay can be summarized as \\"Amazing\\". They remind me that 'Yeah, life can be a horrible experience but LET'S LIVE ON!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Parachutes in every way","review":"I own both Coldplay CDs and I prefer this one over Parachutes because its just simply better. I like Parachutes but I love \\"Rush of Blood to the Head\\". It seems to be much happier and up beat than Parachutes. Parachutes just gets a little slow and boring and sleepy. This album is great though. So many good songs. Im pretty sure the whole world is in agreement here that \\"Clocks\\" is one of the most beautiful songs ever written. Because it is. Other great songs are \\"Warning Sign\\", and \\"God Put A Smile Upon Your Face\\". This album is a must own and so is Parachutes. But if you want the better one get A Rush of Blood to the Head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally ... Some Real Music","review":"This is a wonderful album; moody, atmospheric, melodic, and, most importantly, sincere. There is something universal in the lyrics without being overtly sentimental. In terms of melody, most of the songs are penetrating and linger in the mind. Not only that, but the songs seem to go together well, so each one follows the preceding song in a kind of pattern that fits perfectly. This is an album you listen to even when the stereo is off; a classic in the making. As far as musical influences, there are many, but I hear mostly U2, Radiohead, Philip Glass, and the Beatles ... not too shabby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coldplay: A Band everyone should hear thoroughly","review":"Coldplay \\"speaks\\" to a variety of people. Anyone who has an ear should take the time to listen to them. \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" is an awesome CD packed with songs that anyone would like. My favorite is \\"Clocks\\" along with several others on that CD and on their other CDs. Coldplay is just the right mixture of rock and metal. Their sound is so mellow that there is no way anyone could turn them down. They have a very distinct voice that no one can mimick. Give them a try and you will fall madly in love with them, as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soul-filled album","review":"A beatiful blend of mellow drums, catchy piano tunes, and soft vocals. well worth buying. it makes you think..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for many Tastes","review":"This album scores a five star rating, because it has a wide range of music appeal for all ages and all music tastes. It handles country, neo-classical and hip hop with ease. Fine example of this, HBO and a commercial use the piano track as back ground music for commercials. You will not be able to keep your fingers from drumming out the beats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comparison to Parachutes","review":"This album in no way can match up to the brilliance of Parachutes. It's just boring drivel. Parachutes was ten times more upbeat and faster and had the emotion that this album lacked. Only a select few songs were good on this album such as clocks and in my place. If you want to try out coldplay buy parachutes and you will fall in love. This album was cheaply put together in 2 years unlike Parachutes which took a lifetime to create and is filled with much more emotion."},{"rating":"2","title":"These guys wish they were radiohead","review":"As mentioned in the title, these guys wish they were like their more noteworthy homeland heroes radiohead, and even though they fall short of radiohead's genius, trying is a very ambiguous and commendable endeavor. To put it simply, a Rush of Blood to the Head is melodically adept. Every song has a beautiful flowing melody, complimented by Chris Martin's soothing, yet pleading vocal stylings. The lyrics are straightforward and not incredibly impressive, but the vocal melodies are pristine, which is all that really matters. This album is definitely an investment that won't be regretted, and should tide you over until the next radiohead album comes out which won't be out for another year or so... this, however, will more than likely be coldplay's last album according to Chris Martin. tsk tsk tsk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sure to become a Classic","review":"I always listen to this album over and over. I never get sick of it...ever! This is a must have for people with good music taste. Coldplay is wonderful, beautiful, unique music. I just went to Coldplay's concert a few days ago and it was by far the best concert i've ever been to. They were amazing! Buy this...its for your own good!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rush of Air Supply to the Head","review":"If you want to give these guys credit for anything, they certainly deserve credit for taking soft rock all the way to the top again. They should be called Radioplay because they take basic elements of the Radiohead sound (not the experimentation) and set it to easy-on-the-ears melodies, beats, and lyrics. \\"Lost in Love\\" has nothing on this one. I'm actually eagerly anticipating the Coldplay covers album of Air Supply. \\"All Out of Love\\" with a brittle beat--that will really be something!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bubblegum grew up and got depressed","review":"Coldplay is--utterly--derivative. It certainly is not the worst pop (Coldplay is SO pop!) music ever produced, as the Music Money Machine insists that the most tiresome efforts be well produced these days, so two stars for production values. But Coldplay is simply uninspired, bland, boring, dull, simple-minded and, yes, juvenile. I can only pity the legions of fans who, raving about Coldplay, therein reveal profound lack of exposure to, now, 35 years of notably disaffected and alienated balladeering going back to, at least, as another knowledgeable reviewer noted, the great but ephemeral Tim Buckley. Need depressing music? The Smiths/Morrissey, anyone? Sigur Ros? Too challenging, I suppose. Ahh, forget it. Just go back to sleep and forget these pointless criticisms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booorrring.","review":"I think coldplay have succeded in writing some of the most boring, generic, and above all meaningless lyrics yet seen in rock. But I usually don't mind, as they've also written some rather good melodies. On this particular album however the music seems to have followed suit and is, with the exeption of Clocks, also rather boring. Then again, if you liked the singles, i'd suggest you buy it, as 'In My Place' shows them at about their worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rush of blood to the winker-tinker","review":"Is it just me, or is the lead singer constipated while he recorded this album? puh-lease!!! How dare anybody call this worthless filth \\"music!?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst bands I've ever listened to","review":"This has got be the most annoying unoriginal album I have ever heard. All the songs sound the same and it seems like they never end. My husband owns this cd and everytime he listens to it in the car it makes me want to crash into something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vastly overrated and mundane (but will help you sleep)","review":"Judging from the number of 5 star reviews on this page it seems like I'm a little out numbered but I do believe Coldplay must be the most overrated UK band of the last five years, closely followed by Travis. Not since Oasis has so much undeserved praise been lavished on a 'kind of OK but rather boring' band. Ok the tunes are nice enough for a while but where is the depth? For UK music try Badly Drawn Boy, Dakota Oak, Aim, Roots Manuva etc.I think Dido is ...as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like U2 on a bad day sans Edge","review":"Some good songwriting and tunes here, but it's hard to get past Coldplay's blatent riffoff of U2's style. They will never equal the brillance of U2, and would do much better to establish their own sound instead. The singer's outright theft of Bono's trademark style is unconvincing and rather embarrassing to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid, arresting music","review":"This album is a very obvious evolution in Coldplay's sound, as at times they seem like an altogether new band, covering new ground in an assertively confident manner. Most of the songs here are quite good, with POLITIK and AMSTERDAM being particular standouts; the brutal, passionate title track is a heartstopper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"I think it's next to impossible to capture the way music can move people with words. So I won't even try to do that.Let me say this about A Rush of Blood to the Head: It's a wonderful follow up to Parachutes. In some places, it's brilliant. In others, it's happy and an easy listen. Overall, it's a splendid work of art.You won't be disappointed. Be sure to check out the track \\"God Put A Smile Upon Your Face\\" as soon as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parachutes Perfected!!","review":"From the first song to the last this latest offering from Coldplay is stunning. Every song has at least one melody that you will be singing over and over in your head. Chris Martin, Coldplay's passionate vocalist, captures such true beauty in his voice alone that he could be singing a recipe and still bring you to tears. Jon Buckland has really come into his own on this album and delivers wonderfully layered and harmonic guitar leads over most of the album. His playing is very atmospheric. I loved Parachutes but it left me feeling empty on alot of the tracks. I knew this band had some(somewhat) upbeat songs in them which really come shining through on this album. Some of my faves are \\"Politik\\", \\"In My Place\\", \\"Daylight\\", \\"Green Eyes\\", and \\"A Whisper\\" which is really amazing. It reminds me of the Velvet Underground. So purchase this album. And make the world a better place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emotionless","review":"Let me preface this by saying that I am an avid music fan, with tastes in all different genres and styles and can appreciate talent and art when i hear it. I own Parachutes and while I found some songs enjoyable and engaging, it was not and is not the masterpiece everyone says it is. It was catchy, sure, but nothing amazing. Yet I was interested in seeing what else this band could offer. I saw potential for a great progression. Unfortunately, \\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head\\" is an OVERPRODUCED, EMOTIONLESS mess. It tries way too hard to impress and to please. The songs are lifeless. They lack character and emotion. For those tagging this album as \\"passionate\\" and \\"emotional,\\" do yourself a favor and buy \\"Sea Change\\" by Beck for a truly emotional new album.One star and that's only for In My Place which is probably because it is so similar to Trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"I hesitated buying an album from this band because I just didn't trust the hype. But after hearing a couple of songs and reading these reviews, I relented. Radiohead? Come on. I know Radiohead and they are NO Radiohead. I was going to try to listen to this CD a second time, (not having made it all the way through it the first time)but I just can't bring myself to do it yet. Mind you, this is only after one listen, but it seemed like every song had the same formula. Acoustic guitar, piano voice. Where's the bass and drums? I'll try it again someday, and if somehow I start to get it I'll change my review, but for now, my advice...don't fall for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Hit in the Head","review":"There is but one hit song and it keeps playing in my head. Clocks is a mezmerizing tune with beautiful lyrics masterfully tuned in to the waves of euphoria which surround it. The rest of this album is drab, mundane, boring, sleeping with the fish. Coldplay has proven with one song that every band has the opportunity to produce something special. It is just too bad that they didn't apply that special something to the rest of this lackadasicle blob of plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mind Numbing Boring","review":"I have trouble listening to this album. It is so boring. I chuckle every time I hear someone call this the greatest album of all time. Really the only decent track is \\"Clocks.\\"If you are trying to choose an album from Coldplay to buy, go straight to X&Y;, then Viva, then Parachutes or Mylo. Avoid this dud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coldplay outdoes itself","review":"A collaboration of a single thought or feeling expressed by Chris Martin in almost if you will a display of events and inner being through the lyrics and melodies of this album. This band has outdone itself with this album. The more I listen to it the more I enjoy each and every track. Hearing Clocks on the radio is what lead me to listen to more of the album and in doing so I feel that any one of the songs on this album could be played on the radio and become a hit. Chris really shows the magnitude of his voice and variations in pitch which really connect with the lyrics and words he is using. Don't wait to purchase this album, you won't be able to stop listening and continue enjoying it over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"best song , one of the best album, period","review":"I feel previliged to be able to hear this album. Listening to this album is a soul-purging experience. The scientist is the best song I have heard in my whole life. The morosness of the song was accentuated by Chris eerie voice, which haunts u for long time. It is addictive to listen this song. If u have lost some one u love, u definitly will attach to this song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This is not what I expected for Coldplay. I heard about the band from some friends who thought they were the greatest band ever, so I went and bought the CD. Turns out that their songs are very boring and all sound the same. I wouldn't reccomend listening to them while lieing down or you may fall asleep...And that's what I wrote the first time. Now I'm kind of changing my review of the cd because the more you listen to it, the more the songs get stuck in your head. THey are slow songs, but they are still good. The best song is the Scientest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"When you hear the three singles, (\\"In My Place\\", \\"Clocks\\", \\"The Scientist\\") you expect a masterpiece. But have you ever seen a trailer for a comedy film that looked great, but was disappointing because the trailer gave away all the funny parts? Same thing with this album. The three singles are worth it though. Just skip the rest of the generic filler."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible band","review":"bland, boring music. they are now cashing in selling their junk to tv commercials cause they know the end is near."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just annoying","review":"i don't understand how this album is getting such good reviews. This is one of the few albums that i had to sell becuase i thought it was just horrible. The piano is just like bang bang, playing the chords and bascially nothing more. The lyrics are all right, but the singing makes me wonder if they're sincere. Too many times \\"open up your eyes\\". This is just bad. The fact that the artist is Coldplay does not necessarily mean it's a good album."},{"rating":"1","title":"so disappointed","review":"well i loved parachutes and i picked this album up and completely was disappointed by it. I hate clocks. the only strong track on here is the scientist. all you people need to hop off the band wagon not everything the critics like is gold"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds Like a Budweiser Commercial","review":"This CD is boring. Not bad, just boring. It has all the musical adventurism of a beer commercial. A well-produced beer commercial, granted, But still, a CD that sounds like an hour of test-tunes for Budweiser's next Superbowl spot hardly merits the raves that have been showered on its head.I wanted to give \\"Rush of Blood\\" a chance, even though I'd found \\"Parachutes\\" uninspiring. So I brought it home, put it into shuffle-rotation with Radiohead and the Libertines, and let it spin.Folks, I cringed whenever Coldplay came up. I was reminded of nothing so much as the bloated pop epitomized by U2 and Sting.Download a song or two if you need a fix. But save your real money for music that you'll care about in two years. Beer commercials don't age well."},{"rating":"1","title":"not like the first","review":"I was a little disappointed with this CD. I guess I loved the one before this one so much that I put them on some pedistool. Things on this CD seemed repeatitive and it lacked some warmth that the one before had. I could listen to the other one \\"Parachute\\" again & again. But this 2nd one I'll probably hand to someone I don't like or toss it out the window. Don't waste your hard earned money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped","review":"This is not the masterpiece it is made out to be. Just like Parachutes,it is helplessly forgetable.

I thought Like New might have a few scratches, but I would rate what they sent as Good. The case was broken. They completely lied about the quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst music in the world","review":"This cd is BAD. From the Horrible intro song \\"Politik\\" to the over played \\"Clocks\\" to the boring \\"Amsterdam\\" this album is absolutly auful. It is slow and predictable. Music you fall asleep to. And the singing is soooooooooo bad, you know the people on American Idle, the people who get kicked out in the first round? They sing better than Coldplay's lead singer does. Another thing, you can barley hear the guitars! They might have not even put in guitars and you would never know. This cd makes me want to puke."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rush of Ecstasy to My Head","review":"Living in Indonesia DOES have its advantages *smile* When it comes to Music, we are more updated than the Americans. Indonesians are open to those new musicians from Europe, even before they make a videoclip to be shown on MTV. And that includes Coldplay. I LOVE their first album and excitingly wait for their second. When I first heard \\"In My Place\\" on the radio, I know that the newest album won't disappoint.I was right. This album is far by one of the best albums I bought this year. Coldplay still offers the emotional gripping songs. My favorites ... like I can choose, anyway ... are probably The Scientist, Amsterdam, and In My Place.If you're a fan of Brit music, you surely don't want to miss this one.(now I will wait for Lifehouse's Stanley Climbfall, since I LOVE the newest single \\"Spin\\")"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rave","review":"Sorry, this really isn't a constructive review, I just wanted to rave. I love this cd already! It is a fine follow-up to Parachutes, and has been the only CD I've listened to for a week (and that speaks volumes, trust me). Early favourites: the Scientist, Green Eyes and the title track. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another refreshing cd","review":"I like 'refreshing' as an adjective for Coldplay's music. The new cd, like 'Parachutes,' offers something a little different in today's pop/rock menu... This really is great song writing -- understated, melodic music, insightful lyrics, a very mature vibe in the vein of Radiohead, Dave Matthews Band, and U2, but with its own unique flair. You recognize Coldplay when you hear them. That alone makes them distinct in the popular music scene.As for the cd, it's a bit deeper than 'Parachutes.' It's got the same quiet feel, but there seems to be more happening in the songs, more depth to the arrangements, more instruments, including a lot of piano. It's more upbeat, too. The drummer has more to do on this disc than the previous, which is nice. The songs are subtle and very catchy, and fans of their debut will definitely not be disappointed. Overall a superb offering by a band that has earned its stardom by bucking the sludge trend and striking out on its own course. Pick it up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very well done...but","review":"i love the album...it touches mebut its watered down radioheadi think chris martin is bangin paltrow too softly."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great sophomore album","review":"First off, i don't know why everyone likes \\"Clocks.\\" I personally think it's one of the worst songs on the album, along with \\"Scientist\\" and \\"Whisper.\\"That being said, this album is otherwise fantasic. Definite highlights are the tremolo-drenched \\"Politik,\\" the melancholy-yet-uplifting \\"God put a smile on your face,\\" (i like the chorus and bass line), and \\"In my place\\" and \\"daylight\\" are pretty great too. Yet, my favorite songs are the last 2, \\"Rush of blood to the head\\" and the tragic sounding \\"Amsterdam.\\" they make me moved. if you like coldplay check out other great british bands such as Gomez, and Travis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"...a wonderful masterpiece of creative energy.

Every song on here is just soo awsome and it really makes you a Coldplay fan, i know it did for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"This is the first colplay album I've listened to and probably the last. The album starts of OK then drops until the end where it picks up slightly. The songs all chug along using the same keyboard progressions and slow pace throughout. There is very little variation and while the production is good, overall musicianship is poor.Coldplay might be pleasant enough for those nights when you simply want to nod off. Indeed there are some nice melodies at times but overall this is a very pedestrian and uninspired effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over 1000 reviews...must be good.","review":"The debut album Parachutes is amazing, but this was the album where Coldplay kicked in the door and said \\"we are as great as our inspirations\\". Might be true. Even Radiohead and U2 may agree. Three huge singles came from this album. \\"In My Place\\", \\"The Scientist\\", and the most moving of them \\"Clocks\\". My personal favorite non-single I think is \\"Warning Sign\\". I get so lost in that one. This album was so big it probably created the inevitable backlash by some fans, but's it's near impossible not to like. Afterwards I think Coldplay became the poster boys for the Adult-alternative genre. So be it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Coldplay rocks..... beautiful music. Its also a great alternative than the other emo/punk/screamo/whatever rock bands. Buy this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Well worth the money!","review":"I was totally amazed with this album. Coldplay has managed to not only reach it's debut's magic, but has surpassed it with this unforgettable sophmore effort. I liked Coldplay's debut, \\"Parachutes\\", after a couple listens, but I fell in love with \\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head\\" right after I first heard it. I like a lot of harder stuff, but man this music really hits me. You can listen to this masterpiece from start to finish and it proves to be a very rewarding experience. It is packed with powerful emotion and might possibly bring a tear to your eye. Very heart-felt stuff; all that fuss you hear about this band is for real and well deserved. Highlights include \\"Politik\\", \\"In My Place\\", \\"The Scientist\\", \\"Clocks\\", ah heck- the WHOLE album is a HIGHLIGHT! If you liked \\"Parachutes\\", you will absolutely love this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Coldplay has out-musiced themselves","review":"WARNING: This review will be exceedingly biased, as I am a huge huge Coldplay fan. Read on if you don't care or are one too. . .Parachutes was a great album, but A Rush of Blood to the Head is even better. There isn't a bad song on the CD, and each one sounds different enough to keep things interesting while still holding on to that characteristic Coldplay wonderfulness. Unlike many modern bands, Coldplay is able to make the listener feel what they are feeling--be it love or extreme sadness. This is a great CD!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can listen to it over and over again","review":"I've had this CD now for months, and I'm still not tired of it. \\"Clocks\\" is my favorite, but I love the entire CD--it's not one of those CDs with two singles and a lot of other garbage. The music practically goes right through you. I could go on and on, but just buy it (even if Justin Timberlake likes it, too)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged","review":"The CD itself was in good condition, but the case was creaked and broken.

And let's face it... we are all sick to death of it. U2 thinks they are giving the Beatles a run for their money which is a huge joke.

Coldplay tries to make sophisticated music but it doesn't work! The lyrics, vocals and music are enough to put you to sleep, which I guess, if that is your sole purpose, to sleep, I would give this a 5 star rating. LAME GROUP AND CD. Oh, and Parachutes isn't any better.

All of the songs are slow, pessimistic, and make you want to commit suicide all of a sudden. Buy John Mayer in Room for Squares or something by Jason Mraz. Just don't buy this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly overrated","review":"This band has the worst lyrics of anyone since Britney Spears. And they rip off the sound of mid-1990s Radiohead. Perfect music for anyone who wasn't cool enough to like Radiohead before they were superstars and who isn't smart enough to require lyrics to say anything a Hallmark card or 4th-grader couldn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"no rush here","review":"The hype was what it was, overkill in promoting a sophmore CD of a group who can do much better then what was produced here. I was disappointed to say the least, and although it's hard to top the efforts of \\"Parachutes\\", this doesn't come close. Coldplay needs to turn a deaf ear to the suits who obviously made them \\"rush\\" this out for profit. Buy \\"musicforthemorningafter\\" from Pete Yorn, that'll give you your ear candy for awhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"dreadfully overrated.","review":"This is a pretty good album.mabee worth 3 stars at best.It is solidly written and well produced.But!It is very boring.You will get the same out of this album every time you hear it.There is not much else there ,than what is on the surface.Your normal ,mediochre friends will tell you \\"go buy this album!\\"They will try to tell what I'm sure you've heard on mtv a thousand times.But think for yourself and examine it emotionlessly.You will find that ;beyond the sad ,forlorn love ;which is something that we all know and have experienced and could express quite purely.There is nothing to this music but1:accessibility(to appeal to anyone with pain) ,2: resources(with lots of money you can't afford to NOT sound good)3:and a bunch of booring british saps(who listened to the beatles once or twice)Listen,Learn,Make up your own mind!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock's \\"new U2\\" if they so choose","review":"\\"Rush of Blood to the Head\\" is the excellent follow-up to Coldplay's debut album \\"Parachutes\\". Long in the making, the album more than delivers and manages to meet the highest of expectations.Less \\"simple\\" than \\"Parachutes\\", \\"Rush of Blood\\" kicks off with a pulsating \\"Politik\\" and never lets up. \\"In My Place\\", a long-time concert staple and the first single, is as close to \\"Parachutes\\" as it gets. Everyone has their own favorite tracks, and for me the title track towers above the rest. It is a nice capsule of all that is Coldplay 2002: dramatic and lush musical landscape, thoughtful lyrics, and Chris Martin's unique vocals.It is amazing how fast Coldplay has developed as a band: compare \\"Rush of Blood\\" to 1999's \\"Blue Room EP\\" and you will see what I mean. While I don't want to \\"jinx\\" the band by overloading them with praise, \\"Rush of Blood\\" really puts them in a position to become the \\"new U2\\" for the next couple of decades, if they so choose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still good...","review":"Coldplay's a \\"Rush of Blood to the Head is amazing.

I'm worried now. I'm not sure what it is, but somethings just not right here. I got this album and THE HIPPOS new album and i was very surprised when I concluded the THE HIPPOS' album is FAR better then this one. I would have never expected that, but THE HIPPOS have a lot of great pop/rock intelligence on their new album. My recommendation is that you buy this album, cuz it's still coldplay and it's alright, THEN go online and get THE HIPPOS' new (and final) album, cuz it's AMAZING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice tunes, pity about the lyrics","review":"I bought this CD based on the song, 'Clocks', which is playing a lot on the radio. Unfortunately, the CD is boring. The rhythms are neat and pleasant to hear, but the words that go along with them are confusing and rarely make sense. It feels like a lot of navel gazing going on here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vastly Overrated","review":"This CD is remarkably similar to Parachutes in that the singles are the only good songs on it.

It's puzzling and disappointing that a band that can deliver awesome material can also churn out unlistenable drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me when it's over......","review":"Talk about a bunch of Radiohead wannabees!! This music will put you to sleep faster than a Johnny Carson re-run on t.v., trust me!! Coldplay are a tuneful band, I'll give them credit for that, but the guy singing sounds like Dave Matthews - with the boys from Radiohead backing him up instrumentally!! There's nothing wrong with trying to put some intelligence into your music, but these guys have a holier-than-thou vibe that rubs many the wrong way, including me!Well, Da Peace Dogg just don't recommend this one...I'll check ya' later!!!!!!Da Peace Dogg - '02"},{"rating":"2","title":"rush to da head","review":"You can tell that the music's changed a bit from the last album.

This sophomore album, in my opinion, is much better than the first. None of the songs on this album can top \\"Trouble\\" on Parachutes, but there are stand-outs. The adrenaline-inducing \\"Politik,\\" the simplistic yet catchy \\"In my Place,\\" \\"The Scientist,\\" \\"Clocks,\\" and \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" are all memorable examples of songwriting.People have compared Coldplay to Radiohead, or at least a former incarnation of Radiohead. I think this is a misguided view. The former leans toward the more contemporary, dare I say the often-used \\"wuss rock\\" term; the latter has pushed the very boundaries of alternative rock. There is no comparison, folks...Coldplay is NOT what Radiohead used to be. These are two very different animals.So just sit back and enjoy what both groups have to offer in their own, unique way."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD is a must-have!","review":"Rush of Blood to the Head is the first CD that I could listen to over and over again without getting tired of it. Almost every song on the album has a part that sticks with you, that makes your heart jump when you hear it again. On first listen, \\"Clocks\\" and \\"Warning Sign\\" are the easiest to attach to. But after multiple listenings, I think \\"God put a Smile on Your Face\\" (a totally sexy song), \\"Rush of Blood...\\" and \\"Amsterdam\\" are the finest tracks. I bought \\"Parachutes\\" after \\"Rush of Blood\\" and I think, comparing the sum total of the tracks, \\"Rush of Blood\\" is the better album. (Though I highly recommend \\"Parachutes\\" too)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant. Enough Said.","review":"There isn't really anything to be said for this album that hasn't already been said many many times before. At this point I'm just writing this out of respect for this work and that I feel it can never get enough praise.I loved Parachutes. It was a great album, and set the stage for what Rush of Blood would be. Everything that Parachutes was, is ten times better on this, their sophomore release. The experimentation factor is through the roof, and it manages to produce some of the most fulfilling tracks to be pressed in many many years.Basically it comes down to this: Listen to Clocks, Green Eyes, and Amsterdam. If after absorbing these you aren't convinced, then there's really no hope for you. This is easily one of my favorite albums ever and absolutely everyone should check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sonic signatures","review":"The often reviled mega-seller's sophomore release upped the volume and proved to bitter critics and music snobs alike how intuitive touch and expansive production elevates simplistic songwriting to earnest levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Far superior to Parachutes!","review":"When I first heard Coldplay's first album, Parachutes, not long after it came out, I thought it was pretty good, but not great. But when the band released this follow-up, I was blown away! The music sounds better, and the melodies probably sound better, too! This is one of the best albums I've ever heard!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good one from Coldplay","review":"Coldplay pulled at the listeners' heartstrings with Parachutes, and they do so even more with A Rush Of Blood To The Head. The songs on this album are tamer, more melancholy, and Chris Martin has perfected his cracked, pained, whiny voice.I like this CD, but I find I have to be in the right mood to listen to it. When I am in the mood though, I really do enjoy it. It is so emotionally weighty and the piano sounds so beautiful, that I just can't help but like it. Clocks is a perfect example of this.My preferred tracks: Clocks, In My Place, The Scientist, Daylight, Politik.Once again Coldplay has made a deep, moving, satisfying album. This is typical Coldplay, so if you like them, you will like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good CD","review":"Great songs by a great band. This cd is fabulous, its good to fall asleep to and just to calm you down. There are no weak songs, and they are all amazing. This is one of my favorite cd's and I bet that you will love it. It is like radiohead, but more piano and even calmer. It is a good buy and it won't get out of the cd player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Anyone Else Hate this?","review":"My friend who usually has good taste, recommeded this CD to me, and I really had no idea what it was going to be like except mellow. I like some mellow, U2 is okay. I put in this CD and I was so BORED. Sorry. Every song sounded the same and didn't stir any emotion in me. I gave the cd to a co-worker, big mistake because apparently she loves it and plays it over and over again, which adds to my hatred of this wretched cd.. Go buy American Life,,, much better.. or some Johnny Cash..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD, as was the first...","review":"I have both Parachutes and this album. Instantly loved it. They are kind of like a more melancholy Matchbox20. There is some similarity to the Doves, both of those groups have great music if your looking. I have hear some complain that the lyrics are too simple, but ya know I like LOTS of different music, I like variation. If I want wild abscure lyrics I will toss in one of my MANY PinkFloyd albums. I cant tell you which song is my favorite, they are all really good. Although I have a wide range of music interests, I do not buy albums if more that 1 or 2 songs tops are less than good.

It is on eof my favorites in fact! All of the songs are so beautiful on their own. I personally love The Scientist, but honestly, all are great! Also, the CD is printed on enviromentally friendly prouducts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rather good","review":"This CD one of the better albums released recently. The two songs you might hear on the radio are \\"Clocks\\" and \\"In My Place\\", and these are both rather good songs, with plenty of depth and nice sound. Some other notable tracks are \\"The Scientist\\" and \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head.\\" The track: \\"Daylight\\" is the CD's lowpoint, but other than that most of the tracks are nice. Worth buying, but nothing epic here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music is not a lost cause after all...","review":"How do I even begin to describe in words how wonderful this album is? Brillant, beautiful, soulful...it is a masterpiece that showcases the true talent that is Coldplay. From the magnificent ballads such as \\"Green Eyes\\" and \\"The Scientist\\" to the raging rock anthems of \\"Politik\\" and \\"Daylight\\", how could anyone not fall in love with this album? And if for some ungodly reason you're not impressed after the first few songs...just wait until \\"Amsterdam\\" comes on."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice follow-up to Parachutes!","review":"I remember when I first heard \\"clocks\\" my brother and I argued over who it was. I said it sounded like coldplay, he said U2. The new disc is not quite as smooth as Parachutes, but it is a wonderful follow-up. \\"Clocks\\" gets huge air play in Washington, D.C. and I believe this will be Coldplay's signature song! The piano/guitar is breathtaking, you can close your eyes and this musical masterpiece will take you anywhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Science-minded","review":"Simply put, \\"A Rush of Blood...\\" wouldn't be nearly as great an album were it not for two things, 1) 'The Scientist' and 2) the last minute and a half of 'Amsterdam'. Without the glow and ethereal resonance of those songs, this would be just another highly-accomplished Brit-pop exercise in post-Verve symphonics. And that's not to say it would be bad - not by a long shot - just not as great. However, with the inclusion of those two potent jump-starts, Coldplay sends the album straight to the sky and you're left feeling your God-forsaken heart whistle."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Coldplay work thus far....","review":"Everyone has their own opinion of excellent music. I know for me i admire music with powerful lyrics and wonderful rhythms. Coldplay's first album Parachutes ~ did just that, yet they took things a step further with A rush of blood to the head. This album seems to have the same \\"natural organic\\" feeling as Parachuts leaving the audience with that \\"did we hear this before feeling????\\"\\"Green eyes\\" seems to have a pure folk rock feeling as voice overutures carry over the silence of an acoustic guitar. Overall this album is possibly the best one i have heard in this genre this year. An excellent album with a majority of feeling throughout. 5 starsmy-$0.2"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Album is a Ladder for the Soul","review":"Rush of Blood to the Head is arguably one of the greatest albums ever created. It engages the mind and the heart in a wonderful emotional experience that exhilarates the soul. If I could only listen to one album for the rest of my life, this would be the one. Forget Prozac, Illicit Drugs, or Alcohol--this album is intoxicating on its own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"OK, everybody gives this five stars, and people say \\"everyone should own this cd.\\" I can tell there's talent afoot here, but I don't care for this particular flava. I like Radiohead, but not all post-rock emo and I like Dylan and Nick Drake, but certainly not all post-indigenous folk. I like Sparklehorse, but not My Morning Jacket. Say what ya like (or what you don't like) no single band or cd is for everybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Greatest New Rock Bands...and this CD Proves It","review":"While firmly in the minimalist-rock tradition of Pink Floyd, U2, R.E.M., Radiohead et al., Coldplay has an ear for melody and sound that should make their musical fathers and older brothers drop their jaws with envy, even if it doesn't.The first 5 tracks of this CD are undisputable classics...and track 8 has one of the most beautiful \\"transitions\\" in song structure that I've ever heard.Oh, and one more thing - it's so nice to hear a keyboard-dominated band for once. A hundred gazillion guitar bands are just a bit much to take, don't you think?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Coldplay- A Rush of Blood to the Head","review":"Until recently I have enjoyed Coldplay's music from a distance, listening to the radio tracks, watching the videos. I generally listen to different music genres, but Coldplay's music shines through and is deserving of the vast musical audience it has gained. I bought \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" (2002) a few weeks ago and have been enjoying it ever since. With almost 800 reviews written on the album, theres not much if anything to expand on. The singles \\"In My Place\\", \\"The Scientist\\"and \\"Clocks\\" are excellent. I like the fastpaced \\"Daylight\\" and \\"Warning Sign\\" goes deep. The opening and ending tracks, \\"Politik\\" and \\"Amsterdam\\" are two more of my favourites. This is one of those albums, I can listen to and enjoy through and through at any time of the day. The variety of sounds Coldplay provide are addictive, and Chris Martin's soulful vocals are impressive. Albums like this make me appreciate other music genres, definitely one for the collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...","review":"They really aren't that good. I've heard some tunes on the radio, downloaded some others... I'm just not impressed. I caught their performance on a rerun of Conan, it was awful. I don't get the hype and I don't understand the accolades, they're not that good. I'm reminded quite a bit of Oasis and Radiohead when I listen to these songs. And I must say, Radiohead and Oasis do it just a little better than Coldplay. It sounds to me as if they took a turn for the \\"let's gain the critical praise other bands like Radiohead and Oasis get,\\" which in their respective cases, both sophomore albums did gain better critical response than the debuts. This album, in no way measures up to Parachutes, which I didn't like too much more than A Rush Of Blood To The Head. However, it's definitely not the worst thing I've ever heard, but I've heard a lot better and more entertaining music this year, or any year for that matter. This is what I would listen to if I had no other choices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anthemic!","review":"I liked Parachutes. It was sweet and swell. But it took a few listens to grow on me as a whole. A Rush of Blood to the Head, however, leapt into my heart within the first 10 seconds of \\"Politik\\". The band charges into songs like \\"God Put A Smile Upon Your Face\\" and \\"Clocks\\" with a hitherto unknown intensity. Best of all is the seething title track. I was (dare I say it) shocked to hear Chris Martin (of all people) intone \\"I'm gonna buy this place and burn it down/I'm gonna put it six feet underground\\". Sexy! Throught its 54 minutes, the album brims with confidence and maturity. No sophomore jinx here. Highly recommmended.Key Tracks: \\"Politik\\", \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\", \\"Clocks\\", \\"Daylight\\", \\"The Scientist\\", \\"A Whisper\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"\\" Dunno !\\"","review":"Yeah, I think I would have to agree with the other reviewer! You should give \\"Splinter\\" by the \\"Sneaker Pimps\\" a listen if you like this. They have the same empathetic sound but they do it with more finesse, creativity and dignity than this band.

I wouldn't say it breaks new ground, but it certainly digs a little deeper into its genre. Chris Martin is an fantastic frontman for Coldplay and his vocals are amazing! The entire CD is filled with excellent songs, but here are a few highlights:\\"Polotik\\". My second favorite song on the CD.It starts out loud with banging drums, but halfway through, it switches to a soft, two minute instumental with heartmoving piano playing by Martin.\\"The Scientist\\". My favorite of the CD.A haunting ballad of love, loss and forgiveness.The piano is extraordinary!Overall, the CD is never boring and I can listen to it all the way through without skipping any tracks.At times its quiet and refelctive, or loud and incredible.Chris Martin, Will Champion, John Buckland and Guy Berryman are truely geniuses of our time.I cannot wait to get their new CD and I am definetly going to atten their concert in September."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I Can't Have Jeff Buckley Give Me This","review":"I love this cd.

It was love at first hearing. I rushed to a store and bough Parachutes. After that I had a chance to buy their import singles and get many great songs that were not in their debut album.Yesterday I hada a chance to buy, here in Brazil, their follow-up, \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\". I've been listening to it since them and all I can say is that it is even better than Parachutes. It reminds a lot of those melancholic 80's Echo and the Bunnymen songs, sometimes reminds of a Pink Floyd/Radiohead mix, but you never forget that this is a Coldplay album.I do hope they last long enough to give us pearls like their 2 albums and never try something too weird or different, because they are simply magnificent.If you've ever heard \\"Yellow\\", \\"Trouble\\" or \\"In my Place\\", do yourself a favour and buy this one. You'll be pleased and amazed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something","review":"There is just something magical about this album. No, Chris Martin, the lead singer, doesn't have an astounding voice. There is just something about the style of it all that makes it wonderful.I am a huge fan of Coldplay, and have been for quite a while. Looking at another review, I can assure you, this is not Christian rock (honestly, how could \\"Green Eyes\\" be about God?). I have no knowledge of their religious beliefs, but I assure you, this album was definitely inspired by love and life.The lyrics aren't even that great either, but in context they seem amazing. I urge you to give this album a good listen. Don't be afraid of the first song, it's a little scary the first time through (it has a very different style). Don't just listen to the first few tracks up to Clocks, give the whole album a nice spin.If you like soft rock, British rock, or mild alternative, Coldplay should be good for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"(Yawn)","review":"I tried to love this album.

And although \\"Parchutes\\" is a great album within itself, \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" is simply stunning. There are few cd's that I listen to over and over again, but this is one of them. And there are no songs on the cd that I intentionally skip, because all of them are truly good. \\"In My Place\\" is a wonderful ballad, a song infused with yearning and desire, and probably my favorite on the cd. \\"The Scientist\\" is as full of heart as is \\"In My Place,\\" and \\"Clocks\\" is also a winner. There's something playful about \\"God Put A Smile Upon Your Face,\\" and it's fun to rock along to in your car. This is a beautiful cd and deserves all the gushing praise it has garnered.

It's definitely 'pretty' but because this stuff has been done many times before, in much better ways both musically and lyrically, it has next to no impact or staying power. It's profoundly unadventurous, but at least it's better than most of what is on the radio today. Then again, if you're listening to the radio these days, there's probably no hope for you. Check out Wilco's 'Yankee Hotel Foxtrot' or Clearlake's 'Cedars' instead. You're gonna be hearing the songs off this one on car commercials for the next 5 years anyway, so you really don't need to buy it.Oh heaven forbid, a negative review!

Perhaps it was not best treated by the girlfriend I received it from, but it does not have deep grooves and gets much popping and has a shallower sound because of it. The quality of the sound of this record is very much near the bottom of my new (not used purchases) vinyl."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only record you'll need this year","review":"What can I say? This album is perfect. Every track will pull at your heart strings in one way or another (Politik, the Scientist and Amsterdam being my personal favorites).Don't listen to anyone who compares Coldplay to Radiohead - they are nothing alike. Radiohead's debut Pablo Honey may be a distant relative of Coldplay's Parachutes, but that's as far as it goes. Coldplay have carved their own niché in the music world with their stunning blend of piano, guitar and Chris Martin's beautiful vocals.It is so unbelievably refreshing to hear a band in this day and age who are content to stick with their own kind of music. They aren't trying to please everyone by attempting to merge an infinate number of genres into one song. Coldplay's songs are so simplistic in their honesty - that is probably the reason they have gotten so much attention in this manufactured pop/hip-hop saturated market.This truely is a modern classic.

This music is NOT complicated, and it does NOT take as much talent as it seems. If you think this is heartbreaking beautiful, listen to Blind Guardian's album 'Imaginations from the other side'.

I'm not terribly impressed YET - but then I've just gotten the cd, and maybe I need to \\"discover\\" it. ...My liking for Clocks reminds me of that, and like Poison, it stands out from the rest of the songs.

It's one of those rare, rare magical songs such as Pink Floyd's \\"Wish You Were\\" Here, \\"Under the Milky Way\\" by the Church or \\"Ocean Rain\\" by Echo and the Bunnymen. \\"The Scientist\\" will win a Grammy, mark my words. I'm so glad these guys are here. I belive they'll conquer the world as U2 did in 80's, because they deserve it.Buy this CD for yourself and anyone you care about.

I just do not understand the hype nor the interest unless ofcourse, it is more about the lead singers relationship with his famous, and equally dull, wife and his tendancy to name children while visiting the greengrocers.Every generation gets saddled with a dull band most people don't appreciate and who end having no real talent and longevity much beyond their media hype, witness Oasis. Not worth listening to and I guarantee you will tire of it and find it irritating eventually."},{"rating":"1","title":"listen to some real music, for god's sake","review":"coldplay makes bad music. music should be EMOTIONAL. music should make you feel things. also, music should have SOME sort of display of technical ability. these guys' producers are better than they are. anyone can be good if they have good producers and a lot of money.coldplay's music is melodramatic and whiny. their music is devoid of any emotion, because it has been sucked out by excessive production and WAY too many layered tracks upon layered tracks.furthermore, they are very similar to radiohead, too much to ignore... which is a shame, because radiohead is such a great band. the difference is, radiohead can a) actually play their instruments well, and b) actually write really good songs, instead of trying to make up for their lack of songwriting with production and cheesy string sections.the only reason that coldplay deserves two stars is that at least they're not nu-metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"shameless rip-off.","review":"All Coldplay is a rip-off of Radiohead and Wilco. They're very good at ripping off Radiohead, the first time I heard of a few of their songs, I thought it was Radiohead. They're not very good at ripping off Wilco yet, though.That being said, a great band like Modest Mouse started off as just a rip-off of the Pixies and Pink Floyd. Once Coldplay learns to create their own sound using their influences like Modest Mouse did, I bet they'll be one of the best bands around. But for now do yourself a favor and go buy Radiohead's Amnesiac, Pablo Honey, or the Bends; or Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot or Summer Teeth, instead. Your money will be much better spent.The biggest plus though is \\"Yellow\\" isn't on this Cd.

It will be hard to top.I know some people hear some U2ness in Coldplay, but I never really have (U2 is my favorite band). What I do hear is a cross between the best of Radiohead, Moody Blues and Pink Floyd.The songs just envelope and lift you away. It is so easy to be swallowed up by them.

Just listening to it put a smile on my face. After the whole sucess of Parachutes nobody thought they could do better and the follow Up would not live up to the feel of Parachutes. Well this album is probably 100 times better. I never thought Parachutes to be a brilliant album. It was good but not a masterpiece but this album is so good and so powerful and just fantastic that I can't describe it. This deserves 5 stars and is now one of my favourite album.

It's not even that it's bad, just unoriginal & derivative- there's not a note or idea on this album that hasn't been done better by someone else. This is the first one I've ever heard by Coldplay, so I can't compare it to their previous discs, but I bought it mostly because I'd heard Clocks and liked the sound. Typically the singles tend to be my least favorites on a disc; usually the singles are the most accessible and \\"catchy\\" sonds on a disc, while the meatier stuff doesn't get the airplay. For me this disc was like going to a comedy only to find out that every funny moment was in the trailer, and the rest is just filler.This isn't a terrible album by any means- quite the contrary, I guess given the sad state of music nowadays, this is probably actually above average.

I bought this album cos I was curious to see if it was that good everyone said (even Joey Tempest from Europe - remember \\"The final countdown\\"? - was praising this album). I have to say that Coldplay gets a bit boring, but on the other hand boredom seem to be what many English pop acts build their music around.I certainly don't get a rush of blood to the head from listening to this album. There's only two good songs: \\"The scientist\\" and \\"Green eyes\\", and one decent: \\"In my place\\". The rest makes me wanna shout to these guys to stop.

He decides to spend a couple of months there, apparently out of the blue, causing all sort of unexpected situations to the dull inhabitants of the village. Deep inside, he is a distressed, troublesome soul. A character that comes to be cherished by the reader, at times even pitiful.Again, Hamsun shows the grievance inherent to mankind through a singular man and his relationships with the people he happens to run into in this gloomy and forgettable town.Although at the beginning I could not easily find my way through this novel, I really enjoyed reading it. A book to be listened to, indeed, yet to a lesser extent than Hunger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mysteries, a Novel","review":"I gave this as a gift to my mother who is very well read and also a critical reader.

I bailed out about half way through it. It really made no sense to me at all. What you get here is a couple hundred pages of incoherent rambling by a central figure who I couldn't relate to at all. One minute he's one thing and then another like he's psychologically disturbed or something. Hamsun has some high regard in literary cirles and I like his simple writing style. Hunger was engaging book but this isn't engaging at all. At some point I thought, this ain't going anywhere, it's tedious and I ain't enjoying it at all.

Plus, the image provided was terrible - it made the blade look like a counterfeit.That's not what I found. They are very sharp. In fact, even the back edge is almost razor sharp! Seriously, I was really surprised at that.I inspected the blades with a loupe that I use for sharpening. They have a razor edge. Hardly any leading edge to see or reflect light. These are as sharp as I can get something going down to 4000 grit. Either some folks got bad blades or they'd say I have really low standards.

I don't want to say too much more and give anything away, but it is definitely worth the time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the series","review":"This is my favorite book in this trilogy. I really loved seeing Robert slowly come out of his shell and start healing and living again. Lucinda was a perfect match for him (even though it took her a while to figure out what - or whom - she wanted). The love scenes were good (well, I could do without the one by the stable) and full of feeling. Their every kiss was explosive. I really liked their chemistry. Well, in the end the story with the stolen papers got a bit wild, but all in all, this was a really satisfying read."},{"rating":"2","title":"TERRIFIC, EXCELLENT, THE BEST","review":"THIS WAS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE READ BY SUZANNE ENOCH.

I started with this third book and was immediately captivated by all members of the Carroway family, as well as the way Lucinda's friends all come to their rescue.This is Robert's story, more so than Lucinda's, and the way he decides to get back to normal life deserves respect. Unlike some of the other reviewers I found Robert's recovery quite credible, as I choose to believe that he'd been working toward it over the years.This book didn't have as much of the charming dialog that you tend to get in Enoch's work, but Robert is quite reserved to begin with. Lucinda did pretty well on her own though.Some reviewers have complained that the trilogy is formulaic but I disagree. I've read 2 out of the 3 books now and while there's a hero and a heroine and they're in love at the end of it, that's the basic framework for any romance story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, not overly impressed","review":"I'm not a huge fan.

As soon as I finished that book, I went looking through her other books to see if there was one about Robert. I thought he was a wonderful character, one very different to the typical regency hero, I thought that he had an incredible amount of depth. As one other reviewer said, this was definitely Robert's story.I pretty much cried the whole way through. The way that Enoch portrayed Robert mentally abusing himself as he struggled to put whole sentences together really struck a chord with me. I also loved the way that when Robert saw Lucinda wearing a yellow gown, he would say she looked like sunshine, or when he saw her wearing a green gown, he would say she looked like spring.It was a story that I really enjoyed reading, and I would definitely recommend it to people."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what romance is all about...","review":"I love Suzanne Enoch's books - they're always entertaining and often laught-out-loud funny. But this one was different.It wasn't good. It was fantastic.The story of Robert's recovery is handled with such finess, I fell in love with him myself on page two and couldn't wait to see them together. I believed his reaction to the horrors of the war - and I felt it in no way impacted his manliness.In fact it made him human. And dynamic.This is one of the few romances I've read lately that I didn't feel the need to skip through. I read every word and enjoyed it all.I can only hope that the completion of the lessons will not mean the end of this series.

Many elementary school teachers use it when they study bats at Halloween. But how unlikely is it to find that not only bats, and then a snake (Verdi), but now a cockroach is a children's book hero? One could not dislike Crickwing. He is handicapped by a broken and painful wing injury, and thus goes his way alone. He entertains himself by making sculptures of his food. After several difficult experiences with predators, Crickwing becomes perverse enough to torment the industrious ants he observes around him. Although their queen has the ants gang up on him, they prove to be his salvation, first by stretching out and repositioning his damaged wing, and then by becoming his friends. Crickwing is a true hero when he sculptures an anteater to scare away the army ants from his new friends, the ants. The iluustrations are lovely as ever. Don't miss this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Juneau 2nd Grader","review":"Crickwing is a very artistic beetle. Everyone calls him that because his wing got twisted in a fight with a frog.

I bought this book, and several others, because I wanted to learn more about what he experienced as a solider in the \\"Great War\\". This book is devoted almost exclusively to the First Division's history from World War II onward. Even the \\"clothing and equipment\\" sections are of WWII vintage. There are only a few pages devoted to the First Division's formulation in 1917 and their major campaigns of WWI. What content does appear for WWI is a high-level summation of events. I hope that the other books that I purchased about the \\"Big Red One\\" provide a more complete history \\"from day one\\".

With an excellent introduction to the history and politics of the term \\"Third World,\\" this book provides entries for terms such as \\"Modernization,\\" \\"Colonialization,\\" and \\"Development.\\" It also gives short entries on important historical events, movements, and people, such as \\"Marcus Garvey,\\" \\"Mao Zedong,\\" \\"Rio Summit,\\" and \\"Liberation Theology.\\" Unfortunately, the book has not been revised for a second edition, so some of the entries feel dated. Also, the book is weak on gender issues, reflecting more a tendency of the field up to 1993 rather than necessarily a weakness of the author. I wish a second edition were forthcoming, but until then, I highly recommend this as an important addition to any informed person's reference shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soundtrack that must be listened to...","review":"After seeing the movie, I knew I had to have this soundtrack. A great compilation of ambient tracks. This is not a soundtrack you would sing along to, or bring to a party -- but rather one you can sit back and just enjoy (take to the head, so to speak). Each track is filled with such emotion, even if you didn't see the movie you could enjoy it immensely. I bought this soundtrack to kick back, knock down some work and just let my imagination run wild. As stated before, GREAT soundtrack for a dinner party -- or just closing your eyes and being at peace.

He was the only one who had even a little bit of depth to him. The other characters were flat and dull.Finally, I still don't get the whole radical faction aspect of the novel.

Went to Bosch web page and ensured 422A was driver side, but flip position with 422B anyways and now only leaves about inch smear in lower part of viewing area.

The wiper does not reach all parts of the window, specifically on the bottom right of the passenger side. As for the Driver side, the blade streaks and again misses part of the windshield at the top of the arc. I contacted Bosch directly, and they said that they were aware of these defects, and there was nothing they could do about it. They said that they were not able to get enough tension in the blade to make it conform to my windshield. They said I would have to take it up with the retailer. Bosch still claims that these are compatible with my vehicle even though they are aware of these defects.

Bosch has always had a good reputation for automotive parts and accessories. Bosch purports the blades to be \\"All Season\\"; However, they worked find until the temperature went below 25 degrees, at which time they did not fit the contour of the windsield and left a void of ice and snow in the center of the blade wipe path, thereby compromising vision and safety. I returned them and went back to Anco Winter blades, for 1/3 the cost of the Bosch, Icon blades. Anco is still be best choice for wiper blades. Furthermore, Bosch specified 22 inch blades for driver side and 21 inch blades for passenger side, which were consistent with the length of the factory blades; however, Anco recommended 22 inch for both driver and passenger sides for the 2010 Toyota, Tacoma. Surprisingly, the 22 inch blades DO work on both sides and do not project beyond the seam of the windshield."},{"rating":"1","title":"The average wiper blade","review":"With a $15 rebate, I bought a set of these (422A-422B), to see if they were any different than the $4 blades I usually buy. I won't buy these again. Sure, they look nice, and they work like new wipers, but I could have bought 4 sets of wipers for the cost of these, and had the same results. I wasn't impressed in the snow and ice. They still freeze up, and end up leaving large gaps in the clearing swipes. Maybe I just expect too much out of an \\"high end\\" wiper.

There is a 4\\"x6\\" patch on the passenger side edge that simply does not receive any contact from the wiper blade. Also, they chatter. I attempted cleaning the blades, switching the passenger side to the driver's side, to no avail. THESE WIPER BLADES DO NOT WORK PERIOD. I will say, they were the easiest to install blades I've ever owner. I've had them installed for 3 days.

A complete waste of 15 dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this or I shall taunt you again","review":"My sister went to New York and all I got was this FANTASTIC trebuchet! My son and nieces (ages 8 and 9) have been playing with it for a week and it's held up just fine. It's sturdy, well constructed and works great. They've been having target practices with the farm animals. Even though the giggle-value alone makes it worth the price, it's a good toy, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 2 year son loves this movie","review":"If your son is into firefighters or firetrucks he will LOVE this movie.

I returned the first one I ordered and the second one I received had the exact same problem. Do not buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun for a toddler","review":"My 2 year old loves this video. It's about 45 minutes long. It's kind of hard to explain what this video shows. It's got lots of montages of fire trucks and Bryan visits other stations and shows how the ladder works. But, the footage is all 20+ years old. Then, about 3/4 of the way through, there's a montage about calling 911 that looks like it was shot in the 2000s. The music is very dated and the video quality is not great. Much of it seems to be shot with a camcorder. That being said, a 2 year old doesn't know the difference and my guy LOVES this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"I can't watch this video. After the 3 mins of sirens and chrome, flashing, dashing firetrucks, which is what we all wanted - right kids? It degenerates into showing firefighters with bad hair eating breakfast to the backdrop lyrics 'everybody needs a hero' (- James, Age 2)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Holds attention!!","review":"My 22 month old son enjoys this video! it doesn't hold his attention the entire time, but not much does. My 4 year old nephew was visiting for the holidays, and once he saw this video he kept asking to watch it again and again. Good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"How disappointing to see the same old, same old represented here. While a few voices are fresh and interesting, the majority (whose poems have been encountered in too many publications lately) feel stale. This anthology contributes nothing new to the broad and exciting spectrum of today's poetry. See American Poetry: The Next Generation for a more democratic and surprising vision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice concert, professional capture","review":"Nice concert from a great band, I enjoyed every minute of it.

Tunes that did the most for me were \\"Analonihium\\", the awesome (almost) ballad-like \\"A Beautiful Child\\", title track \\"Through The Glass Darkly\\" and \\"Everything Is Coming To An End\\". Best factor this CD import has going for it is the band's playing. Line-up: Daniele Caputo (of Standarte) - drums & lead vocals, Stefano Gabbani (also, of Standarte) - bass, Gianni Vergelli - guitars and Gianluca Gerlini - Hammond C3, piano, mellotron & clavinet. Fans of - say - Uriah Heep, Atomic Rooster and {obviously} Standarte would likely get the most enjoyment out of the disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a successful collaboration","review":"Having been a fan of Robert Asprin for a number of years, and having been impressed with prior collaborations of Jody Lynn Nye, I found \\"License Invoked\\" a disappointment. Little about this book has the ring of truth necessary for a good fantasy. The characters have an unpleasant, one-dimensional feel to them: a perpetually annoyed, insecure, English government agent; an upper-class Englishwoman masquerading as an Irish 'acid-folk' singer; a French Quarter denizen on the government payroll. Combined with goverment agencies specialising in the paranormal (X-Files anyone), a Satanic version of tele-evangelism, and you are left with a mixture that doesn't jell. There is a certain disconnected air to the story, as if neither Asprin or Nye had any real interest in the tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"I'll usually buy anything by Robert Asprin - his \\"Cold Cash War\\" makes my top ten sci-fi books ever. This book read like a poor attempt to create another Thieves World franchise. The characters aren't engaging, the events fairly ho-hum. Save your time. Read his Myth series instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minus 1 star for a mixed beginning","review":"I'm glad to see Asprin back to writing on a regular schedule.These two authors 'invoke' a good story with personable chemistry between the protagonists. So why only two stars?The beginning, so important to hooking a reader, is a jumble of mixed messages, and doesn't do justice to the plot or characters assembled.Never confuse a reader as to whether you are going to \\"romp\\" or deliver careful characters. When the material starts out slyly poking fun with odd government agencies like \\"O.O.P.S.I.E.\\", you expect you are going to read \\"screwball comedy\\", which is a place the authors have creative gifts.But this is actually a murder and black magic story -- a pretty good one.If you can roll past the first thirty pages of mixed signals, you might find a nice story here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Least from one of the best.","review":"I read about the first 30 pages and could go no further. The Myth series and the Phule series are both excellent, and hopefully Mr. Asprin's next book will be equal to his past works. Unfortunately \\"License Invoked\\" falls far short of expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"The review from \\"a music fan from Texas\\" is my best friend's","review":"Well, clearly my best friend and I are utter loons for Fine China. While this is their first release on a \\"known\\" label, this synth pop outfit has actually been around for a couple years now. Several of their releases were available for awhile from Velvet Blue Music; it's very interesting to note their evolution from a paradoxically subtle guitar-driven pop to a more radio-friendly, yet still marvelously elegant, electronic sound. Check these guys out."},{"rating":"2","title":"There are treasures in the desert sands of Phoenix","review":"What I most admire about Fine China is their ability to take 25 or 30 years of influences, and make their own sound so cohesive. If you find yourself missing the catchy and melodic songsmithing of bands like New Order, The Smiths, The Cure or The Pretenders, then you should absolutely check out the Fine China clan. Rob Withem's vocals are pristine, ethereal and beyond reproach. Add to that the New Wave beats, the luscious layered synths, the jangly guitars, and sumptious bass lines, and you've got all the makings of a definite favorite record for those that just aren't satisfied with the Top 40 drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE NORMAL BOOK FOR LEARNER,THE WORST FOR NATIVE SPEAKERS.","review":"I have openned this book and surprised by all translations.I am native Turkmen and this book could be better written by native speaker of this language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Commentary on Galatians by Martin Luther","review":"Commentary was for a Christmas present.

Specifically, the lack of a table of contents.There are 3470 locations in this book. At the very least, they could have put in a table of contents to get you to each of the six chapters. Instead, you have to guess where the passage begins.In a novel or other linear work, the lack of a table of contents is a slight annoyance. In any reference work, especially a Bible commentary, it is flat-out a deal breaker."},{"rating":"2","title":"very inspiring book","review":"A Book of Angels is a very inspiring and comforting book.

The solution, as often in Perry Mason mysteries, involves a whole lot of new data for the reader to digest. In this particular book, the data are actually clearer and more relevant than usual. But in return, they're less believable. The murderer's plot is too elaborate to work as well as it does, and the murderer's hidden authority would, in the real world, have been known to the police months or years before.I don't mind. The ending is exciting and, as always, the story flows with magical smoothness. Very well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"An honest account","review":"This is not a bad book at all. I honestly enjoyed it for a number of reasons. First, there are not a lot of books dealing with the Italian Campaign in WWII. This book covers one man's journey from Anzio to the Italian Alps. Second it mentions a number of military units not commonly written about, such as the joint Canadian and American 1st Special Services division and the South African 6th Armored Division.On another note, I get the feeling that while the author was very young at the time of the war, he grew up very quickly, but still had some adolescent tendencies that he struggled with. I suppose this is part of his growing up in a twisted world. The book ends abruptly, and I won't spoil it for you. But I did enjoy the fact he admitted he came back from the war, troubled, angry, addicted to cigarettes and alcohol. Probably, because I have found myself in the same shoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous product","review":"This is very awkward to install.

I haven't heard Liszt played with such vigor and passion before. Andsnes gives a fresh, exhilirating interpretation of the Dante Sonata, and his performances of other works such as the Mephisto waltzes are equally compelling. This is one of the most exciting recent recordings of solo piano music I've heard. My only regret is that Andsnes hasn't recorded Liszt's other works for the piano. I have no doubt that such performances would be equally spellbinding. The sound quality is superb, comparable in quality to what I've heard on EMI's recordings of Stephen Kovacevich's ongoing Beethoven piano sonata cycle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving and incredible","review":"This cd is amazing, I can't imagine listening to it without being moved. It will take you somewhere beyond the everyday experience, your imagination will come alive. True, the overall tone of it is dark, but I would hardly call it \\"depressing\\". After listening to the whole cd, I am left in a different state than before, a state of awe. This cd was the first time I heard Liszt, and he's been one of my favorites ever since."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mystical thriller","review":"This is a book I have reread countless times, and it is always fresh. It renews my appreciation for reality, for the simple material world, and reminds me of the mystical potential lying beneath the surface we see. I especially enjoy the heroine's journey from self-absorption to concern and compassion, and the hero who rises to the occasion to rescue his friends and incidentally the world. One of my favorite books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this edition!","review":"I bought this wonderful book as a gift.

It is not for everyone, but if you are one who contemplates the greater meaning of things, or enjoy reading about the interaction of the natural with the supernatural, you will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesesting but overpriced collection","review":"If you love Bob Hope, or have a morbid fascination with typical mediocre movies of the period, you'll enjoy this collection, because they depend on Bob Hope, rather than a good script. Further, as others have noted, these movies were not remastered. If you can find the collection for $10, it would be worth buying, but not for more than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reviewing wrong product","review":"Most of the reviews so far are for VOLUME 1, not this VOLUME 2. Don't be mislead, Volume 2 films are a pretty bad group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough detail in areas","review":"This book was required for School. I had never touched VB until this class, and this book was not very helpful to me and every one else in the class. When I got to chapter 5 it felt like all I had done was type in code presented in the book. There was very little explanation as to why you were doing some things. It really appears that there was not enough room for explanation because of the layout. The class ended up buying the \\"Teach Yourself VB.Net in 24 hour\\" from Sam Publishing. The Sams book breaks the code down in a much more understanding way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crammed","review":"I purchased this book because it claims to be easy to learn VB. Although this book does make certain tasks involved in writing VB code seem easy, they certainly are not. I think the major problem with this book is the fact that they use a \\"two page\\" approach to teaching. This means the explanation is on the left page and some \\"examples\\" on the right page. This is OK, except that some, if not most, tasks in VB require more than one page to explain. Therefore, the reader is left to try to guess and search for the concept the authors are trying to convey in the one-page explanation.I was forced to put this book aside and purchase another book that has more detailed explanations on what I'm trying to learn. This book IS NOT for the beginner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this book!","review":"This author is TERRIBLE at trying to teach VB.NET. I don't know about his other books, but I will NEVER buy one of them again! He makes too many assumptions that you already know a lot about VB.NET. His \\"example\\" coding is horrible. I have some programming experience (although it is somewhat dated) but he gives about a paragraph or two to the topic, then writes a little piece of code, then sums it all up and expects you to be an expert at it. I need a sample of the code and how it works, not just the line it goes in. I would highly recommend you keep looking and NOT buy this terrible book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sylvain does it all","review":"I really enjoyed this. This record is the sound of a very accomplished journeyman rock and roller doing it all, very stylistically diverse and always compelling.

It's a first-person account of an intelligent person disabled by alcoholism. He's an individual. He doesn't represent everyone in his category. Its value is in the intimate look inside the mind of an addict and how he makes decisions. I was especially interested in the lies he tells himself to get different effects. For example, he says, to stop drinking for two days he must *decide* to stop for a month. His description of the pain that drives him to drink is vivid and heartbreaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I was looking for.","review":"I live in southern Michigan, in the slush and salt.

Most the Zen Books out there right now are not that simple to understand and have terminology you have to be a Buddhist scholar to interpret. Also, check out Open Mind Zen - it's another American Zen style book that is intelligible to the average reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect, many things I didn't want to hear","review":"This book was very helpful in trying to grasp Zen, which, I guess, is ungraspable. It was full of many things I didn't want to hear about reality, that is why I love the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great beginning... that was about it...","review":"I loved the opening of the first chapter, and the metaphor about what we call ourselves being nothing more than a whirlpool in the river of life. Great metaphor. Love it.The rest of the book seemed to me to be teaching (and Zen specifically has no teaching and is the destroyer of teachings) and emotions. Beck's slant on Zen seems to me to be getting people to meditated for years (according to her it takes years) and work work work at it. But Zen is not about that, it is about \\"nothing to attain and no one to attain it\\" period. All this working at it that she recommends fosters a subtle sense of egoism, a belief that there is some goal to reach, something to gain.Perhaps Beck is working with people whose lives are disasters and she is having to keep them busy in the hope that they will someday finally get it???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you to the previous 5 reviewers!","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read, and I have the thoughtful people who recommended it to thank. Joko Beck's straightforward, no nonsense approach makes Zen practice a day-to-day, moment-to-moment experience that truly changes the way you see yourself and the world, but ONLY if you work diligently. I love the way she refuses to promise a blissful, enlightened life, yet engages you to strive for pure joy, whether happy OR sad. I am now looking forward to reading Everyday Zen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed my life.","review":"\\"Nothing Special\\" subtley shifted my perspective of many things. The first reading stirred up my mind and made me very uncomfortable. Its a whole different way to look at everyday living. Joko teaches you how to \\"see\\" things as they really are. Slowly and with persistence, you begin to see who you really are without all the drama. This book helped to set me free. My husband and I would read a chapter everynight to each other. We read the book over and over, each time understanding more and experiencing it more deeply. Now our lives are so different. Its really worth reading. thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet story set in small Texas town","review":"Ms. Woods has again captured the essence of small town life. While this takes place in Texas, it could be any small town throughout the southern US. The interaction of Mary Lou, her teacher Anne and the members of the singles continuing education class will leave you with the feeling that friends can help you overcome almost anything. And, when you learn where the title of the book comes from, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. Everything from life behind the counter at Dairy Queen to a gypsy gathering are in this book. If you like Jan Karon's Mitford books or Billie Letts' Where the Heart Is, I think you'll also enjoy spending time with Roseborough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely outdated","review":"When I bought this book, I didn't realize it was published in 1990, so there is nada regarding the internet.

There really is nothing new or groundbreaking in this book. To me, this was just a quick way for him to capitalize on his \\"Guerrilla Brand Name\\" to make an extra buck with recycled information.

However, this chair has NO recline positions, it has only one setting and that is extremely reclined. My son is practically lying back once he is seated. It leads him to slide down and slouch, making it very difficult to feed him, or for him to pick at food on the tray. Also, it is a very flimsy design, making it easy to tip over, if baby were too active.I would not recommend this chair to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"Not a good high chair.

The author never misses a chance to slam this woman in an attempt to garner more sympathy for the husband. Anything the husband does is described in the most flattering terms possible. Such a single-minded account does not ring true and the simple minded writing is annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a step under GOD","review":"You sure can tell that the accused was helping to write this book. I think this is one of the worst books I have read in ages. Paul Dunn would like the world to know what a champ he is. I, for one have decided he is anything but. I feel bad for his dead wife. He has placed himself right up there with god. I sure think that he probably got away with MURDER. This was a very disappointing book. DO NOT BOTHER WITH THIS BOOK!!!!!!! It is very one sided and slow moving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bias","review":"This book appears to be extremly one sided. The book is written to give you the impression that there was no way the husband would be guilty. It seems to me that there were things left out to give that impression. I also think that whether the husband did it or not he is still directly responsible regardless of how this book paints it. I also didn't know the Rio Grand River ran through the northwest corner of New Mexico.Given this fact is wrong I wonder how many others are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not true","review":"I happen to know exactly what happened throughout the ordeal of Paul Dunn and his trial. All of you who believe this is a truthful story have been decieved. He left out very vital information that led you to believe that he was completely innocent. He failed to mention how he managed to hide the evidence that led to the verdict. Paul got lucky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I say this was Feather's worst?....","review":"I usually enjoy Jane Feather's novels. But this one really disappointed. It was very long, but only because I found it tedious to get through. Magdalen just seemed like the worst spoiled brat. I just kept getting very upset with the way the character acted and the choices that Magdalen made. The plot was a little outrageous, too. What 11 year old even thinks of true and lasting love? The leading male characters aren't even memorable. The entire novel seemed to focus on Magdalen's wants and how she was bound and determined to get it at any cost. It was simply ridiculous. My reaction once FINALLY finishing the thing, was to throw it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me....","review":"I have read three Jane Feather novels (the Bride trilogy) and enjoyed them immensely. However, this novel was not what I thought it would be. From the very beginning, I didn't buy into the love story between Magdalen and Guy. When they started having an affair, (she was still married, but her husband was asssumed dead), I was fairly disgusted by the whole thing and I quickly lost interest in the whole book. Of course, this is just my opinion...but I was very disappointed. I liked the character of Guy, but I think he could have been utilized in a better way with a different type of heroine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Innocent Enough","review":"I first fell in love with Jane Feather's work with WIDOW'S KISS and went on to read some previous works. I picked up this one and was intrigued by the story line. After reading some of these reviews, I still thought I'd give it a try for myself. I love historicals, especially medievals and am very familiar with that part of history. Knowing that in those days girls were betrothed as young as 8 or 9 years old, her young age didn't bother me. It was the adultery I couldn't get my mind around. Let's be real. In those days, if it were known, she'd have been hanged or tortured to death. Eloquent prose is one thing, having a \\"heroine\\" commit the unpardonable is another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"This book is a little long and was boring. I think that Jane Feather writes well and she could have done better with the story. I hated the relationship between Magdalen and Guy, it grosed me out that she would cheat on her husband even though she knew he was alive. I felt so bad for Edmund and how his life turned out. I did not like the ending because it was predictable and it was unfair. I think that this book was okay and that people should read it only if they are bored out of their minds with nothing to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"An excruciatingly read","review":"This book is packed with historical content. As far as the storyline and character development goes, a quote from Thumper's mom (in Bambi) comes to mind: \\"If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all.\\"Enough said.Kerry Atkins"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never again...","review":"I just finished this book tonight and I must say that I will probably never read another Jane Feather book again. My sister-in-law recommended Jane Feather books to me since I am an avid reader of historical romance novels and I am sorely disappointed. This is my first and last Jane Feather book. The story line was not only predicatable, but it revolved around a selfish female and weak, pathetic men. Moreover, the infidelity and childish lust killed the story for me. I found nothing positive about this work and can't wait get rid of this book. Atleast I learned a good lesson in this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful waste of time","review":"There was nothing romantic about this book. The characters were dull. The heroine purposefully set out to commit adultery and did so, without a modicum of guilt. This is especially disturbing b/c her husband, Edmund, was not a bad character at all. The hero is somewhat, just there,he's not compelling at all. The only thing that was notable about him was the fact that he only committed adultery/cuckolded his nephew because he thought he, Edmund, was really dead. Meanwhile, the heroine \\"just knew he was alive\\" all along and didn't give a care. When the heroine supposedly \\"grows into a woman\\", I find myself rooting against her until the end. She is amoral and immature. This book is a huge waste of time/money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Insufferable Heroine","review":"I could not recommend this book, the characters were just not ones that I could give a hoot about. Adulterous, selfish heroine; this book could've easily been half the size and virtually nothing crucial to the story would've been harmed--namely, because there wasn't much of a plot.

This book though is more for the History Student and Literature kind of person. I myself am just a simple housewife and mom and if I have to search the dictionary more than three times to know what the author is saying or learn to speak french than I have lost all interest. I just want a simple historical romance with perhaps a little history to set the scene but too much of anything is no good. I don't speak french and I didn't study old english so it was quite unenjoyable to read this book. Also, it was nice and very well done of Jane Feather to be so accurate to the times but if the buyer of the book doesn't understand it what good is her accuracy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent Optics Poor Construction","review":"You get what you pay for.

In the original recording, made in the 60's, there were 3 soloists, each of them sang more beautifully than Sosa, and as a group of 3 it was much more interesting and exciting.Second, these 2 most beutifull pieces turn here to be on the verge of kitch - worser, on the verge of \\"world music\\"!The tempo that ricardo hagman choose is slow, so slow, but without any intrinsic reason, unless - and i suspect that this the truth - he wanted to sound very \\"spiritual\\"...I suggest to any one who wants to listen to the real thing to buy the original recording.

He was confident Germany would defeat all of her opponents and rule Europe. He didn't figure on the Japanese however and once the war began however he wanted to contribute but not in uniform (afraid of Roosevelt ordering him to a cubby hole somewhere) so he found jobs testing aircraft and giving flying advice to pilots in the South Pacific.

Alagna's beautiful tenor tone is truly amazing throughout the CD and his perfect French diction is very enjoyable. After listening mr. Alagna's French I prefer him to anyone else I've heard singing this repertoire. IMO the loveliest songs are \\"Je pense à vous\\" with the easy high C# and the light \\"Vainement, ma bien-aimée\\". I think the arias from Le Cid and Samson are a bit too heavy for him, but however, he sings them with the great interpretative power. It's possible that he uses a little too much pianissimo in the Bizet aria, but on the other hand that's where I think his voice is at its best. Nothing can take the fifth star away! This CD will be with me anywhere I go..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fabulous and elegant recording","review":"Roberto Alagna brings great style and sensitivity to this intriguing collection of famous and lesser-known arias.

A MUST HAVE for fans of Roberto and French opera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Then again, you could just be blind","review":"This album is it. This is far and away the best album of all of 2000. You might have to be a fan to understand, particularly in a rare live setting, but this album delivers a progression with Sixteen Horsepower that is unrivaled in many bands careers. The elements that defined their sound in early recordings, and proved to be strong, are stripped away to the basics, allowing the writing of the songs to combine with the delicate and layered music that just bursts forth like no other.

Not this band. Vocalist David Eugene Edwards still comes across like he's charming the snakes from the hills, setting the album afire with his views of heaven and hell. By the third listen the entire set sinks in and that's it, you will be throwing this offering on the player almost every day. It's that intriguing.Take it from someone who normally runs from country to embrace a Nine Inch Nails CD. This harmonious album surpasses all musical boundaries and ultimately conquers them all. 16 HP delivers haunting, soul-driven music for folks bored with the mundane drivel set before the masses. 16HP is the real deal, kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sadness","review":"It is sad that this sound has been strictly located w/in Denver for so many years (that is, of course excluding its tremendous success in Europe).

It claims that with a few simple hand tools (and a lot of C-clamps), a neophyte can produce a very nice canoe in a reasonably short period of time, which I found to be true. The author breaks the construction process down into some 260 small steps, which makes it difficult to get confused or frustrated. It's apparent that the author had taken many students through the building process before he wrote the book. Then, once the canoe is built, he goes into great detail on painting and varnishing, where I was surprised to see how little I already knew.

Berlin is NOT brought to life convincingly at all and in fact I grew tired of yet another description of the piles of brick which made up the city there in mid-1945.One problem I had is that the characters are so poorly rendered it was impossible to muster much enthusiasm for their travails. The Americans are indistinguishable from one another and Jake Geismar (the 'hero') himself is far too sketchily drawn (no small feat when he appears on each of the 481 pages) to be of any interest at all.Save your money (and save a big hunk of time) and buy the Alan Furst books.

This is a really cool WWII thriller that readers will really enjoy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"This book had a lot of potential. The post WWII Berlin setting and the dynamics of looking back at what had been done during the war - It's a captivating subject: Wondering how Germany people had been able to watch and be involved with the atrocities; the jockeying of the US and Russia knowing they'd be adversaries after the war; the scrambling to acquire German technical secrets and experts.The history surrounding the book was what kept me reading. But the plot of this novel is convoluted, the relationships are not well realized, and there are some coincidences that are totally unbelievable. Honestly I should have stopped reading after the second blatantly unrealistic plot connection, but like an addict, I kept reading on. Wasn't worth it. Kanon is a capable writer and good at dialogue, but this book is way too long, a complicated mess and it feels like it was unsuccessfully pared down from many more pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been so much better","review":"I was really gripped by this book to start with. The descriptions of Berlin, the people, Jake's yearning for Lena... But after he finds her (all too easily) it all goes downhill. Why does he care so much about the \\"mystery\\" ? Why is he prepared to put his own life, and hers, at risk ? I lost interest in the twists and turns so much that when eventually the \\"villians\\" were revealed I'd forgotten who they were. A much better book would have simply been about Jake's search for Lena and her struggle to come to terms with what happened to her and her country. The \\"mystery\\" was unnecessary. And one other thing really bothered me (spoiler alert !) - when he first finds her she can't even bear his touch after her horrors at the hands of the Russians. Then 5 mins later its all la-di-da and this is never mentioned again. Not believable I'm afraid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atmospheric Drama","review":"The soap operatic whodunit/love story of THE GOOD GERMAN is entertaining enough, but the real gift of this author is his ability to recreate the atmosphere of Berlin at the end of WWII.

This is one of the most tedious books I've ever tried to read, and one of only perhaps half a dozen I've had to give up on in the last 40 years. I think it's unfortunate that it is so poorly done, because the essential story could have had merit if the author wasn't so overburdened in his love of detail and too many names. He also relies on continually repeating a description of wartown Berlin. After the first dozen or so examples, it's time to move plot, not focus on setting. I regretfully suggest you skip this book.

In fact, this is one of the rare books I simply couldn't force myself to finish - not because is was \\"scary\\" in any way, but for the simple reason that life is too short to waste valuable reading time with drivel like this.

Murphy gives a satisfying and stimulating introduction to biblical Wisdom literature (including Sirach and Wisdom of Solomon) as well as treatments on Wisdom intertextuality, theology, and the metaphor of Woman Wisdom. However, the layout of the book - moving updates to separate appendices - makes it cumbersome to read, and Murphy's methodology leaves something to be desired. All in all, this is an invaluable resource for lay readers and those without an extensive background in Wisdom studies, but the more advanced scholar will probably be disappointed in this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets the job done","review":"This book covers everything that is necessary for the exam. It was pretty well organized, and covers everything in enough depth to answer exam questions. The only thing missing is the end of chapter \\"cram outline\\" - something to stuff into your brain just before the exam.The book did not always incorporate Microsoft's guidance on design issues - what's really included on the exam. I found that the slide decks from Tech Ed (find the one on CA's!) did a better job preparing me for the exam. This exam requires a lot of real world experience - anyone with a CISSP certification should well.The CD has only a few sample questions (mostly not on security), but provides access to the web site for the additional questions. The CD does duplicate the exam format, which is substantially different than the old exams. The CD software crashed with Dr. Watson errors on an NT Workstation, so it took several tries to get through the practice exams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef?","review":"The useful information in this book could easily have been condensed into 25-50 pages.

My other gripe is that the only challenge posed by the questions at the end of the chapters is that they are ambiguous or otherwise poorly worded, often leading to incorrect conclusions.If you buy this book, you will be back looking for a replacement pretty quick.. take a look at the \\"Designing Microsoft Windows Network Security MSCE Training Kit\\" from MS Press as an alternative, and definitely pick up the MCSE Readiness Review for a better look at what an actually test might be like."},{"rating":"1","title":"A wee bit mild","review":"I am a FULL-ON tea drinker.

I also gave the planer a thorough cleaning and lubing while it was apart.Now all that it needed to was a new set of planer knives. I found the Freud C600 knives and ordered them. They arrived quickly and in perfect shape. Installing the knives went quickly because I still had the Ryobi blade alignment tool.

Perfectly visible with the naked eye, once you look closely. So much so that it is not possible to adjust correctly. So I have some useless blades and can't return them.

Not much substance here, some explosions, a few thrills, he gets the girl, kills the bad guy, yada yada. Boring for 90% of the population, but delightful for the other ten. I am with the majority for once on this one, however, as Cruise is even more ridiculous this time around. If they had an award for the actor who can somehow manage to overact WHILE showing no emotion at the same time, he would win every year. Maybe for MI4 he can be in one of those power-scooters those senior citizens drive around, and could engage in battles that way.

Number one was a classic, number two was a waste of time and number three looked like another Tom Cruise classic; however at the end of the movie I was still waiting for a plot. Tom Cruise never really had an objective of the movie and also all of the \\"bad guys\\" weren't really pointed out in the movie. The movie was just things blowing up, fake technology that is even impossible in the future (i'm a chemical engineer can one really be ID by their vascular arteries). Even though I'm back at home I'm still waiting for a plot...or atleast a badly organized plot, some type of objective. I would say see the movie just to confirm that there was no plot and that Tom Cruise shouldn't produce and star in his own movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"WITLESS, DERIVATIVE AND GRIM","review":"Not for a moment did I suspend disbelief at this meaningless spectacle of mayhem and contrived superficial emotion interspersed with loud, over-the-top action set pieces.By paying to see this movie, I felt guilty supporting an increasingly bizarre and crazy man's delusional, controlling behaviour. Yes, I'm talking about Tom Cruise. I heard other movie goers expressing the same thoughts. So I'm not alone.My gut feeling is that some of the Amazon reviewers who praised this movie are Paramount plants. Even my 12 year old son thought the movie was \\"boring\\" and he laughed when he heard the familiar notes of the Mission Impossible theme. He said he couldn't \\"take it seriously and the plot was ridiculous.\\" So if this wasn't made for 12 year old boys, who was it made for? Not young adults, that's for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the 2nd, more enjoyable than the first","review":"MI:3 was a thrilling movie. I mean literally, from start to finish, it was non-stop action. It was certainly and adrenaline rush. Tom Cruise is perfect once more, as Ethan Hunt. I loved him in this. For all you Cruise Bashers, get over it. This movie did extremely well. And the USA is not the end point for film gross.The acting by everyone is really good and its a fun guessing game as to who is the real bad guy. The first Mission Impossible is actually the better of the 3, in terms of plot. However, this film is certainly more entertaining and it just feels fresher. And for a M I film, I found it more believable than the first one and less confusing. And the great thing is, you really don't need to watch any of the other M I movies to understand this one. Its a great stand-alone film."},{"rating":"2","title":"CRUISE CONTROL","review":"Definitely the best of the three, this one is at least a bit credible. I thought Phillip Seymore Hoffman made a good sociopath, frankly I wish he had been in it more. This movie is definitely action packed, it's exhaustively so, actually. I really not a big fan of these Mission movies, they are not nearly as good as the Bourne films, but this one kept me interested and I didnt find myself rolling my eyes as much as I had in the other two Mission movies. I appreciated that they gave Ethan a genuine love interest, and I liked how much of the movie was in flashback, that made it more riviting. After the second Mission movie I was not looking forward to another, but after seeing this, I'd definitely see another. Like I stated earlier, this is hardly up to any of the great Bourne movies, but without a question worth a viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action Roller-Coaster Ride from Start to Finish!","review":"I have watched this movie over 5 times, and I still love every minute!If you are an action fan, you will not be dissapointed in this one!The HD Transfer is so clean you can see the pores in Tom Cruise's Face, and the sound is excellent also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"The kind of action movie I like, suspense, intrigue and I want to watch it again.

If you love how films are made, checking out the HD-DVD version is a must!This is the second HD-DVD I've watched, and Picture-in-Picture video commentary is like nothing you've seen before. Unlike regular DVD and Blu-Ray audio commentary, you watch the film along with Tom Cruise and JJ Abrams as they watch the film too. When they want to talk in detail about a scene, they pause the movie! And their commentary video continues! Absolutely amazing. They will talk about alternate takes and deleted scenes and you can immediately view them right there by clicking a button (you don't have to pop in the second extras disc to see deleted scenes). Seeing these creative pros talk to each other adds so much more than just a normal commentary audio track. You can see the excitement and the energy they put into their work.

As if this were not enough, I found that the characters never materialized as real and complete human beings. While there were glimpses of what it might have been like in the early days of the frontier, it often seemed to be taking place in today's world of corruption and violence.

I never believed for a second that these characters lived in the 1700s, what with all the late 20th century pop psychology running through the narration.

The film has sparks of greatness but fails. Some scenes like the ball scence and Anna's death are beautifuly shot and succeed and most others just seem lukewarm. Levin story is cut to only to a few minutes they probably should have not included him and just focused on Anna's story in my opinion.

I think Sophie Marceau is wonderful, but not in this movie. Either she just did not 'get' Anna, or the director didn't; either way, the movie reduces to nothing more than a beautiful woman walking thru various scenes. [As was the version with Jaqueline Bisset].The two great Annas are first, Garbo's (a straight take on the novel, less a romance and more a movie of social mores and the injustice of the divorce laws that was Tolstoy's focus). The second was with Vivian Leigh, done as a deeply romantic tragedy, and much the twin of her equally brilliant, equally tragic, and often overlooked 'Waterloo Bridge'.I own and cherish these three films; buy them !

How awful!! Obviously, the director wanted to draw a line between the classes, but to do it so awkwardly... Yes, Russian high classes were used to mix their Russian speach with French, but there has never been such a total language barrier as the director tries to convince us.I was also surprised to see some good actors giving such totally wooden performances!I doubt the film gets any better towards the end, though I will never know that for I couldn't bring myself to watch it for long (even out of curiosity) as it pained me greatly to see one of the finest works of literature spoiled so heartlessly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad","review":"This adaptation of Tolstoy's classic novel gets off to a bad start with a laughably ludicrous dream sequence and never recovers.

This is something completely different and completely awful.Why?The book written by count Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy is brilliant masterpiece of Russian and world literature. This novel is really big.

And, of course, such gallop has nothing in common with the original. No idea. No style.The actors are pretty bad, screenplay is awful, the movie is kind of waste.If U will have ability to watch this movie - dont do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendor & tragedy.","review":"The initial scene with Molina caught between a pack of wolves and a bear in a pit, really horrors us. At this anguish moment, his memory about the events of his live tells us his story. He introduces in the upper class Tzar society of the initial 20th century Russia. Molina marries a rich maiden, whose love for him was doubtful. Anna is part of this opulent class, and takes part of the palace parties, whose splendor is the greatest part of the film. Her love for the military man takes her away from her husband and son. The final and tragic moment, in this version seems as a mannequin thrown in the rails. This scene really is a disappointment. Back to Molina, the scene in the pit does not conclude in the film. We suppose he has been eaten by the bear when he falls down, if we are negative, or if we are positive he had survive when someone shoot at the wolves and rescue him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoax","review":"The movie did not not play at home DVD, it does not play on the computer either, contacted the seller, never got theresponse. It looks like the movie was burned at home...lack of credibility, simply a hoax would never buy any items from this seller again."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow passionless Anna","review":"Slow, passionless, pointless production of a complicated masterpiece. No fire. No passion. Boring. and even worse: trying watching it without knowing who it is or what it is about!! Clueless."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautifully filmed tragic love story","review":"Sophie Marceau was excellent as Anna Karenina. Sean Bean's portrayal of Vronsky was only so-so. The costumes are gorgeous, and the storyline good. A recommended watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wooden acting. Marceau as Anna is NOT in love. No wonder.","review":"I was disappointed in the main characters in this movie. Marceau was not convincing in her love- sick portrayal of Anna. She is a beautiful woman with great acting potential but the chemistry with Bean was understandably nonexistent. He was very wooden/passionless and terribly miscast as Vronsky"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophie Marceau Spoiled It","review":"Sorry, I just couldn't get into this version of the movie. I began watching it on TV this evening. I've read the book, which is one of the most brilliant classics ever written in my opinion. I also saw a TV series several years ago starring Nicola Paget. This series, I thought, made a pretty good attempt at being faithful to the book, and Nicola Paget portrayed the beautiful, troubled Anna in a most believable way.Sophie Marceau, however, was too far removed from what I perceived Anna must have looked and acted like. Marceau seemed more like an ordinary present day college girl caught in a time warp. She didn't look particularly beautiful (and those straight bangs didn't help any!) and one couldn't help but wonder why Vronsky would give her a second glance.Considering the lofty quality of the book, this movie was pretty ordinary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat-Unmoving","review":"How do you describe to someone a disaster on screen? You show them this movie.The worst performance that i have ever seen from Sean Bean(Vronsky) and Sophie Marceau(Anna).There was no spark between them ,the acting was totaly wooden.The only thing worth watching was the performance of Alfred Molina(Lenvin), but his persona alone was not able to hold the fort.It did have some nice cinematography,still was not enogh to save this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"'The Whistling Season'","review":"I like Doig's writing style. Very calm but holds your attention. The one room school was interesting.Am planning to buy The Bartender's Tales."},{"rating":"2","title":"A heartfelt tale.","review":"This book was a gentle, quiet, enjoyable, poignant, funny, sobering read. It is so nice to read a story about real life, not \\"forced\\" real life. It seemed almost like a screenplay, the images were so vivid. I appreciated the author's characterization and after finishing the book I am saddened to remember that those people in the book aren't living breathing folks - yet, they must be, in some sense. They must be an amalgamation of souls from the West's epic history.This was a heartfelt tale that left me sad to lose, inspired to live, and grateful for family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just magnificent","review":"This is such a good read on so many levels. I've given it to six people since its paperback release, and everyone has loved it, especially those whose families have one room schoolhouses in their history. Beautiful. I hope Doig brings back Morrie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Whistling Season","review":"It's no suprise, Ivan Doig can write. I've read almost all of his books and loved everyone of them. I didn't realize he wrote comedy, but he has in The Whistling Season. I laughted out loud over an over again. He has a way of making you feel you are an invisible part of the story. The intensity you feel is wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeply affecting","review":"I was deeply affected by this coming-of-age novel set in the Montana prairie of 1910. The story is told by Paul Milliron who remembers one important year in his childhood, when he was 13. He and his two younger brothers have recently lost their mother. Their father, Oliver--in trying to deal with being father, mother and homesteader--responds to an ad in the Minneapolis newspaper for a housekeeper and hires widow Rose Lewellyn. She arrives on the train, unexpectedly bringing along her brother, Morris Morgan, who is later hired to teach in the one-room school. My favorite scenes are those of Morris responding with marvelous creativity to a job he had never considered, but seems to have been born to. Paul's crossover to adulthood relates to his discovery of a secret about Rose and Morris and how he handles it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of my TOP WORST READS!!!","review":"This was a book club choice to read and I must say that only 3 of 13 of us even finished the book. The era isn't one of particular interest to me, however I hung strong until the very end anxiously WAITING for the climax of the novel. The twist didn't come until almost the very end of the book. This book was so piecemeal, I was truly difficult to tie many nonrelevant events to the \\"story\\". Don't waste your time - I wish I could get mine back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FIlled out series","review":"Ihad loaned this book to a friend who did not return it.

One of those books I am so glad to have read and will recommend. Also enjoyed the historical perspective of the United States at that time of one room school houses, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whistling Season","review":"The Kindle edition was very poorly transcribed. There were so many misspellings that it became a real distraction while reading. I enjoy reading on my Kindle but I felt cheated on this book. The story is great, just don't get it on your Kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Story....Beautiful Writing","review":"Ivan Doig, a Montana writer, is one of my favorite writers. His descriptions of Montana, makes the reader \\"see\\" the beautiful state.This family story is one of courage, intellect, and adventure. Teachers I have loaned my copy, think it is a great book. Although the days of the one room schools are gone, we know the impact on education in Montana and other places of the their contributions to our society.I would suggest teachers, parents and students read THE WHISTLING SEASON.I have read Doig's other books, but this one is my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet story from the past","review":"It is difficult to pigeonhole this book into a particular genre. Although one of the primary characters is a teenage boy, it isn't really a coming of age story. However, that character is presented with a choice to make that is tough for one of his years. This is a story of a rural Montana community, particularly the type that is developed in a one-room school in 1909. The story is told in a gentle, and sometimes humorously insightful style. It definitely isn't a plot driven story. However, I enjoyed the characters, and the glimpse into a bygone era. I look forward to reading more from this author in the future.The kindle edition did have some typos that were mildly annoying. I expected more given the price and the publisher."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Whistling Season","review":"Loved it. Just could't put it down. What a wonderful experience those children had with that talented teacher! One-room schools were a blessing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly fine writing","review":"I chose this novel because Amazon suggested it to me and because of its high rating by readers. I had never heard of this author. I now consider him one of our best contemporary writers. I think of him as a kind of Mark Twain of the prairie. His characters are well developed and his descriptions are often pure poetry. The humor is subtle and not to be missed. Finally, this author, unlike so many others , knows how long to string out his plot and how to bring the story to a conclusion. Everyone in my book club enjoyed this book, and you will, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Whistling Season by Ivan Doig","review":"I am almost finished with this book. I recommend reading any book by Ivan Doig. Especially if you live in Montana. I received this book on time and in great condition!! Thanks so much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Trifle from Ivan","review":"Ivan Doig has always been one of my favorite authors, but I don't know what happened here. A short story perhaps, but the lack of narrative drive did not sustain any interest for me. The evocative, pastoral settings of time and place were sweet but not enough to bolster an incredibly threadbare plot. Certainly not one of his finest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whistling Season","review":"Whistling Season was my first Ivan Doig read and I consider it one of the best books I have read---and was the best of 2006.

I am now attempting to read any of Doig's books I can find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book; very poor conversion to Kindle","review":"This is not a review of the book/story. It is a review of the Kindle (Fire) Edition. The Edition is riddled with typos, punctuation errors, garbled paragraphs, random capitalizations, and so forth. For example, the name of a major character turns from Rose into Kose; another from Toby into Tobe; and so forth. Amazon gets an A for the Kindle concept; an F for execution and quality control."},{"rating":"2","title":"Schooling on the Prairie","review":"An absorbing tale of young people growing up on the 19th century frontier. We've liked it so much that we've chosen it for our once-yearly book review at our 108-year-old Berkshire Reading Club."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely story","review":"The Whistling Season is a touching depiction of growing up and attending a one-room schoolhouse in early 20th century America. I was fully engaged and loving it but for two complaints. First, the Kindle edition is rife with typos. Apparently the book was scanned and the scanner changed life to fife almost every time, along with many other respellings. I wish someone had checked the manuscript before sending it to my Kindle. Second, I was so enjoying the gentle flow of events and wish the book could have found a logical ending in that mood. Instead there is a revelation at the end that, for me, detracted from rather than enhanced my experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"I got on a Doig jag a while ago and read him to death. This one is good.Really, Really Really Really"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great characters, labored writing","review":"Doig has created a wonderful group of characters, but his writing made it impossible for me to read more than half of the book. I kept tripping over his prose, which is labored and overwritten. He is certainly a good storyteller. If he told the story simply and elegantly, I'd still be reading. Such a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't get it.","review":"I'd pay full price -- or nearly so -- to get this on Kindle. So why not publish it on Kindle and set the price at market?

During the last fifteen years I've suffered through more than a few boring bookclub picks, and also some slouchers I've handpicked myself. Hands down, this book takes the prize for WORST bookclub pick ever. The characters were all dull and boring, with the possible exception of Morrie. And the book has NO plot. Really! I felt like \\"the twist\\" at the end was an afterthought when the author realized he'd forgotten to include a story line. I can't for the life of me figure out where all the raves for this book are coming from. Dull from start to finish!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doig is no Wallace Stegner","review":"I bought Bucking the Sun out of the Bargain Bin a few years back. Here's another Doig title that I shouldn't have paid full price for. My bookmark is collecting dust between 138 and 139.

This is one of the best. It provides a wonderful review of paintings and how they were made in Western Europe before the 16th century. This was a time of great transition in style, subject matter, and materials. This was when oil painting transitioned from an ancillary medium, believed useful for a few minor aspects of a painting, to the primary means of making visual art.

Models present a real nightmare for any average sergeant-major: unshaved, long hairs, wearing totally unfitted uniforms (too small or too long sleeves, blouses and trousers are not pressed etc). The art of wrapping putties (see pre-1945 section) must be a great mystery to them (and to the authors). All this is described as \\"non-regulation manner of wear\\" but in fact present a group of scarecrows rather than regular soldiers.I remember my first sergeant-major who used to say that a real soldier is expected to kill an enemy by his look and appearance.

He also does not practice economy of movement. The side headlock technique shows a strike to the legs to \\"soften a male opponent\\" prior to a groin strike. A groin strike does not need a \\"shock technique\\". & NEVER release your weapon if you truly need it for support!! & On the handgun technique dont stop the technique short to do another technique, continue it another 6 inches & disarm the attacker as soon as possible.

Some quite prominent gestures, differing from the Anglo-American lot, are left unnoted, and others are mis-interpreted. I don't believe he did any \\"research\\" in Greece. Was he even there?In another of his books, he states authoritatively that men who are attracted to women with small breasts are homosexuals, whether they want to admit it or not.

It succeeds primarily by using the Branden's own published words against them - demonstrating (as only a prosecuting attorney could) their abhorrent exploitation of the very woman who provided the only success they could ever claim. It also lays bare the souls of the Brandens - and shows why it is not surprising that they still continue to profit from trivializing her legend long after her death.The personal lives of authors and philosophers are generally of little import in understanding their works and ideas. However in this case, the Ad Hominem attacks fueled by the Branden's deceptions have all but crippled scholarly debate on the subject of her philosophy. Hopefully, this work will help to rectify that situation. In any event, it is gratifying to know that Ayn Rand has her own \\"Prince Valliant\\" providing a much-needed defense.

Granted there is a piece of velcro to secure the travel pack in the pocket but it is small and with DVDs costing around $20 each that's $140 that I might loose if it falls out of the pocket.

Materials and stitching are solid and the sleeves are good for a nice friction fit.I've migrated to a music server and loaded CDs onto a hard drive, so I'm storing CDs and ditching the plastic cases. With these binders I can put a CD and the commercial booklets/liner notes into the same pocket, which I like because it keeps me from buying 2x as many binders.

The vet medicine for his arthritis was running us $51 for a 20 day supply. It was advised to stop the old medicine for 3 days before starting the new meds. We did has instructed and although it took about a week and a half, these aspirin seem to help even better with is hip problems than the prescription meds. Aspirin everyday seems to help is mobility greatly. Although it can cause tummy problems we've found giving it with food helps settle it. Given his age though, something else will probably give out before his stomach become an issue. For anyone looking for a cheaper alternative to vet meds, I recommend these.

My dog refused the pills and I thought she would eat anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for older dog aches","review":"We have used these Nutri-Vet K-9 chewable aspirin for several years with several dogs for a variety of reasons. I've never had a dog refuse to take them right out of the bottle nor have we ever had a dog have a bad reaction to these. We have a large pack of dogs ranging in age from 6 years to 12 years old and they are very active - constantly wrestling & playing or chasing squirrels and shadows all over the yard. That means there are going to be days when a dog (or two) is either feeling his age with some arthritis aches or has just overdone with the running & jumping. Our vet has given his stamp of approval for two of these with food as needed and they always help our hounds. We have large breed dogs - Rhodesian Ridgebacks & a Walker Coon Hound, not sure how effective or what dose would be good with small breeds, but 2 tablets for a 70lb to 90lb dog seems just right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly grateful for this product.","review":"When our 12 year old dog began limping periodically we discovered he had arthritis. 300mg of enteric aspirin was suggested. We were also told that the human variety was acceptable. It worked great for the arthritis, but it upset his stomach and he stopped eating about 2/3 of his normal amount. I found this product here at Amazon and decided to give it a try. Since the aspirin is chewable, we decided to start with 1/2 a tablet to see how it worked. He's doing great now, eating better than ever, is much more active and far less \\"grumpy\\". I would recommend this to anyone with a dog in need of pain relief because it is chewable (therefore you can reduce the dose) and doesn't upset their stomachs as the human type so often does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure...","review":"My aging golden retriever (15+ yo) is suffering from severe hip dysplesia, plus a car accident a decade or so ago.

(He refuses to eat the food, if it's mashed up in it. And we're talking about a large dog portion, so it's a lot of food for 2 small pills). The few times we managed to trick him into eating them, they did ease his pain for roughly 2 hours. That was a blessing, but not worth the constant hassle.

Fight Paris's music is pretty far removed from the old school rock of Stone Rider, and sounds like a disastrous attempt to mix hardcore music with Southern rock, compounded with lyrics that Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit wouldn't touch. I wondered if they were being ultra-ironic or something, and were secretly mocking bands that said this kind of stuff, but song after song made it clear that they actually believed the misogynistic macho posturing they were pushing.

I'll admit, there's a few catchy parts (mostly on \\"Complete Heat\\") but other than that, theres much left to be desired here. The intelligence and artistry displayed on this album is about the equivalent of a rap or hip hop album...and that's not good. Take out the heavier and unique aspects of Every Time I Die, insert lame lyrics, and you have Fight Paris. That's not to say I can't be objective when I say that scenesters will eat this album up and with the proper promotion from Trustkill, it'll probably be spun by the same kids who think The Used are the savior of rock n' roll.

The two main problems with this approach are: (1) Eicher assumes I know lots of things about the obscure people in the Confederate government already (which I don't); and (2) there seems to be no central thesis that is supported.I expect that a well written biography of Davis would cover most of this material in a much more comprehensive manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Necessity for Astronomers","review":"At some point, every astronomer is confronted with the spherical coordinate of a star or other celestial object that looks like:03 19 40.80 -19 24 40.0If you know how to use celestial coordinates, this number is like a celestial objects address.

It starts off well enough, but after a few chapters of directionless examples of bad language, one starts to become bored.Then, part way through the book, Watson starts showing his true colours. On page 103 he takes an inoffensive quote from Australia's ex-PM (John Howard), that being \\"As a people, we have traditionally engaged the world optimistically. Our open, friendly nature makes us welcome guests and warm hosts\\", and then spends the next page arguing that this echoes the propaganda of the Third Reich. Earth to Don: the Nazis wore shoes, but all people who wear shoes aren't Nazis.

We are losing our ability (or is it will?) to say what we mean in a way that is easy to understand and worth the reader's time.Chapter 1 should be digested by everyone whose job requires them to write or speak. In the beginning I thought the book was a 4; by page 58 I was thinking 3 stars; and by chapter 3 it was in freefall. His own writing bogs down in muddy thinking and poorly chosen examples.

This album has a very straight forward sound that cuts straight to the heart of things. As opposed to all Ikon albums to follow, these songs are much more stripped down. With less electronic layering, their songs remain vastly atomospheric and emotive with raw power.You hear the band evolve with each track. If you enjoy the less electro/industrial/dance side of Goth(the only kind of Goth I enjoy), you will fall in love with this album.

On my typical ride to work (typically just less than 1hour - 13.5 miles), I ride for 8 minutes, then get a pain on the insides of my upper thighs. I need to come off the saddle until the pain subsides, then it is OK for a while. I sometimes suffer numbness in places where I'd prefer that not happen!The Special Flier is better, but still not good.I have now removed the B17 from the bike, and am trying a Selle San Marco Rolls - have only done one ride to work on it, so I can't make a comparison, but I really don't like the Brooks - disappointing.

Winchester makes a repeated point of how popular he is among South Koreans by virtue of his being English; that was snotty enough by the third go-round. What did me in was the time he arrived at a U S base, browbeat them into letting him stay there (when they didn't have to), and then proceeded to trash just about every single U S military person he ran across after accepting their hospitality. He also had a penchant for running into anti-American Koreans; you'd think they were rife, along with all of the many prostitutes throwing themselves at him. Oh yeah, there was one old soldier, fawningly pro-British, as though the U K had been the ones who saved South Korea.Yes, there's well-researched history here, hence a second star. Not worth purchasing new. If you can't find a used copy, get it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contains very little about the country","review":"Simon Winchester's Korea bills itself as a \\"treasury of fascinating and informed insight on the culture, people, language, history and politics of this little-known country.\\" Given the author's wide-ranging journalistic experience and track record of producing bestsellers (The Map that Changed the World, Krakatoa), I had high hopes the book would deliver on this promise.Instead, what you get is the author hanging out with ex-pat Irish priests and American servicemen. His only contact with the Koreans themselves seems to come through the sex industry, as he visits in turn a hostess bar, a strip club, and a barber shop/massage parlor. One cannot help but detect a note of wishful thinking in the author's descriptions of Korean women eager to service him. The book is, in short, disappointingly purile in its taste and utterly lacking any kind of insight into the country whose name is emblazoned on the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"A promising start but a drag towards the end","review":"I picked up this book for its interesting cover- the pairs of shoes seem so inviting- asking the reader to take a glimpse into the mystical land of Korea. That was a promising start but the read soon became a drag. The author tends to describe scenaries (perhaps because he walked for the journey)with too much details and there are not many facades of Korean life that are well-depicted. There is insufficient insight into why Koreans are different from the Japanese and the Chinese, though all 3 great nations are so close to one another.For an Asian who would probably know Korea an bit more than fellow readers from the Western world, I do not find this book entertaining at all. The saving grace was perhaps some history of the development of hangul, the Korean language and the different types of ginseng. That's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Learned nothing about Korea from this book.","review":"Unfortunately I bought this book because of its promising title.But it was basically just a lure. Maybe to trap buyers whohave a real curiosity about Korea the \\"Land of Miracles\\".After all the back story of Korea is truly interesting. Weall know about and have at least a curiosity about theKorean economy, the academics, the general orderliness,about Korea. But this is a bait and catch book. Thereis no understanding of Korea culture, the people, orthe history. Winchester just wants to satisfy his ownego and show what a \\"cool\\" guy he is. There are the usual East/Westposturing stands that are very tired, very obviousintentionally or unintentionally in the book. A better,writer of greater integrity is needed to explore these issues.Search \\"Korea\\" and read about in Wikipedia. You'll learn moreand its free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was This Written by Someone Else With the Same Name?","review":"There remain very few books of Simon Winchester's that I have not yet read. Happily, I can say that I have loved his interesting and insightful looks at plate tectonics, China, the OED, San Francisco, Krakatoa, Joseph Needham, so when I began the Korea book, I expected to be thoroughly engrossed. What a disappointment! It seems as if an aide ghost wrote it for him. The outlook is that of an overeager teenage boy about to enter his first house of ill repute, in fact this becomes so boring, it is difficult to finish the book. Winchester judges all Americans by the servicemen whom he meets at the bars and bordellos, well all except for one literate officer. Sorry, I cannot say anything more positive about this book.This was a total waste of money and of time - his, mine and anyone, who reads it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An arrogant westerner's view of Korea","review":"This book details the author's walking tour in South Korea in the late 80's. Though tidbits of interesting historical and cultural facts are included, they were written in a disorganized and anecdotal manner. Occasionally careless statements about the Koreans and Asians were made, clearly with exaggeration or overgeneralization.Though the author said he loved Korea, what stands out page after page is the superiority complex he displayed for the land and the people. He mocked their age-old customs and current undertakings and gave proud accounts of his own bad behavior during his travel. The air of arrogance and condescension exudes from every single line. I am not a Korean, but even I am offended. The author obviously fails to understand that not everybody regards Kendal Mint Cake the best thing since sliced bread."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"She died too soon, and this may be one of the better compilations of her music...

It took only 20 minutes to read. It is badly edited, with several typos and bad internal references. A good deal of the information in it is out of date, and there is very little technical information at all. It seems to be a small expansion of a magazine article written for purchasing people. It is addressed to senior management, but I don't know of any senior management who would listen to the hype. It would be a good book to give a senior management person whom you don't like, but wants to know something about EDI."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is love?","review":"This movie will force you to ask yourself the difficult question, \\"Have I ever really known love?\\", and cause you to long for a friendship that will endure the span of your own lifetime.This movie is a romance, but there are no wooing words of passion between the two main characters. This movie is a bodice ripping hot bed of passion, but the two main characters never have sex with each other.Do we choose the people that we will love, or are they prechosen for us? Whatever you feel or think about this movie, trust me, it won't be a lukewarm opinion. It was well worth the money spent for this DVD.If you liked this one, I would also highly recommend, \\"Henry and June\\" with Fred Ward & Uma Thurman, \\"Delta of Venus\\" with Costas Mandylor, \\"Red Shoe Diaries - The Movie\\" with David Duchovny & Billy Worth and \\"Nora\\" with Ewan McGregor & Susan Lynch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriguing but ultimately frustrating","review":"This movie is about Dora Carrington's love life, and is effective in exploring it. Hoever, for those of us who knew of her as an artist and wanted to know more, it is disappointing. Her paintings don't even make it into the film until the final credits, where they seem to beckon one into a fascinating story that the film never told. Why did Carrington paint? What was in her heart and mind? How could a movie about an artist completely neglect her art? It doesn't tell the whole story at all. I was upset and annoyed at this. It's a pattern I've seen all too often, when the people making the movie seem more interested in who an artist or writer slept with than why and how they became great artists in the first place.Emma Thompson gives the best performance I think anyone could have under the circumstances, but she (and Carrington) deserved a better script. I never felt as if I knew Carrington, because the art that meant so much to her was not part of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"This movie proves again that love is more than a chemical reaction. It does not spell very much out for you. Sometimes it even seems to be just a string of single events. Yet the one thing that becomes clear in the end is that love exists in many different forms.My only problem was the desciption written on the back of my video tape (not the one pictured above).

The fact that I actually had some type of interest in Carrington is beyond my comprehension. This movie should not be entitled Carrington. It should be entitled \\"Can a Woman be More Screwed Up in the Head?\\" If you are looking to find the answers to why Ms. Carrington's personality did not follow the norm, you will not find the answer in this movie. If you looking for a sexually, morbidly confused bunch of self absorbed, self-destructive artists, you have a winner with Carrington. (i.e. when Mr. Strachey is first introduced in the movie he spots Carrington by saying \\"Who is that lovely young boy?\\" Where I come from people can get arrested for comments like that!)This movie will not uplift or encourage you. It will not make you a more socially or artistically aware individual.

The singer (I forget his name) has a voice very similar to that of ex-Saosin Anthony Green, although perhaps a little more on the annoying side. But, for sure, the instrumental breaks more than make up for it.

The music itself is pleasant to listen to. The beats are nice, the interludes of piano music are a dramatic touch --but then there's the \\"SINGING\\".What most reviewers fail to mention is this: entire blocks of song are composed mostly of someone screaming into the mic. Badly. (No, this man doesnt not have a pair of Maynard James Keenan lungs.) Its a rare moment when our vocalist's pure tones can be heard (usually at that part of the song where the music dies down) and when they are, the moment is all-to-brief and soon to be followed either by more screaming or a girlish shriek.If this type of music (with the vomit-screaming) is not your style, this cd is NOT for you.

It made me feel as if she was tentatively dipping her toes into the genre of romantic fiction, but was hesitant to go all the way. The heroine, Selena Caldwell, needed a bit of backbone - could one really have an immediate affair with the guy who just told you your fiance is married? I found the characters insufficiently involving to allow me to accept that, and, frankly, I didn't like York Sutherland. Driven guys are OK, but he seemed slightly obsessive, overly arrogant, and Selena should have given him a boot up his ego several times before surrendering to his charms. Other Stephanie James books are better - try those first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thw worst JAK I have ever read","review":"This is the worst JAK's novel I have read. Only the writers you love a lot can disappoint you so much. It is very out-of-date. I can hardly believe there are contemporary readers that like this novel. York is a dominant male, arrogant and so prepotent that sometimes he verges on violence, not considering just for one second what the heroine, Selena, thinks, hopes or believes. And she is so weak! and inconstant: first she cannot stand his arrogance, and suddenly (the morning after...- she loves him. He says terrible sentences like: I want you, I will have you, give yourself to me. And she: her mouth says no, but her body says yes - which has always remembered me of rape.

That of course is a subjective opinion. It's a far departure from \\"Mi Tierra\\" if you have heard that. If you read the insert, she explains which music styles she is incorporating.

The whole story is just wonderful, and growing up in the South, you simply KNOW what Florence is talking about. You just understand. Like being hot and sticky from the humidity in the summer, if you are a Southerner as am I, you will relate to many of the things referenced in this book. A great read.

Dan McGirt's first two books about Jason Cosmo are funny and entertaining, but with his third book, he fails to continue what had been a winning trend. His tongue-in-cheek humor goes over the top, with the characters being far too aware that they are in a story, and his best supporting character, Mercury Boltblaster, only appears in a small portion of the book. Read the first two books, but skip this one. It's not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"over the top and trite","review":"The highlight of this book for me was the reference to the Luggage of terry pratchett's discworld novels.The book was slightly funny in parts, but it lacked the spark that would have truly made it a funny satire/parody. It had the characters \\"break the fourth wall\\" entirely too many times and then had them go right back to what they were doing, as nothing had happened. IF they had made fun of the roles (which they did) and then proceeded to do something completely unexpected or at least original, it would have been funnier. But as it is, they did the equivalent of: saying, \\"I'm going to step right here without paying attention and slip on a banana peel, to humorous effect,\\" and then doing so. It just isn't funny.For a few pages, half way through, I thought maybe it would break away from this and be fresh and original for two minutes, but no luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Schnauzer","review":"WELL WORTH IT!!!

How about showtunes sung by Gilbert Gottfried who is responsible for the voice of Iago? He makes Danny Devito sound like Luciano Pavarotti. Whoever wrote this movie obviously wanted to write broadway musicals but got stuck writing a low budget, sequel that Disney apparently quickly churned out to make a few extra bucks.Unless you are a fan of big bands, showtunes, and terrible singing by a ghastly cartoon parrot, I say avoid this movie at all costs. Stick to Aladdin part I!This movie does have many features, such as awful singing, annoying big bands with Jaffar and Iago dancing around and singing in their cartoonish, distorted voice. I issue you this stern warning, if you buy this movie for your kids, they will watch it again and again, and you will unwittingly and gradually LEARN the words to about a dozen poorly written show tunes with Gilbert Gottfried of all people shrieking out the lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing...","review":"I just purchased the video today, and I'm sad to say that it was a huge dissapointment. The first thing that caught my eye was that the animation lacked the elegance present in the first movie. Very ''Saturday-morning-cartoon-like''. That aside, the plot was remarkably weak. I kept waiting for the ''BOOM'' to come in. It didn't. Another huge dissapointment were the songs, wich had no meaning for me, it seemed as if they were just written in to prolong the movie. I definately think this sequel could have been done better, but that's just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trainwreck","review":"Absolutely terrible. The production quality seems amatureish.

This movie has 5 new songs but I don't care for them.The animation is okay,but this is one of the worst squels ever made. The worst mistake was making Iago good.Disney can do much better!

I would give it 0 stars if I could. It had poor score, dialogue, animation, and songs. I don't understand why Robin Williams didn't get involved to do the voice for the Genie in the sequel. They chose the voice of Homer Simpson instead. That really disappointed me alot! Genie's voice was very annoying in the sequel. Disney really needs to stop making these horrible sequels.

How anyone would have the nerve to compare this to Halo 2 or worse yet call it a \\"Halo Killer\\" is really insulting. It is already getting panned on reviews. I am not an XBox fanboy, PS2 is my primary system but come on. If you have played the beta you know the online game play is slow and poorly implemented. The game is available today so you can see what I am talking about. Here is what I liked about the game: The theme. The theme that was essentially ripped off.Everything else about the game will leave you with a complete feeling of mediocrity, it's linear, it's short, there is a lot of slowdown. Don't get me wrong it is not the worst game ever, but it does not live up to the hype and it is not as good as you would think it should be.

You start off as Templar, a Rapid Reaction Force (RRF) member, and later on in the game you gain a shadow marshal, an ISA regular, and a field operative, whose names are Luger, Rico, and Hakha. You can choose to play as any one of those four people. Your enemies are the nasty Helghasts. The game does start off kind of slow but it gets better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must buy game","review":"First of all, people need to stop making this game out to be a halo killer. The 2 games are different. Killzone is more realistic than halo. The sounds, enviroment, and control. There are some graphic bugs and some slowdown, but that's because the game pushed the PS2 to the limit.Some people didn't like the game because of the weapon accuracy. The weapons control and accuracy is realistic, because in real life you can't hit the same point over and over again with a machine gun and this is coming from a military guy. The enemy in this game is smart. the hide, regroup and use military tactics on you.

I packed up my PS2 and dozens of games and got what little value in trade-in that I could to switch to XBox and I couldn't be happier. Basically, this lame game was the mitigating factor to switch.All you do in killzone is run through levels that are so similar from one another it's stupid. There is no variety whatsoever in the enemies, and that really is the main problem. It's just wave after wave of the same dudes in black saying the same phrases over and over in their deep voices.Oh yeah, it takes at least 5 to 6 head shots to down an average Helghast-it's so fake. The story is lame, the graphics are fair but just as dull as everything else on the game.

This is one of the best games in this genre that I've played and is well worth the money. I thought that the story line (which followed a group of soliers) was interesting and the levels were challenging. It was tough to get coordinated at first with the controls, but once you get it, you got it, and the game moves uphill from there. My favorite part of the game, though, was the multiplayer mode. Forget the storyline and get some of your buddies to play that! I can play that for hours ( but the dual screen can get confusing). I highly recommend this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty, but significant playability issues","review":"Killzone is nicely detailed, the graphics are very good and it's got a sophisticated European feel to it, but several issues significantly reduce its playability.1. Sluggish controls. It's like you're trying to move in chest-deep water. Everything moves slowly.2. Enemies are stupid, yet difficult to kill.3. Members of your squad just get in the way -- excess baggage. Get out of my way!

I don't know about that... but from the brief demo KillZone looks like a very solid FPS, probably the best on PS2 which isn't saying too much I know.

A more realistic feeling of warfare and casualties came to mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"a halo killer or killed by halo","review":"if u ask me, this is better than halo. Halo feels more cartooney to me. I dont like halo i think it is a horrible franchise but... Killzone is morerealistic and the graphics look like PS3! theyr amazing and no frame rate issues in it.Plus the combat is intense and fierce. Dont let the costumes fool u.

Should have just bought one of the lesser priced ones. Talon states it needs cleaned occasionally-twice a week is more like it. The nicotine builds up all over the outside dome quite rapidly. It is difficult and awkward to clean. The two small plastic hinges which regulate the angle and height broke off within the first month.-Thus it keeps falling down on itself. Do yourself a favor and buy a smokeless ashtray that is half the price. This one falls apart more quickly than an AMC Gremlin.

The first time I cleaned it, (very carefully with a very mild soap in water and let it dry overnight unplugged) and then plugged it in and turned it on, the light (this is the indicator that it is operating) came on, went out, and it is now a reminder to me to STOP AND THINK BEFORE I SPEND MY HARD EARNED MONEY ON GARBAGE LIKE THIS!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Editing is your friend.","review":"Dear author of \\"Stars Over Stars\\",Have you considered having your work edited?

While it is true that he does touch on subjects that aren't necessary, he eviscerates all actual theology in the process. As near as I can tell from his writings, his feeling is that as long as you have warm and fuzzy feelings towards a god-like idea then the term Christian can be stretched to include you. There has to be some line at which you say \\"if you are not a follower of Christ, then you are not a Christian\\".

My best songs are mostly the vocal ones.Stealing Time- I can relate to the songs lyricsCan't Sleep- Very etheral vocals, heavenly!Hope, and Liquid Love- nice instrumentals, flows well with Can't sleepAlone Tonight- clever lyrics in this songOverall the album is great and is one of the most unique CD's in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"This CD is perhaps one of the best trance CDs I have bought in a very long time, if it can even be labeled as trance. Albeit this album does hold some very strong dance anthems...the real beauty is found in the down-tempo chill tacks. Never before have I found such calming solace in one CD. Amazing. This is an album that has a great mix of chill and trance intermingled in a cocktail of sonic ecstasy. Buy it, you will no doubt be very pleased. The best tracks in my opinion are Alone Tonight, Home, World on Fire and Good for Me. But don't get me wrong...every song on this Album is fantastic it was hard even listing those four without ending up listing the entire album itself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Electronica in a LONG time","review":"Bought this CD from Tower as they were closing their doors forever. If I had paid full retail price it would've been WELL worth it...which is more than I can say for most of the CDs I've purchased in my lifetime! Every single song on here was great or at least very good. A great CD to throw in and listen to or select as a whole on the comp. I don't always like all the 'mixes' out these days, sometimes they're so repetitive you want to tear your eyes out, but these are mindnumbingly good. Can't wait to see what else they do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tri-State","review":"Blast from the past with lyrics of The Who \\"Rain down on Me.....\\".

Absolutely mind blowing, the best progressive trance/synth-pop record of the year 2006. Every track is jamming. Not a single dull moment.

It contains lot of previously unreleased tracks which were only heard previously on 'Trance Around the World' by Above and Beyone Live radio broadcasts. The 2nd cd of Anjunabeats:Worldwide contains a track called M.I.R.A which is a killer!

I ordered two of these items because I had extremely tight clearances to work with. The items they sent me had a conical transition between the two pipe diameters - which added an extra two and a half inches to the length of each unit. This made the items useless for my needs. For some reason, flat-cap reducers are extremely difficult to find online. I was duped by the misleading photo, and because this seller was so slow to deliver the order, I didn't have time to screw-around with sending it back and waiting another twenty days for a replacement. I finally found what I needed (the item in the photo) from another seller, who had it delivered in just three days."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Finest Films Ever Produced","review":"I saw Career Girls when it was released several years ago, and I am buying the video because the film has been re-playing in my brain ever since.

I am stunned that artists can achieve this throughout this extensive performance. It also expresses joy of the arrival of the Messiah. I think Handel sometimes sounds heavy and a bit sad, really like minor keys, but here there is no such impression. This CD is clearly my favorite among Messiah CDs. Now some consumer information:Primo: Counter tenor Bowman sings a few pieces which are sung by female singers on other recordings. Don't let it scare you off, I usually don't like counter tenors but here it is just right, and it all forms a whole.Secundo: This recording is by no means extreme or odd, as was perhaps the Parrott Bach B minor recording.Tertio: My favorite air, \\"Why do the nations\\", is short. Why do they not sing the extended version, like Robert Hale on the Gardiner CD. But again, it does not spoil this CD.Quarto: The Messiah recording is available on another CD at radically lower price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This Aubrey product was a disappointment.

I was very excited because the cookies looked simple enough to make, but the pictures showed gorgeous cookies.I have tried quite a few recipes and they aren't as simple as I'd first thought. Many require a fair amount of time and effort, but if you're a true baker, you won't mind the bit of extra work. I also found that many of the recipes only produce 15-20 cookies and with the way my family consumes them, I have doubled many recipes.But what I really love about this cookbook is the variations on classics. There are tons of recipes for chocolate chip cookies depending on your preference, plus shortbreads, double baked cookies and much more. I highly recommend - but not if you're in a hurry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed in the book","review":"I went by the reviews and thought I couldn't beat the price, but received the cookbook today and I was very disapointed. First of all, I like pictures of the cookies when I'm trying a new recipe, and most of the recipes have no pictures. Also, I love chocolate chip cookies, but do we really need 5 different recipes?? I did enjoy the little info given for some types of cookies, such as the biscotti. But all in all, would not recommend this book, too few recipes, no pictures, so glad I only paid 4 bucks for it. I can't really understand someone stating it's the best cookie cookbook they've even seen.....seriously????"},{"rating":"2","title":"The next Guitar Legend!!","review":"The next Pat Metheny / Larry Carlton!I just seen this guy live in concert and he shredds!!This guy has a style all his own and mixes everything you can imagine.

Everything is clear and easy to see(Except for on the \\"Training\\" level.) Also, the effects are just about as realistic as you can get on the Playstation 2 system.The gameplay is pretty frustrating at first, if you're used to playing ATV 2, but once you get used to it it is REALLY fun.The soundtrack is very good, there was only a few songs I didn't care for...Of course, that's just personal preference.The thing I like best about this game is the fact that all of the features are easy to use.I like everything about this game except for two things: it is very sensitive to how you land a jump on the atv, and you cannot race against the other riders on the custom enduro tracks.Overall I rate this game as 4 stars out of 5. Great for anyone who wants a very challenging off road game."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment--where can i get a refund?","review":"How can you release a version of a classic game and actually make it worse---well off-road fury 3 did just that.

Yes, the soundtrack is good but the atv's now sound completely fake and the lame attempt now comes off rather annoying. ---bzzzzzzzz So, for those of you who atv 2 was like crack rest assure that this game is more benign than water.

The reason we are seeing such a dramatic decrease in quality with the 3rd installment is that Rainbow Studios (creators of Motocross Madness 1 & 2, ATV Off Road Fury 1 & 2, and MX Unleashed) had nothing to do with ATV 3. Sony gave the job to Climax who I must say don't know what they are doing. The graphics, driving mechanics, music, race tracks, and options are all inferior. You can't even load two profiles at once to race your friends. Save your money (like I should have done) for MX vs. ATV Unleashed by Rainbow Studios which comes out in February.

I have read the 'Ecstacy club' by Douglas Rushkoff and it's along the same lines as this. If you want to understand more about the rave scene, '200 BPM' definitely gives you an accurate picture of the drug scene - the immaturity of the ravers, the escapism, the pathetic search for the next high, the selfishness of party scene and the stupidity as people throw away challenges to face life's realities. If you want to read a good book, this isn't it. The hero wallows in his own self interest, with endless descriptions of his current altered state of being - hardly an interesting topic. You want to shake him and tell him to wake up and start really living life - have the courage to spend days and nights awake and fully conscious. I personally look for books in which at least the hero is inspirational in some way - this isn't that type of book. Definitely not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Numb","review":"to compare this book to the Ecstasy Club is such an insult. yes the characters are self-indulgent. yes they're selfish, bratty and irresponsible. that's the whole point. does anybody get it? it's about what happens when youthful ideals and naieve blue-sky optimism are corrupted by drugs and greed. this is the dark side of the moon. explore it."},{"rating":"2","title":"it was the best book i ever read","review":"i could relate. i never read but i couldnt stop reading this book. the only thing i didnt care for was the fact that he was gay . i could say that i felt like there are more people out there like me and that it made my feel great. also i liked when he mentioned djs that i love ,proveing to me that he knew what was up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipping charge","review":"Let me start by saying that I am a big fan of Britt coffees and Costa Rican coffees. I don't have an issue with the product or the price for the product. My beef is with the outrageous shipping charge for a 12 oz. sealed bag of coffee. That was about $10. The coffee cost $9.50. The shipping box was big enough to hold ten bags of coffee. Why not just a sturdy envelope? I will definitely find Costa Rican coffee in my local area and buy from a brick & stick store. Usually I try to offset the state sales tax (8.25% in the DFW area)with the shipping and handling charge. There seems to be a trend of increasing shipping and handling costs. Local sales tax on this purchase would have been in the range of $0.80. Soon we will all be paying sales tax AND shipping charges through on internet sales unless something keeps us from paying ANOTHER tax which will surely affect the internet market. Anyway, just my 2 cents worth. No more Britt through Amazon for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst Books I've ever read","review":"I have yet to read the rest of the books in this series and am hoping that when I do they will be better than this one. Normary had no backbone whatsoever- first she marries someone she doesn't love to make her aunt happy, when she is already in love with someone else. It is said she does it out of duty, but what about her promise to the one she loved (Robert) that she would marry him? Didn't she have a duty to fufill that promise? After marrying a man she hardly knows, and falling in love, he gets mad at her for no reason and treats her horribly because of unfounded accusations. He doesn't even give her a chance. I think at the very end when they reconcile was rushed and unrealistic. If he wouldn't believe her before, why would he suddenly believe her then? I disliked both characters immensly, as one was a wimp and the other a hothead. Not a good combination. Hopefully the other books in this series will be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tender, Touching Tale","review":"To fully appreciate this book, one must be willing to step into a culture of a different time. The colonial setting lends itself to a story which shows self-sacrifice and redemptive love. The story of Noramary will make you cry, laugh, and smile. It is a story of true love. This romantic tale deserves more than one reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor proofreader","review":"This book was filled with misspelled words that sometimes led to hilarious discriptions.

It will strike your core."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has depth, but lacks breadth","review":"The book is very well-written and organized. Clearly, the author has been blessed with insights uncommon for someone so young - or anyone for that matter. Probably because of his age at the time of writing, the principles he describes so well are not always extrapolated for the reader. I suspect his relative lack of worldly experiences just doesn't offer him the opportunity to apply his tenets to daily life.

I'm sure many might find it...nice. Just not me.What really bugged me was that the deck that arrived had several duplicate cards and was missing some cards entirely, even though still sealed. This, and the somewhat flimsy card stock told me that whatever job the deck's creator had done, no care had been taken by the publisher. Especially since the publisher never bothered to reply to my polite enquiries regarding getting individual replacement cards.

Some were so far ahead of their time that only now we see some of them being used. Ernie was a staple on TV from 1950 on, but these classic specials, the last he produced before his tragic car accident in 1959 that took his life, display his great wit, timing, and more.

The plot is absolutely ridiculous.

But then... there was a let down. You see, my Persian is a finicky cat, who only wants to eat dry food. Unfortunately, Kitty Kaviar only enticed him into eating the wet food that I was trying to entice him into eating for only about 2 or 3 feedings. By about the sixth or seventh feeding with the Kitty Kaviar he had completely snubbed his nose at it.Still, I must admit that I haven't found anything that worked better. I would encourage people to give Kitty Kaviar a try, because of the fact that was the very best response from my finicky cat that I ever gotten.P.S. My other cat, who is an American Shorthair, and normally likes to eat anything I give her, LOVED and RAGED over the smell of it as I served it to her one time - but she didn't eat very much of it - so I haven't mixed it with her food any more since that one time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitties go bananas","review":"My cats, even the one who doesn't care much for fish flavored dry and wet foods, love these flakes. I am happy because they are all natural, and easy for them to eat. Cats tend not to chew their food much and that is why crunchy treats are often a waste of money if not simply bad for digestion.My cats smell this stuff and heads start turning. One of the cats gets flakes on her fur and then happily licks herself to get the remaining bits all cleaned up. They purr like crazy with it.If you are looking for wholesome foods for your cat, make sure you get Ann Martin's book, _Food Pets Die For_, here on Amazon.Have fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mature?","review":"Neuropa sinks in this album.

For a tourist to the area wanting to get in a bit of diving, a great resource to supplement a local guide.

From truck drivers to infantrymen, these voices tell stories that only Vietnam veterans can tell. Trujillo made a valiant attempt to let the sounds of the voices flow in their natural state, and he edited little, so the words sound as if they come from one who stands on a street corner, talking to whomever will listen.

It is a dense treatment of a pivotal incident relating to the Great War, rather than a larger treatment of the conflict itself. This doesn't make it bad, but I was glad that I read The Zimmermann Telegram after having read Guns of August.The Zimmerman telegram was one of the instruments that contributed to bringing the US into the Great War.

I also purchased a brand new Freud blade for the saw. The inside diameter worked fine. But the outside diameter (OD) measured 1.004. The saw blades run between 1.001 and 1.002. This means that the bushing would not fit in the new Freud blade or the old Craftsman saw blade. I ended up carefully grinding the OD that measured between .998 and 1.000. I was a machinist in a previous career, and realize the bushing I could be out of round by a few thousands. but it seems to work. What upsets me is that I paid 9 times more than Freud's competitors bushing. I could have spent 99 cent for a poorly manufactured bushing instead of 9 dollars.

Cincotti's voice is bland and poorly controlled, and his piano playing pedestrian. Such songs as \\"I Love Paris\\" and \\"Bali Hai\\" are almost laughable. Too bad that this young man became a star before he's had a chance to develop his modest talents."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok but it doesn't impress me.","review":"Peter Cincotti is a nice young artist,in the process to grow up and eventually to be a star,one day in the future.I like the way he plays the piano,but there is a lot of work to do with his singing !His voice sounds a little hysterical and weak.Simply I do not understand the massive promotion from his recordinglabel which spends millions in advertising this CD,showing it on all media just next to \\"Genius loves company\\" by the great Ray Charles,promoted by the way by the....same label !To me,it seems a little too much for a mediocre album,which might sell a lot,thanks also to the new fashion campaign of Ermenegildo Zegna , with Peter Cincotti ( pictures by the top photographer Bruce Weber ) replacing Adrien Brody........"},{"rating":"2","title":"HE HAS ARRIVED","review":"This record really shows how much Peter has grown musically since his first CD. You hear the emotion in his voice throughout the entire record, his piano playing is amazing, and his song writing is particularly touching. The hip hop influenced Bali Hai, the funky St. Louis Blues, the cinematic On The Moon, the poignant He's Watching, and the amazingly virtuosic Cherokee, are all stand out tracks. I can't imagine anyone NOT liking this cd. See for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stay True to Yourself","review":"I wrote glowingly of Peter Cincotti's freshman effort and hailed his promise as an artist. I liked ON The Moon but fear he may be going down the Harry Connick \\"road to nowhere\\" with this follow-up. Cincotti impressed me with his original compositions and unique take on the classics in his first CD. This effort is more uneven--he shines on the funky \\"St Louis BLues\\" and on \\"I Love Paris\\". He is very bland and non-descript on \\"Some Kind of Wonderful and \\" Up on the Roof\\". I enjoy his work but can't help but think Cincotti will rise or fall as an artist in a jazz trio/nightclub setting rather than as a Harry Connick wannabee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great voice","review":"Peter Cincotti has such a smooth voice that this album will sooth the even the worst day away.

It is way overproduced, over-hyped, and image driven. It reminds me of Westport, CT and yuppie, watered-down culture. I think firstly, the guy needs to get his mug off the CD cover. Real jazz musicians like Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald had to rely on actual talent to sell their music. They would never make it in todays market, and this guy is a posterchild for all that is corrupt and wrong with it. His sound is so artificial, I think it might cause cancer. He brings nothing to the table. That lag-behind-the-beat technique doesn't impress me. It's the Berklee/Suzuki method of \\"swing\\" which I've heard ad nauseum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unfortunate","review":"I loved his first CD. This one exposes all the weaknesses -- a mediocre voice and lack of depth, included -- while giving short shrift to his many strengths. The standout is \\"raise the roof.\\" It swings and has an original modern jazzy appeal. But too many songs here are pop shlock that could have been taken straight out of a Disney soundtrack. Pete, make a U-turn fast and don't try to become a Michael Bolton! You have the potential to be a great jazz vocalist."},{"rating":"1","title":"a Poor Man's Harry Connick Jr","review":"Peter Cincotti is trying to find himself as a Artist but albums as these don't speak of where he is heading but show whom He tried to pattern himself after but is doing a low-budget take on it.He ain't Harry Connick Jr. Cincotti has a aight voice&alright on the Piano but He just ain't got the hype that has come with his name.to much polish&shine but nothing of substance in here yet musically to speak of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe The Hype","review":"Wow....Peter Cincotti's CD to me really fell short of all the press and product placement he's been receiving. He apparently has been deemed \\"the new Harry Connick Jr.\\". Are you kidding? I don't know if this proclamation came from his own publicity folks or not (though I tend to guess that's probably the case), but regardless, it couldn't be any more inaccurate of a description. Cincotti's piano playing is fair - however, his vocals need a lot of work. It's not a bad voice....it just needs lots of work. As it is right now, he sounds more like a decent karaoke singer than a real jazz vocalist. He's young, so hopefully over time he will improve. However in the mean time, the amount of mediocrity flooding the music scene in general continues to be frustrating. Unfortunately, Cincotti's contribution doesn't help matters. One final thought - a nice cover photo does not make a great musician."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank Heavens I heard the whole cut on Jay Leno","review":"The few bars played on line were not enough to sell me. Thank Heavens I heard the whole cut on Jay Leno last night. You need a few more bars on line to get into the song.

I think he is wonderful, and really think his youth and talent could bring even my 15 year old to appreciate really great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful","review":"I think I might be the minority here, I actually like this one better than his first album. Cincotti simply sings much better now. Although his voice still doesn't quit grab me, maybe he should foucus more on his piano solo, he surelly can play piano quite well. And add some spark. For his young age, I would expect more energy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really WANTED to like this cd....","review":"I really liked Peter Cincotti's first cd, and was looking for more of those clean, almost sparse, little-trio-in-a-smoky-bar arrangements.

There is no disputing that. But there's no variety in the arrangements. Sometimes it sounds like you're listening to one depressingly long track.

In my opinion, this doesn't work at all. And the lyrics on the original tracks... Ouch. Here's a line from \\"Christmas Without You:\\"\\"I hop on a train to Macy's,Thinkin I'll just replace thesememories we made together.But all the memory shelves are bare.\\"That's right.

This one isn't. It is one of her earlier works when she had not yet polished her writing skills. As other reviewers have commented, this book was written 15 years ago before she became famous. The plot was largely unbelievable. It involves a woman who is having an affair with a married man and wants to break it off. She comes home to find him stabbed and dead in her bed. She says she is innocent, but she is \\"presumed guilty\\" hence the title of the book. His brother comes to town and she gets involved with him and he sets about solving the murder.

The entire album, with the exception of the mediocre \\"Come To Poppa\\", is top-drawer. Songs such as \\"Rock & Roll Never Forgets\\", which extols the joys of rock & roll for full-grown men and women; the title track's description of a high-school romance and its aftermath; \\"Fire Down Below\\", a song about urban street life; \\"Sunburst\\", which is about someone who has it made; and \\"Sunspot Baby\\", which relates a tale of the anger that results from trust betrayed, all unite to form a harmonious whole. The fact that Seger, like virtually every other Midwestern, Southern, and West Coast rocker, advocates efforts to free people unjustly imprisoned in foreign countries, as well as increased funding for law enforcement, makes this album an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience."},{"rating":"2","title":"shipped fast","review":"i bought night moves on tape played so much just wore it out. so i got it on c d love it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Rock and Roll from the Seventies","review":"This is a classic of Rock and Roll and Seventies music.

An album filled with rock 'n' roll anthems and classics,this is as American as American music gets.

An absolute classic, anyone who likes rock n roll, must have this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seger's best work","review":"This album is simply a killer. Bob Seger in those days was playing raw, essential rock and roll at its best.There's not a loser on this whole album, but the title song is a must hear. And \\"The Fire Down Below\\" is the one of the best workouts a Telecaster will ever get. It's a smoking, hook-filled, howling rock masterpiece. Seger outdid himself on this album and never again reached this high water mark.Don't miss out on Night Moves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remastered?","review":"This is a great album. The only complaint I have is the remastering. About 2/3 through the song \\"Night Moves\\" there is a worbling in and out that sticks out like a sore thumb. It made me cringe. It sounded like a worn out cassette tape. I could've made a CD from an LP that would have sounded better than that mess. To me, it ruined the song.

David's chapter on Einstein and unified field was good but the rest of the book looked a little thrown together. Even compulations should be well ordered.

For example, \\"4 and 20 blackbirds baked in a pie\\" are pictured as birds half in half out of a fruit pie, with the suggestion that they are eating the berries (rather than the original intention which was something more like a blackbird pot pie).

The pages are fairly thick (unlike the Disney treasury we recently bought) which is good since I let her turn them. In 2 months time the first page has been torn from the spine. My daughter is a fairly careful page turner. It's rare she stops looking long enough to read a whole story, but Humpty Dumpty, Pat-a-cake, four and twenty blackbirds, three little ghotessess, and old king Cole are a few she'll turn to and ask us to read.

This game is pretty linear like Jak 2. Origanality. What originality? They got the guns idea from Ratchet and Clank series(which is a great series by the way), now they copy the weapon uprades? Not to mention the fact that its a GTA copy too. The difficulty is hard but not as hard as Jak 2. There's always this challenge. Beat this time or lose and break the controller(depending on how you handle situations). Hardly any minigames. Ratchet and Clank has more and better ones at that. Sorry, but The Ratchet and Clank series are simply better for originality and plain fun. If your looking for a fun kickbutt funny(and I mean funny) platformer go with the Ratchet and Clank series. (and for fans of the series, look for a new game coming this fall 2005 called Ratchet: Deadlocked)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another disapointing racing game.","review":"I knew I was in trouble when Jak states, near the beginning of the game, \\"One thing I can do is race!\\".And that's what JAK III is - race after race after race. Want to proceed in the game? You have to race. Want to proceed in the game after that? Another race. So on and so on and so on and so on.Normally I wouldn't mind so much, but with JAK II you MUST complete racing games in order to progress with the rest of the game. Thus, if you cannot finish the racing game you CAN NOT continue with rest of the game.I'm glad I rented this one instead of buying it.

The world is huge and allows access to Haven City later in the game and you have access to upgraded weapons, more secrets/orbs, vehicles, and light jack. I beat this game much faster than Jak 2, but Jak 3 is by far the better game.If you want my personal opinion, Jak 2 is the best Jak game in the series, but Jak 3 would be the overall best.

Why come out with another one? The first one was very very good, everything was appropriate and it was easy, but challenging! Isn't that what every video game should be like? Not too easy but not to hard neither? Jack II came out with hard levels, cursing, Adult humor [If you thought Daxter was cute and friendly in the first one, you'd be having your mouth open when he stars at a girl's privates...] and so much more disturbing sequences. This one was a disgrace to all of them. It's short, everything is pretty much the same just that it takes place in a freakin' desert instead of a rainy town, and guess what?

The worlds are so huge.Maybe there was a chance to put more action on the space ship but this way is also fine. I know for sure that my son will enjoy it. The city looks much more like the real living place, the citizens shot back if you attack them. I did not get a chance to try all other goodies, I had to come to the end of the game so I can help my son go through, but I saw an option to include/buy something from Ratchet&clank game.

In particular, Investigation of a Flame is a testament to the idea, \\"Protest is patriotic,\\" a characteristically American idea that our country nonetheless loses sight of whenever it's most urgent to keep it in focus.

Where most language learning books simply transliterate words phonetically, this software actually lets you HEAR the words spoken by an Egyptian as you see them on the screen (written in Arabic, in English transliteration, and the English equivalent). The words are categorized and you can listen to each word as many times as you like. It even has a function where you can record yourself saying the word and compare it to the Egyptian's voice (it shows the wavelength pattern of the words, too). As a housewife, I have appreciated the ability to print out vocab sheets as needed for study.

The mix of booze, despair, and the fight for his brand of honor is done to perfection. Parker's writing is genius and so is the script for this movie. Every actor is worth watching...but, Selleck is riveting in his complexity. As Jesse Stone, his flaws captivate.

The dialog that Parker writes is very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect role for Selleck","review":"I'm a fan of Robert Parkers \\"Paradise\\" series featuring the Jesse Stone character. I like his Spenser books somewhat less because the Spenser character has grown tiresome and repetitive over too many installments (to me at least).Tom Selleck is perfect as Jesse Stone, a brooding Police Chief of a small New England township. He's battling alcoholism and a continuing love connection to his ex-wife. This character is pretty much the polar opposite of his Magnum P.I. character but he nails it - just enough brooding with sparks of wry humor. These series of movies (Stone Cold, Death in Paradise, and Night Passage are three of four, I think) are all beautifully shot and feature a great supporting cast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesse Stone is FANtastic!","review":"Anyone looking for Magnum P.I. in the Jesse Stone character should look elsewhere. Tom Selleck does a magnificent job in his portrayal of a rough, very flawed, but brilliant sheriff as he cracks the case, but interacts genuinely with his fellow officers and the people he serves. I enjoy this series and have all of the Jesse Stone DVD's. PLEASE GIVE US MORE! Terrific series! Intense, dramatic, wonderful sound track and scenery...you really care about these people.

If I could give it 10 stars I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"Night Passage","review":"These Jesse Stone series are a great vehicle for Tom Selleck, its good to see him back in action - the stories are great, and suit him to a tee. He has that ability to convince the viewer that he is Jesse Stone - very much a tortured soul. He is very believable in the role.. it seems like it was written for him. I have all three episodes and enjoy watching them very much - keep wanting more."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Atmosphere, No Plot","review":"I kept waiting for this picture to get moving, but it never did. There is a lot of atmosphere and a lot of meaningful brooding, but nothing ever actually happens. As a result, the pacing of this film is painfully slow. We don't get anything like a story until nearly the very end, when Stone stumbles across the money-laundering scheme. Of course, part of the reason everything is so slow is that the filmmakers jettisoned the biggest part of Robert B. Parker's plotline. The money laundering is strictly secondary in the book. It's as if they did \\"Mutiny on the Bounty\\" without the mutiny. On the plus side, Selleck is excellent, and so is the rest of the cast, but they are torpedoed by the molasses-in-January pace and excess atmospherics. It's hard to believe the same director made the other two Jesse Stone pictures. Those two are excellent; \\"Night Passage\\" is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"not just god or bad","review":"I like the Jesse Stone books.but this telling shows only a slight resemblance to the story.I really like Tom Selleck, but the changes are more then I like,some needed to fit Mr.Selleck.but others were just P.C.and still others,well I don't know why, maybe because it was just a way to make it fit.as a movie, it was just ok. but if you read the book before, it really doesn't measure up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert Parker's Jessie Stone's \\"Night Passage\\"","review":"I had previously rented from the video store the movie Stone Cold, with Tom Selleck.

Night Passage introduces you to the main character, Jessie Stone, and also the other returning characters. Who, where, when, etc., without deterring away from a great story/plot.

Unfortunately the author had a hideous writing habit that he used throughout the book. As he would explain various topics he would add additional letters to particular words. For example: \\"...\\" At first I thought this was a typo, but it occurs on page after page with different words and is terribly distracting. I can't believe an editor would let this get through. I don't know if this was meant to be cute or what, but it is just...annoying.Additionally, for a book that is obviously designed for those of us who are clueless about algebra, Mr Miller would often start off explaining new topics by stating something to the effect that he once thought this topic was hard, but now he doesn't nor do his students, so the reader should do super well.

He spends a good deal of this book telling you that he is. I however have to disagree.Whenever I tried to learn a concept from this book, I always ended up more confused than when I started. When he derives equations he introduces unnecessary and complicated steps that ultimately contribute nothing to the solution. His descriptions of the functions are confusing and regularly use terms he has not introduced. The values chosen for the examples easily could have been ones that would clearly illustrate the principles being taught, but for some reason Miller usually chose the few values that didn't clearly illustrate anything.On the plus side he makes notes of which sections will be on the Math SAT. So, if you are practicing for the SATs, you may find that helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really good for the clueless","review":"Just once I would love to open an Algebra text and find in the first chapter on the first pages and explaination of WHAT THE HECK ALGEBRA IS, AN WHAT ITS FOR, AND HOW IT FITS INTO THE WHOLE WORLD OF MATHEMATICS.This book offers nothing new in technique or content.

I grew up with the magical story and timeless pictures, as did my kids. My 19-month old granddaughter likes to sit on my lap for what she calls \\"Bar-Bar.\\" The pages of Babar going for a drive and the wedding party with all the animals are great to play \\"Where's the....?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Sentimental favorite","review":"This was a childhood favorite of mine. Its a poignant, charming book that warms my heart. I hope every child reads it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Imperialistic propaganda at its best (or worst)?","review":"I second what one of the reviewers said about the imperialistic propaganda.My husband recalled reading this book as a child, so when my mother-in-law got it for my daughter, I was delighted. So, I read it today for the first time and was utterly horrified at the blatant propaganda in it! Wow, it scares me to think that the book is a classic and that a few generations grew up reading it! I'm returning it to the nearest used book store. I'm sure my daughter is too young to pick up on the offensive things as I do, but there is tons of kind and cute literature for children out there, so why bother reading this (on a personal note, I did not find the book either charming or delightful, but rather tedious and boring, offensive things aside)?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing...","review":"We received this book as a gift for our 3 yr old. I read it to her and it was really disturbing. Other reviews have noted that it must be read \\"in context\\" as far as the time it was written. I disagree - when was a child's viewing a mother's brutal murder (Babar seeing his mother being shot before his eyes) ever appropriate fare for a little child? Then, Babar has to run for his life and later on in the book, there is another death. Also, Babar is surprised when his cousins have no clothes - this is upsetting to him. I find it offensive - elephants don't need to be like people - they don't need clothes. I don't see the charm in this book at all. I don't see the attraction. One thing -- Babar marrying his cousin is the one thing that is not shocking - its not like incest, like brother and sister or like they grew up together -- people have been marrying cousins for thousands of years - up until at least the beginning of this century - hardly immoral."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Remembered","review":"I remembered how much I loved Babar growing up so I thought I'd get it for my 5 yr old and 19 month old. Babar's mother is shot and killed at the beginning of the book and another elephant dies later of food poisoning. Not the cuddly elephant book I had hoped for. Weird what a difference 40 years can make on one's perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best thing since sliced bread...","review":"This captivating tale of how a young elephant overcame obstacles and prejudice kept me on the very edge of my seat the entire time. De Brunhoff's mastery of the literary terms created a real page-turner that I could not put down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reconsidering the classics","review":"We all know how nice it is to share a book from our own youth with our child. But take time out to re-read Babar as an adult -use your adult judgement, apply your morals and beliefs to this book. You will not need to dig very deep to see that this story is based on unabashed imperialism. It is, in fact, offensive. I am not saying that you should not go ahead and read it to your child. But do have a discussion with him or her about what Babar learns from the lady, his relationship with his mother and his bride. As for myself, I am just not buying this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty scary for a young child","review":"I purchased this book thinking that Babar is one of the great classics and how much my 4 year old would love it. Well, I'm glad I read it first. The first thing that happens to Babar is that his mother is killed by poachers. How frightening is that for a young child? Then, left alone in the world, he goes off on his own, has wonderful adventures (the part of the book that's fine) only to come back and marry his cousin. Well, those are not the sorts of things that I'm willing to expose my young children to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mother gets shot and dress for success themes","review":"We are getting rid of this book at a garage sale. Mother shot, odd story does nothing for the mind and teaches nothing of value-- sad too as pictures are great-- but this crazy tale goes out the door with joy."},{"rating":"1","title":"imperialist propaganda for the kiddies","review":"I don't know why this book is a classic. Foreigners come to Babar's home and kill his mother. He goes to the land of the foreigners to learn to be just like them because the are so swell and all. He then takes their ways back home with him. marries his cousin and gets everyone to wear clothes like the foreigners. This is a nightmare, not a children's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"WALKING SIPSEY: The people, places, and wildlife","review":"This is an excellent book to read as well as an excellent guide to exploring the Sipsey Wilderness.

The songs are a good selection but who ever mastered these track for this particular CD boosted the highs so much it's not only 'harsh', it sounds like bad scratched up record. You'll especially notice it during the vocals.

On some level the overlay of vocals and guitar rhythms on this CD remind me of Juanes' music. But at the same time it's definitely a great departure from Juanes' music. I love Michael's CDs because he's always changing and evolving his sound - always making that extra effort to do better instead of resting on his laurels. I heard that he's going to re-release this CD to include the salsa and reggaeton versions of his songs. I know some of my friends were disappointed that there were no pure salsa tracks on the CD.

She travels around the United States, first landing in New York City and ending back in Paris only to become disappointed by the look Paris has after touring America. This book was written after her visit but creatively written in journal format, dating from January 25 to May 20, 1947. On the contrary to public opinion, Beauvoir is not anti-American in this reading. Although she is very critical of the way of life people have in the United States, she seems throughly interested throughout her stay. One can note recurring themes that Beauvoir focuses on throughout the book, ranging from female rights to racism to the architecture and fellow intellectuals from America. This book is recommended for help on discovering different perspectives about the United States."},{"rating":"2","title":"America Through French Eyes","review":"\\"America Day by Day\\" is a look at the experiences of Simone de Beauvoir, a French existentialist, as she traveled through the United States in the Spring of 1947. Beauvoir chronicles her experiences in journal form, and the reader is able to gauge her reactions to different regions and factions of American life first hand. We witness her awe at all the conveniences in a hotel lobby, and her disdain for the situation with blacks in the South prior to the Civil Rights movement, among other things. Beauvoir primarily mixes and mingles with intellectuals and journalists, but she also has meaningful interactions with college students and African Americans. Through this all, we see Beauvoir's positive and negative views of the United States--both the goodness in the nature of the American people and the ways in which American freedom and democracy is restricted by the aristocratic nature of society are featured."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outrages Shipping Charges","review":"This was the only place i could find this item (at the time!)POoR FIT!I was Charged an outrageous price for the shipping of these two items!

Also, my hair felt brittle after applying this product! Except for my hair ends, the rest of my hair was relatively soft and smooth, and this product made my hair feel brittle! Not impressed.

SOCIOBIOLOGY has a massive Lit. Cited (up to date of original publication) and contains all the really useful bits of Wilson & Bossert's very useful PRIMER OF POPULATION BIOLOGY. It also has some lovely examples of pioneering studies in behavioural ecology that in some cases have been taken to very exciting \\"next levels\\" over the past quarter century & in other cases still lie fallow. Wilson's style is readable and I still feel that this book makes a good foundation block for a personal library, but it is essential that one gets more recent stuff as well, including both the critics and the elaborators. This is the beginning only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read, but more like a science textbook","review":"Having been a science major, this book at times reminded me of reading a biology textbook. At other times though, the author does use his literary skills and story telling ability and keeping things humourous; especially when he tells of the murder, deception, treachery, intrigue and chemical warfare of his beloved ants.There is A LOT of theory in this book. He will typically describe an organisms behavior or behavioral trends and then desrcibe the competing hypothoses for these trends, phenomena or divergance from these typical trends.Like I said though, this book is technical. Don't attempt reading it unless you have completed 2 courses of undergrad biology and calculus, as well as chemisty (most of the chemicals used by ants and the like involve simple organic compounds I was a chem major myself.)In other words, this is not like On Human Nature or Journey to the Ants: This is more like a 3rd or 4th year advanced biology course textbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Welcome Return","review":"This is a classic by the most famous \\"bugman\\" in the world, a naturalist in the twentieth century who drew conclusions from the observed behaviour of insects.

This is not a short read, but is absorbing and a \\"must\\" for the \\"everyman\\" who wishes to learn from the thoughts of a master. I have the original hardcover but am glad that the book will be more widely available and is sure to be something that readers of Wilson's popular books will want to have in their libraries. Wilson's Pulitzer Prize winning \\"On Human Nature\\" is another book well worth reading for an overview by one of the best American minds of the latter 20th century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware--looks nothing like photo","review":"I ordered this rug in two sizes for an entryway and hall runner. In the photo, it appeared to have a neutral tan background with small pebble-like circles on top. I received the rugs today and I'm so disappointed. The circles that I thought would be pebble sized are actually the size of my hand--they're 4 or 5 inches in diameter. They have odd borders around them that change color, so one circle might have 2 or three colors in the border. The worst part for me, though, is that the background color is a muddy mess. It appears pink, copper, purple and brown all together. On the plus side, the rug is soft and cozy. It feels pretty well made for the price.

Thus, so much backstory is just redundant and useless. The storyline, though creative at elementary stages, is not very well developed. The writing isn't that well done, either. The characters aren't true to their personas in the television series. Their emotions and the way they talk are very uncharacteristic of the original characters.

I don't recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book of Fours","review":"This was an awsome book. I found myself wishing that they had made this into a story arc on the series. It was fun and very true to each charecter. It is the first book that I have read in the Buffy book series. I love how it incorporates the past slayers.

If the focus had been more on India Cohen, or even exclusively, this would have been a really first-rate Vampire Slayer novel. But there ends up being way too much going on in this story. Then again, one of the things that makes Holder stand out as a writer of Buffy stories is that she continues to use the people and places you creates (e.g., the Ghostroads), so hopefully there will be some more on India down the road. They already proved in the Spike & Dru novel that stories about past Slayers can work, so let's just keep our fingers crossed on this one. \\"The Book of Fours\\" is not a great Buffy novel, but it is certainly above average."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice job","review":"I really enjoyed this book because it was exciting, different, and had many new characters.

It has been quite a wait for the next Repairman Jack novel to arrive. I remember when I first read the the Tomb I was amazed and have been anticipating a new chapter ever since. This book did not dissapoint. My favorite chapter without giving to much away was Jack's booby trapped hideout and the suprises that it held in store for the thugs. I only had two minor gripes. I wish there was more of a supernatural element to the story like in the Tomb but that is just a personal preferance, also the relationship between Alicia and the cop never really seemed to have a purpose, it was all set up and had your interest but then it just dissapeared.

The tuners are smooth, and the action and setup out of the box is nice.The sound is nice and bright, sweet even. The intonation is pretty good it goes a tad sharp up the fretboard, but not enough to notice when strumming chords near the nut. A professional set-up may take care of this by lowering the action just a bit (this could be at the expense of playing loudly). There are no dead notes, or buzzes. I am sure a solid soundboard would make this sound even sweeter, but that is only found a higher price point.Overall I am very pleased with my ukulele, and I would purchase this model again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Rating from a Marginally Qualified Rater","review":"I bought my first beginner ukulele only six months ago, but enjoyed enough that I decided to move up from the toy class to something a little better.

Like others who have rated Oscar Schmidt products, I have been impressed by the beautiful finish of this instrument, but it's the improved action and sound quality that totally won me over. Go ahead and buy your $20 Rogue instrument to see if you like the ukulele, but when you're ready to step up to the next level (but perhaps aren't ready to shell out $250), this is a solid stepping stone.

None of her songs are catchy enough to be hits and its really not well made. Overall, I'm not satisfied with this album. I'm crossing my fingers that her next album (Christmas) will be better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this cd!!!!!!!","review":"Over the last few years, Christina Aguilera has made an impressive debut to the pop charts and this cd adds much kudos to her credit. My personal favorite song on the album is \\"Ven Comnigo\\", the spanish version of her hit \\"Come on Over\\". I have actually listened to that song 1123 times in one day and I\\"m still not tired of it, but the average person is not that obsessed.

Christina IS the BEST!","review":"What can I say? Christina can sing virtually anything. I think its great that she's exploring her Latino roots through her first Spanish Language CD. She really nailed the language. In the world of teen pop non-singers (Britney Spears) Christina has proven time and time again that she will be the one left standing after 20 years has gone by.

Her accent is a little off as expected, but I can tell one of the only reasons this was realeased was to keep Christina from fading away like she has started to do. I mean, Mandy tried to do the same with a special edition album, and its a flop. Anyway, most of the songs are kinda boring. She's got her OK ones, but she obviouly tries too hard to show off her voice.

I loved it. While Aguilera is much too given to vocal gymnastics in either language, I find it less annoying when she sings in Spanish. There is no denying the quality of her voice. The selections range from slow and evocative to lively, with all of them sharing excellent arrangements and very professional instrumentation. I would highly recommend this album to anyone whether they understand the words or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christina expands her horizons","review":"Christina Aguilera never ceases to amaze me. She wowed me with her vocals in her debut album, and she wowed me again with her first Spanish language album. The songs are all great, with some nice uptempos and beautiful ballads.

Keep up the good work Christina."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same, predictable, standard pop only in a \\"latin\\" package","review":"Many of the hits on her English CD don't really sound well in Spanish. The record company should have just paid writers to make new material instead of rehashing the same old songs. This is just the same pop fluff from her previous CD offered in a new package and with a few different sounding latin artists to make it sound \\"authentic\\". This CD reeks of pretentiousness to me and I don't believe Christina is \\"exploring\\" anything about herself here, it's just an opportunity to ham it up in a new language... (would this CD have been taken as seriously if someone without a spanish last name had made it?) Besides, would she have even come out with a spanish CD if it wasn't the \\"in\\" thing to do right now? I just hope she comes out with an Irish CD soon to honor her mother's heritage (U know, the person who actually CARED about Christina)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Muy bien!","review":"Este disco es muy bien. Firstly all those people whom said she is just trying to cash in on the latin excplusion they can shut up. She is half latina and therefore by latin american standards is just latina.

If she had come out with this album before any english stuff no-one even know she is from america. This album did really good on the latin charts and she shows once again that she can sing.

I know fans are gonna say, \\"ooohh, I wonder what she sounds like in spanish\\" well to me its nothing special. I know it might sound like I'm bashing the album but in about 2 years from now, this CD will be wiped off.

Her singles Come On Over Baby, I Turn To You, Genie In A Bottle, Reflection and What A Girl Wants are all included in Spanish as are many new tracks. The highlight of the new tracks is Falsas Esparanzas, which she also performed live during her tour. The song is both funky and seductive, and you will play it again and again!

I recommend for her not to scream so much, to take it easy and to LEARN SPANISH instead of translating the same English songs and put it out on another cd.I guess this cd should be named, MI TRANSLATION INSTEAD OF MY REFLEJO.You outhere having second thought about buying this, well is not a good cd, is just translations of the same English songs that were on her first cd, If you want the translation just talk to you latin friend , I am pretty sure he or she could translate better than what the producers of this \\"album\\" did.Don't buy it!Cristina please don't scream so much!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Christina is just a FAKE RIP OFF of Samantha Fox!","review":"Disgusting that Jive never changes its ideas.

Also the steps in Sam Fox's 1991 videoclip for \\"Hurt me! But the pants stay on\\" are EXACTLY the same as in Christina's genie in a bottle steps.It's just disgusting how uninventive the firm Jive is and how they degrade their artists to be imitated by a cheap teenie version 10 years later.Also towards Christina it is not very fair to just let her be an imitation.

I could have gone back 7-8 saves and done what a guy on youtube does but I wish the game was just more fluid. I guess i should have known to conserve ammo 10 mins earlier in the mission ::eyerolls::. All of the difficulty settings are pretty much the same. Graphics are overrated and dont run well on my GTX 460 and dual core 2.9. And finally, the story line is pretty lame.

Challenging FPS, then it goes alien. While graphically cool, it completely loses touch in the CORE (interesting that the core of the CD sucks). After you finally get out of the CORE, its fun again for a sequence, until you have to fly the VTOL. What a piece of junk. Unfortunately, the game is weaved through with tedious boring frustrating sequences (example, flying a VTOL in windy weather battling aliens who fly faster, turn better...). I finally gave up deciding that a game this frustrating wasn't worth playing. Oh one other thing, you better have a VERY fast CPU and at least a GEForce 8800 NVIDA card to play this game or you'll have LOTS of skipping and stop action (not the kind of stopping you want).

These are all things that Crysis lacks.It's almost like Nvidia, ATI, and Intel are paying Crytek to make a game that computers can't run, just to sell hardware. I got through the first few hours of the game, and I couldn't even bear to play it any more after that, because it just wasn't any fun to play.

Obviously, the graphics you see in the ads cannot be run on most machines...even gaming enthusiast's machines. So, why buy this game if you cannot enjoy its biggest asset (great graphics)???There are no graphic optimizations done by this company.

I can not fathom Microsoft making a \\"keyboard only\\" game in this day and age.Also, you need to play the game with the DVD in the drive the whole time, or go through the frustration of trying to download a Trojan free .exe file patch. This game is rated \\"M\\" for mature, so if you don't want little ears hearing the \\"F bomb\\" you have to download a patch for that too... or turn the human voices off in the settings.I gave the game to a neighbor (with the above disclaimers), returned the joystick, and deleted the game from my hard drive.

The graphics are stunning, but you must have a high-end system to play it, no exceptions. That's the only reason why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. I can played it maxed-out (all fans screaming, LOL), and it is exceptionally good. You do not have to follow an invisible tunnel to accomplish missions -- you can go almost anywhere, anyway you desire, which makes playing this game again so much fun!The Crytec game engine is amazing, and just keeps getting better. Crysis 2, IMHO, is the best SP FPS ever made...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crysis good even on 6+ year old computers","review":"I have an old computer with a 2.01GHz CPU, 1GB of RAM, and a Geforce 7600 GS, twin 80GB hard drives. And ran in 800x600.And on the lowest settings, the game looks and acts beautifully.Sure there's no shadows or light beams, but the Singleplayer Demo has convinced me it's good enough for the full version.There was a few times it froze in places. But it never locked up on me.I recommend this to any FPS fan out there. To give this game a chance, even if their computer is not as good as these top of the line ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Technological Marvell","review":"Crysis is an obvious successor to Far Cry once you see the initial game play. However, the nano suite, amazing graphics, destructible environments, zero G, and ice world are quite unique. Overall, I found the game to be really fun. I did upgrade my video card (WinXP): originally I had an AMD939 4400x2 and X1900XT/256MB. The game played fine at 1280x800, 2X AA, and MED until I got to the ice level. Then I had to drop to 1024x768 0x AA, and MED to even hit 10-20fps. I installed an 8800GT/512MB and went to 1280x1024 2x AA, HIGH and the game ran smooth as silk (even maintaining over 30fps on the ice level). The one HUGH item the game lacks is the ability to REALLY go where you want (sandbox). I really wanted to just take a helicopter and fly around the island or go hike over mountains but couldn't. The upcoming Mercenaries game should give me what I am looking for. Anyhow, Crysis is still worth a try, at least try the demo if you are unsure and make a decision..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"This game plays on very high detail on newer systems but still has some frame rate issues if you want all the bells and whistles.

Vista 32 Ultimate. 8800GTX, and a 1248x1024 monitor. The game runs very smooth with everything on Very High with no AA. Some might say the \\"low\\" resolution of my monitor helps. When I'm on water where there aren't too many texture maps to update, I can run with 8X AA and everything would still be smooth.Game play is great but can be annoying sometimes. For instance, you don't have a \\"always run\\" mode so you always move too slow unless you keep the shift key pressed.

The suit is useless because you can only use abilities for about 3 seconds. People say that the game is open exploration. Yeah, it is, but there isnt much to explore besides jungle and the occassional Korean outpost. You mostly have one mission and you follow the nav point to get there. You are extremly weak; running into a camp full blast is useless. I had to sneak everywhere invisible and snipe with my machine gun to keep from getting killed.My final thought?

Even today, with games like Bulletstorm and even Crysis 2 (yeah the first one still looks better), nothing seems to surpass the level of detail that went into this game. That being said, you need a nuclear reactor-powered super computer to handle it a max settings. Kidding. My quad core overclocked hd 5870 beast handled it fine. The story is set on an island (Crytek is so creative *sarcasm*) taken over by Koreans and your job is to infiltrate, evacuate hostages, and uncover the truth. Throughout the journey you find lots of Koreans, trees, and even aliens. The lighting effects, physics of breaking palm trees and punching walls in, and explosions will leave your jaw on the floor and it will stay there. The story is whatevs. Multiplayer is fun and fast paced. Overall the game is good. Just not great.

It won so many awards & is so highly praised that it is ,I admit, a classic. It did have good ideas, which it mostly ignored. Instead it talked about bleak characters, in a bleak world, doing bleak things in a bleak way,etc. Also this book gave me way too much information on the main character's sexual dysfunctions. Maybe my personal prejudices got in the way of my enjoyment of this book. For instance I dislike unrelenting bleakness & don't believe in psychology. Still I do not understand why I am the only person who disliked this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a REALLY good book.","review":"If you like sci-fi with a little psychology mixed in, then this is the book your you. This is an excellent and quick read. This was one of the most satisfying books I have read in a really really long time. I really liked the interaction between Robinette (main character) and is AI psychotherapist (Sigfrid). The other part of the story is about his actual exploration of space via 'Heechee' technology which humans discover but don't fully understand.

I really cannot recommend this book enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunted by this book","review":"Isn't that what you want from a novel? A year later I still think about it. Yes, the psychotherapy sections seem a little slow. It helps if you've ever had any therapy, and are used to the rhythms of it.

And the premise seemed exremely intriguing. But once I started reading, I found that I had to force myself to trudge through it. I did not identify with the main character. Seems like Pohl was trying really hard to create a deep character, but it seemed contrived and phony to me. And it was just boring. I didn't care about the protagonist, and just kept wanting it to get to the parts where they would go on missions. Then when they went on missions, it was still boring and disappointing.I really wanted to enjoy this book, but maybe that was part of the problem. Perhaps it was too hyped up in my mind before I started."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure drivel!","review":"This was an \\"Old Wave\\" guys bizarre attempt to adjust to the \\"New Wave\\".

Few other novels offer artistic possibilities as great as 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA. Unfortunately, Saddleback's artwork is the book's weakest link.Intended to introduce young readers to classic novels, the Saddleback volumes I've reviewed have varied from fair to poor. Their version of 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA does a fair job of condensing the novel down to 56 pages. A little more pruning was probably called for since some strips are overflowing with dialogue. A bigger problem though is the book's artwork. It's poorly done and often amateurish. I don't know if it will entice younger readers into wanting to read the original. And $9.95 seems a bit much price-wise.I'd rate this an optional purchase. There are better versions of this book available. Check out the 'Classic Starts' series from Sterling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the buy!","review":"Not the full story.

I was expecting a paperback version of the original story punctuated by some colorful illustrations. What I got was basically a comic book.The description states that the book \\"features classic tales retold with attractive color illustrations.\\" In plain English, that means the book is 70 pages of bold, cartoonish drawings that tell the story via \\"thought bubbles\\" like those you find in comic books. There are sporadic phrases from the original book sprinkled throughout, but not exactly as part of the story.I was very disappointed with this book.Also, part of the spine was torn slightly during transit, so I returned the book for a full refund. I have since purchased an illustrated paperback (what I was looking for in the first place) at Barnes & Noble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Bad","review":"Review by my 11-year-old son: This book is very bad!The graphics are like Japanese anime.

Mayfield was clearly the master of funk and his falsetto vocals are the definition of soul. I have too many favorite tracks to pick just one -- \\"Freddie's Dead\\" and \\"Kung Fu\\" are alone worth the price of this CD. Most of the songs address some kind of moral or social issue and the lyrics are genuinely thought-provoking, not cliched. Some of the songs make you want to dance, and for others you just need to close your eyes and soak it in.This is one of my favorite CDs of all time, regularly played and always enjoyed as much as the first moment I heard it.If you are even remotely curious about Curtis Mayfield or funk/soul music in general, you have to have this CD. It just doesn't get any better than this.

Arendt breezes through an exorbitant quantity of philosophy with remarkable clarity and grace in this two-volume work. In it she provides a critical review of classical thought, including Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus, Augustine, Dons Scotus, leading all the way up to Kant and Rousseau. She also explicates the notion of the Will in Nietzsche, and then Heidegger's \`Will-Not-to-Will' in his later thought. It is possible that Arendt will remain among the greats in Western philosophy, political theory, and journalism more broadly. Her depth of knowledge and insight and capacity to read a text with fresh eyes will astonish you. Also included in the second volume of the text is one of the most cogent explications of Heidegger's Being and Time you are ever likely to find."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this cookbook and I eat meat","review":"This is such a good cookbook, it has so many delicous recipes in it.

There is a variety of recipes and I love the time saving tips and recommendations of recipes that can be made and frozen ahead of time as I plan to fill my freezer in the month before the baby is due. It was exactly what I needed and I highly recommend it, I have referenced it nearly every day. It also contains lists of high-protein or high-iron recipes which I find helpful.

I have recently overhauled my diet for medical reasons and have been on the lookout for simple, healthful recipes. This book delivers all that and more.

I keep coming back to this cookbook because of its potential and hoping/praying that the results will be better this time. But, nothing changes. The food isn't great.

I found that the recipes seemed a bit complicated, because of the amount of ingredients needed and its not just stuff that most people would have lying around the house. I haven't cooked anyhting out of the book yet, but have used a lot of the tips she offers. I guess I am just not much of a cook. I am a young newlywed with all the time in the world, but I am pregnant and therefore exhausted. I also don't have the cash to spend on all the weird ingredients you need on hand, which I would have to buy at the local co-op which is super expensive.

There are several recipes that are quick and easy to make and also several that can be frozen and reheated later. This is now the first cookbook I reach for. My husband who is a vegetarian in training loves the meals too! There is a lot of variety and most of the recipes don't require a lot of exotic ingredients that you can only find in specialty stores as is the case with some vegetarian cookbooks.

She also includes the nutritional benefits that you are recieving from each recipe. I also liked how she grouped the helpful recipes to make for pre-conception (that's me), pregnancy, and post-partum. It was so handy to have when I cooked for my vegetarian friend that came home from the hospital when she had her new baby. I made the fabulous butternut squash lasagna which is recommended for the post-partum mom to help her heal because of its high nutritional content. They really loved it.

The book's anti-semitism could easily be replaced by any other kind of racism and feel right at home in 2005. The story concerns a liberal Christian writer who takes on a magazine assignment to write about anti-semitism and his angle is to pose as a Jew so he can find out firsthand. It is a rude awakening for him, whether it is a hotel that does not cater to \\"those people\\" or a fiancee making off-hand anti-semitic remarks and thinking nothing of it. Some people might get thrown by writing that was done fifty years ago, but it is a book well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous Shoe!","review":"Beautiful shoe.

I am so pleased that Edie Adams had the foresight to save all the material that otherwise network television would have ultimately scrapped.Most intriguing for me are the earliest shows. Since Ernie was on television in it's infancy, and a few years before I was born, the shows from the mid-1950s were all new to me and very funny, free-wheeling zaniness. The way he played with the camera, the sets, recovered from gags that didn't go right on live TV, all made me admire his comic brain even more.

They took the son of the Devil of the marvel universe and cut off his balls.. at least they didn't make him sparkle when exposed to sunlight and give him a boy band make over.. no... wait..

Nicholas did a good job of a man slowly discovering his abilities, coming to terms with them, and doing his best to make his own relationship with the devil.It's not easy to make such a movie.

This film combines Nicholas Cage's lack of acting talent with a terrible script. The results are disastrous.

They could be great (X-men, Batman, Spiderman, Hellboy, V For Vendetta), they could be awful (Hulk, Skycaptain, Judge Dredd, Ultraviolet). This one gave me what I wanted out of it and adequately told the story of the Ghost Rider, though I never really followed the comic that much, so if there are plot holes I wouldn't know about them. Basically, Nicolas Cage makes this movie. The man is a great actor and can turn S*** into gold (with the exception of the unsalvageable Wickerman). In this case the story is well-written though most of the other actors are B-rated. The girl/love interest Eva Mendes, can barely act, though has nice bouncy breasts and therefore satisfies as eye candy, but little more. Overall, a successful and enjoyable movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Selling your soul to the devil? Bad idea!","review":"4 of 5 stars for the Ghost Rider. I do recommend this movie! First rule of being in a movie: Never sell your soul to the devil! It never works out. In this Marvel comic made into a feature movie, we follow motorcycle daredevil Johnny Blaze who does sell his soul to make his father healthy again. When the devil comes knocking we learn of the legend of the Ghost Rider; the agents who collect debts (souls) on behalf of the devil. We meet a cowboy who we later learn is also a Ghost Rider. Together they battle an evil being who is attempting to steal souls owed to the devil. An interesting story, interesting characters. Well acted, well photographed and great special effects! My favorite scene is the horse riding cowboy aside Johnny Blaze on his motorcycle both moving thru the desert at night leaving a trail of fire.This is one movie in which I like Nicolas Cage. This is a solid movie that I do recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Blu disk! Great comic book tie in!","review":"I bought this movie sight unseen, so I wasn't expecting too much. I liked it! No, its not a great movie but found it very entertaining! Great comic book tie in with the Ghost Rider on a horse from the old west and the present day Ghost Rider with a chopper that puts any bike from American Chopper to shame! Wait till you see this thing! Amazing design. The special effects on the evil characters are very well done and a bit creepy. This unrated edition would probably give the youngsters nightmares. But for the rest of us, we can handle a bad dream or two right?! PQ is Beautiful. Solid blacks, colors and exceptional detail. SQ is superior as well. 5 stars on both.

However, overall it's kind of a mess. The action sequences, though ultimately empty exercises, are often exciting, and when the movie keeps it light and airy, there's an enjoyable exuberance to the proceedings (but all too often, it dips into dour drama and schmaltzy romance). Definitely one for the DVD player, not the big screen.

The plot is confusing,stupid and totally unbelievable even by comic book standards. The plot holes are big enough to drive a semi through. The special effects were mediocre by today's standards and it looks like some of the actors were just phoneing it in.A pretty poor effort.

Nicolas Cage has wanted this forever, a super hero role. Remember he almost played Superman in the '90's, that would have been even more ridiculous than this. He's far too old to be believable in this role. Had they stuck with the guy playing his character at the beginning, the film would have been much better and more believable. Hopefully this film satisfied his fantasy and he will leave super hero roles alone. I, for one, plan on leaving Nicolas Cage movies alone.

We both love super-hero stories and action films, but this definitely did not live up to my hopes. It's the writing that killed it. It's some of the worst I've ever seen in a major motion picture. Very cheesy. But the acting isn't much better. Eva Mendes is just going through the motions, doing what she can with terrible writing. But Nicholas Cage is way over the the top and, again, cheesy.

This movie isn't even a real testemant to that cause it is a bad movie. Cage has reached a level in his movies that can only be surpassed by the hammy Burt Reynolds when his career was going down the tubes. Cage hams it up in every scene doing his quirk/Elvis/hambone gimmick that is so over used and over done by him that it is like, \\"why is he getting paid to do this?\\" and \\"why am I paying to see it?\\" I am a comics fan and I read Ghost Rider. Cage is totally miscast. But I guess when you have a ton of money and you are 'over' as a 'star' you get to play any part you want. Peter Fonda is good as Mephisto and Eva Mendes is hot but this movie just sucks.

Perfect for a Happy Meal tie-in.Nicholas Cage, as wonderful an actor that he is, is horribly miscast -- filling what should be a brooding portrayal with bizare Cage-like eccentricities. Why have Johhny Blaze be a dark, tormented loner (because, again, when you sell your soul to the devil there might be a slight chance you'd be a bit moody)when he can be a motorcycle superstar who listens to the Carpenters and eats jelly beans out of martini glasses?An amazing source material turned into a painful, unbelievably bad movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghost Rider is a Winner!!!!!","review":"In looking over other reviews around here, I'm seeing plenty of \\"weak plot\\" and \\"Nicolas Cage can't act\\" stuff.

He is very believable in his comic character portrayal of the Ghost Rider. Some other reviewers say that you have to be a fan of the comic series to enjoy this movie...more nonsense. This movie was exceptional and left open for plenty more sequels. Eva Mendes could have had more lines...granted, and the love story could have blossomed into something more, but, I believe that's being left for the continuation of the series!Oustanding special effects and an exceptional story!

The story jumps around, the villians seem made for a \\"B\\" flick and I don't see much chemistry between ANY of the actors/acteresses.

Then of course he turns into the flaming head Ghost Rider and beats all the white dudes up.Totally blew the movie for me.Not only that, but the whole movie is slow.

It even had Sam Elliot playing the exact same part as in Blade.So unless you want to see a cool flaming Harley, this movie pretty much sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"This movie is an insult to the extraordinary acting abilities of Nicolas Cage. The one forgiving point of the movie was that Eva Mendez was cast, but, not for her exceptional acting abilities either, but for her outstanding Feminine form; her body, not her brains. Why take to Thoroughbreds and make run the \\"Mule Racetrack?\\" Why take two incredible actors and put them in a movie where their true artistic abilities are not utilized...?

Some say he has gone downhill since movies The Rock, Con Air, and Face Off. But I still enjoy almost all of Cage's movies. I have watched this movie 4 times now since I have bought it, it keeps my intrest from start to finish and I never get tired of it. I think the scene that did it for me was when he was changing into the Ghost Rider and laughing like a crazy person, no other actor could have done that personality like Cage does. But if your just looking for a feel good action movie, with some great songs within the movie, and great acting jobs from Petter Fonda as the Devil, Cage as the Ghost Rider, and Eva Mendes as Cage's love intrest then get this movie. Some scenes are over the top but if your into whole Marvel comics stories then pick this movie up sit back and enjoy a fun movie to unwind to on a day off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made for the under 12 boys market.","review":"What a complete load of garbage this movie is.

Unfortunately, 'Ghostrider' was more dissapointing than the first 'Spiderman' was.The biggest problem with this movie is that absolutely no time was spent in character development. The story went straight to action way to early, and there was no bond with any of the characters like should be felt in any good movie. This seems to be a huge problem with most movies in recent memory. It seems like the theory today is, if you have good graphics and fight scenes, then substance really doesn't matter.There were a couple of funny parts that saves this from 1 stars, but this was overall just a boring, colorful modern movie built up way too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghost Rider","review":"Nicolas Cage is a favorite of mine and I like his action movies.

He did much better in Face/Off which was some-what comic book like. I didn't sense chemistry between him and Eva the kiss was more like them eating lunch, sloppy and all over the place. I personally don't like Eva, she looks greasy. The villains were no challenge to him, especially the last one. I guess the most powerful is the easiest to kill? I really hope Cage picks better rolls in the future, this and the Wicker Man are killing me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool Effects - That's IT!!","review":"Just a bad movie overall. This film only proves that no matter how many cool effects and tricks you use, it can't possible make up for a shoddy script and horrid acting.Creepshow IIImade more sense than this predictible film. Certainly not Cage's best acting either. But really cool computer effects! Goes to show where all the money went with this film. And the chick was pretty hot too!Just a predictable script with cheesy acting by some barnyard rejects. Too bad Sam Elliot and Peter Fonda (what the hell was he doing here?) didn't have anything better to do than this film. Cage is good, and so is the hot chick. But that's it.A rent if you must but definitely not a buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible move, terrible waste of time and money","review":"Ghost Rider should have been a kick a** movie, instead, it got its own a** kicked, through a poor script, terrible CGI, and bad acting.

I wish that Cage respected his fans specialy the Harley bikers to provide theme with something that will show there good side of being bikers.

I obtained this new copy at my W-Mart $5.00 bin. I liked the sound track which includes the fine classic rock Satanic songs of Ozzy, ZZ, and the Carpenters. Cage sells his soul to the devil, former Easy Rider Peter Fonda and becomes his bounty hunter in the form of Ghost Rider. The movie is rather boring until we get the transformation, although it tries to keep us entertained.The highlight for me was the interview Eva Mendes conducts with a punk girl who describes Ghost Rider. \\"His head was all like in flames...but he made it look good.\\"Sam Elliot ensures the picture will remain a cult classic.No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.

But Johnny soon lerans to control his powers and decides to rebel against his master protect mankind from hell's evil intentions, under the guidance of former Ghost Rider Carter Slade (Sam Elliot).To be enitrely honest, I had never read a Ghost Rider comic in my life, and was only vaguely familiar with the character walking into the theater.But, as the lovely Eva Mendes, who plays Johnny's love interest Roxanne, said, \\"Ghost Rider has edge.

Nothing memorable other than Eva Mendes and her cleavage. Nic Cage was decent, but didn't seem to be trying that hard. The CGI was better than the trailers would lead you to believe, but it was nothing I haven't seen done better before. The worst part of the film was the villians and how easy they were defeated.

Nonetheless, it is very relevant and quite interesting!(I later found more of mr. Rose's thoughts in a book he edited with a Hillary Rose - his wife? - called \\"Alas Poor Darwin\\".

It is always interesting to read about Aleksanders work on artificial consciousness, and Penrose on Quantum Consciousness.

And in any case, \\"electronica,\\" in Gomez's able young hands, doesn't mean \\"soulless.\\" \\"Rex Kramer\\" may start off sounding like DISCO, but once Ben Ottewell's chesty roar kicks in, it's blood-n-guts time.\\"In Our Gun\\" collapses the last twenty years of pop music into one record.

The howl that is so viseral and the blend of classic southern rock with a modern Radiohead touch playing and production make them one I my favorite rock bands. More roots than the Mother Hips, who I love as well, they are in the vein of Pearl Jam and great West-Coast groups. That said, this album is a good example of them at their best I think. I first got Liquad Skin and was left not really that happy. It was more Alice in Chains than I wanted and knew Gomez to be.

I can play this one all the way through, which is nice. The title track builds to a creshndo that is unlike anything I have heard. \\"Ping one Down,\\" Drench, and \\"Shot Shot\\" are other my favorite tracks. This is a disc worth buying.

I for one am just mighty glad they've kerbed their endless jamming a little bit and sharpened their song writing skills (which they should have done a little more on \\"Bring It On\\").Bands like Gomez, who seem to have an approach to arrangements that involve throwing everything in - including the kitchen sink, normally attract the kind of fans (you would think) that would perhaps encourage a little bit of experimentation! Apparently not. Let's say upon hearing \\"In Our Gun\\" it hardly took me by surprise!So, thankfully the boys have shifty slightly away from their more rustic blues leanings and written songs you can, oh my goodness, actually whistle along too!They were great before.

The excitement ended by chapter two. The romance portion of the story is frustrating and the mystery predictable. The two main characters get together in chapter 1 (yes, chapter 1) and they are in limbo until later in the book...much later. The \\"mystery\\" in the story is probably only a mystery if you don't own a tv or this is the first book you've ever picked up. Free time is precious, spend it on Charlaine Harris orLaurel K. Hamilton."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"The story was okay. I didn't find the characters that interesting or appealing -- at least, not enough to buy a sequel if there is one. It's so obvious who the villain is. And, frankly, I like my romances a lot steamier. The best we get here is the first delicious kiss that Dan gave Brandy. Everything after that was just bland. I DO have to agree with one reader, though. The cover is so misleading. Who is that vamp on the cover? It certainly isn't Dan Martin who was described as having black eyes and black hair. Black hair? Isn't that a [very unappealing] blonde on the cover? And was that supposed to be a werewolf in the corner? There was no werewolf in the book. One more thing; I thought the last terror scene would never end. Good grief, was THAT ever dragged out. I kept hoping the book would get better.

Pitch perfect is the pacing, acting, writing and score. This is a real life, genuine thriller wholly devoid of any action scenes. It makes you think. It helps you see the freedom you take for granted. It shows you what happens when you let the ends (socialist utopia) justify the means (gestapo, statism). Don't be so naive as to think it couldn't happen here--and know that the threat is from the left, not the right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watched it Twice - Great Character Study - Great Film","review":"I don't usually enjoy having to read movie subtitles - concerned I may be missing subtle visual clues. Fortunately, there was ample time to read and look at the actors. I couldn't figure out where the storyline was going early on. I kept watching and I was rewarded!! One could almost see the changes taking place in the minds of the main characters - the policeman listening into the lives of a writer and his girlfriend, an actress, via bugging devices throughout the apartment. The torment of being forced to choose between one's integrity or submitting to behaviors just to keep one's job or life was grueling to witness. The Sonata to a Good Man at the end of the movie was quietly emotional and somehow satisfying. I don't want to give away the details of the story - it is for each of us to observe and respond to the message set forth.

I have had some personal contact with former Stasi Agents and dicussions about what this period in German history was like. The film comes the closest to showing the absolute hegemony and terror that this agency held over all East Germans, from the bricklayer to the space scientist. I strongly recommend it, in German (especially) or in English!For those of you who see the creeping loss of liberty elsewhere, there are many lessons here."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lives of Others","review":"I have shown this movie to friends who were very impressed and said that they understood the lives of those behind the Iron Curtain much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A peek behind the Iron Curtain","review":"A rare peek of life under a communist, socialist government, in this case in 1984 East Germany. East Germany was in the World's spotlight, due to which it had the highest standard of living and the most freedoms of all other European communist block countries. Further, by 1984 things had improved to a considerable degree.This film is a great achivement, a must see film.

He \\"spies\\"on them by listening in through the multiple microphones implanted in the apartment.Along the way, he somehow gets involved in their lives and starts trying to influence or manipulate the outcome of the story.

Very realistic and well done, actually moving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"I found the plot corny and unexceptional. Eyeball rolling moments include the cliched accident in the road and the Stasi guy listening to the music. Didn't believe his character or much else. It is sentimental melodramatic claptrap designed to push buttons in people to produce waterworks, rather than serious thinking. On the plus side there is some nice period detail (although I have no idea how accurate) and photography.There is the possible perception that an arthouse-like poster and promise of subtitles will mean superior fare, but there is a lot of junk out there, period. Worth a rental maybe as it is not totally without merit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subtitles Spanish, French and English?","review":"If I could give this less than 1 star I would.Considering that German is one of the most spoken languages in the world, in this country and in some states it is the second most spoken language after English, why wouldn't they have German subtitles?This is the reson why I WILL NEVER buy blue ray products!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just kidding!","review":"The other reviews do not lie, this is one of the best films to be released anywhere in the world in the past 5 years.

After a few minutes of viewing, I realized that there was no way to understand what was going on due to the offensive way Sony has subtitled the movie. One word every minute, with no particular criteria. So, if you don't speak German, save yourself a big frustration. I can see films in Spanish, French, Italian and English.

He is the invisible man who chooses to remain invisible but through the course of his work reaches the point of a moral shift. Once headed to the top of Staziland, he sacrifices this to provide protection to his moral superior. AND he chooses to remain invisible, the only life he knows. As such he is the true artist, the real voyeur and playwrite, in the story. The victim of spying at the end is splashed across bookstores in a huge graphic posters while the artist who kept him alive remains an invisible postal worker. This is the perfect portrait of the artist as an invisible man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tenor Sax","review":"When I first received this item, the octave key was a jammed, which could have happened during shipping, so I exchanged it for another, when I received the replacement 2 of the keys leaked."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent Book!!

Then you clean your house and they turn up everywhere \\"I don't remember playing guitar on top of the fridge..\\" This little guy holds about 6 picks snugly in its little kangaroo pouch. I stuck this to my main acoustic guitar and instead of sticking the little pick in-between the strings I just stick it in the holder. And when I clean and start finding loose picks everywhere I just stick them back in the holder. The little adhesive strip keeps it really snug on the guitar, and im sure a little goo be gone will remove residue after you don't want the holder anymore.

For the price, you would expect better quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"This toy was the beginning of my 7yo daughter's discovery and subsequent love of LPS. She has had hours and hours of play out of this. The Gondalas are the main feature (no batteries!!) and the whole 'town' is often transformed into a Motel/Hotel with each of the 'rooms' accommodating guests. We have the Cafe adjoining and the park and next birthday is about to see the addition of the Get Well Centre. Surprisingly (I thought this was for younger kids) the LPS and in particular this town which is our main toy from the LPS, has been a winner. We got this really cheap, for the price we paid it's been well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It broke twice!","review":"I bought this as an addition to a fast-growing LPS collection. We cranked the handle and the gondola went around once and it never worked again. So I returned it and got another set. This time, the gondolas never did go around. Maybe we just have incredibly bad luck. Now we are waiting for a new set from Hasbro."},{"rating":"2","title":"daily play","review":"I have a 4-year old daughter and a 2-year old son, and they both love playing with this.

I especially liked it, because it was NOT just about Hollywood's legendary stars of the 1950's through the 1990's. But it included interesting background information about the responsibilities and interaction of movie technicians (hairdressers, cosmetologists, electricians, etc.)as well as the author's own story of her life between movies when she lived in California, West Virginia, and New Hampshire with her husband and 3 daughters. The author is VERY UPBEAT and HUMOROUS. And--SHE did not include scandalous incidents which would cause embarrassment to the stars or her colleagues!

This book is amazing. Blymyer takes you along on her adventures here there and everywhere with the most exciting people you've heard and read about.

She questions her decisions regarding her husband, children and her career and all the while she is searching for a deeper meaning to her life. You'll laugh and cry and feel a little sadness when the book ends and Blymyer has to say goodbye to the reader. You will go back to read this book time and time again and pass it along to your friends. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More than I expected","review":"What a delight!

But on the deluxe version I got, there are no cut outs or restoration of the missing faces -- it is simply the \\"censored\\" printed cover you see in the first two album photos.

Sorry about the contrarian viewpoint but this is just to warn any potential buyers of this disc who may be overtempted the gushing reviews of how fantastic the album is. For my money, check out the criminally underrated \\"groove trilogy\\" specifically \\"Goat Heads Soup\\", \\"Its Only Rock N Roll\\" and \\"Black and Blue\\", these discs are funky and souful."},{"rating":"2","title":"oh, and one more thing...","review":"if you are waiting some of these songs on the radio before u buy, Shattered won't be among those played.

Before they make me Run is a great Keith vocal with great lyrics. \\"Booze and Pills and Powders, Choose your medicine.\\" and \\"Gonna find my way to heaven cause I did my time in Hell.\\" are some of the best in the song. Beast of Burden is probley the best on the whole album. That leaves us with track 6, Far Away Eyes. I hate country, that's why I love this song.

First of all, at least five songs are written in the same key and have similar rhythms. Second, the singles Miss You and Beast Of Burden are cheesy pop/disco oriented songs that are overly repetitive that are not appropriate for the Stones style.

The Stones were so good enough to add almost an albums worth of unheard (for most of you out there) songs on top of \\"Some Girls\\".Whipped cream with fudge and sprinkles on top of your favorite ice cream, to sum it up.I tip my hat to \\"The Glimmer Twins\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Janus festival","review":"The one half of this album confirmed everything the punks were saying about them at the time, and the other half outrocks the Pistols.

The band sounds tight and full of energy. Keith presents some more of his patented cutting Stone's riffs. And Mick is at his snarling, strutting, sneering best.

He does such a great job of expressing his years of study into simple truths, and embodies the Great Cosmic Joke that will leave you laughing at yourself and how serious you take it all at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind opening, thought provoking!","review":"Alan Watts has a amazing talent of explaining the complex in a way that is entertaining and easy to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Watts","review":"This set of talks is fantastic.

I bought some thicker motorcycle gloves to help fight the cold air when i ride especially on the free way (I travel 36 miles one way). But the thicker gloves only lasted 10 minutes and once my hands got cold, it hurt really bad, i still had maybe another 30 minutes worth of riding. But once i bought these puppies and installed them without any kind of modifications i can ride in 27 degree weather with only regular thin gloves. Dont get me wrong, they were a bit chilly but they were not painfully freezing. They do cover the controls so know where your buttons are. Also its a bit of a hassel moving in and out of these so once i got my hands in i left then there.

I was at the peak of my appreciation for him.Well, while I was in Chicago, my girlfriend's dad got a copy from the UK, in advance, before it even hit the US.We all listened to it while driving through Chicago. The first few songs showed promise. The next showed dissapointment, and there was no return from it.The songs were repetitive, they didn't flow into each other (Much like Zipper Catches Skin), the lyrics were redundant, the band sounded like they threw together stuff at the last moment, and to top it off, he had to throw in Xzibit. Ok, nothing new. A rocker throwing in a rap artist. Well, Cooper couldn't pull it off. It isn't right.Who once was the king of classic rock has now became a new aged smock. It sounds like he's trying to really get attention. He shouldn't even try. He has thousands of fans.Cooper, you can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened To The King Of Shock Rock?","review":"This album doesn't even deserve one star, it deserves none. What happend to the magic that is Alice Cooper? This album is really bad,the song \\"Dirty Diamonds\\" sounds like it's been ripped off from Aerosmith's song \\"Get A Grip\\". If you listen closely to the chours of Dirty Diamonds and compare it with the begining of \\"Get A Grip\\" you'll see that it sounds exactly the same. This album deserves it's name it is dirty and not in the good way. Also, I was shocked to see on Alice's web site, that he compared this album to \\"The Eyes Of Alice Cooper\\". \\"The Eyes....\\".

The album is worth owning for \\"The Ballad Of Jesse Jane\\" alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't let the cover fool you...","review":"This is one quirky little CD that may show that Cooper is gaining the confidence to go beyond the ghoul-schtick and perhaps settle down to the art of making music. And more incredibly, this is one of the first times in a long time that Cooper's voice seems to reach beyond the music. No spit-shine here, just earth-y, deceptively simple backing tracks with the Coop trying on all kinds of vocal personas (yes, there are some glorious returns to the \\"clean\\" Alice-voice of yore). But things are not all on the up and up. Tracks like \\"Saga of Jesse Jane\\" and \\"Run Down The Devil\\" show Cooper still suffering from his insufferable sense of humor and still bearing the weight of his much publicized faith. Over all, though, a real gem. Oh, I get it. Dirty Diamonds!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Story OK, but needs professional editing.","review":"The story seemed to be decent, but was difficult to read due to all the typos and other errors that don't get caught by a spell check. It was frequently difficult to determine which character was speaking dialogue and there was at least one instance where the author called one of his heroes by the wrong name.

In order to do so theyreluctantly agree to co-star in an action movie, but there are forcesat work busily sabotaging their efforts - and that's aside from theirown egos!I found the premise of Men of Extreme Action interesting andbelievable.

This is by far her favorite toy. Ever since she could pull herself up on her own, it's virtually impossible to keep her entertained with toys on the floor. This product not only keeps her entertained while standing, she's learned to use each part of the toy like the ball drop, the lighted numbers, and the pop up frog.

Yes the infants love it, its musical and there are lots of activities on it. It's got the alphabet, the ball tube, and a few spinny things on it. However, I feel that it's not a good 'pulling up' toy. I had a 10 month old infant try to pull up on it and it tipped over on him once he was standing and he got a black eye. I have also had a few 2 year olds get their arms stuck in the opening. No major injuries but some scratching and bruising. The age limits should be increased on this toy. 2 to 3 would be more appropriate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would recommend to everyone","review":"Toy is awesome.

Sometimes they work, sometimes they do not, and they create a lot of static noise. Sometimes a unit emits noise even when it is not in use, which can be quite annoying. I investigated these problems and learned that the units need to be connected to outlets wired to a single phase to work. If they are plugged into outlets connected to two different phases they may not work. This explains why the units work in some locations but not in other, but does not explain why a unit connected to one outlet sometimes work and sometimes does not. Furthermore, the system is prone to interference from electrical appliances. Since most homes have three phase wiring and use a lot of appliances that can generate interference, this suggest a faulty design concept."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Since it works only on one circuit it's really great if you need an intercom from one side of a room to the other, except it'll feed back if you try to use it.

This garlic press is one such case. I always use scrubbers intended for non-stick pans, but this wear still occurs. And who knows what kinds of chemicals are in the cheap finish they use? Looks great out of the box, but they show their age before long. I notice this particularly on this product and on the ice cream scoop.

The bottom screen part that dices the garlic just came out.We hand wash this and take care every time..Now this is a 1 star going in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little less than okay","review":"first of all, it is true--you will have to apply a lot of pressure to use this instrument. you can't fit more than 2 cloves of garlic in press. when you try to press two cloves as opposed to one, you do have to apply even more pressure. the cleaner that comes with it is helpful but it can be really hard to remove the garlic that is on the outside face of the press where it comes out. i need to scrape it with a knife just to get the garlic that i have pressed off to be used in cooking. pressure and time applied for use and having to clean it each time i press it and the great energy and force needed to press the garlic makes it worthless. i can do it the old way which is peel the cloves and use a grater. the old way doesn't hurt my hand and i save time. i was really hoping this would be something i can use in the kitchen and save myself time and mess. its not. back to grater."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not stand up to use","review":"I was all set to love this garlic press. I had used the smaller version for almost four years. But within three months it broke. The screen the garlic passes through came out rendering it useless. I have tried to contact the manufacturer because I am sure it is still under warranty but they have not responded to my email and the pix I sent along with it. So I am frustrated because the tool is in the garbage rather than in my utility drawer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zyliss Garlic Press","review":"Love this garlic press, large capacity for the garlic and the cleaner makes it so easy to clean.

This garlic press is so easy to use. Even a somewhat lacking common sense person such as myself was able to figure out how to operate the device and how to easily clean it. Yay! Now...can someone tell me how to use this thing without making the whole house smell like garlic? On the other hand, we haven't seen any vampires in quite a while..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job, no peeling needed","review":"I like my press. I disagree that it can press more than one clove at a time. I guess it can if they're little and skinny, but it will only hold one plump clove at a time. I don't have any trouble pressing one clove, but if I try to overload it, I do not have the strength to squeeze. But that doesn't matter to me: I usually only want a clove or two, so pressing them one at a time is no issue. I love that I don't have to peel the garlic. That part works true to advertising. The little plastic do-dad to clean the holes is useless, but the press clean just fine with a bit of water."},{"rating":"1","title":"loved my old zyliss press but...","review":"Had a zyliss press for years that we loved - the pin finally gave out so I bought this. After 10-15 uses, the metal snapped and the section with the holes broke off entirely. It was too late to do a straightforward return - am now working on getting a refund. After emailing was offered $4 for the slight damage... see picture above of the slight damage!

It scrapes very easily. Check out my video on youtube. Until they fix the coating issue, this gets a 1 star from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garlic Lover","review":"It works as described. No peeling of garlic, hooray!! And the cleaning is very simple.However, if you put in more than 3 cloves, you will need some serious hand strength to squeeze the handles. It's just something you might keep in mind if you're considering this to give as a gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more pressing problems!","review":"This is the best garlic press I've had. It has a roomy \\"bowl\\" that allows for a couple of large cloves at a time and the cleaner is a whiz! I wouldn't try using it without peeling the garlic as some have said you could, but I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Performance of Zyliss garlic press","review":"This product was highly rated by Cooks Illustrated and since the previous garlic press I owned was virtually useless, I decided to spend the money and order this, and it has lived up to its rating. There still is some waste from the outer skin, but it is sooooooooooooo much better than what I had before."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best - even with shallots","review":"It's all been said, my 2 cents: I'm a big fan, even works on shallots! The brushed aluminum makes it even easier to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed......","review":"I had heard great things about the Zyliss presses, but although this press works great, it is not stainless steel. Nor, apparently, is it solid aluminum either. About a year after using it, I started to notice little flecks of silver paint coming off in my garlic. Apparently there is some kind of finish on the aluminum, or maybe it is an aluminum coating that is coming off. Regardless, as soon as I noticed that, I tossed it in the trash and ordered a Rosle. Significantly pricier, but stainless steel and the tool of many a professional chef, it will likely be around for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST Garlic Press Ever!","review":"I've had this one for several years now and bought one as a house-warming gift recently, too. I also find it great to crush other items like peppercorns, Chinese herbal tablets (too hard to chew and must be crushed to take). I use this DAILY and find it the perfect garlic press and so DEPENDABLE and easy clean-up!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of money!","review":"I am an able-bodied cook with decently strong hands. I have been using garlic presses for 14 years. I couldn't get a single piece of garlic, peeled or unpeeled to mince through this thing. I asked my husband, with stronger hands, to give it a try and he was able to make it happen with considerable force. After a week of frustration and sore hands, I gave it to my five-year-old son to have. He would probably rate it at three or four stars because he thinks it is a great toy and it does a superb job of shooting play-doh through the holes. In my experience, when buying a garlic press you should buy one that has prongs that grasp the garlic while pushing it through the holes. In my opinion, this is definitely not a good garlic press. The best garlic press I have ever owned was from Ikea. It finally just broke and I miss it dearly. It's almost worth driving four hours to get another!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken within a few uses","review":"Unlike the other people here who are also giving this device 1 star, I had no problems getting garlic to come out, in fact.... I would be a person giving this 5 stars, had it not broken so quickly on me....I wasn't even using very large garlic this time, a small little piece.... the little pin that allows the swinging action of the press broke off and now the device is useless.1 star for cheap materials, otherwise I have enjoyed Zyliss products.... I will be more wary now..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shiny surface peels off - Do not n=buy","review":"I would not buy this garlic press. I've had mine for 2 years and the shiny coating has started to peel - I am wondering now if I've ingested some. People, please read all reviews good and bad before buying. I also don't disagree with all the \\"functionality reviews\\" that most people have given here - very good functionality and very good look and feel - but is it safe to use for your family? I will not purchase this garlic press again."},{"rating":"2","title":"compared to Kuhn Rikon Epicurean","review":"Very good press, with one flaw and one caveat.PROs:-- very even crush-- little mess while crushing-- decent leverage-- inexpensiveFLAW:-- the coating begins to flake off after a while (how long with depend on use), but it didn't hinder the function of the press for meCAVEAT:-- clearing peels from the crushing chamber after use requires digging them out; this really slows you down if you crush large batchesBOTTOM LINE:I now use aKuhn Rikon Epicurean Garlic Pressand it is much better for pressing batches of garlic: the flip-out grate makes clearing the press quick and easy with just a swipe of your finger (much easier than having to dig the peels out of the crushing chamber on the Zyliss). But if you usually only need to crush a clove or two (one pressing), then the Kuhn Rikon Epicurean looses it's big advantage. If you can live with that caveat, the Zyliss does a better job for less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aluminum Peels Off, Food Discolored","review":"This thing has a coating that peels off and gets into your food. When you put it in the dishwasher, it oxidizes, and you get grey aluminum powder on the garlic. Unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much too hard to press","review":"I had an older, small Zyliss press that worked just fine but finally gave up the ghost. Ordered this based on the great reviews (crossed my fingers and ignored the few not so great reviews). I am a woman with average hands and strength (please don't ask me to define average), but pressing a clove of garlic through this thing was a real workout. First, it is a rather large press so getting your hand(s) around it for good leverage is a stretch. I tried it with peeled and unpeeled garlic. I snipped off the garlic tips. I cut the garlic in half. I put only one clove in at a time. Still, it required a huge effort for me to press the garlic through. Called my husband and, although he could manage it, he, too, thought it was much too hard and uncomfortable to deal with. Not sure why there is such a difference of opinion on how easy/tough this is to use, but I am going to purchase something smaller and hope for the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great replacement for old garlic press","review":"I could not wait until I could replace my old stainless garlic press with something that was functional and easily cleaned after every use. I read several reviews on different presses and based on the Zyliss reviews, I purchased the Zyliss. I use garlic almost daily and this is a very simple and easy press to use; no need to peel cloves, just put them in the press whole. It is large enough to press two cloves at a time and clean up is a cinch with the built in cleaner. It attaches to the press so you cannot lose it in the drawer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap coating flakes off into your garlic","review":"The title says it all. This thing is a piece of junk and will poison your food (see the picture I uploaded) after just a few uses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Fragile","review":"Got this for my Thai wife who uses a lot of garlic in her cooking. She didn't have big enough hands, or the hand strength to use it. It takes a lot of strength, using both hands, to get this to work because the holes the garlic is pushed through are very small. Using unpeeled garlic isn't recommended because most of it gets pushed up instead of down because the small holes clog quickly. It failed completely, after about 1 month of use, when I put about 3 cloves of garlic in, gave it a pretty good squeeze and the entire bottom plate with the holes separated from the rest of the press. When I buy a new press I will look for something sturdier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice press!","review":"I use my press often, it work very well. It looks nice and it works even better!Highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent garlic press","review":"This is a well-designed garlic press. It takes very little effort to press a clove/cloves of garlic without peeling. It cleans easily, and, if needed, comes with its own attachment for cleaning the holes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great garlic press","review":"Never been that impressed with garlic presses before, but this one's great! Bought it based on America's Test Kitchen recommendation. Very little waste, can handle large cloves, cleaning tool is handy and stows in the handle so it doesn't get lost in the drawer. I have small hands so get the easiest results by (mostly) peeling the cloves and doing just one or two at a time; my husband has no problem pressing several unpeeled cloves at once. Have been hand-washing it so haven't had any peeling finish issues. Was initially concerned a \\"jumbo\\" press would be clunky to store, but this isn't that large overall and I really appreciate the larger hopper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product but it unscrews","review":"I am about to buy my second set - for a gift this time.

I enjoyed it and bought the first season set.If you watch sci-fi shows soley because you like certain areas of the sci-fi universe, ie. space battles, aliens, etc. then this is not for you.

The rough lifestyle, domestic drama, and racial clash of his childhood unfold over the course of this book. The autobiography is written in the third person, so as to interpolate black history rather than his life facts. The book is not so much about his life but rather the essence of his lifetime. His story is told through dialogue and the stories of others. He places the reader in his shoes as a witness. This is an incredibly interesting choice of the writer. Religion is also a both negative and positive influence in his family life. He faces much domestic pressure in an unaccommodating country. This is a worthwhile read and is significant to life. His view is intriguing. Life is like a mountain."},{"rating":"2","title":"his first and best novel","review":"I came to Baldwin through his essays, which are vivid, incisive, and full of raw emotion. By contrast, most of his novels are mediocre. Nonetheless, this novel is very good, a glimpse at a life that is utterly alien and beautifully, indeed brilliantely, captured.It is the story of a struggling boy - very bright, caught in a culture and society that excludes him as a black. If you read this, you will understand how he feels and what he struggles for. That is what a good novel does, and this is very good.Recommended with warmth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revisery Warning","review":"Like others have mentioned, this book was over-written and the prose was too lyrical. Some of the descriptive passages and religious mumbo-jumbo were very tiring to get through, and it stalled the little action the novel did have. And in the end, there was a lot Baldwin set up in terms of plot that was left wide open. Especially The Letter (when you read this you'll know what I mean). Why did Baldwin dedicate so much character dialogue to the letter, leading readers to believe the revelation of it would resolve the story, then end things before it was revealed??? WAS it even revealed?This could've easily been a novella, and a good one, if he had revised the manuscript better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two thumbs up?","review":"I find it humorous to read all of these reviews and decided to add my tid bit of info. I find Baldwins work in Go Tell It on the Mountain totally directed toward the Christian. Unless you have a superior understanding of his literature, this book is frankly boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great start but does not sustain","review":"Begins as a bildungsroman, and a fine one with beautiful writing. I become less interested when the point of view shifts. An interesting bridge between the Modernist tradition and the African-American style of story-telling (montage of multi-generational, tangentally-related voices and plots) that Morrison embodies. The spiritual crisis that is so important to Baldwin does not capture me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Religious aspect of Go Tell it On the Mountain","review":"When this book was published I was early in my career as a Pentecostal preacher. Baldwin's desctiption of the religious fervor, the \\"tarrying\\" meetings was sensitive and clear. It took such a person to reveal so much about himself and the selt-deprecation (or self-flagellation). This was a significant part of the lives of those--both black and white--who were taught to despise self to gain the greater approval and glory of God.This book, especially, was a major turning point in the attitude of those who did not know or care about the \\"holiness people,\\" the pentecostal, the poor black, or even the acceptance of one whose gender choice was of the same sex.I would recommend that everyone find a copy before they become out-of-date printings. We live in a much more accepting and tolerant society today but we can continue to improve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enjoyable","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book since I knew it had religious overtones. However, the book tried to tie religious feelings with characters that only on the surface appear to be faithful. At least Baldwin created an interesting struggle with faith and temptation. But the whole idea that repetitive sinners contain the Spirit is hypocrisy! These people just go through the motions of a faithful life and therefore, the character descriptions are incorrect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Confusing!","review":"Go Tell it on the Mountain was a powerful book, but it was extremely confusing with the different characters and setting. Its switching from past and future tense did not flow and the characters all got twisted together. There is no way to read the book only one time through and understand it all. New characters popped out of no where and left me completely confused about who was who. Maybe this book just was not right for me, but I really would not recommend this to anyone who has a cheerful personality. The reader has to enjoy thinking about and pondering ideas in a book and be okay with reading depressing books.

While the themes and some of the events were good (i.e. racism, abuse, religion), the way it was written made the book unenjoyable for me. I found that the way the book was written made it this way for for others as well. I dont think this is just a coincidence. If the book was written differently I probably would have found it enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"To this day, the worst book I've ever read.","review":"I first read Go Tell It On The Mountain when I was in junior high and found myself bored, annoyed, and on the verge on giving it back to the library without finishing it (which I never do). I slogged through endless pages of \\"lordy lordy help me stand\\" \\"hallelujah\\" and othersuch near-maniacal religious zealot ramblings that had nothing to do with anything.The story is about a boy who is growing up, and his family has problems. It's not a huge book, but without all the frenzied Jesus-babbling, it could have been edited into a decent short story. It literally got to the point where I could skim through entire pages of nonsense to find any actual action, which was usually just \\"he shut the door and sat down in a chair\\" and then back to the crazy.I read it again in near the end of high school and hated it even more. Won't be picking this up ever again and wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I JUST DIDN'T LIKE IT!!","review":"I was told by my English 1(S) teacher to read the book and I didn't even finish it. I couldn't get into it and what I read of it was stereotypical. Maybe there was something that made the book good at the end. All of my friends will agree that the books wasn't very good!! Who really cares about a preacher that sleeps around? Not me. All of the characters are introduced at the worst times and one can't even remember who the characters are...

I didnt like anything that was in the book, and as a result, I found it incredibly hard to read. I cant believe that people can enjoy this book. I hope that I never have to read a book like this again becuase it was too long, and extremely boring. It put me too sleep half the time I tried reading it, and I would recommend to anyone that has not read this book never to read it, because it really is the worst book I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unintelligent and overated.","review":"Baldwin's prose is average; and, at the time, the issues dealt with here weren't at all banal, but Baldwin tackles them far to brashly. He offers a panoply of problems, but rarely offers a solution that's tantamount to his psuedo-genius. The protagonist simply goes into fits of self-loathing and predictable \\"White man oppresive, Black oppressed, so let's sink down to their level.\\" But I just can't get over the prose. It's not terrible, just unecessarily overated. I guess it was pretty iconoclastic for it's time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this. The deeper I got the more repugnant was the religiosity to me. I sent it back to the library and got another book. I was turned off by the fundamtalist's belief system. Which is the base for this and something that I find completely wrong headed and evil. Misses the whole point of Jesus' ministry."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book was excellently written, but hard to follow.","review":"I am a 10th grader and was required to read this story for English. Although Mr. Baldwin used vivid imigery, it was extremely hard to follow, and seemed to skip around in time a lot. Also, this book was centered to much on Religion, nad not the characters. For anybody who is looking for a easy read this book is not a very good choice. To understand this book, it would be helpful to take your time while reading it and take notes on what you have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling book on the struggle of a boy's plight for id.","review":"This book simply shows the hardships of African American boys trying to become men. Studying up on Baldwin has also given me a new way of looking at the book as a autobiograpyhy written simply in 3rd person. This is a book I would recommend to people of all races and creeds. Baldwin is simply manificent and should be given much credit for this wonderful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHISTLEBRITCHES","review":"Russell (Joel Weiss)has a junk food diet that leads to his production of gas which he enjoys to the dismay of everyone around him.

It adds a level of diversity to my game portfolio :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Value","review":"While this title is several years old, it is still a very fun PS2 title. My wife and I rented this for the family and had a blast. While there are many games that require you to hammer buttons, there are also games like archery, the 1500k, pole vauly, gymnastics, horse jumping, shot put (and many more)that require a lot of skill. We found most of the games addictive. Also, with practice you could get better. Archery was awesome! If you are looking for a cheap game that many in your family would like, I recommend this title. We bought it after renting.Some have given this game negative reviews because some events (like swimming and the 400 meter) require you to tap for over a minute. No one can possibly do this and enjoy it. But, and I say BUT, there are too many good events on this title that DO NOT require you to tap for you to pass on it. Ignore the \\"tappers\\", you will have a blast with the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hand and fingers tire quickly","review":"I just opened this game and really couldn't play more than half an hour without my fingers tiring of the controls. Almost all of the events use the same rapid succession of the X and O buttons to gain speed. I found it difficult to continually press these buttons and I couldn't compete with the computer athletes in most events. I tried pressing the buttons with my index and second finger instead of just my thumb, but it wasn't much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"It has more to it if you look for it!!","review":"I really liked Athens 2004 especially the events that do not require button bashing. Check out Gymnastics and High Jump as two examples.We had great fun as a multi player and spoofing it out on the dance mat."},{"rating":"1","title":"great idea...........bad game","review":"989 sports has all of these great and awseome ideas! They just cant figure out how to put it together.Athens 2004 is a game based on the Olympics (fully liscenced) which includes full rosters for most nations. NOTE: this game does not have basketball, baseball, soccer, etc. This game is for the tracks, shooting, swimming, yeah yeah yeah. The gameplay uses mostly simple combos in order to complete tasks. EX: for tracks, you push o and x over and over until you get so sick you will have lepricies. You could put the biggest battery over the buttons and still lose to the computer.Overall, if you enjoy the Olympics either(A) Actually play them(B) Go and watch them, or (C)Go back to gym class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste your Money","review":"This game is TERRIBLE!!! What a waste of $$$. Rent this game before you buy and save yourself the $$$$. You Won't buy it! Don't make the same mistake that I made.I took a chance with this game because it is the \\"Official Video Game of the Olympics\\"....it is obvious that no one played it before they endorsed it.

Perhaps donate it to the local retirement village?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Treasure Trove","review":"Except for a couple of champagne-like ringers, this book is nothing less than a compendium of the American popular song from the 20s to the 70s. Pitched to the intermediate pianist, the song selection is top-notch and the arrangements are very good. If you're anything like me, this will be the book you will play from and these will become the defining versions. You can find the book for less than $10 on Amazon, making it quite a steal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shows potential to be an enjoyable series","review":"I have read all of Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories as well as a number of other short stories by the same (author). I have also read a number of other Holmes stories by various authors, I would recommend John T. Lescroart if you can get your hands on any of his out of print books.The Monster of St. Marylebone was an enjoyable read, perhaps some minor disappointments. At one point in the book a word is uttered for which Holmes is unaware of it's meaning. It's extremely unlikely Doyle's Holmes would have been unaware of the meaning.However all in all I would recommend this book to any fan of Sherlock Holmes. The plot moves along at a good clip and I am looking forward to other books on Holmes by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointed reader","review":"I won't repeat what other reviewers have written, but I was very disappointed in this book. Since it was marketed to Sherlock Holmes readers, I expected some resemblance between the plot / characters and the original Doyle works. Instead, I got overblown horror, a romance for Holmes, artificial dialogue, and basically a run of the mill horror story into which two unrecognizable characters named Holmes and Watson have been inserted. It might have been an OK horror book on its own, but it's misleading to market this book as any kind of continuation of or homage to the Sherlock Holmes series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst thing since Samba for Sherlock","review":"Wayne Worcester has completely missed the Sherlockian boat I'm afraid. Yes the book features two characters familiarly named Holmes and Watson, but neither of these fellows behave anything like Conan Doyle's timeless creations. We are treated to rather bizarre political and sexual views that paint our heroes in poor light. This tasteless excuse for Sherlockiana is quite likely the worst thing I've read since the abysmally bad Samba for Sherlock. Do yourself a favour if you are a Holmes fan...give this one a miss!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a true Holmes book","review":"If it were any other detective, especially a hard-boiled one, it would work. Since it's Holmes we're having tortured in the first half of the book, it doesn't really work. The language is too modern and while I like Abigail's character, she's too modern also. In short, read Worcester's book first before you buy this. ......................."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"If you seek characters and a story with fidelity to the Doyle canon, look elsewhere. Holmes here is dim and vulgar, missing many obvious clues up to the end. His conversations with Watson feature a late twentieth century emotional intimacy wholly foreign to the Victorian era.The plot is lurid and overly extended by improbable characters and happenings, including Holmes' remarkably consistent incompetence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not scary","review":"Nothing new or horrific here. I don't understand why the dead communicated with the family in such a violent, disturbing manner; even when they were just trying to help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Message is","review":"The message from this movie should be \\"Do not waste your money.\\" One of the most boring, least frightening, and worst attempt at original that I have seen. I watch a lot of horror movies and this does not qualify in the least. When I saw the trailer, I thought it had a chance, but when I wasted my money, I realized it will only be brought out of the DVD cabinet to show people what not to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Thriller-Minor Problems","review":"Ok, so here's my opinion. I've seen many thrillers in my lifetime, and his one seems to hold it's own surprisingly. Of course, I don't place it in the same league as Secret Window or Signs, but it definately had something original about it. The story, even while maybe being like like a puzzle with pieces from several other scary films, comes together to surprise when you don't expect it. I thought the way the elements of the ghosts, he physco dude, the house, and the crows all came together was at the very least chilling and a lot of fun to watch in the theater.Overall 4 out of 5"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad but...","review":"Even if you didn't know this was a Pang Brothers effort, you'd know it a mile off, as I did having missed the opening credits at the cinema.The Brothers Pang borrow liberally from their past work, notably The Eye - an outstanding film if ever I saw one - and the shame of it is that what was used to such intense effect previously is squandered on this film. The motifs have now become routine and formulaic. For a first effort it's not bad but the wet-blanket happy-ever-after ending lets it all down. I'd much rather no-one-here-gets-out-alive and have the birds peck the family's eyes out, starting with the wretched little rugrat that takes up way too much screen time.The cast generally give it their best shot but William B. Davis is wasted in a completely redundant role.If you want to see something shocking, suspenseful to the point of nerve-wracking, watch The Eye on a double-bill with The Birds and you have yourself a truly sleepless night.There's nothing new here at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"What if...","review":"you had enough money to hire Dylan McDerrmott, but then, not enough to pay for the scriptwriters or special effects? You might come up with a third rate film like, say, The Messengers. What was it about, you ask? Well, crows. Spooky crows. Spooky crows that attack people, like, say, in a movie made some time back by a guy who did pay for decent scripts. And, ghosts. Creepy ghosts. Creepy ghosts with long dark hair that skitter along the ceilings, like, say, in a movie a few years back that had a really good script, based on another movie from Japan with a really good script. And a farm hand who turns out to be a homocidal maniac instead of the cheerful, helpful guy he seems to be, like...oh, never mind.

Every haunted house cliché is dragged out along with a bit of The Birds and The Shining thrown in just for good measure. There are some genuinely creepy moments along the way but the formula is so tired and predictable that these moments are not enough to save the movie. Kirsten Stewart does a reasonable job of carrying the story along but the entire cast clearly lack conviction, and this lack of belief diminishes the film even more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time like I did","review":"This is a very disappointing movie. The character development is poor, making me or anyone that watches this movie not care about what happens to them.Coming from Sam Raimi, this movie is pathetic. He gave us such great movies as the Evil Dead series, which stand out as some of the best horror films of all time. Yet, in recent years he has produced much schlock like this and Spiderman 3.This movie is just like all the other horror movies that revolve around a teenage girl and a decrepit farm house: lame and predictable. This will not keep you guessing as it throws everything together in the last twenty minutes; it does all the thinking for you!The scariest part of this movie is the age difference between Dylan McDermott and his wife! Other than that, it might as well put you to sleep.Verdict: Don't even waste your energy staring at the screen like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"can't play on my blu ray player","review":"of all the blu ray disc i bought from amazon, the messengers is the only disc that cannot be play on my samsung bp-1000.

And if the males in the cast could manage to deliver lines without hemming, hawing, adding grunts and interjections, and generally dawdling along in a fruitless attempt to make their stilted dialogue sound believable, the film could've shaved off fifteen minutes of dead (would-be dramatic) air.

Since then there have been oodles of movies following the format. Some have been good, some have not. The Messengers falls on the good side, in my opinion. It's not a great thriller, but it has its moments.I agree with another reviewer that said they were tired of the Grudge-esque black and white stop motion ghosts. There are plenty of them in this movie, but the effect is slightly better than most. One particularly good scene is when Ben sees one of the ghosts in his spoon.There were plenty of jump out and scare ya moments with a decent hit/miss ratio. A few scenes were drawn out too long, and the eventual scare doesn't amount to much.The acting is fine...it should be with Dylan McDermott, John Corbett, and the up and coming star Kristen Stewart. Stewart stands out, but the movie is centered around her.I enjoyed the movie. It's a pretty enjoyable 90 minutes with some good scares."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"The reason for this low marking is that the movie will not work in the Blu Ray Player.

But I strongly advise against it for anyone with any computer equipment you actually care about keeping virus or malware-free.It's positively unconscionable to think there's anything even remotely OK about connecting to the sign-up website Steam just to run this game, after buying the game in a store.

For comparison, imagine if you bought a used car that would not start because it was used. There are no labels to that effect on the box or by sellers, and you're just stuck. And you must have an internet connection to play (also not on the box). What you buy is basically download software and the permission to load their game on your computer. This is how valve does business. If you don't like it, you're stuck, because Valve customer service is abysmal.Their games are good, I'll give them that.

One of them I have been playing. It is good and feels just as if you were there fighting. You could smell the blood.However, I have not been able to play one of the other games, although I bought it about 4 weeks ago. I have been trying to contact their tech support, to no avail. They do not answer my e-mails, and there is no phone number to call.It is just too bad that their tech support is as bad as good is the game.Bottom line: Make sure the game will work PERFECTLY in your computer. Because if there is ANY SINGLE glitch that stops you from playing, you can kiss your money goodbye. I feel cheated with the tech support for this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steam Really Messed this one up","review":"Steam used to be an optional install for your computer now that you are forced to install it before you can install this game. I have had a pretty little orange box sitting on my shelf for a week. If you use AOL as an ISP, I would recommend not purchasing this game until they come out with a fix for this, because you can not download the steam update while using AOL therefore the whole game is useless and unable to be installed until this is fixed. The orange box has become a pretty expensive BOOKEND for me. THANKS STEAM!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crashed My System","review":"When launching any of the games purchased, I couldn't get passed the intro as my system kept crashing. My PC is only a year old and exceeds the minimum requirements, I have an NVIDIA 7300 LE, new X-FI Xtreme Audio sound card, and 2.66 GHz Pentium 4.My PC kept locking up so many times that when I powered off, it corrupted my master boot file which took me a day figure out how to fix. Once back into Windows, I IMMEDIATELY uninstalled everything.What really shocks me is a game maker that suggests you completely remove all anti-virus software completely in order to solve lock-up problems. I use Norton AV 2008, and if Steam can't get their game to work properly with such a popular AV software package, they have no business trying to sell this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a nightmare","review":"Got it out of the box when I got home, excited about playing Portal. Plugged it in, I get nothing but an account prompt. Okay, that's fine, I had a Steam account years ago. Type in my username and password. Okay, doesn't work, that's weird. Okay, so I do the password retrieval. Hours go by. Nothing in my e-mail. I try to create a new account. I'm sorry, your e-mail is already being used! Your account name is already taken!Frustrating, no fun to be had here, waste of time. No support number to call, no way to get to a human being.

Maybe it's just me but when I lay $50 hard earned dollars down for a game, I want to take it home and play it (after all I own it right? - wrong). Valve's Steam software dictates when I can play. Well, when I finally got Ep 2 up and running (the next day), it was OK - nothing special and certainly not worth $50 (maybe $20) but at least they gave me a bunch of other games I could care less about.

It uses an activation application called \\"Steam\\" to install and make sure that only the original purchaser can use it.

End of story.","review":"What more can be said? You have here a collection that includes three of the best games ever made, plus two expansions, for less than the usual price of a single title.If nothing else, Team Fortress 2 by itself makes it worth it. TF2 really is the funnest multiplayer experience out there, and it keeps on getting better and better. Major pieces of new content are being added to the game THREE YEARS AFTER RELEASE. FOR FREE. It's also a really easy game to get into - easy to learn, hard to master.Tips: Hunt around for a well-run server and become a regular for the best experience. Avoid servers with instant respawn times. You'll want to find a server with friendly people that use voice chat alot. Eventually, you'll want to find a reliable psychologist to help you cope with your newfound obsession with hats. Trust me on that one.Finally, if you have the option, get this for PC or Mac rather than a console. It's very light on system requirements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this used!!!!!!!","review":"There is NO REASON this game should be sold here used.

The reason = steam -- you probably know by now by looking at the reviews. The game itself is perfect, the games you get for the price is an absolute steal.Most people would consider steam a flaw but it's a necessary evil more like. The only flaw is that it is not offline capable straight out of the box, so you'll have to spend a good amount of time updating. But other than that, steam is a magnificent piece of game management. It updates everything for you via bittorrent and allows you access to all your games in one place -- pretty neat if you ask me. And it's free.Barring unforseen circumstances like loss of internet connections or pirated games, I don't see much reason for anyone to complain. Don't like it? Pay more and buy the games seperately, otherwise get this because the best game ever made along with a bunch of other games for essentially nothing sounds great to me. Wouldn't you agree?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meet Satan. His name is Steam","review":"The Orange Box seems like a tremendous value. The atmosphere and play mechanics of Half Life, the frustrating yet still amusing Portal, and the bash and go Team Fortress 2.But you get another bit of software for free. It's called Steam, and it connects you to the Valve servers. It also needs updating right out of the box, so be prepared for thrills as you sit and wait... and wait...It's default settings have it run on start up, so it sits in your system tray like a barnacle. You have to change settings to get rid of it.Thanks for the great games, Valve. Too bad I have to have steam running to play them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might be fun if no Steam","review":"While I know some get tired of people complaining about a game they have not purchased; I think it fair to rate this game poorly as I cannot buy it since it is Steam/Valve. I bought HL2 thru the Steam Download when it came out and I cannot play it as I cannot find my login and password. I was supposed to get Episode 1 for free, but they took so long that I moved on to a new computer and thus lost my links. Valve's support is not good, their servers are slow when they actually work and when you want to play you have to wait hours for the games to 'update'. So I cannot buy nor recommend this software.I wanted to buy it, but when I started reading the reviews to check for DRMs, I saw Steam/Valve has not changed for the better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bundles... good and pad","review":"I mostly purchased this bundle for TF2 and Portal.

My computer has a quad core processor with a 8800 GTS card but Episode 1 crashes so frequently that I have just given up playing the game.I have been gaming for quite a while and this is one of the worst game I have come across (frequent crashing + steam). What a waste of money.About steam: It's a malware (you can also call it a spamware) program without which your games just wont run.

But the password that I knew was correct didn't work. So after spending on Half Life games, can't play. Does Steam have customer service? NO! Offer any help? NO!

They have redone the weapons, made them better. The game plays very well. Overall a nice little episode, but WAY too short. For the price of the Orange Box I got games I already own and what was left, after EP 2, was not worth it. Portal was OK. It made me laugh, but was not much value added. Team Fortress, yawn. The reviewers that said this was a great value for the money either buy their games on an expense account or did not previously own HL2 or EP 1. Then after Christmas they come out with \\"own everything source\\" for not a whole lot more than the Orange Box. I'm jaded.

Unfortunately software sellers are not required to post on the outside of their box that the product is locked by a DRM system. If they did I would never buy it. There is one possible workaround if you want to sell your game or purchase a used game. When you first install the game create a unique user ID in the Steam DRM control system.

In a special-ed parenting class, she is paired with fat, misfit and closeted Clarke (Jeremy Dozier). Danielle wants to find the father she's never met and Clarke wants to run away from the military school his dad is determined he attend to make him a man. The two hit the road for California with a bag of flour -- their classroom \\"kid\\" -- that sports a changing, painted cartoon face. With derivative box art that reminds of LOLITA, this film has nothing creative or original to offer and plays itself out as a witless vanity production.

In Dirty Girl, first-time writer/director Abe Sylvia makes things even harder for himself by setting the film in the nostalgic 1980s and promising a subversive edginess in his titular protagonist, a promiscuous high schooler named Danielle who embarks on a cross-country road trip with an unlikely partner in crime: a closeted bisexual classmate named Clarke. Unfortunately, Sylvia fails to bring it all together and make it work; I found Dirty Girl tame and uneven, never quite bringing the Dirty and then trying to tie it all up in a sentimental bow that's wholly unearned. Despite an experienced cast that includes William H. Macy and Mary Steenburgen, Dirty Girl isn't worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't give this clarinet a one star","review":"I bought this clarinet at the end of May 2006,high school band camp started at the end of July.

Ever since that history class, this book has been a touchstone for me. I've passed it along to friends and to both of my parents. It insists that you rethink your ideas about what's \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" for feminism, and focuses your attention on the connection between the political, the material, and femininity.

The only decent sexy scene is a hot tub one with several topless girls that runs maybe 2 minutes. Further, the cover advertises \\"4 UNRATED deleted scenes\\" as though those are sexy scenes, but they're NOT at all.

Needless to say, I watched it once and then threw it out. This movie had lame jokes and even worse acting. While I appreciate stupid humor movies, this one was a disaster. Don't waste your time watching this movie, you'll regret it later."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money,","review":"The description of the movie on this site and on the dvd box is inaccurate. The dork billy wagstaff doesn't have a crazy night in the hot tub with babes and booze. The hottest chick in the movie doesnt show anything unlike american pie. The movie is the stupidest one I have ever seen I own some dumb movies but this one I couldn't even keep in my collection I threw it away, embarrased if anyone would have wanted to watch it. If you want a great snowboard movie get \\"Out Cold\\" great movie and actually has a realistic plot and is funny. I actually feel three times dumber for watching this movie. The actors or the writers or both should never be around another movie set, screen, or even a piece of paper.

Especially for a high school student who lacks a little self confidence or remains unsure about their future plans. The Rhythm Of Life has a way of focusing the reader's mind on the things that really matter in life. In the end it will motivate anyone to strive for personal greatness. I found the book to be very insightful and easy to relate to. This is one that is worth reading, discussing and passing on to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Change your life","review":"This book changed the way I looked at life. It is very hard to find anything that can impact you as much. Very ahead of his time, yet renewing long lost wisdom, Matthew encourages the reader with very real challenges to improve their life in every aspect. A must for someone searching for renewal, or for a person just wanting a little more out of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Matthew Kelly as a writer, speaker and a man is absolutely amazing. This book, along with his others, has touched me in so many ways. In his writing you will find that you are able to relate to all that he has to say and all that he encourages you to be. He has touched my soul and my life. I look forward to seeing him speak and to reading the next book that he writes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally debunked.","review":"This book is, in hindsight, horribly wrong. It is now known that there are no WMD's in Iraq. Saddam did not pose a threat to America and the world at-large. It's just sad that the trumpeters of the Iraqi war were playing to the wrong song. It's packed with faulty and \\"highly dubious\\" intelligence. The CIA has since admitted as much but I do not expect as much from a hack writting a book to profit from a \\"massive intelligence failure\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The greatest threat?","review":"Weapons of mass destruction are a matter of great concern, yes. The fact that seems to escape the esteemed Mr Butler ... is that the U.S. possesses more of them than any other nation on earth and seems willing to use at the proverbial drop of a hat. ...Richard Butler (who I am ashamed to say comes from my own country) was almost fired by the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan for his disgusting behaviour in Iraq on more than one occasion. He was repeatedly called before his superiors for his lack of restraint and professionalism. Evidence is mounting to support claims that Butler was a U.S./Israeli spy.His total lack of respect for the culture and desire to be in control of UNSCOM teams made him blind to the need to relax/remove sanctions on Iraq. He thus prolonged the misery of a population and should be held partly accountable (along with Clinton, Bush, inter alia) for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqis. This book is drivel. Propaganda of the worst kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal music","review":"I must admit that I was a bit skeptical of a guitar/banjo instrumental album. However, my doubts were put to rest very soon into this album. The music on the album is, indeed, phenomenal! Tom has a unique style and presents his work in a way that only he can. I highly recommend Tom Smith's \\"Musical Pictures\\" and anticipate his next offering. Great album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ordinary families","review":"This book should be read by all who have grown up in a large family.

From the famous to the infamous, here are the sad, surprising, strange, or sordid ends that have befallen well-known names from the past. The breadth is impressive for a small book, and there are a few names that may not be familiar. You'll receive a brief biography for each alphabetized entry and a summary of the events that led up to their death. Minor quibbles are lack of citations or references and a general tone of innuendo. It's not a classical historical reference, but rather a maudlin set of stories that would probably be difficult to track down yourself. And so it is all democratically minded, we will all go that-a-way...one day."},{"rating":"2","title":"very creepy, interesting","review":"I found this book in my dad's old books collection not too long ago, and its a good work to read. It introduced me to such personalities such as Primmie Niven, Carole Lombard and Huey Long (hey, I'm 23 they were way before my time). Forbes gives great detail and he makes death look interesting, not something to be look forward to. I can tell he had fun writing and researching this book and if Malcolm were alive today I'm sure someone would write a sequel to this book. Perhaps the sequel would have Princess Di (another monarchy figure), Kurt Cobain (Jimi and Jim of the 90s), Dr. Atkins (the so-called revolutionary diet hero dies from a fall) and maybe Malcolm himself. I always read at least one or two biographies in the book before I go to bed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the correct size for the wb101 shaper cutters.","review":"I bought this because Freud recommended it for doing raised panel door arches/cathedral tops with their wb101 shaper cutters. Well, it's about a 1/16 of an inch to big. After calling them they explained that it was designed that way to work with templates. Well, that's the lamest excuse I have ever heard. By it being over sized it changes your radius of your templates. They recommended that I take it to a machine shop and have it milled down. I was thinking about doing this, but I have come to the realization that the wb101 kit just really stinks overall at doing raised panel doors... For the first time ever I am extremely disappointed with Freud!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Used DVD in Very Good Shape","review":"If you love old Disney cartoons, then DVDs in this series are excellent choices. The animation is great--much better than today's sterile look. Since the cartoons are so old (probably from the late 1930s and into the 1940s, the disks produce a grainy picture. But it's not too grainy to detract from the experience, especially if you're watching the cartoons with a little grandchild. I did buy the Classic Cartoon Favorites, Vol. 1 - Starring Mickey, and it was defective. I had to return, but I received a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Treasures For Animation Buffs These For Others","review":"These cartoons are great! I read all these reviews complaining that these cartoons are available on the \\"Treasures\\", but the truth is these are good DVDs that serve a different function. I own all the \\"Treasures\\" DVDs because I am a animation fan and I believe all \\"hard core\\" fans know they need to get the \\"Treasures\\", but I also own all of the \\"Classic Cartoon Favorites\\" DVDs.

As someone who is currently living in the D.C area, I was fascinated to travel back in time while reading this book and picture how D.C. has become what it is today.

Brinkley says in the preface that the book \\"is less a work of history than of personal reminiscence and reflection\\"; I'd go so far as to call it gossip. It's pretty much nothing but a collection of anecdotes, but without an index(!) you can't even go through it looking for anecdotes about any one specific person.

Guess again. Not only did they pull it off,but they have made another marvelous record.The band rocks out such standards as Rudolph the Red-Nosed Raindeer,Run Run Rudolph, and Santa Claus is Coming to Town,with the Charlie Daniels Band(ala early Elvis).Christmas Time Again is a smokey r&b influenced song with an outstanding duet featuring Johnny Van Zant and Dale Rossington. Even though this is a signature Skynyrd record,they manage to incorporate a beautiful orchestrated Greensleeves(traditional) keyboards by Billy Powell and Bill Cuomo,and also Classical Christmas-instrumental. The album concludes with another upbeat guest Thirty Specialand back to the group's honky tonk \\"Skynyrd Family.\\" Whether you are giving or receiving,make sure this one ends up under your Christmas tree.You'll be playing this one for many years to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY","review":"This is the best Christmas CD yet. The old tunes were done so fine and the new tunes are honest. I could tell that they did this one for themselves. The emotions run high in Christmas Time Again and Mama's Song.

It is not as good as Land of The Living though. It doesn't take advantage of Kristine's voice and range and less soulful this time around. The lyrics and the production/mix is not as unique as Land of the Living. When I first heard Land... album, my first thought was wow! The voice, the lyrics, and how all of the tracks really flow from one to another beautifully. Very smart producers/mixers/arrangers. As someone mentioned Kristine and her record comp. should have used the same producers again and take more chances. I do like Stronger and stand in love as singles with the dance mixes though. worth getting the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Stronger\\" is Strongest","review":"Kristine W's latest is the \\"Strongest\\" dance/pop CD released in quite some time. With her thumping disco beats and rich soulful voice -- without those annoying Christina Aguilera-Mariah Carey vocal acrobatics -- she clearly takes a stylistic cue from The Diva herself, Donna Summer. But Miss W. brings things well into the new century with high energy songs that make us move and beautiful ballads filled with raw emotion (despite some cliche-ish lyrics). Not to mention her kickass sax skills. Still, it is Miss W's ability to belt out a song that puts her head and shoulders above her disco dolly peers. I hope Kristine W. crosses over to mainstream radio someday soon so that younger audiences can get an idea of what soulful singing truly sounds like."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars is not enough!!","review":"There are women who sing \\"anthems\\".

Although, they didn't really need to tweak much as even R&C; 1 was a masterpiece.Yet again this game has another version of the Rhyno called the R3yno (can be obtained by completing game).Gladiators fights are also back but now you can get multiplayer (can be online) and some levels feature a mode were you actually do a specific mission one at a time for bolts as you fight along side of the galactic rangers.The only series which can compete with this series is the Jak and Daxter series.This is series is 1 of the reasons why PS2 is simply the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Conclusion to RAC Trilogy","review":"Ratchet and Clank have always had a good series, but this isa unbelievable! If you love Jak and Daxter(I think it sucks) than I think that you would have a lot more fun with this. More weapons, more strategy, more enemies, and a lot of stuff to blow up!! And it includes a multiplayer obtion and online gaming, something that Jak 3 doesn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite PS2 game ever!!!!","review":"An action adveture and a shooter rolled into one! It dosen't stop there though, it has great multiplayer and it's even online!! The weapons are extremely creative and they all can be upgraded to 8 diffrent forms each getting even stronger!( The RY3NO can only be upgraded 5 times though.) Only two flaws in the game is the diffuclty in beating the game with out getting all the stuff and the story could be better. Bottom line: Great fun for everyone! Tons of unlockables and secrets. I hope Deadlocked is even better!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but could have been better","review":"This game has some of the humor I love from this series. However, this game seems incomplete to me. The plot isn't as engaging and has no twists that came in the previous games. Also, some of the mini games I really enjoyed in the past aren't here any more. No grind boots, spaceship fights, the fighting arena isn't as cool as the one featured in Going Commando... The vid comics are interesting however. But overall, while this is a fun game, I thought it didn't shine as much as the others. Perhaps Insomniac games put too much time and effort into developing the multiplayer aspect of it. Even a number of the minigames seem to be similar to the multiplayer game levels...I think a R&C; with cooperative multiplayer would be much more fun.. being able to cruise through normal levels with a partner to back you up would be fantastic.They did keep the challenge mode, so kudos for that and the ability to level up weapons multiple times keeps it interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY IT NO MATTER WHAT!!!","review":"ALL THE RACHET AND CLANK GAMES KIK AZZ AND THIS ONE SHOULD BE NO DIFFERENT!!!

The graphics are pretty good, and the characters and dialogue is amazing. There were actually some pretty funny jokes in the game.Some people will say that there are bad words in this game. The worst word is the a-word, and you have to turn of the music to hear it because its not even in a video - its in the gameplay when a robot says it. Also, Klunk does say 'What a load of bull...' during Qwarks memorial service or whatever, but ratchet stops him from saying it. Anything else is censored.Qwark is made a main character in the game, and it turns out pretty well. I would give this game an 8.5/10 because some of the parts are difficult and it gets a bit boring after you play it like 7 times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great game, but was mislead","review":"Hey folks!Let me start off by saying that Ratchet and Clank 3 is definitely one of my favorite games to ps2 and absolutely the best of the Ratchet and Clank games.But i wasn't informed that the product was encoded **(unsc /region code 1)**, so that i couldn't play it on my ps2The productinformation is somewhat misleading and incomplete.So have that in your mind when you buy the game and if it ain't a problem for you, then get moving! ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"quarktastic","review":"The Ratchet and Clank series has been a good series in my oppinion this is the latest game i have bought and beat and its pretty good.

Happy Days is the worst play I have ever read. It is a mundane, insipid melodrama of no merit whatsoever. The idea is weak to start with; Winnie is a middle-aged woman buried up to her waist in dirt. SWith only a few possessions and Willie, a mumbling gargoyle of sorts, to keep her company, she remains entrapped in her absurdist situation, delivering a dull monologue that swings between pathetic whining and annoying screeching. I can't even imagine that watching this play would be an any more pleasant experience. No one moves at all, and all that keeps this play \\"going\\" is Winnie's humdrum soliloquoy. It's hard to imagine that the talent behind Waiting for Godot and Krapp's Last Tape could have been responsible for this tripe.

Though Kollek's character, Jack, may be detractingly virtuous, the viewer is too compelled by the reality of the landscape to notice. Kollek corralled actual Midtown Manhattan prostitutes for these interviews and splatters them on the screen warts and all without judgement.

Naturally, the prices are 1961 prices but everything else in the book holds true.From the introduction:This is the first part of a new price catalog for minor coins and tokens of the British Isles struck in copper and other base metals.Part one of this catalog deals solely with the official coinage of England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, and certain British islands.Part two will cover the token coinage of British Isles but unlike part one it will be a select list only - particularly so far as the seventh century series is concerned.This catalog is necessary for any collector or numismatists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"As the other reviewers state, this is hardly the \\"best\\" time travel stories.

I got the feeling she lost interest in the story and slapped out a conclusion so she could move on to something else. Any interest the reader had in the characters after reading Banewreaker is lost as they stumble toward what she describes as an inevitable conclusion. The only interesting characters all die when the entire theme of the first book pointed toward the fact that they reach some kind of peace. Plot lines that seemed original and intriguing, such as the attraction between Tanaros and Cerelinde, peter out. The promise of the first book has been squandered. I had to finish it to see what happened, but was sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skillfully written and ultimately pointless","review":"SPOILER WARNING. I was very disappointed by this book. Not because of how it does or doesn't relate to Tolkien (I don't care), but on its own merits. It's skillfully written, but the emotion foremost in my heart at the end was: so what? There is almost no evolution of the main characters, which is a capital sin of storytelling, and what evolution does happen matters little, as Carey kills almost everyone off at the end.

Bottom line, don't waste your money or your time. You'll find it hard to care about anyone in this story, and those chararcters who do manage to engage your vague interest, all die.

Avoid this series like the plague!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Months Later You'll Still Remember","review":"I, like others here, found Jacqueline Carey's Kushiel series a wonderful breath of fresh air in a rather stale fantasy market. So, I, like others here, was excited beyond belief to find The Sundering books. I read both one after another about six months ago. I finished not knowing really what I thought. These books are so different, formal and epic, where Kushiel's are personal and enganging. I was sad and drained; I let a friend borrow them with a warning that they were \\"dark\\". She didn't read them and I found myself disappointed because I wanted to talk with someone about the books. As time passed I found myself thinking again about the books, the characters, trying to figure out how it could have gone differently, and wondering what will happen now in the world Ms. Carey has created. Kushiel remains in my mind as a terrific story with amazing characters, settings and it was fun, but The Sundering is what I keep thinking about and want more of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Change is good part 2","review":"Again, I am also a fan of the Kushiel series, however, THIS IS NOT KUSHIEL! This is a whole different world, and it is amazing, with it's own mythology and history.Wow... some of this book was sadly predictable, not sadly as in bad writing, sad because you know that's how it had to be. Other parts were also amazingly surprising, and also sad in the same aspect, it had to be.This book was excellent, and it made me cry and laugh at the appropriate parts. And the ending, though it's horrible and made me Carey, was very well-written, and it does leave it open for a possible sequel, which I wouldn't be adverse to."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Jacqueline Carey Challenge I Took","review":"Um, yeah. Not as exciting as Jacqueline Carey's Kushiel's series. The story felt predictable to me. Yet, I couldn't stop reading; was up until three in the morning finishing the book. I think what kept me reading was HOW the ending would happen and HOW it would be justified. Meanwhile, the talent of a poet brings to life a whole world never seen except in Ms. Carey's imagination.I tried to decide WHY I cared about any of the characters. The good guys; not exactly all that, and the bad have reasons for their own behavior. So if everyone is \\"just so\\"--WHO cares? Then Jacqueline brought in a child. As my mother and I confirmed long ago: Any show (book) is good if there is a child and/or an animal, even the war or cowboy shows that Dad liked to watch.The final reason I finished reading this series? I challenged myself to read everything I could by Jacqueline Carey. I only have the Santa Olivia series to go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very different than Kushiel, but still good.","review":"I feel this series is very well written. I understand what people who give it poor reviews are saying. But think about it... those who follow from faith, do they question it really? Or fully understand what they are doing? No. Faith can be a very blind thing and I feel that is what Carey is portraying. I also feel she is trying to portray the idea that no one is fully good or evil, and that what is thought evil is often from an origin of good. I understand her ideas and concepts in this story and I find the characters very interesting. Perhaps this story line is not for everyone, but personally I am not let down at all. Carey is magical with words and her writing style and though this is very different from her Kushiel series, I feel it is just as good in it's own right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a true DIN size","review":"The trim rings were all much bigger than a typical DIN opening.

It's the type of movie that's been made umpteen times before: there's some major crisis, a rag-tag group sets out to solve the crisis (often in defiance of inept authorities), but with all the odds stacked against them it looks mighty certain that they're going to fail, but just in the nick of time they pull it off. In short, this is a low-brow, predictable movie.

Neither can the star, Lou Diamond Phillips.Phillips not only seems out of place as the Sheriff of Gallup Texas, but completely off key the entire film, in his own little world, and relating little to his supporting cast.At his side, Dina Meyer conveys a somewhat reasonable role of the bat specialist enlisted to help deal with the situation. Unfortunately, she does little the entire film and I really don't understand her role when there were apparently already two bat specialists on the case.I miss the old horror days, that took more to wit than making its monsters believable, and they surely have vanished.

The movie did have my attention for the bloody killing scenes but after about 45 minutes i totally lost interest. i didn't care about any of the characters as they were not interesting and if a bat did attack them, who really cared? and the Bats! what a hoot! they looked so fake. and even some of the effects for the attacked victims were bad..get a load of the dummies! don't bother with this if you really like horror movies or campy movies -- this wasn't even funny enough to be camp.

This movie is about a mad scientist, whose experiments with bats goes horribly wrong--(like in most monster movies you see now days). So the bats get bigger and bigger and bigger...Until they escape and start attacking the town. Bats is somewhat in relation to Alfred Hitchock's The Birds. Only with qiant killer bats, that is.

Tickle-fetish customers line up to tickle the armpits of a slave woman whose arms are tied over her head. Suddenly a public-address announcer pages the woman, who then slips out of the wrist restraints as if they were a pair of gloves, revealing her helplessness (and ticklishness?) was faked. Just as EXIT TO EDEN was taking us somewhere we didn't know existed, it glosses over the subject matter (bondage, sexual cruelty) with a stupid joke.

Rosie may do good things for kids, but this \\"movie\\" was certainly was not one of those things!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTE GARBAGE","review":"Without A doubt one of the worst movies ever made.It is actually hard to put into words how bad this movie is"},{"rating":"1","title":"When this movie comes on......RUN!!!!!","review":"Rosie O Donnell running around in black leather and fishnets is not my idea of entertainment. First she had to ruin every man's Betty Rubble fantasy, and now this. Rosie stick to day-time TV so people who work for a living will never have to see you and your big basketball head."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film is pathetic!","review":"Dan Ackroyd & Rosie o Donnell of all people took part in this shameless film about two undercover cops who travel to some sort of exotic lsland with it's inhabinets devoted to gratifying sadomacstic sexual fantasies. Unbelivably bad comedy that will make the viewer wanna make a head start towards the exit. This type of film will only appeal to people who have a sick and twisted personalty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Titillating Tripe","review":"I first viewed this movie on HBO or something several years ago and was quite intrigued by the plot premise. My opinion is that this COULD have been an interesting and stimulating exploration of human kink...(but NOOOOOOOOO). I thought the movie began to explore and illustrate some of the mental and emotional aspects of a dominant/submissive relationship and found the scene of bondage and light discipline exciting and exhilerating. But then....the meddling hands of Gary Marshall et al, turned Ms. Rice's Exit To Eden into some bizarre hybrid from hell in hopes of increasing its commerical marketability.I guess America is not ready for an honest, thought-provoking look at actual sexual/erotic behaviors. I'm really sorry Exit became Bowderized by the addition of \\"comedy\\" and a subversive co-plot. Maybe I'll read Ms. Rice's book before someone starts burning them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insult to Rice and BDSM","review":"I am personally insulted that Anne Rice's book was butchered into some schlocky/comedy/keystone cop caper movie this way. This film insults those of us who live (and rather enjoy) the BDSM lifestyle. The overly glib explanation of the male leads bondage fascination was extremely insulting, spankings from a busty maid indeed. Believe me, this fascination with pain and servitude goes much deeper than that; it can't be so glibbly and easily glossed over as the film does.I would have given this film negative stars if it were a possibility. Garry Marshall should be flogged for making this film, and who in the name of all things sacred and profane wants to see the Golden Heifer herself in leather?"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY WHY WHY WHY","review":"just by looking at the cover I could tell that this movie would be nothing like the book. I was wondering how they would be able to make it into a non X rated movie and still include the best parts and points. Well they did do one thing, they made it into a non X rated movie but they put ROSIE O'DONNELL in it! they turned it into a comedy! Why? why? why? it was a good book! if your idea of improvement is to turn a perfectly good story into [junk] then just leave it alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dana is truly a princess in my life!","review":"I truly loved the movie, mainly because I have an almost childish crush on Dana Delany. I have a weakness for red hair anyway, and the scenes where she is shown coming out of the swimming pool made me so passionate for her, but depressed because it\`s only a movie. I have almost all of the episodes of China Beach on tape that were recently shown on the History Channel, as well as the movie Live Nude Girls, and have tapes of all the Pasadena series thus far. Fate would be unbelievable for me to get to meet her but would love to have the chance to talk about my lingering visits to Cheshire, Naugatuck, and New London, Connecticut, and perhaps Fishers Island, N.Y. via the Groton Ferry. I\`m sure our paths must have come close to each other at one point or another, but alas, I can only fantasize!! So I must be content withthe tapes, I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"split personality","review":"After turning Pretty Woman from a dark story about prostitution into a romantic comedy, Gary Marshall tried the same tack with Anne Rice's nasty little novel about sexual obsession. Well, he made a movie that is neither erotic nor funny. Worse, it feels split down the middle, and needlessly overplotted in order to merge the two sides.This film comes from the vast middle period of bad Dan Ackroyd films--put it in the same batch as Dragnet. Sometimes dumb and clumsy isn't funny, it's just dumb and clumsy, like a bloated uncle left to watch the kids after Thanksgiving dinner--which begs the question, when did Ackroyd give up on being sharp-edged?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie but I wish it was available new on DVD!","review":"The critics didn't like this movie but I did. The actors all offered very solid performances and the movie was very funny. And the concept was great - especially in our politically correct to the point of being pointless and annoying world. I hope the studio re-releases this one! I'd love to buy it but not for the prices they've listed for the used version."},{"rating":"1","title":"From UK to USA","review":"These people sent me a DVD with the wrong district on it.

After waiting 3 weeks for my shipment i was disapointed with the UK DVD and had to send it back to Great Britian who knows if I will ever hear from them again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why the bad rep?","review":"Well I have to say that I am a huge Rosie fan. I mean she is so hilarious and definitely a fabulous person considering all the charity work she does. Okay, about this movie. Well, unfortunately Rosie considers it to be her worse movie ever, however, I find it hilarious. I mean it full of comedy and trust me the thought of Rosie in an S&M outfit automatically cracks me up without even watching this. It's all about her and Dan Akroyd are detectives and they go to this island where people are allowed to indulge in their fantasies. It gets very creative which only makes it funnier, and it's just non-stop laughter. I would recommend renting it first and then buying it but I have it and trust me, anytime I need a laugh I put this in and it never fails me. I also recommend \\"Another Steakout\\" with her in it as well, it is also tremendously funny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you missed this one . . .","review":"I see that this album is no longer available.

I thought I was going to loose my mind the first time I listened to it, and I nearly had a flashback to his incredible set at Red in Boston. If you want to know what a real set would sound like at a true underground rave then you betta' run to the nearest store and buy this CD. He is a master of his skill and is one of the best DJ's in the world. However, if you are into commercial or bubble gum techno/house/trance, this CD is not for you.

Love, Filippo B."},{"rating":"2","title":"something worth the money","review":"the best ballad, in my opinion, is VIVIMI (Viveme). One of the best tracks off her latest album. Mi Perspectiva, Escucha Atento, Tu Nombre en Mayusculas, and Como Si No Nos Hubieramos Amado are some of her best tracks on the album. In my opinion, on every album Pausini has released, she is original in her lyrics and writing. While her ballads are bittersweet, her sound on this album, while somewhat of a rock sound, still has her beautiful voice for the ballads. My number one favorite is VIVIMI, spanish or italian version, its the best! Definitely worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual, still excellent","review":"This album departs a little from Laura's traditional style. It is nevertheless of prime quality. The sound is a bit raw, which however matches beautifully with the rock sounds she tried to embody in this work. For the old fan, the ballads are still there, compelling as always. Special note to her further growth as a writer, since she wrote or co-wrote all but two songs in the album.P.S: She looks stunning on the CD cover, although a bit too gloomy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work like probioitcs should","review":"I tried swithing to this product as an experiment but it backfired. I have used enough probioics products to know that it should calm my IBS symptoms and I should have less cramping and gas.HOWEVER, this product has almost zero effect on me.

They are about the same size as my fish oil pills. The smell is akin to rabbit food and leaves a nasty after-taste in my throat.

Because the meaning of the Popol Vuh, he tells us, is situationally dependent (i.e., is likely to change depending on the context in which the reader approaches the text), Tedlock had to receive formal training as Mayan \\"daykeeper\\" (shamanistic reader of the Popol Vuh) before he approached the text. The results are amazing -- a depth of commentary and a tapestry of images that will require a dozen readings before I can begin to comprehend it, but intriguing enough that I bought a copy for my wife for Christmas as well. No folklorist should be without this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"Book came exactly when it was supposed to. It's in excellent condition and was everything I expected it to be. Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Vastly inferior to the 1985 edition. Usually a book has more information in the 2nd edition. This has MUCH less. Huge sections of the background information have been removed. Does the author think this makes the book MORE comprehensible?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior to Christenson","review":"The Popul Vuh is a wonderful insight into the Maya mindset by way of cosmological, social, and lingual perspective. The way the language is represented and translated, and what is explained is decent here from Tedlock, but only that, decent. Allen J. Christenson's dual complimenting approach let's the reader decide which way to first absorb this material while engaging their understanding in a far more effective and accurate way. Check out his version."},{"rating":"1","title":"no good for my needs in lighting","review":"I was very disappointed in these bulbs they were not only very dim and barely lit up my tank, but they created so much heat that my tank temperature rose 5 degrees when they were on! I found other company's here on amazon that sell colored compact fluorescent bulbs which give more lighting, and use the same wattage of power and create zero heat!

However, I take travel writing as an exception.Sub-par travel literature is inherently dangerous to read, especially for the novice globetrotter. Whittell's books on Central Asia have been a great way to get yourself hurt far away from home. Please do yourself a favor and DO NOT pick this book up when you see it.The Library Journal mentions something about this area of the world being previously inaccessible to western travelers. They must've gotten this mixed up with East Germany, because I've had several absent-minded professors meander their way through the same locations as Whittell (in the early 90's) with half the trouble and none of the bad advice.

The instructor (JAC) is excellent at cuing and has great form. The workout has wonderful music and incorporates variations on traditional moves, such as leg presses, plies and squats that make the workout fun and mentally challenging. A medicine ball is used for both aerobic and balance work, which is different and interesting. There are also some yoga stretches. I highly recommend this workout because it is both challenging but very enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another side to the story","review":"I have a respect for those who can write an engaging story that so many can relate to. This book is no doubt well written and meaningful. Its true that domestic violence is an on going crisis that needs to stop. In many ways i am sure that Rebecca has helped the community heal from the event by understanding it a bit more. If I were an outsider of this story i myself who think what a strong women this is! However being a daughter of Ann's I cant help but wonder would my mother really want parts of her personal diary published? I feel that this book makes my mother, her family and close friends once again victims. The good intentions that I imagine were the source for Rebecca to write this book were lost along the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't go along with the rest of you....","review":"As an 80's rock collector (melodic, hard, idiotic, and otherwise), I have to say I was disapponted upon receiving this cd. I gave it a few months before my review, but I can't say it's anything special. Any comparison to Kansas or especially House of Shakira is unwarranted. Quite simply, this cd is lacking in memorable riffs or choruses. Much of it sounds esentially the same, and there's not much variance in the vocals. My review leans towards 2 1/2 stars, but I can't do any better. I know most of you won't agree with me, but that's ok. That's why we all have different ears. This just didn't do it for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent informative easy-to-read book.","review":"Being a beginner in the commercial acting business I have found this book so simple to read and understand and useful to anyone starting out in this industry.

It is easier to use, but it simply does not help to remove stains. Moreover, the perfume scent is overpowering and your whole load of laundry will end up smelling like it when one sprayed item is added. The Stain Stick (by the same company) is a far superior product as it actually works to remove stains and it is truly unscented. Don't waste your money on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spray n Wash Doesn't Work Very Well","review":"I keep trying different variety of Spray n Wash, hoping it will work at cleaning spots on our clothes. Sadly, it doesn't seem to do much at all. Maybe on a very light, fresh dirt spot it will help, but on any kind of real spot (juice, ink, marker pen, grass, etc....)it seems to do nothing at all. Every year or so, I try a bottle of it, cause it's on sale, or just for wishfull thinking, but it never does much.I always get out a bottle of bleach, and that takes care of it.

I always prefer a book to a movie and this is no exception. The Robert B. Parker series featuring Jesse Stone is just great. But this movie does a fine job of capturing the essence of the story. There are some major changes, but they do not detract from the enjoyment of this movie. (Unlike \\"Sea Changes\\" which, unfortunately, bears little or no resemblance to the book.)

Parker's Spenser novels, he was portrayed as about 25 years or so younger than Tom Selleck. However, Selleck, who is always best as a cop or cowboy, makes Stone his own. This telefilm, the third in the series, which was quite good in its original airing, is even better without the commercials (what isn't?), and will hold up over time as well as its star."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...] - @tss5078","review":"Based on Jesse Stone Novel #3, Death In Paradise, was probably the best Jesse Stone book to make into a movie. On a cold rainy day, the body of a young, abused, teenage girl is found floating in the lake and Jesse gets obsessed with finding out why. As with most Robert B. Parker novels, the story is very solid, and this one was especially good, because it brings Jessie Stone right to the edge, and I feel like you really get to know him more intimately from this story. Tom Selleck, AKA Magnum P.I., once again is in a familiar role and makes the story that much stronger. I can't say much more without giving stuff away, but the ending is quite unexpected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Selleck is Great","review":"I love Tom Selleck in this role.

There's an organization and humor to this book to rival much of what you'll find concerning layman's philosophy. The book has a few logical hiccups from time to time (for example, Rowlands sees a goal as something that is either achieved or unachieved at a particular point in time; this boolean perspective doesn't allow for a goal that is achieved in degrees).I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Transfer to DVD","review":"I picked up a copy of this DVD for $1 at one of the neighborhood discount stores.

The only reason for purchasing this DVD should be if you are eager to see \\"Alexander...\\" regardless of the picture quality.

Now, even with all three criteria, this book is a stretch of the imagination. I knew nothing of this book or the author before I ordered it, so I'm informing others. I expected an interesting analysis and instead I received boring, useless fiction to include: Jesus' last name (Grail) and Paul's motivation (greed).

As soon as I read it the first time I went looking for some \\"junk\\" land and even bought some. I have yet to pull a junk trailer out there , but I know I can. I even am in the process of hooking up a battery in My truck, like suggested by Phil for power.Thanks for this book , and all the help it has given Me . While not quite a Rockefeller, I at least do not feel like I am circling the drain as bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining read with good information.","review":"Overall, this was a very entertaining read with some useful information.

Phil gives us a firsthand account of how he faced these tough times and not only survived but thrived. From how to put together a place to live from nothing, literally, to creating your own power to the love life of those living at the \\"grassroots\\" level. Hardly a dusty tome of how-to information, Phil tells his story with flair and humor that will have you chuckling to yourself as Phil describes how a city slicker tackles life in the backcountry. Even if you don't choose to take the road less traveled that Phil did, you'll feel a whole lot better about your options in these troubled times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scorpions, dust devils, and dirt bikes Oh My!","review":"While I enjoyed the authors anecdotes about rural desert life and experiences I thought he was a little too cynical about most of the desert rats who dwell up here. While I admire the tenacity he showed in the construction of his homestead his choice of building materials left me wondering what he could have done with slightly more in the way of a budget. His plan drawings are not that detailed but with the materials used you really don't need that much detail. The most enjoyable sections of this book were his conversations with the demented vet. These anecdotes were cynical, wry, funny, and all too true comments on our modern society and I enjoyed them with great gusto."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass","review":"Very poor sound mix, songs seem to be played in slow motion very little energy. Stick with Yessongs the seminal live CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't stand the sound","review":"Yes has always been my favourite band since I was in junior high. Having another live album, especially with many tracks from their latest album, is always a treasure for me. I really love the chosen songs. Unfortunately Close to the Edge was not included. But I'm very happy that none of their weakest album, Open Your Eyes are included.All members are still in their top performance, remembering that they are not young anymore. If you noticed, some songs are a bit slowed down. I think the reason is Steve Howe, which can't play as fast as usual. Getting too old I think.Anyway, overall it's really a good album. One of the best live album this year. I just can't stand the sound quality. It's too 'digital' while I prefer an 'analog' sound. I don't know how exactly to describe this better. It's like comparing vinyls with CDs (when it was first introduced in the market). It's too artificial."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good live album","review":"This is a superb live recording that has been recorded, mixed, and mastered by someone who really knew what he was doing. This is one of the best sounding Yes live albums ever. I wish this production had been done on the KTA albums! The material is uneven, with the new album's songs being much stronger and still some work by the oversized band (four Yesmen plus the now-departed Billy Sherwoord and Igor who was in a moraz of keyboard parts he was still feeling out) to arrange the older stuff. Don't be fooled; Ritual is just Jon humming a few bars before the next song begins. Ditto for Time and a Word. They did not perform the whole songs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"house of yes; live from the house","review":"It is surprising now that I bought and listened to this CD that the reviews by other buyers were so high - 4 to 5 stars. I am a big fan of Jon Anderson, because he is a brilliant singer/composer. This album was the first Yes, I have ever purchased. If one has ever listened to Vangelis & Jon, the combination of Vangelis's music and Jon's singing is quite enchanting to listen to. I found the House of Yes composition to the contrary. The musicians, to my ear, drowned out Jon's voice numerous times. The acoustics where they were playing made Jon's voice, as well as the instruments, lose their fidelity, and tone range. Having the performance live gave the audience plenty of change to whistle and shout their enthusiasism which disturbed the quality of Jon's singing. A bitter disappointment overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware when ordering this","review":"In stock does not mean in stock. Ordered this and brake for other side.

Good pictures and illustrations, just the right balance in the writing between keeping you interested but learning something, and the first place I have run accross that thoroughly explained how the Rosetta Stone was translated and exactly how hieroglyphics work, including some of their meanings. A comprehensive overview of Egypt's history, and it's political, cultural, intellectual and religious life. Gave great insight into how much our own culture and civilization - and Christianity, I think - really owe to the ancient Egyptians. They had the first calendar - the resurrection of a god theory, the first writing, the first surgery and medicine, the first real architecture, including the first use of stone, probably the first indoor plumbing. And mostly they seemed to be a well-off lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book sparked a lifetime of passion about Egyptology","review":"When I look back, this was the book I remember poring over most as an 11 year old in my local library. The illustrations, the explanations, as well as a whole chapter on mummies, this book really has it all. While not pedantic and too scholarly, it is a great book for young readers, and comprehensively covers Ancient Egypt from the point of view of a novice. I remember making assiduous notes to remember tidbits of information (such as the origin of the double crown), and to this day I look back fondly on the many hours spent with this book. It has led to a lifetime of deeper study and passion about Egyptology.Now with children of my own, I was just delighted to find it on sale here and procured a copy as quickly as I could, so that they possibly could be as inspired by this book as I once was. And hey, I can relive some of my nostalgia too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dell-1700 toner cartridge","review":"Dell-1700 cartridges - just opened the box. Both toner cartridges are bad.

Based on that experience we bought four more. Every one of them is defective. We even tried them in a second printer to make sure that it wasn't a printer problem. I'm not sure what the cause is, but once we bought an OEM Dell cartridge the printer works again just fine. We had them on our supply shelf and didn't find out they were defective until after the Amazon return period had expired. So, we're out $100.

They made a movie about this story years ago with Frank Sinatra, Tony Curtis, and Natalie wood. I thought the typecasting in the movie was right on, but true to some of the morons in hollywood who changed the story's ending, the picture didn't have the true impact of the book.

Reflecting upon my experiences in China, I was amazed at how Mr. Harris distorts the truth. Almost everything he says in the book is incomplete or distorted. If anyone wants to know more about China and its people, the best way is to go and visit, and see for himself. The worst he can do is read Mr. Harris diminutive lies. I regret my parents wasted their money to buy this book for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"To See Behind the Chinese Face, We Need to Be Chinese","review":"The fundamental flaw in this book is that it is written by an American. For any Westerner to presume that they can, with authority, describe what makes Chinese tick is ludicrous. The book is all the more damaging because it is written in a style that leads some readers to believe it is based on scientific study by a well-healed professional.I know the author of this book. I have seen him as a client, and was dismayed by his lack of understanding of Chinese people. He is an American who has lived in Hong Kong for over twenty-five years, but has retained his American viewpoint. When his book came out, my Chinese husband and I both read it. There are so many Western-style generalizations about Chinese people in this book that it is an insult to all Chinese.

I remembered how very much I loved it and simply had to read it again. If you love fantasy this is one fantasy that's so captivating and mesmerizing that you'll find it hard, if not impossible, to put down. The author has the unique ability to capture and own your imagination for as long as the book is in your hands, and long after you've put it down as well.

I'm just so glad that I found them in a set and could add them to my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the Punk Princess","review":"The Enchanted Forest series is a childhood favorite of mine. It's the perfect story for that little girl who knows that its the knights who need to be rescued, and that damsels in distress are some of the best actresses. You meet Cimorene, a strong willed princess who would rather learn how to fence than when to scream during a giant's abduction. When she runs away to keep from being married off, she meets a dragon who accepts her as her princess. This leads her off into a world of adventure where she couldn't be happier in her \\"improper princess\\" life."},{"rating":"2","title":"What fun!","review":"I did not realize that these books were for young adults when I ordered them, so imagine my delight when I found that they are quite enjoyable for \\"old\\" adults also!!

I recently read them again as an adult and still loved them! They are, in a way, your typical fantasy books with an alternate world and a quest. However, there is just enough of the unconventional (a princess who would rather make cherries jubilee than be a princess) and the wacky (melting wizards with lemon scented wash water) to keep you smiling through the whole thing. I can't help but love these and I know I will read them many more times over the years. These are just plain fun and you should read them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great fun","review":"I realy enjoyed these books.

At the same time, his wife does not want to give up the jobs and independence she gained in his absence. Their communication is nil, further jeopardized by Sam's jealousy of the mother/son bond formed during the many years he was away. The author takes the reader into the lives of many touched by the war, with every attention to detail and sensitivity.Their frustrations become very real.

New courses, new characters, and slightly better graphics have been added. In the older version I kept looking for the extra critters that are so familiar around the golf course.

This single verse alone would topple Wenham's case -- yet he NEVER ONCE addresses Maccoby's cogent arguments in favor of this reading.In short, this book leaves Pauline scholarship very much where it was: with Paul as the true founder of Christianity.

Her acting not to mention was terrific as well.The film was fast paced, and left little to let the mind wander. The script was well done, and the characters were definitely original.

Who makes these decisions and why? Why do we even care? Like many I will not buy a partial season. They must think we are utter idiots. No, they DO think that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third time's a charm!","review":"Although \\"Over the Edge\\" is a bit talky at times, Jonathan Kellerman's third Alex Delaware novel finally places the author as a major contender in the thriller genre. This tightly written story, about a former child-patient of Dr. Delaware's that supposedly grows up to become a schizophernic serial-killer, reads much like a Q & A session: the reader follows Alex Delaware on numerous \\"interviews\\" as he attempts to gather information to establish his former-patient's mental stablity. At times the novel gets a little too technical in all of it's psychological terminology, but makes up for it with strong character development and an amazing ending. I'm looking forward to Kellerman's next Dr. D novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious? Vous?","review":"Listen, I basically like the plots of these stories and the action. But poor Alex himself is getting so pretentious, he's verging on the insufferable! He has a house in the \\"Hills\\" with a deck and a koi pond, he cooks like a Cordon Bleu grad, drives a classic (restored by himself) Porsche. He can tell you the designer of any woman's dress he spots on Rodeo Drive, he drops the name of every cool jazz icon known to man, he has a live-in (and perfect, of course)lover that makes custom guitars for rock stars (whose workshop is in Venice!)... I mean, C'mon! This poor ... goes through the gamut of cliched pretense like Sherman through a goose! Sam Spade would dump a beer on his head. Lucas Davenport would toss him in his koi pond. Yikes! What an unbelievable fop!"},{"rating":"1","title":"May 25, 2010 is not the original release date","review":"After only a few pages into the story it was obviously a much older book than what Amazon states as a release date. There were no cell phones, computers were vastly limited, and smoking occured everywhere including at the crime scene and in the hospital. This was a flash from the past. I hate paying premium prices for an older edition. Common Amazon... get with the program."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to put down","review":"I only recently became a Kellerman reader, and I have enjoyed this book quite a lot. I am an avid mystery reader and, even though I find Alex Delaware pretty unbelievable, I enjoy him. In this series this one came second only to the Murder Book. My favourite Kellerman so far, however, is Billy Straight (possibily even more unbelievable but, then, I simply devour Harry Potter, despite being a grown-up). Just be sure to start this book when you have a free weekend..."},{"rating":"2","title":"So intensely good","review":"This is the first Kellerman novel I have read. I picked it up having no idea what it was about and could not put it down. It is so intense from the first page to the last. The plot is great, it grabs your attention right away. I highly recommend this book. I think I could probably say this is the best mystery/thriller I've ever read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed.","review":"Very disappointed.

But am I the only one who thinks his plots are just TOO conveniently convoluted? In this book and Monster as well there are plots that go back 40 years that conveniently spring up just in time for Delaware to dig them up. Why does everything have to be soooooooo complicated all the time? Why can't it just be interesting? Part of the fun of having a shrink sleuth character would be in examining WHY people behave the way they do but this often just becomes a plot device. Still, a great series but it could be so much better!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Living Lazily in the Sun","review":"The songs on this CD are a bit reminiscent of Jimmy Buffett or Kenny Chesney, but listen on and Jake makes this CD his own.

I live in Naples Italy and the roads are not forgiving.

Defeats the whole purpose on these tires being on road bike wheels especially 700c x 23mm! Like I said really heavy tires adds more weight on to the wheels hence more kinetic motion to get moving. Feels like there is sand in the tires might also have to do with the stiff in the tires too. It doesn't roll smoothly, they is drag in the tires and you feel like rolly polly.I feel like I can go faster and ride smooth on my mountain bike then this Gatorskin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Indestructible","review":"Original Continental Ultra-Sport tires on my 2011Schwinn Le Tour Classic Road Bikecame up with 5 flat tires within 205 miles.

But it's too fragile. I've got a through puncture after 3 commute rides. It was a piece of glass. While examining I've found a lot of surface punctures. I used 3 different brands among gatorskin. All 3 are better in terms of number of surface defects. May be it's the tradeoff for grippyness -- the rubber of gatorskin is softer and more elastic.I bought pair of gatorskins for commuting in winter when it rains. A lot of debris at expressways shoulders I ride. These ones don't work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"good tires!","review":"I replaced a pair of Specialized Armadillo tires with Gatorskins. I've only ridden 40 miles since changing but there is quite a difference. The G-skins have a far superior ride. I have neck problems and the A-dillo's, while I liked them and got very good service from them, my neck would be very uncomfortable following a ride. A-dillo's have a very harsh ride. I would never have believed that tires woud have that much effect on the ride, assuming they have the same psi, but obviously they do. I ride to work a couple of times per week and ride on a very busy street so there's lots of debris on my route so we shall see how they wear. But for now, very happy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"These are directional tires","review":"I think everyone has pretty much covered all the good things about these tires, so I just want to point out these are marked as \\"directional tires\\", not that it may actually make much of the differences since these are not even treated tires, but why not make things right from the beginning when you have the chance, the direction of sign is marked on the red sided lable, not very noticeable.Also these tires will be very difficult to install when brand new, they are very tight and will hug the rims like nothing else, so make sure you got some good tire levers like the Kool Stop Tire Bead Jack or very strong/thin tire levers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gatorskin=Awesome","review":"Pros:1. Flat protection. Second only to the armadillo. Armadillos wear out way faster though.2.

Although they are flat resistant, they still get a bunch of embedded debris that doesn't penetrate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frequent flats","review":"I bought these on recommendation from a local shop - no more flats they claimed. Expensive, but worth it right? Well in the first 15 days of riding I've had three flats. After the first I returned the tire to the shop for a new one, then that tire got a flat too. Sheesh.The first flat (day two of riding) was a weird sidewall blowout, maybe a defect in the manufacture of the tire. The second and third were from pieces of gravel slicing the tread all the way through to the tube. Just regular gravel from a bike path. So now I have a useless $50 tire with two holes in it, and another that I don't trust. Very disappointing.I should note that I've been riding my bike everywhere my life takes me for the last ten years, and am very experienced in installing and caring for tires.In the past I've had success with Bontrager race lite tires, which are cheaper to boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"GSkins","review":"Bought Conti GatorSkins in Denmark this summer; recom by top Copenhagen cycle shop for wear and grip espec on slick stone city streets.

I'm a bicycle commuter and ride 28 miles per day on urban streets. Flats just come with the territory on my commute, but honestly I'm getting more flats now than I ever have with these tires and I paid 3 times more. I've had 10 flats in the past 3 months! The majority were from punctures, but now I'm starting to get pinch flats because the bead is now damaged. That leads me into the other thing I hate about these tires, the wire bead is so tight that changing a flat is harder than ever! It's just a matter of time before the bead is damaged. I've even broken a few levers trying to take off these mothers. Avoid these tires like the plague! Take it from someone who has put them to the true test. They're definitely not worth the money! Go with armadillos or shwalbes all the way. I've always had good success with those tires. They're expensive, but they're actually worth the extra money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Tires Ever","review":"I bought two of these for front and back in addition to tire liners (yes, needed desperate flat protection).First on all, Tire liners did _nothing_. period.The first tire had a large 1.5\\" gash in the side of the tire. (QA problem?) But, both are worthless and did less than nothing to protect against flats. I might as well have been riding on tubes!(These flats were _not_ pinch flats, but from unavoidable glass and such).

This series was pure eighties, break dancing, big hair, music, posters. Ricky Schroder shines his title role, and he surrounded many well-remembered characters. Even legendary actor John Houseman appeared and Erin Gray really made big impression with her stepmother role. But, my favorite character is probably Rick's pal played by Alfonso Ribeiro. He was funny character. Everytime He appeared, there was some kind of funny things happened. Yes, by the today's standards, it's maybe cheesy but you certainly agree it's lot of fun, and I believe eighties will never duplicated.I had many fine memories with eighties, and Silver Spoons was certainly one of them.

However, she didn't adhere to her own \\"Dateworthy\\" advice to work through these issues. She married a man who leads a double life and cheats on her with multiple women. The author's personal choices aside, she comes across as very condescending in this book.

There is essentially no plot, and very little action, until a final \\"battle\\" between the baseball bats and the bad guys.

Unfortunately, this film is more like a clone in many ways than a sequel.Once again, Brown's character works with law enforcement to stage an event (you think he would have learned by now) this time to trap a killer. Again he uses his special effects tricks to get out of various scrapes. He once again gets in a fight with a hired killer, and once again throws food and kitchen objects at the killer-well you get the idea.This film is just too predictable to be very good. If they had taken the same formula and added a new twist of some kind it could have been a decent sequel.

It read like a novel. I enjoyed witnessing the change in Arvigo as she became more accepting of Maya beliefs and less fixated on the thinking of american practitioners; the struggle she had with changing her thinking process and finally being able to kind of mush them together into her own way of healing. For example at first she would introduce a plant and what it was used for and how it had a certain chemical(s) in it that would give it that healing property. But as she learns more about the plants she has to adopt a spiritual understanding on how these plants work to heal. And I loved the ending!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kelly shines as a solo star****","review":"Kelly Rowland album is exceptionally good. There are a few songs that really stand out such as \\"Haven't Told You\\", \\"Stole\\" and \\"Train on that Track\\". I am really impressed, because the vocals are good and the production is different. When artists try something different it can sometimes hurt them, but this really shows how versatile Kelly Rowland can be. I just hope that the mainstream R&B world will listen to this cd with an open mind. Some of the sounds here are alternative, but the message is good. If anyone doesn't think the songs fit with the album's tile Simply Deep I disagree. The songs here have meanings, but they are not spelled out to you. Kelly is being true to herself, and when you put this with good lyrics and music it will be a winner every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT solo album","review":"Kelly really shows her talent on this album. She hits notes that I've never heard her hit before, and she hits them all perfectly. Her mixture of R&B; and Rock is perfect. This is definitely the right sound for her. I think that everyone will enjoy this album, if they're a fan of Destiny's Child or not.Kelly shines in Destiny's Child, but shines even brighter as a solo artist. Keep on shining Kelly!In conclusion, I give \\"Simply Deep\\" 5 stars! If I could, I would give it more! If you don't have this album, GET IT NOW!

I am really late on this one, because I just picked up the album, and I am not at all disappointed. While I do feel that the production on a couple of songs fall short, Simply Deep does a good job of maintaining a level of consistency throughout the project. I really can appreciate an artist who is willing to take risks and experiment with different musical styles. Kelly does a good job with the material she was given on this album. I do, however, wish that there were more songs worthy of being singles. That may have helped the album sales a little more. I like most of the material, but my favorites are Love/Hate, and Everytime you walk out that door. The groove of this album is definitely smooth, and I look forward to hearing more from Kelly in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Dumb!!!","review":"This album should be banded from musics stores!I hated it it.She did a bad job.

Her voice blends well with Beyonce and Michelle's but by herself... this isn't good. I bought this CD because Stole is one of my favorite songs EVER and the packaging is nice... I could've saved fifteen dollars and bought the single. Simply Deep is one of the worst CDs I've ever bought. Stole is seriously the only impressive song on here. Of course there's Dilemma but I was tired of that last year. Kelly's voice is so- not there. I mean I could've sang these songs and it would have sounded better. I don't get why this CD received good reviews. Hello? Has anyone noticed that she can't sing? Well, okay, she can sing but her voice is annoying- to me anyway. For example, on her hit Can't Nobody she actually sounds sick. Wait, maybe she was just making me sick with her vomit inducing tone. The point is: don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"BETTER AS PART OF A GROUP!","review":"The first solo cd by KELLY ROWLAND of DESTINY'S CHILD was a great effort but sadly falls far shy of stellar.

Although the grip didn't seem to work when using six AA's, it worked fine with two rechargeable batteries it came with. Great supply of power for my D90, which uses alot from the flash and shooting video.The vertical shutter release is not as sensitive and needs a firmer hold for metering and focus let alone shooting.Still, with batteries and grip, it's a great deal. It's a permanent component to my D90 which needs the extra power for long trips and videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for the price.","review":"Works great on my D90. I like the feel better than nikon's grip. The shutter button is perfect.It only gets 4 stars because of 2 reasons.1.) The 1700mah batteries don't last as long as nikon's 1500mah batteries.2.)

When I plug in the battery pack grip my flash either does not work or is very sparatic in operation. I thought it was the off brand battery I was using so I installed a genuine Nikon battery. To no avail, I still did not regain my flash function until I disconnected the battery pack and installed the battery directly into the camera, which defeats the purpose if you ask me. I will be buying the Nikon MB-D80 battery pack because the grip is very convenient but I can no longer use this particular brand. I hope I just received a lemon and no one else is having the same issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haven't used the Nikon grip, but this one shure is great","review":"All of the reviews seem to be based on comparing the Nikon grip with this product, which doesn't make much sense. I mean, if you're a Pro using your camera all day and charging for it, then the money spent on the Nikon grip is an investment, hell, even a business write-off. Why go cheaper?But if you're looking for a way to make your camera's battery life last longer, while enabling you to take comfortable vertical shots, then why pay more for a grip? The Opteka works perfectly, while it seems quite durable. As far as the supposedly cheap plastic... I don't really see it, but who cares? You can buy three of these before you start comparing with the cost of the Nikon. And if you're a photographer with tiny hands then you're probably used to EVERYTHING being too big for you: lense rings, lighting equipment, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great alternative, very happy with it","review":"I've had this product for a week and love it. Worked great out of the box and had no issues with the Power2000 batteries or inserting them in the grip. I haven't tried the AA battery tray but I can insert it just fine.Great alternative to the Nikon branded product for consumers. I haven't obviously beat on it yet or dropped it so I can't comment on durability but I'm not too worried. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprising how good it is!","review":"Ok I was skeptical. I thought it would be cheap, but figured it would be worth it just for the batteries. I have not taken it off the camera, I balances very well with the grip on, much better than without with everything except my 50 mm 1.8. (that feels like there is no lens on it at all. The only issues I have with it is that the control wheels are rough feeling, the battery door opens to easy and the on off switch is easy to flip by accident. The battery door not opening is not too bad because unlike the body the batteries are held in with spring loaded tabs. Over all I love it. One thing is that if you have small hands it will be a big thing to grab onto. Batteries seem fine, I had heard of them, unlike Opteka. with the Power 2000 brand so they are what I expected.

However, I found the book to be unreadable. I am not certain what the author had done differently, but I could not get past the first 40 pages and those pages required serious work to read. It looked as if the author had some very good ideas but he had put it in a manner that was difficult to understand.Perhaps you will do better than I did.

The description of the elves are at odds with the elves in TLOR."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tolkien goes Biblical","review":"The Silmarilion has never quite been up there with Lord of the Rings, in terms of popularity. Perhaps it is because Tolkien never actually finished this book himself - his son reworked and rewrote his fathers sketches - or it may have something to do with the lack of a clearcut adventure, with a single hero and a clear beginning and end. The Silmarillion starts of as Tolkiens version of the Old Testament, and ends up as an adventurous collection of tales from the history of Middle-Earth. All the appendices with family trees and elvish dictionaries are pretty geeky, but I must admit: I really loved all the stories and sagas about Feanor, Turin, Beren, Luthien and the other 'new' characters. It is just as mesmerizing as LOTR and, fortunately, not to be made into a motion picture anytime soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the core books, but has some serious problems","review":"This book is by far more emotional than all of LOTR, with lots of excellent vignetes of Eleven lore by Tolkien.

I think this may have to become an annual thing..."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you enjoy Tolkien, just buy it.","review":"So often J.R.R. Tolkien's works are only brought to CD when they are \\"adapted\\" or \\"abridged\\", what those two words really mean is trashed. So it was with some anticipation that I got my audio book copy of _The Simarillion_.Fortunately this piece does not dissapoint. Martin Shaw does an excellent job reading the book, and true to it's advertising it is completely unabridged. That makes for nearly 14 Hours of reading by Shaw. I'm not 100% certain that all of his pronounciations were correct, but I can certainly live with it. It is absolutely awesome to be on a long drive and be able to hear the story _Of Beren and Luthien_ .For any fan of Tolkien's work I cannot recommend this more highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"How can any one not like this book?","review":"This book is the truest fantasy saga that I have evr read. The grand, flowing, bueatiful prose and imagery captures this tragic opera. Those who belittle the book lack the understanding and knowledge to fully comprehend this grand saga. Yes it is long and diffucult. But it is also the best story I have evr read in my life. The Silmarrilion is the only true fantasy book out there. If only all authors wrote a book like this for their fantasy sagas. Do yourself a treat and read it. It may be boring at first, but if you plunge into it you will see why so many rate this book highly. Buy it today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Calling all Tolkien Freaks","review":"Much has been said about the dryness of this book, and it is true; it reads like a cross between a text book and the King James Version of The Bible.With that said, if you loved the Hobbit, the Ring Trilogy and have a particular fondness for elves, you MUST at least skim this book. Even though this is not a page-turner, or a book you will read cover-to-cover, you will probably enjoy getting Tolkien's thoughts (which drive the stories in the above-mentioned books) about the beginnings of Middle-Earth.It's also very handy as a reference book and the pronounciation guide and glossary in the back of it are invaluable. :o)"},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOOOSCH ...!!!!! REALLY HARD READING !!!!","review":"Tolkien is the master of fantasy. No doubt about it. So, I supose what I'll say below will leave many of his fans upset. The truth is the following: this book is boring. The concept is grandious, the creation of Arda magnific, the battle between the elves and Melkor amazing. But Tolkien's style is typical of some British writers. It is dry. Even when he writes about beautiful moments or beautiful scenarios, it's dry and emotionless, almost if it was just a newsman relating it. So, enduring reading the whole book is already a victory. Please pay attention to the fact that I'm not saying this is not a great book. This would be insane. I'm just saying the writing style is boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scholarly Writing on Middle Earth","review":"Tolkein never intended for this book to go to print. He used it as background information to lend body to his masterpieces: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. While the Silmarillian may provide information to the die-hard Tolkein fan, don't expect it to evoke the same magic Tolkein's other works weave so adeptly. It contains neither the personal element of seeing Middle Earth through the eyes of the human-like hobbits, nor the redemption of a single coherent plot. This book reads like a history text, which is, in fact, what it was conceived to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"No where near as good as his other books","review":"I give it two stars because I'm a Tolkien fan, but it's like reading a phonebook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Immensely difficult to read","review":"Am I the only one who doesn't think this book is the best one ever written? It's not the stories, anyone interested enough in the world of Tolkien will want to know what actually happened in the first and second era, but the style of writing is impossible! I have managed, purely out of my enormous interest in Middle Earth and its inhabitants, to wrestle myself through this book once; the second time I tried I couldn't even reach page 10.This book is clearly a collection of notes which Tolkien made about his world's history, which have never been rewritten in a pleasantly readable style, and which have never been checked to keep things consistent, as there are many given facts that differ from given facts in other parts of the book.In short: only read this book if you are really, really interested in the history of Middle Earth, otherwise it's impossible to get through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected..Listen to it on unabridged CD","review":"This is NOT a continuation of the LOTR/Hobbit story. I rated it only 2 stars not for any fault in the book, but rather the fact that this is really a reference book and not a story. I suppose that if you wish to ferret out specific details and \\"historical\\" content it would be fine. But I found it a little too dry and disjointed to read with enjoyment.The above review was written in may 2002. This addition to my review was written on 18 Sept 2006.I still find the Silmarillion hard to read. I did listen to it on an unabridged CD and liked it. Part of the problem is that the Silmarillion is disjointed and the place names are hard to keep straight. The audio version obviates that. Please don't think that I am down on printed books. Lord knows there isn't a low priced, durable, simple to use/store electronic device that can hold a candle to a book. But for the Silmarillion, I'd make an exception."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, though not meant to be easy reading","review":"Awhile back I read The Silmarillion after reading The Hobbit/LOTR series. I enjoyed the Old Testament inspired beginning of the book of how Middle Earth came to be and the Valar who strived to protect it from Morgoth the first dark lord. It was also interesting reading about the ancestors of characters such as Elrond. However, as many people have mentioned before in their reviews it does get complicated and isn't always easy to digest. At times I had to take notes on the names because I didn't know that there's family trees and an index in the back of the book that's very useful! It's a book that might need to be read over and over in order to fully grasp everything mentioned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Symbolism in The Silmarillion","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's use of symbolism in The Silmarillion is exquisite. His use of symbolism really enhanced the book. Because of the added layers of action that the symbolism provided I enjoyed the book much more because of it.The symbolism of The Ring being the source of the problem and also being the source of all evil made the action that more provocative. Also the whole book is a work of symbolism of our very lives. Tolkien being a catholic fashions his work as a symbolic portrayal of our fallen human world. All these things made me enjoy this book allot more than if there hadn't been any type of symbolism to think about.In conclusion I gave this book 4 stars for it excellent use of symbolism and for keeping me entertained and interested throughout the entire time I was reading. Through his successful attempt at employing the literary device of symbolism and creating an awesome book I recommend this to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating story of adventure and history","review":"This book is one of the most fascinating books I have ever read. It contains thousands of years of history, and amazingly detailed and enjoyable tales and sagas which all relate to one main plot. The sheer complexity of the work will demand respect from you, but to those who are not fantasy readers, or Tolkien devotees, it will read somwehat like a textbook. Overall, a magnificent saga of a whole seperate world, but only for hard core fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Silmarillion Audio Book","review":"The Silmariollion Audio book read by Martin Shaw is a great buy for Tolkien fans. The book, to listen to is at first hard to follow since there are so many strange names and a cast of hundreds (most of which are named). The book is well read and the narrator gives energy and enthusiasm to lines that might seem boring when read. Also it is nice to finally learn how to pronounce some of the character and place names. The Silmarillion gives a much better history of Middle Earth than what is given in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. After reading (or in my case listening) the Silmarillion, one is compelled to go back and reread the trilogy with a better understanding of the lore and history that surrounds that timeless masterpiece.Thumbs up to the Silmarillion, and thumbs up to the narrator Martin Shaw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic!","review":"I fell in love with Tolkein's work when I first read The Hobbit as a child. Since then, I've read many of Tolkein's novels, but I read The Silmarillion only recently. And boy was I awestruck! Tolkein weaves a master tale of beauty, valor, faith, and courage of the Children of Illuvatar against the relentless assault of the Great Enemy, Morgoth, and his servants. The epic proportions of the battle between Good and Evil reminds one of an even greater work - the Bible - and Tolkein appears to have been inspired by the language of the Old Testament. The Silmarillion will always be one of my most favorite books of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I finally understand some stuff in LOTR!","review":"I read the well-known Lord of the Rings trilogy before Sil, and I LOVED LOTR. I read Silmarillion for an independent reading project at school, and got a good grade. The best part? I LOVE this book! It's more like a history book than LOTR, but it's SO much better than any history book that your teacher hands you and tells you read Section One. After reading Sil, you wanna read it again... and again...Then I began reading the trilogy again and not only will understand about Beren and Luthien-- you'll understand a LOT more, too. Like when Gildor Inglorion says he is of the House of Finrod, you'll COMPLETELY understand what House he's talking about, and WHO he's talking about. You'll begin to wonder about not only Bombadil, but also Goldberry (river-daughter? Ulmo's? But he dwelt alone...), and Glorfindel... need I say more? If you love Tolkien's works, you MUST get the Silmarillion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonferful","review":"I really enjoyed this book. At points it was somewhat like reading a dictionary, with all of the lengthy names of cities and people, but it was still very enjoyable. I'd say it ranks second in my list of best J.R.R Tolkien books - behind \\"The Hobbit\\" and in front of the trilogy series of \\"Lord of the Rings\\". I suggest it to any Tolkien fan but not to a reader who wants constant action. In conclusion, this was a great book and I really enjoyed it, so read it yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is not the Lord of the Rings, nor the Hobbit","review":"When I first read it, i expected it to be a sequal or prequal to the Hobbit, or the Lord of the Rings. It turned out to be some kind of history of all the world of Middle Earth, with many explanations but very little if any narrative or plot.If you're interested in the background and history of Middle Earth, this is for you. If you want something similar to Lord of the Rings or the Hobbit, stay away from this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tokien: First-born among storytellers","review":"In the Silmarillion, Tolkien describes the creation of the world as an evolving chorus sung by the Angels. The Dark Lord rebels in braying discord, but the clear melody of the One God ultimately triumphs. Tolkien's passage describing the Song of the One is perhaps the truest review of the Silmarillion itself: the faintest whisper at first, becoming slow, deep, and wide, possessed of an almost unbearable sorrow from which chiefly arises its beauty. Tolkien's elegantly crafted prose creates a web of many hundreds of hauntingly realistic lives that captures, then pierces your heart with the overwhelming tragedy and nobility of the human condition. A must read for serious students of the soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow start, but fun to read","review":"This book starts slow, but once you get past the first section the action begins to pick up and the story becomes one of the better ones that Tolkien has ever written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read a Beloved Favorite Anytime, Anywhere!","review":"This is a book I read and loved in hard copy a long time ago. I wanted to re-read it, and couldn't find it anywhere. I'm having a great time reading it-without help from my reading glasses - on my Kindle Fire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Answers many questions","review":"This book is a great help for those wanting to understand Tolkien's Middle Earth. For someone who has never even looked at Tolkien, I wouldn't recommend starting with this one. Check out the Hobbit instead. For those already steeped in Middle Earth, this book gives you great info about the First Age and what went on. It gives stories about characters only mentioned in The Lord of the Rings, plus a great mythological account of where all the elves, men and dwarves came from. It is a great guide to use to tie the story of Middle Earth together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"It was very good service. It has taken way less than the maximum number of days to get to my residence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roybal","review":"Fascinating history. Enjoyed the journey...it was like safely floating through a perilous road and feeling relief every time good triumphed over evil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This narrative of the construction and development of Middle Earth is a wonderful construction of the tale of Middle Earth organized as an anthology. It has the exact feel that Tolkien intended (that of a mythology constructed over a period of time and handed down through the ages) and sparks interest and imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book","review":"I have read Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit at least twice now, and always wanted more information on the background to Tolkien's world and the history he established to make Middle-Earth feel so realistic, and alive. This fills in much of what I wished o know, and makes the experience of traversing Middle-Earth (In the Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit) richer and deeper. The Silmarillion gives new meaning and understanding to the reader, and to the events that take place in their stories by relating to you the history of ages before. A must read for any true Tolkien fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Tolkien Book","review":"I think this book is the most beautiful that he has written. It is the history of Middle Earth and how it all began. I love back stories and this falls under that, after having read The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit first."},{"rating":"2","title":"The History","review":"The Silmarillion consists of a history of Middle Earth from the creation through most of the period before the Lord of the Rings stories take place. It is written as a history, not as a modern novel (unlike Lord of the Rings); and so do not read it expecting a novel. However, if you are very addicted to the Lord of the Rings saga and plan to read it again, the Silmarillion will definitely provide a lot of key historic information that will enhance your enjoyment of the Lord of the Rings. It will help you understand the origins of the races and many of the names and places mentioned in the songs and tales which may have seemed rather obscure the first time around.You should also read The Price of Immortlaity, you will not be disappointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific...","review":"This book is really helpful in decribing how things came to be and what caused many of the things in The Lord of the Rings to happen. My personal favorite in the story is the Tale of Beren and Lúthien, which is a tale similar to that of Aragorn and Arwen. Overall, this book was beautifully written and exellent for any Lord of the Rings fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never heard of it, huh? Your loss!","review":"Millions have read \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", but how many of them have gotten a hold of \\"The Silmarillion\\"? This is not a novel as such, nor a collection of short stories. This is the story of Middle-Earth, and in here you will find the answer to just about every question that is raised, but not answered, in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". \\"The Silmarillion\\" tells of the making of Middle-Earth and all of its inhabitants, elves, dwarves, humans and all the others, and of the thousands of years that passed from the world was created by Eru, The One, until the days of The Great Rings. It's written in the style of ancient Nordic sagas, and it's filled with drama and poetry. If you loved \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", you shouldn't be without \\"The Silmarillion\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have to any Tolkien fan!","review":"This book has it all, There are many unanswered questions in the Lord of the Rings about the elder days, here are all the answers, the scope of the book reaches from the foundations of Tolkien world to the last and more subtle details of it; from the beginning of middle earth to the third age and the war of the ring. Anyone who has seen Nasmith paintings about Tolkien, would agree that this book is the perfect compliment to its counterparts, The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, illustrated by Alan Lee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor performance after other outings","review":"After reading Tolkien's books The Hobbit and Lord Of The Rings, I felt I had to read the other ones-they were so great. When I first started to read the book, I was thoroughly disappointed. It was boring and slow, and the opening was terrible- I never even bothered to read it all. After Tolkien's first books, this was a thorough dissapointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"My personal favorite of Tolkien","review":"I have to start saying it is a dense book, can give you headaches specially at the beginning but definitely one of the best stories if you want to understand the middle hearth.

BUT... I can't recommend the Silmarillion, I hve tried to read it many times and rarely do I get past page 200. It reads like the Bible. I am not saying the Bible is a bad thing but it is not an exciting and dynamic read. A fictional Novel should be. It should involve dialogue rather than a recounting of actions of one person or deity and then jump days, years, or centuries ahead to recount others. I love tolkien but I think I will stick to the Lord of The Rings"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who needs another Bible","review":"It took me 10 years to read this book. I'd started with the Hobbit when I was in my early teens and enjoyed it, then read Lord of the Rings Trilogy. I picked up the Silmarillion at a yard sale, not even knowing of it's existance and started to read. I didn't get through 2 chapters. I've read the Bible cover to cover twice and I couldn't get through this book. It took me 10 years to finally read it cover to cover and I couldn't tell you what happens beyond a basic description. It even has pages and pages of begats, just like Genesis. The only reason I even finished it is I set a stupid goal for myself. The book takes you through generation after generation, and gives you the origins of countless Tolkien species. In General, Not that interesting and I wish I hadn't bothered"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good deal, but not accurately represented.","review":"This is a great companion piece to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. I'm enjoying having it, and this was a good deal for what I got. My only complaint is that it was marked as \\"like new\\" condition, but when I got it, it had a small tear in the front cover. That wasn't enough to ruin it for me, though, as you can see from the 4 star rating I gave it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable AND symboliv","review":"I find the simarillion among my favorite books. It is full of action and suspence yet it also reprsents the true history of earth. Like Satan Elkor takes the fall then strives to rule the world.

I had just finished The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. I was amazed I hadn't read Tolkien until now. So I figure what else has he done that I would enjoy. So Amazon has this book and 310 reviewers review it at 4 and half stars or something. So I get it and start reading it.I couldn't get past about 100 pages. I tried I really did. I would read two pages and put it down and take a break and try again but I couldn't get anywhere. The story he was telling wasn't a story at all. It seemed like a history lesson, with a boring hard to follow plot and people whose names you couldn't pronounce let alone remember. Now I've read some Tom Clancy books that were longer and as boring as watching CNBC but this was ridiculous.OK so I'm sorry if you love this book I'm sure if I was devoted to Tolkien maybe I would give this book another shot.

He answers a few questions from the previous books and makes the fantasy world a bit more complete.i really enjoyed this one and recommend it to everyone. The part about the Valinor who are the next step from kings is interesting. One war was because the mortal men couldn't go to the deathless island of the elves or the valinor's island.So the men were pretty much on Saurons side the whole time and the Elves and dwarves on the other.The book is very creative and therearen't so many journeys"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book may not be for some people","review":"I LOVED lord of the rings and the hobbit so I decided to read this book even though at first I had no clue what it was about.When I first started reading it I was fascinated at how deep it delved into the history of middle earth, so now if you see any references to lore in the lord of the rings after reading this book you can say \\"hey I remember that\\". However this book can probably only be read by serious readers who can stand what is basicly a history book. There are man6y interesting tales in this that are part of the shaping of middle earth in fact the entire book is. Some people have tried to associate tolkien with the occult but all that is a huge lie(seriously the guy was a christian) in fact some of the storyline is similar to the bible like the fall of the Noldar. ***PLEASE NOTE: This review was written by my teenage son who accidentally logged into my account.

It was wonderful! Though it is a challenging read, any true fan of Tolkien will eat it up in no time. This book includes every aspect of the history of Middle-Earth from its very start, and will answer many questions you may have been asking after reading LOTR. This writing of this book is so vivid, I felt like I was living the history of Elves, Men, Orcs, Dwarves, and Ents. I suggest taking the time to read it through twice, you will pick up so much more. And don't be afraid to use the \\"dictionary\\" at the end, I know I got a little confused with names at times! Well, buy this today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful and inspiring","review":"The Silmarillion for the most part gives a very detailed historical background to all things that exist and happen in middle earth during 'Lord of the Rings'.

It is most definitely among the best books I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"You cannot compare","review":"Of all of the works of fantasy, there are some that are stood up as masterpieces. The Wheel of Time, A Song of Ice and Fire, The Sword of Truth, and of course, The Lord of the Rings.But the Silmarillion cannot be compared to any of these others. It is not a fantasy book like any other. The Silmarillion is a narrative. It is the best of Tolkien's work because it is truly told in his words, as he recounts the history of the first age.But there is more than that. However outstanding or wonderful the Lord of the Rings is, there is simply nothing in it that is as powerful as the last stand of Hurin Thalion, or the love of Beren and Luthien.The Silmarillion is undoubtebly the finest novel I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful book, but....","review":"THE SILMARILLION is a wonderful book and provides a rich legacy of information which underlies Tolkien's beloved THE HOBBIT and THE LORD OF THE RINGS (LOTR). The author shows the true depth and richness of Middle Earth, creating a beautiful mixture of myth, folklore, and in some respects, scripture.For those who have loved and cherished Tolkien's more famous works, this book will provide great enjoyment. HOWEVER, for the person not familiar with LOTR, the book may be extremely difficult. While beautifully crafted, it may be difficult to follow as it is more reference than story in a sense.I would, as have many others, recommend THE HOBBIT first, followed by LOTR, both masterpieces of storytelling. With sufficient interest and background, THE SILMARILLION can then be truly appreciated for its own great gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection of Stories","review":"This book is essential a collection of sometimes closely and other times loosely connected stories that begin with the creation of the Middle Earth universe to the downfall of Númenor. Some of stories of a more history fashion of how Middle Earth came to be. Then you have the epic and heroic struggles of characters or races. This covers the first and second ages of Middle Earth. You will learn of the orgins of Morgoth, Sauron and Baelrogs to just name a few. My favorite stories in this are the ones about \\"Of Beren and Lúthien\\" and the story of Túrin Turambar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful read - and reread, and reread, and reread","review":"The Silmarillion is Tolkien's seminal work. The Hobbit and especially the Lord of the Rings Trilogy have it as their foundation.This one is told, intentionally, in an archaic form as old tales. Tolkien wrote the stories as the Elves lore, the Elves interpretation of history as they knew or understood it. Many of the tales are from long before the Elves came into being. It isn't easy reading - just read it through the first time. You will 'get' so much more with the second read. There is a podcast of college-level lectures from the TolkienProfessor - I subscribed to them on iTunes. You can go to his website for a link, just put a dot com after that. The lectures are a great help and lots of fun for a Tolkien fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Details: You may like them or hate them","review":"I read the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, The Hobbit, and some of Tolkien's shorter works. When The Silmarillion came out, I was in a completist mood, got it and read it. Part of the way through, I decided that \\"I really don't want to know anything more about all this.\\" I did force myself to finish it, with most details going in one eye and out the other.A lot of details that obviously fascinate some people and bore others. Having recently entered senior citizenship, I will content myself with the goal of re-reading the Trilogy and The Hobbit. This is a goal I have had for the past 39 years, since I first read it in the summer of 1966."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic","review":"Hard to read for most, but this epic book has zero fluff and is just downright incredible.

Of course, the story is neither embellished nor diminished in its electronic publication, however the paperback version has at least one advantage over the Kindle edition. I am a big fan of the maps that Tolkien included in his books, especially in the Silmarillion, as it helps me to visualize the world he created. When I read the paperback version originally, I found myself referencing the maps, and the genealogical tables rather frequently as the names of places and cast of characters is rather expansive. This task is more cumbersome with the Kindle edition, but not impossible. I would recommend reading the paperback version of the story first, and then deciding if the Kindle edition is worth the $10. Also, the auto-reader function really struggles the pronunciation of Tolkien's writings, as do I."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the Bible","review":"Another reviewer has said the Silmarillion is \\"the next best thing to the Bible.\\" In my humble opinion, it is much better,and in many ways deeper. From the wonderful creation myth in which the world is SUNG (not just spoken) into existence, and evil is seen literally as a kind of disharmony, to the philosophically brilliant understanding of the human condition by contrasting our human freedom through the \\"gift\\" of death with the Eleve's deathless fate being tied to the world, to the beautiful and spare telling of individual tales, this book continues to bring me delights, tears, and indescribably deep emotions after many readiings. A beautiful and profound meditation on the deep questions of mortality, good and evilI, freedom and fate; I recommend it to anyone who is on the path to becoming more fully human."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hard read, but worth it!","review":"It might take you a LONG time to read this book, because it is like driving a car through mud. The details are exquisite, and if you miss one, it messes the story up. So, when you read this, make sure you have LOTS & LOTS of time! The time spent is for a lot of info tho, so give it a try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Put away your Bible... this is The Book!","review":"First, there was the Qu'ran. Then, there was the Bible. And now, here is the Silmarillion! With this book, Tolkien proved to the world that he was one of the best (if not, the BEST) writer of the 20th century. This book provides essential Middle-Earth background to any Tolkien fan, BUT it is not for your typical Joe Schmoe reader; \\"The Simarillion\\" is a difficult book to read. That aside, I would have rated this book 10 stars if it would have been possible. Fantastic work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as accessible as LOR but worth the effort","review":"If you want to explore the legends and lore behind the Lord of the Rings, this is the place to start. Christopher Tolkien has collected here several of his father's more myth-like (as opposed to story-like) works. Never finished by J.R.R.T. (but intended as its own work), it is not as accessible as LOR. It takes more time and patience. Still, one can see his genius and dedication. This one isn't easy, but is nonetheless worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic History of Middle-Earth and Other Lands","review":"When I had finished the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings, I was searching for more Tolkien books to read. A friend of mine recommended the Silmarillion, and I am very happy I paid eight bucks for it.Tolkien's Silmarillion is an account of the First Age of Middle-earth and Beleriand, beginning with its creation, the fall of Melkor, the coming of the elves, and of course the Silmarills, jewels created by Feanor of singular beauty. My favorite story is the Tale of Beren and Luthien.Let it be noted, however, that this book is arranged differently than his other novels, and is sometimes rather difficult to follow along with the timeline. Many questions from the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings are answered,and we hear what characters such as Elrond and Galadriel did during this period. This is indeed a fantastic book in every way imaginable. I highly recommend this to any die-hard Tolkien Fan or to someone with absolutely nothing else better to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Amazing Silmarillion","review":"Loved Lord of the Rings Director's Cut and wanted to know more. Tolkein kept writing this book his whole life which I find amazing. I especially wanted to know the love story of Beren and Luthien being as he called himself Beren and his dear wife Luthien and the names are on their gravestones. Fathomless and wonderful reading in a beautifully illustrated hardback book to keep and pass on to a loved one. What a mind!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot more entertaining than reading yourself","review":"The biggest complaint I hear about the silmarillian is that it is dry and hard to read. I agree that it is like reading a historic or scriptural text, but the stories of Beren and Luthien, and Hurin, and Erendil are wonderful. Knowing the history enriches your experience of the Lord of the Rings. I ordered the book on tape because I have eye problems which make reading difficult, but I have also found it a lot easier to 'get through' the dry parts this way.If you are looking for a gripping novel this is NOT the book for you. However, it is a wonderful wealth of information for anyone interested in delving into the world and history of middle earth. It will explain a lot about Lord of the Rings."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Silmarillion","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's books are great. However the rewritten notes that Christopher Tolkien puts out are not well written. There is great background material in the notes, but it is not set out as a good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fictional History Lesson","review":"-I truly love Tolkien's stories, but this is not one of them.This is textbook style history of a fictional land. This book has lots of information about many things, but it has absolutley no entertainment value. If you are not a true Tolkien fanatic who loves irrelevant facts you will get no pleasure from reading The Silmarillion. There is no plot, just the droning progression of years, and no main characters(though there are well over fifty minor characters you'll have to remember)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Perfect Cure for any Insomniac","review":"I'm a big fan of Tolkien, but I hate to say that this book bored me to tears. After readingjust the first 30 or so pages I fond myself drifting off to sleep. When I woke up, I found that I had slept 2 hours! I'm not kidding! This REALLY HAPPENED! Sorry, Tolkien, but I just didn't love this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring?","review":"I loved LotR, and I loved Hobbit, and I bought this book, expecting another great story (or collection of stories, whatever). Instead, I find myself with 366 pages of condensed boredom. I dunno, perhaps I'm missing something here, but while I find it fascinating, I just can't see how anyone can *enjoy* it...Nevertheless, if you liked the other two books, don't let my comment put you off buying it, you might be one of the people who does find it enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lord of the Rings stands without this volume.","review":"These stories were written as the history of Middle Earth, and are fascinating in LotR precisely because they are never told completely, like the books described by Borges that never existed. Be content with LotR-- a 20th century masterpiece! Let these tales remain mysterious creatures of the woods, rather than jarred specimens in a biology room... by not reading them."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"This is supposed too be one of his greatest works but it is probably the lowest point he has ever reached.If you have read anything in the bible you now it isn't even Tolkien who made the charakters, he has just changed the names.Sorry to say but this should have been much, much better"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, dull, dull treatise on Middle Earth","review":"I love Tolkein's books, but as a reader, not a student. Therefore, I look at his books as a reader of STORIES, not an intellectual exercise in world building. Therefore, I have to say, \\"The Silmarillion\\" is a boring textbook exercise on documenting the bloodlines that Tolkein wrote about so brilliantly in the Hobbit and Trilogy books.The writing style is documentarian, tinder-box dry and dull. There's not an ounce of emotion in the entire volume. It's more like a thesauraus than a novel.If you want an engrossing story for adults, read \\"LOTR.\\" If you are looking for a more childlike adventure, pick up \\"The Hobbit.\\" But don't buy \\"The Silmarillion\\" unless you'd get excited by looking through a Farmer's Almanac/World Book encyclopedia of Middle Earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do yourself a favor and labor through Tolkien's opus","review":"I will admit that I have had many false starts with the Silmarillion. The causal reader will be put off by all the pages leading up to the part of the awakening of the Elves in Middle Earth, and their journey to the West. That is when things take off.Be warned. The Silmarillion is written like the Bible. It is a distant and sometimes cold narrative of great events in an ancient world. Yet, there is a gripping beauty to it. And anyone that does not shed a tear when reading the tale of Beren and Luthien should have their pulse checked.In many respects, the Silmarillion is a far superior piece of literature than even the Lord of the Rings. Do youself a favor--pick it up, and see what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for any LOTR fan","review":"Even though The Silmarillion was published post humously, it was, for the most part, written before the LOTR. It is compiled from JRR's notes and writings on the history of Middle Earth, and just explains so much that went on, leading up to the events of the Third Age that we know so well. Especially interesting, if you ever wanted to know more about the history of the Elves, of Sauron and Morgoth, and of what origin Gandalf is. To me, this book should be read by every person who reads LOTR, as it is a companion. I had to go back to re-read the trilogy again, right after finishing The Silmarillion. And you'll also be happy to know, it's written in the same completely absorbing manner that Tolkein wrote LOTR in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rough, But Worth It","review":"It's easy to see why Tolkien wanted this appended as a prologue to Lord of the Rings and it's equally easy to see why the publisher rejected that idea. If you're a fan of Tolkien's world-building, then this is worthwhile, but it's a slog. The language is very lofty, the litany of names is challenging, and the prose is... turgid.But if you can make it though the muck, you'll find a rich and tragic story about a world that starts in a state of beauty and perfection and slowly slides into despair and destruction. It gives context to the world of Lord of the Rings and enriches some of the themes of sacrifice that run through Tolkien's works."},{"rating":"2","title":"J.R.R Tolkien's Silmarillion","review":"I would definitely say this book is a must have companion to the Lord of the Rings series if your a big fan of the books. As previous reviews have stated, the beginning is a bit hard to get through, but once your past it, its really a good story. A friend of mine once said it read like a text book. He was partially correct. It is very text booky towards the beginning, but it really is handy for deciphering all the background legends in lord of the rings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Tolkien has singlehandedly created a vast and largely consistent mythology that provides a splendid background for the epic Lord of the Rings. I found many of the tales quite gripping and complete in their own right. Some parts of the book though were a bit taxing or even outright boring. If you enjoyed the Lord of the Rings, you should really take the time to read this (and the Hobbit). All the three books are written in very different styles."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are the story-eater kind, this book will EAT YOU!","review":"This mass of complex and (sometimes) excessive detailed stories, is like a a great passage opening to another dimension: the world, and I mean not only the Middle Earth, but the whole conception of Tolkien's own spiritual world. It is a great story that, by narrating you parts of it, leaves you intrigued and desperate to read the next chapter, (I mean, What happens to...?,)It is one of those stories in which by the end of each page you turn to the next because you simply NEED to know. This book, you have to take it carefully and slowly, and if you don't undrstand something reread it again, because only that way you will be able to savour all the richness that lies hidden in the covers. It make take you a year, but when you finish, your mind will be so full of satisfaction you'll plead for Silmarillion 2. It is a MUST read, but only after you've read The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely good--you don't need to be a Tolkienhead to enjoy!","review":"Any fan of sci-fi, whether they like the Tolkien wannabe Terry Brooks, the masterful Robert Jordan or even those hideous Star Wars novels, should read this book. Despite what everyone says, this book isn't really that hard to read (I read it in eighth or ninth grade, with little trouble), and the scope is incredible--all of the events of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy and The Hobbit are condensed into the last two pages of The Silmarillion. If you are a Dungeons and Dragons fan, you should also buy this book--in the back is a small elven dictionary that can help you create authenic elven names like Elianar (Starfire) or Celeb-Sul (Silverwind).No matter what books you like to read, you should read this one as well. Tolkien is the Beatles of sci-fi, and The Silmarillion is his Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard, but more than worth it","review":"I will grant that this book is hard to read, like a Bible. But no creation of a world is easy, less when it really starts at the beginning of everything. The story grows with each page, the characters live and die fully sometimes in just one paragraph, and when the gods take away their gaze from the world, life go on by itself. Of course is not the best book ever written because now there are better, but it was for a lot of time. If you consider yourself a fantasy reader, then read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The creation of Middle Earth; a melodic song.","review":"I began the read and found myself bogged down with the weight of all the different names and how they related to each other. I put the book down. Later, I began again and took notes, chapter by chapter.The creation reads like a 'song', full of joy and sorrow, jealousy and vengence. Since reading the LOTR first, this style of prose was somewhat hard to get used to.Although I re-read LOTR, I have never re-read The Silmarillion. But it did give me more of an understanding of the complete history of Middle Earth (origin of Balrogs, Sauron...)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great (not perfect, but great)","review":"This book is one of the best books I've ever read. The characters are memorable, the story is poignant to say the least, and it will haunt your dreams.Morgoth.Feanor.Beren.Each word brings an instant picture to the mind's eye. Readers of Tolkien's world that yearn for more, people who aren't satisfied with the Lord of the Rings should read The Silmarillion.A word of caution: If you like action, lots of action right up front, this book is not for you. There are so many names in the first few chapters that you will quickly get lost or even bored. It even happened to me. The first time I read this book, I ended up thinking that Melian married Finwe and Gil-galad was somehow Finrod. If you are too confused, put the book down and get a snack, sleep on it and return with a clear mind. Believe me, it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silmarillion","review":"Opulent in imaginative cloth. Perhaps on of J.R.R's best books ever. This book gives a grand look of a wonderful land filled with adventures and peril. I loved this book and think it is the quite possibly the best book I have ever read. If your looking for sagacious adventurous book you've found it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book, while rather confusing (especially with all the names sounding alike, ie: Manwe, Ingwe, Elwe, Olwe, Finwe, Aule), is a very good look at the history of Middle-Earth. It helps you find out who the people are when they are referred to in LOTR, such as Earendil and Varda. However, as my friend puts it, it is the Bible of Middle-Earth. I like it, but then again, I'm odd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meant to be read aloud","review":"I had already read the Silmarillion before but I never really appreciated how beautifully Tolkien wrote until I heard this book read aloud as an audio book. I usualy don't buy audio books also. It is still dense, bt when you listen to the reading by Martin Shaw, you realize that this is beautiful prose. It is the Old Testament of Middle-earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Silmarillian: An introduction to other Tales of Middle Earth","review":"The Silmarillian is a work completed and published posthumously by Tolkien's son, Christopher. It is the bible of Middle Earth and contains a much abbreviated taste of several other tales and books of Middle Earth, including: The Children of Hurin and The Lord of The Rings. This is where you'll find the legend of Beren Erchamion and Lúthien Tinúviel, family trees, and the relationships of the free peoples of Middle Earth. It begins at the beginning of the birth of Middle Earth, Elves, Dwarves, and Men, of good and of evil. Must reading for the Tolkien scholar, informative reading for the Tolkien fan, and entertaining reading for the passive listener."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have","review":"If you enjoy the Silmarillion, then you are a special type of Tolkien fan. I must say that, if you are that special Tolkien follower, you will have a strong idea for yourself of how things are pronounced, how voices sound, etc. The Silm. audio book and it's narrator will probably jar you slightly from your expectations, but in the end I believe you will enjoy the piece, and consider it an important addition to your Tolkien library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silmarillion: 5 stars! This recording: ZERO stars...","review":"I love each and every word of \\"The Silmarillion\\"; no Tolkien education is complete without it and no reading of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is possibly as rich without it (those who think otherwise delude themselves). BUT--this Martin Shaw presentation is DREADFUL: so lifeless, so passionless. The mispronunciations (accepting JRR's own readings as canon) are galling! Now: for a beautiful, emotional, *emotive* reading--do try Christopher Tolkien's own readings. His \\"Of Beren and Lúthien\\" is simply not to be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silmarillion= least favorite of the works of Tolkien","review":"This is definatly not what i expected. the first 100 pages are a grueling history of the gods of middle earth and it took me a commited effort to read through them. There were several times i thought the phone book would be a more interesting reading. after that it lightens up a little bit but i still had flash backs of sitting in church as a child being forced to listen to the preacher without falling asleep. I am dedicated to finishing the book, like it or not. In my opinion, this is not the Tolkien we all now and love. this is something totally different. It's not the same style or interesting story as the hobit or LOTR. I would only recommend this to the most serious and dedicated Tolkien fans or nerdy types that enjoy a difficult and long winded geneology of ficticous days of old."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyed it","review":"overall i enjoyed reading it. there were a couple chapters that went on about how the world was shaped. every hill, lake, and river was described and named. that was pretty boring and i ended up skipping through most of it since i didn't feel like actually drawing out the map. but like i said, i enjoyed it and now i'm reading The Hobbit and I'll probably find myself reading other stories that followed the Silmarillion."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think...","review":"... that this book is quite a brilliant book. I am very glad to have purchased the First Edition and would recommend it to just about anyone. Also the seller was very timely and very professional. I am glad to do business with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After reading The Hobbit I expected this to be just as entertaining. However, I found this to be utterly boring!!! A full narration of the history of middle earth?! Goodness!!! A poor rip off of the bible at best.

It was boring with too many names to remember."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusion","review":"It's hard to blame this mess on J.R.R. Tolkien, since he didn't exactly write it. I liken it to all the albums Jimi Hendrix put out after his death. Half finished pieces of garbage which the original master would never be satisfied with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silmarillion","review":"I think the book is boring!!!!I was frustrated with do many differentnames of characters. The only good part of the book was the last section because there was a connection to theHobbit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, dull, dull.","review":"What is everyone so excited about? I can't figure out what Tolkien was thinking when he wrote this. I loved his other works, but this was difficult to get through. It's reminiscent of the bible, like alot of other people have mentioned, lots of things getting created, and hundreds of names, lists of elves begetting other elves. If you like plot, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"it would've been better fully writen by tolkien","review":"as it says at the top, christopher tolkien compiled the book through his fathers notes, and i loved the plot and ideas... but i found it read to muc like a text book and seemed to drone on through ages without dialog or anything..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Increadibly hard to read","review":"this book was written like a text book, it has no plot and no character development it just tells the entire history of middle earth. the story spans several ages so you read about many different generations of families. the bad part about this is that for whatever reason all of the male characters have almost the same name thus making it not only boring to read but difficult to understand. Its like reading a history book about that time period in Prussia where every who ruled was named Frederick except your reading it for fun and not a class grade."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gods Weep","review":"One of the most emotional stories I have read in a long time, Tolkien's \\"The Silmarilion\\" is the story of the endless conflict between the Noldor and Melkor, the First Dark Lord.The stories contained within are varied and for all tastes, ranging from \\"impossible\\" love stories to tragedy, making of this a very complete reading experience.Unfortunately, this book definitely is not for everyone, it is, as a matter of fact, a difficult read, heavy with many characters and places, something that many readers do not like at all. That, added to the fact that the atmosphere is nowhere near of joy and happiness (unlike many times during \\"The Hobbit and \\"LOTR\\"), sum it up for a special book.And intense and poetic reading worth any time you spend with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good listen of a good read","review":"Several friends warned me that trying to listen to The Silmarillion while driving could be asking to fall asleep at the wheel. On the contrary, I found Martin Shaw's reading of this classic to be a very pleasant way to experience Tolkien's unabridged work. Shaw has a powerful, engaging voice and since there is very little dialogue in The Silmarillion, he doesn't need to adopt many different personalities in his delivery. Many other reviewers have covered this title from the perspective of its greatness in a literary sense so I won't bother adding to that. But as far as the quality of this audio book edition, I give it full marks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Of the Beginning of Days","review":"The Silmarillion is the spellbinding compilation of JRR Tolkien's tales of the Elder Days of Middle Earth, the History of the Elves, and the Shapping of Arda. Edited by Christopher Tolkien, the Silmarillion includes such wonderful tales as The Children of Hurin, the heart wrenching story of Beren and Luthien, and the Fall of Gondolin. For fans of any of Tolien's other writings, such as The Hobbit, or The Lord of The Rings, the Silmarillion is a must read. In it's pages we find the ancient tales of the Elves, telling of the shipping of the World, the origins of the Elves, Men, and Dwarves, and many tales from the ancient struggle between the Elves and Morgoth.RD Williams, author of 'The Lost Gate'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Audio CD set a must for lovers of Tolkien's use of language","review":"The audio CD boxed set of The Silmarillion, which contains the entire, unabridged text of the book over thirteen discs, is a real treat to listen to. Martin Shaw's narration captures Tolkien's vatic voice flawlessly, with excellent pacing, tone, and the correct pronunciation of those tricky Elvish words. Shaw is, however, less effective when he changes his voice to speak as specific characters like Eönw, Morgoth, Thingol, or various female characters. Tolkien's use of language is such that it rewards repeated listening, which makes this boxed set an excellent investment, even if, like me, you own a copy of The Silmarillion that has been just about read to pieces, and know the words a little too well for your own good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult read, but very worth it","review":"Like most people, I have read The Hobbit and The LOTR several times. Last year, I finally decided to give The Silmarillion a go. I'm glad I did; it is actually a better book than either The Hobbit or LOTR. I'm just really glad I had the other books under my belt first.This is a difficult book to follow, and you will find yourself flipping back several times throughout. It is completely worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtakingly Beautiful","review":"The Lord of the Rings was so wonderful. The Silmarillion has a completely different kind of beauty. It reads more like an old tale of history (like Herodotus without all of the digressions), and it is steeped in the unique magic of Middle-earth. If you ever feel a longing for days that will never return, The Silmarillion is for you. It satisfies that feeling for a while, yet it sharpens the longing all the more."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT BOOK -- terrible mass-market edition.","review":"This is not a literary review. This review is about the MASS-MARKET PAPERBACK printing/edition.I have the version with a gray/silver cover... WASTE OF MONEY. This is a wonderful companion for the Lord of the Rings, but this printing is terrible. It's tiny, stiff, and cheap. The paper is yellowish with tiny, poorly printed font.If you love LOTR and Tolkien, then buy this book -- just DON'T buy the mass-market paperback, keep looking for a better version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second only to LOTR","review":"It does not matter whether you're into fantasy or not, this is a must read. The first 1/3rd of the book can turn off even LOTR fans, because it is filled with too many names and places. But, work on the book. The rest of the book is one of the best reads ever. Like so many other reviewes say, THIS IS NOT A COLLECTION OF SHORT STORIES. This is a story about elves and men and their wars with Morgoth (Sauron's boss). The writing is top notch. This is a great fantasy and literature at the same time. If you're sick of G.R.R. Martin and Robert jordan and looking for something original, read the old master JRR. This is an undeniable masterpiece. I'm not one of those ringnuts, but after this book, I might become one :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book Tolkien wrote","review":"This book is what I think the greatest book Tolkien wrote. I read it once a year because there is so much to it. It starts with the creation of the world and Middle Earth. It goes deep into the history and myths of Middle Earth. Many stories mentioned in the Lord of the Rings books take place in the Silmarillion. This is not an easy book to read. I guess you can call it the \\"bible\\" of Middle Earth. But it is a very good book. Things in some of his other stories make more scence after getting the pieces The Silmarillion fills in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes more than once","review":"I have read this like 3 or 4 times now and still get lost in the details.

My only knock on Tolkein is he often calls characters or places by multiple names, and i could not keep them all straight without reading the book through twice. But I am a big enough fan to do it, and enjoyed it the second time through"},{"rating":"2","title":"I always come back to this book.","review":"The stories in The Silmarillion are intensely philosophical and deeply humane. Due to the fact that this book is basically a posthumous compilation of drafts, very often an event is told in only one or two sentences and many things are not elaborated or explained. This leaves many holes in the stories, but at the same time this allows the reader to interpret a story in many ways according to one's own believes and understanding. Be it the author's intention or not, this is actually one of the most fascinating aspects of The Silmarillion. No matter how my interests may have evolved over the years, this book is the book I always return to and find new perspectives to look at the characters and the stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laborious, but great","review":"This book was a hard read, but well worth it, especially if you liked the Lord of The Rings. For instance, did you know that Elves have a homeland? Did you know that Gandalf is a Demi-god, not a wizard? Did you know that he was sent into the land to stop Sauron and nothing else? I bet you didn't. But if you read the Silmarillion you will learn this and everything else.The story in LOTR was about one inch of a story that is a foot long."},{"rating":"2","title":"nicely read","review":"Unabridged.

Deathly toxic, once more it is appalling to find it used with a 'heat outdoors' statement attached. Does the company know this material is being used this way???

The pictures in this book look as if they were copied using an old copier from the 70s very dark and pixilated and hard to view. A book on photography, I would think, should have better images. This book looks as if someone printed it up in their basement. A much better buy would be \\"The Camera\\" by Ansel Adams. You can buy it used for $10 to $20; it has more information with better details on using large format with lot better images showing you how to use it. I was looking forward to it arriving.

It's more mellow pop than it is country. Willie's voice is clear as a bell and the quality of the recording is amazing -- crisp and sharp with every instrument defined and audible.\\"Always on My Mind\\" is, of course, one of the best known love songs of the 20th century. Almost as good are two other songs on the CD: \\"Old Fords and Natural Stone\\" and a song with a clever hook, \\"The last thing I needed the first thing this morning (was to have you walk out on me).\\" Most of the other songs are covers Willie performs adequately, if not with inspiration. But the three great songs on this CD put it in the must-have category."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta love it!","review":"This is a great album! I just listened to it for the first time. You can infer from the track list that it is pop done up Willie style, but that is not a bad thing. They are all good songs, and this reissue has two bonus tracks that are also excellent. I've seen reviews of this that say it's one of his weaker efforts, but I disagree. (Glad I didn't listen to them!) The arrangements have variety, and are always tasteful and not overdone. The musical details are interesting.

Dramatically, it holds up fairly well, although I found it a bit more heavy-handed than I remember it. Some great performances by Powers Boothe, Randy Quaid, Albert Hall, Levar Burton, Veronica Cartwright, Brad Dourif, Meg Foster, and others. But this print is horrendous! Terribly grainy to the point of being out of focus, colors are over-saturated, and full of dust, dirt, pops, jumps and skips. And the sound is muffled, subject to irregular dropouts, and often distorted. I will not keep it in my library. It's a shame because it would have been worth watching again sometime. I guess the studio didn't think it worth digitally cleaning up the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining, but highly inaccurate","review":"Powers Boothe, while obviously talented and provided a strong character, he did not capture the real Jim Jones in any sense. This movie is so full of inaccuracies that it is not worth viewing to obtain any true information regarding the Peoples Temple movement. I would recommend some of the documentaries such as Purple Haze or the A & E Biography of Jim Jones-Journey into Madness. I found this motion picture misleading and almost total fiction as I know many, many family members and survivors of Peoples Temple and have written/researched Peoples Temple extensively."},{"rating":"1","title":"Know what you are watching!...source and context tell the story","review":"This made-for-TV(CBS) film is a textbook example of the media massaging the message. The Jonestown \\"event\\" happened in late November 1978, this movie was on TV by 1980--within little more than a year CBS is further reinforcing and shaping the public's image and the very mythology of Jonestown. Although it is a second-rate production with poor acting and dialogue (I image the result of haste) the movie's importance lies in what it does not tell you...seeWas Jonestown a CIA Medical Experiment?: A Review of the Evidence (Studies in American Religion, Vol 35)...among others.Watch this film after having consulted other sources and understand how we are manipulated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - this DVD is awful quality!!!","review":"Buyer should beware that the quality of this DVD is terrible.

Even the above poster states that this has been fully restored and remastered. But, sadly it has not. For a film that was only made in 1980, I can't believe that a film would have picture quality that is this bad. Honestly the quality of the picture is that of a bootleg, and its even worse than Reel Enterprises version of the film. The video jumps from time to time, it's murky and the sound is like something from a 1930's film.Shame on VCI for bringing out a title that is this bad.

It was very interesting and tragic. I read some negative reviews on the quality of the DVD but thought the reviewers may be exagerating. After receiving the DVD I can say that the reviewers were correct. The movie is basically unwatchable. The video looks like the old projection films you see in high school and the audio is worse. I could barely make out the dialogue, it's very muffled, and there is no closed captioning. If a movie is going to be released on a digital medium, the producers should take the time to restore it.

Plus he is a coward to, and i can't believe they looked up to that peice of trash that claimed himself that he is god. Now that is disgusting. The movie is great, but this DVD needs a lot of work.

My partner has a Samsung R225 with T-Mobile and he usually has 1 to 3 bars. T-Mobile refuses to give me another phone model. They will only replace my phone with the same model (which they have and I still get no reception inside my house). Poor customer service. Will go with another carrier when my contract is up in a few months (and get different phone, as well)."},{"rating":"1","title":"You pay for what you get","review":"I've had my phone for just about a year. When I initally bought it, I was excited at having a smaller phone, but realized this comes at a price. Let's just say it's the perfect size for the 18 month old I nanny. Everything on the phone is compact so if you are over 5 feet tall, you may find you need to adjust the phone when you are speaking and listening. The buttons are rather small and difficult to manuever if you don't have small fingers. The sound quality is so-so. It is lightweight (this is a plus). If you are looking to take pictures with the phone, the quality is grainy (typical of the first camera phones). After this phone, I've decided to go back to a flip phone because unless you remember to lock the keys you may find your phone dialing your contacts while it's in your purse or bag. After my year with my T610 phone, I'm looking forward to trading it in."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dont hear it","review":"I got this phone a year back,i had a Nokia earlier.I never had a problem with my Nokia.But with this one even after a year i never hear it.Mainly in crowded places etc,its never heard.The menu is difficult to Navigate and also everything needs lot of steps.Im just waiting for the year to get over so i can rid of it.I dont recomend it to anyone"},{"rating":"1","title":"not great","review":"the phone's camera is not that great, dust gets on the camera lens and it is very hard to clean. the text messaging is pretty easy, it spells out the word if you want it to. although, the signal sucks, i dont get great signal unless im in the middle of no where."},{"rating":"1","title":"T-Mobile is the worst","review":"I've had this phone since February 2004, and have had nothing but problems with it. Dropped calls, spotty network, and VERY poor customer service. I have called T-Mobile on numerous occasions and it would seem that the only job of the reps is to pacify you and tell you that the service will get better. I will not, however, resubscribe with T-Mobile next year, if they do not clean up their act. I was told that I would get reception at my house. I have to walk 4 blocks away for one bar of signal. Little things like that add up. The camera, games, etc. are useless without good solid signal service, and this is where T-Mobile fails miserably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, but NO speakerphone!","review":"I don't think there's deliberate deception, but Amazon's promotion is wrong.

In actuality, the T-610 is far inferior to the Nokia. It drops calls all the time. It often doesn't record incoming phone numbers. It freezes up about once a day. It can't send or receive calls from places the Nokia could, like my office. I sent the first one back and got a replacement under warranty, but the second was worse than the first.

I was able to get 4 bars signal strength at my house, then I took it to work and got no signal. Granted I work in of all places...a building.

As a matter of fact, my area is one of the large coverage region in my state. Can you believe this? I do not know it is because of the phone or the T-mobile coverage.

After reading positive and negative reviews of this phone, I was finally swayed into purchasing this phone due to the hefty rebates offered at Amazon.After about 6 hours out of the box (four of those hours charging), the phone's operating system locked up, and the screen is now blacked out (probably permanently). The phone only responds with a pleasant chime as it starts up, but sadly, nothing else.I sincerely thought that some of the negative reviews for this product were from purchasers with gripes against the manufacturer or service provider. At worst, maybe these bad reviews were isolated incidents, and I could beat the odds. However, in the end, I must sadly concede and admit that this is a terrible product and should be avoided at all costs.

It has decent battery life, looks very nice, and I have had almost no trouble with dropped calls or weak signals. I have yet to try out the Bluetooth features.In response to some of the complaints others have made, you do have to be careful with the charger. I had a Sony phone when I lived in France that had the same type of charger, and it is a bit different from other manufacturers' chargers. Be SURE to read the instructions in the manual on how to insert and remove the charger. It is true that it will break or become loose if it is constantly removed improperly. If done correctly though, you should have no problems.Since I have had no problems with my signal, my guess is that the problems others have reported with weak signals probably have more to do with the service and not the phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy phone","review":"I have had enough problems to last a lifetime I guess.

T Mobile refuses to replace the phone with the same features...I will have to shell a good amount of money as well....All in all SOny Ericsson T610 is not a good one.

I live in the Seattle area. Once in a brief while, I show all 5 bars on the display, but more often it's only 2 or 3, and a weak 2 or 3 at that. My wife bought the Samsung E105 at the same time. The side-by-side comparison is very interesting. Her phone shows 5 bars (and gets great reception) most of the time; we're both on T-Mobile.

Surprisingly, the old phone is able to receive some signal even in places where T610 loses the network.The Bluetooth option is a cool one. With a good Head Set you don't need to press any button to make or receive calls(provided the phone receives the call).The camera could have been better. The resolution is pathetic.The phone does not give any error message when it fails to complete a call due to loss of Signal.Other than this weak reception, and few minor glithes the phone is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"good phone but has issues","review":"i got this phone mainly as a poorman's pda (contact and calender manager). i got the TRENDware bluetooth USB adapter along with it. it syncs up great w/ software from trendware as well as the software from sony ericson after some early pitfalls setting up the software. reception on the phone is like any other phone i'd used before.like others i experienced issues where the phone will just hang and the only way i can get out of that state is to pull the battery. this kinda sucks and i hope there is a fix out there. but all in all i'm happy with my phone because of the price and bluetooth :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST PHONE EVER","review":"THIS IS THE WORST PHONE EVER. DON'T GET TEMPTED BY THE REBATE..THIS PHONE HANGS, DROPS CALLS, VERY SLOW INTERFACE. IT KEEPS HANGING...I AM GOING TO RETURN IT ASAP!(I ALSO HAVE NOKIA 3650 WHICH IS THE GREATEST PHONE I EVER HAD)"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better phones out there","review":"This phone is unnecessarily complicated. The screen resolution sucks. The camera is virtually useless. Menu navigation is very cumbersome.The only good thing about this phone is, it gets you cash back. In short, I would not buy this phone again. I'm waiting for my contract to get over so that I can get better phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, but not fuctional","review":"It is sleek and stylish and has a large screen and long batt. life, so I thought seems like a nice phone. Then I started using it. There are so many problems with this phone which result from simply poor design. Here are a couple of the more critical. The screen is useless outdoors and in the sun, forget about trying to see it, you need a hood, literally(even using your hand to shade it barely works). The exteral side buttons are not programable, dedicated to camera and internet fuctions ONLY and they are too sensitive, so while talking you inadvertently take pictures or put it in the camera mode(and camera is poor quality) The joystick and the menu are \\"cute\\" but poorly implemented, the joystick is a button inaddition to the pointing device and you end up pressing the button while trying to nav. thru the icon. The icon, again are cute, but no fast way-shortcut to get to a function, and the list goes on and on.DONT BUY IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst phone I've owned!","review":"I'm not one for paying a lot for a cell phone, and ususally that works out fine for me. The free offer phones I've had in the past have been decent phones with good reception. This phone I actually paid for and have had major, frustrating issues with it.The phone freezes a lot, has terrible reception, and picks up a lot of background noise making it hard for people on the other end to hear what you're saying.I definitely do not recommend this phone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT","review":"I didn't believe the reviews for this product, and was seduced by the price. Yes, it is unbelievable. However, there is a reason this product is so heavily discounted. The phone can't even perform the basic functions. I am now on my fourth phone, and each of them have had similar problems...1. Phone freezes during a call, when answering a call. Which means you can't end the call without taking the battery out.2. My latest phone has now stopped connecting to the network, and so is completely useless.Be advised, Amazon will not exchange this phone for another one. You will be stuck with a phone that does not work. I am being forced to purchase a new phone on ebay just to use my service with T-Mobile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad reception and poor battery","review":"I just got this phone and the talking quality is good only when you are out of the door. It's bad to use it in a building. The technical data is also misleading. I had expected this phone to stand for about 10 days (no need to say 12 days) but it stands only 2 days and I have to recharge it. I charged my previous 3390 once per week for my usage.I got cheated again by Sony for their \\"technical data\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Customer support from mfr","review":"the freaking power cable quit working w/in a few weeks and neither t-mobile nor sony will fix it for less than $20. Sony took my address and said they would, but it never showed up.Well the phone is rugged! It's been 3-4 years and it still works. It went through the washing machine and half the dryer. It was submerged in a puddle for 30 minutes- it keeeps working.The blue tooth syncs w/ my pc and tells me where to go etc. I buy a $25 access card every couple of months and avoid the taxes. It's been a great little phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Trek Communicator - at last","review":"I came into the game late, waiting for a good phone (but not necessarily a PDA.) This phone has every feature I could anticipate for the next few years, including bluetooth and IR connectivity. It can also be unlocked and used in Canada or Europe with their local SIM cards. T-Mobile gets mixed reviews but I've had no problems with them...they have excellent coverage of the West and East Coasts of the US. They're also the only GSM network in the US (other than Cingular, which does suck) that I know of, so for me it's a no-brainer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad signal","review":"I got my T-610 cell phone about month ago. The signal was very bad either in office or at home. It lost signal very often at home. I had to go out to place a call or recieve a call.

A lot of features. (BLUETooth, IRDA and so on.)2. Cheap( got it for $50 before rebate.)Cons:1. Very difficult to take SIM card out.2. The key pad is badly designed, sometimes the keys stuck under the face plate and cause the pone to froze.3. Menu is difficult to use .4. standby time is about 1/3 ( or less) what Sony Ericsson stated. Other phones I used before usually get 60%-70% of stand by time with light usage.5. Ring volumn is low. Vibrating(Ring) is not strong enough.6. The phone screen get dirty easily.7. Only 1 mb of memory avaliable (T-mobile).The reciption signal is ok for this phone. This phone looks cool , but the quality is poor. Spend a little more for a better phone. I will not recommand this phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good phone, but....","review":"The phone looks great and works nicely but occasionally it will freeze up -- then you'd have to remove and reinsert the battery.

I could never get decent reception on this phone, even though I was clearly in the coverage area. My wife also has T-mobile service, and gets great reception in the same locations. When I called T-Mobile, the representative confirmed (unofficially) that this phone has well-known reception problems. I'm returning this one to Amazon ASAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Could do Better","review":"The reason I say you could do better is that both Sony as a manufacturer and you as a consumer could do better.The phone doesn't get as good of reception as most Nokia or Motorola phones (on At&t; or Tmobile) and protective cases are both needed to cover the easily scratched/smudged screen and virtually unavailable. Same with handsfree, other than the ill fitting piece that comes with it only a bluetooth set is available adding at least another $60 to your bill.Sony usually means superior quality, but my girlfriends Motorola V300 was free after rebate and I'm jealous of it's quality over mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony Ericsson T610 Phone (T-Mobile)","review":"Since 5 years I was using sprint phones with very easy and cool features. Recently I took Sony Ericsson T610 Phone (T-Mobile)and my problems started. I don't see one good feature. I don't know how people are surviving with T-mobile. I am thinking first time I took very bad decision with T-mobile. I'll strongly advise that don't buy T-mobile phones.."},{"rating":"1","title":"T-Mobile has the worst reception!","review":"T-Mobile is the worst carrier you could ever have. It can drop your call in the middle of the conversation, and the signal is very unstable. It could vary from strong to nothing while you are holding your phone up high. I even got not error messages saying \\"no socket available\\" when I was trying to check my voice messages at 2 a.m. on a Saturday night. The quality of the line is so poor that you have to scream on the phone all the time and it makes you repeat something simple numerous times! It's so frustrating.... I will terminate it once the contract is up. I would not sign up with them again even if they offer many free minutes because it could turn your good day into a real bad day!!! You can't even carry a conversation over 3 mins without the call being dropped."},{"rating":"1","title":"No reception","review":"I dont get even a single bar at home (North Brunswick,NJ).

I am not sure why or how that happened, and when I called Sony, they said that it is considered physical damage so they will not replace it or repair it. And they will not repair it even if I paid for it, so it is not just a warranty thing. So, here I am stuck with a phone that looks horrible.

If I decide to take picture then I cannot check what picture I did. Home I can see just very, very bad pictures I got with this camera.Additionally, sometimes the phone answers the calls I am getting. Sometimes the phone dials somebody from my phonebook.

I have T-mobile on all three phones, so the T 610's poor reception couldn't be because of network problems.The camera quality is pretty poor and I sorely miss the loudspeaker option that is present in the 6610.I feel that the next phone that I'll buy is going to be a motorola; their phones are very intuitive to use as compared to nokia/sony ericcson.Also, before opting for T-mobile - please please please - check the network connectivity in your locality.

After removing the back cover to change the camera reflector to the mirror, the battery moved, and I put it back in its correct spot.
