This movie definitly lives up to the quality of Vacation as it is completely hysterical! There are so many memorable lines in this movie youll be reciting them casually to friends and family. You gotta feel bad for Clark, why cant he ever have little fun with his family. The movie pinpoints just how stereotypical Christmas can be, and then shows how it can be if everything goes wrong.

It is, quite frankly, the best Christmas movie there is. The comedy is non-stop from beginning to end. This time of year, we watch it 3 or 4 times before Christmas, including on Christmas Eve. Having said that, the Blu-Ray version is no better than the standard DVD. The video is so-so, the audio is terrible (Dolby 2.0), and there are no extras. Maybe I shouldn't expect more, after all, the movie is from 1989. However, in releasing a Blu-Ray, I think people do expect better quality. If you are buying this movie for the first time and can get a good deal on the Blu-Ray, go for it. If you are thinking of replacing the standard DVD with a Blu-Ray, save your money for something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Christmas Tradition!!","review":"Our family has been watching this movie every year for 20 yrs!!

I purchased it based on the numerous positive reviews... what a let down. Even the cable guy is funny next to this. Badly acted, clumsy, badly aged, miserable movie, that's what this is. I smiled once at the end of the movie, but even then, it was just a smile. You see everything coming 10mn before it happens, there is no wit. You are supposed to watch the main character make a stupid face during a minute and find it funny. Pepople here talk about sarcasm... sarcasm? What's sarcastic is that anyone would find this funny. You could show this movie to the public in \\"idiocracy\\", and yes, they would have a good laugh... Plus it is not something you would want to show young kids in my opinion. My 12 year old daugther said at the end that she hated that movie, it was too negative, boring, and had nothing to do with Christmas.

The main character fabricates that he is divorced when he meets a girl at the lingerie shop? A Santa-Clark imagines himself seeing the girl naked as he dreams about the family pool?

I wanted a widescreen HD version. I found this Blu-ray version on Amazon and placed my order. My two complaints: video quality and \\"widescreen\\". The video quality is slightly better than my DVD at best. The \\"widescreen\\" was the bigger problem. I assumed this would be a re-release of the original theatrical widescreen version - it isn't. They have actually cropped the top and bottom off of the 4:3 DVD version to make it pseudo-widescreen. My Blu-ray now has less of the original movie than the 4:3 version has - it has been cropped twice. Don't waste your money on this - keep watching the DVD version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watchout for overcharge!","review":"Somehow I was charged for two rentals instead of one.

Then again the first time I saw it was as a young adult and about the time it was originally released. Chevy Chase was not too far removed from his SNL days (relatively) and still fairly popular. Now I guess with time I found the movie just silly and not particularly funny or entertaining. Lots of campy humor, too many close-ups of Chevy Chase's goofy wide-eyed look that became more irritating than funny, and several instances of foul language and sexual innuendo which I found uncomfortable to sit through with my 12 going on 13-year old son. There are some genuinely funny scenes, but by the end I was quite disappointed. I also suggest parents of early teen and younger kids may want to screen this PG-13 film first as the rating recommends before deciding to share it with the younger ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes us laugh out loud","review":"Our family watches this movie every year, but we only have it in vhs.

The Blu Ray upgrade in picture quality is worth it.But, skip the Ultimate Collector's Edition and just stick with the single disk purchase. The extra items such as the coasters, the fake snow, the santa hat and the moose cup are all low quality crap. The Marty Moose mug, which could have been THE item to have in this set is so small you could barely stick your pinky finger in the opening. the tin package for the set is nice but only takes up space on the shelf unless you can find another holiday use for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good christmas movie","review":"I love all the vacation movies.

Kind of like one of the old Saturday Night Live skits they did about the old Roman warrior movies. Amazon made good and sent a new one. Unfortunately, this new one did the same thing.

If you watch this film and don't at least snicker, check your pulse and buzz the nurse...you're DEAD. The crazyness that takes place in the beginning is only subdued by the ending that we all pray never darkens our wreathed door.This is the TRUTH...for our Christmas party where I work, it is mandated that all who enter must recite a line from this film to enter.

Beverly D'Angelo looked especially good in this. I have since had dreams of her in a Santa cap (and nothing else). Rusty and Audrey were kinda lame in the movie. Randy Quaid was a jerk, but that is his appeal. I would give this 1/2 thumbs up (due to amputation)."},{"rating":"2","title":"CHRISTMAS WITH THE GRISWOLDS","review":"This holiday classic just gets funnier every year. Full of classic lines & great sight gags along with one of Chevy Chase's funniest performances this has become a Christmas standard. The many hilarious scenes include Clark W.Griswold JR. stapling Christmas lights to his roof(and himself) and Clark blousing err browsing while shopping. The scene where Clark goes sledding always gets lots of laughs(it's classic Chevy Chase)! The music is good too as many Christmas favorites old & new fill the great soundtrack.

Those of us who bought it as Cherry fans when it first came out called it \\"Disco Don\\" and gave it away or sold it (cheap). This is standard funk jazz, faceless and hysterically excited about nothing. The biggest shame here is that an otherwise unrecorded Cherry composition, which begins wistfully with Collin Walcott's sitar, a piece that in concert was brilliantly played by Cherry on piano and trumpet, is hereby immortalized as yet another piece of fusion tripe. A reviewer a little ways up the ladder here says Relativity Suite should be reissued, and when that happy day comes may Disco Don also vanish without a trace---except for those few seconds...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!!!

I'll admit, that my favorite character is Blaine McCracken and that I'd like to see more books with him, but Ben Kamal and Danielle Barnea are great characters as well. I started this book a couple of days ago and I couldn't put it down. He's gotten much better with these characters as the books go by. The plot was good and it kept your interest all the way through. The only draw back that I saw to this book was that he copied a part from one of his earlier books almost verbatim. I was a little put out by that. All in all, though, well worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to read","review":"I don't expect great literature when I read a detective story, but it would be nice if the plot was at least remotely believable and the author had some facility with the English language. Unfortunately, neither is true here. I actually winced when reading portions of this book and finally found it too painful to continue. I am impressed with one thing: that an author of such mediocrity could get his work published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lou Rawls: Live at the Dentist","review":"If you're thinking about buying this CD because you love Rawls' amazing blues and jazz vocals, don't! BuyThe Legendary Lou Rawls,Live!, or one of his many other fine releases instead. This CD is full of sappy pop songs, most of which belong in your dentist's office rather than your CD player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"I wanted a collection of songs by Lou Rawls but this isn't it. All the songs are overproduced - too much musicical effects, too much singing fast with finger snapping, too much in the jive mode. I've been slowly replacing the tunes in this album with the same songs by other artists.Reminds me too much of Bill Murray's impersonation of a lounge musician."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT COMMERCIAL HOOK WITH FEMALE FRONTED MELODIC SYMPHONIC METAL","review":"If you're a fan of Nightwish and After Forever but still have a passion for some of the more commercial flavors of hard rock then this is an album for you. It's easy on the ears with a hook that is anything but cliche. Buy this album and you won't be dissapointed! I am so glad that I found this project and I'd have to say my favorite track on the album is Out! Enjoy it as much as I have.The female voicings immediately jump out at you as a very produced and commercial project that has a different flavor than the more popular Amy Lee. The vein is similar to that however, and you'll find yourself tapping your feet to the songs. It's not as heavy as the Nightwish or as symphonic but leaves the listener still jumping out of their seat in a rockers euphoria!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very surprising","review":"I was very surprised when I picked up this album. I haven't heard their other stuff, but now I want to... The songs are very melodic and easy to listen to. My only complaint is a couple of the songs are a bit too bubble-gum for my taste, but strangely it's not bad enough for me to fast-forward the song.

Their speciality is loud, fast, raucous live shows. But, I like this one a lot. Good sound quality, catchy tunes. The influence (and voice) of Ex-Dash and current Cowboy Mouth drummer Fred LeBlanc can be heard and felt on this disc. It's a good influence.I'd recommend this as one to have, but I'd also recommend catching these guys (who I've known for nearly 20 years) live.

Based on the Bible and its presentation in Christ the Healer, our lack of faith is the reason if we do not see healings today like the ones recorded in the Bible. Through His Word and His Son, God has expressed His Will for healing. There is not one example in the Bible where a person sought healing and did not receive it. Christians need to know what The Word says about healing. Some say, \\"Well, Jesus just healed to show people that He was the Son of God.\\" Ah, don't people need to see that today more than ever?

And, no it wasn't only when commercials came on - it is continuous. Unfortunately for us I did not do any sort of research before purchasing the tv. Now that I've put in a couple of searches on this tv, I see that I wasn't the only person who had issues with the sound. It seems to be the #1 complaint on this model. It is unfortunate because Westinghouse is a good name brand. We did return this set and purchase a slightly more expensive model that is not a Westinghouse.

They're designed to be used with a stereo or surround sound system.I am updating this review today, Jan 1, 2013 to indicate that approx 1 yr ago every time the tv was turned on, the screen wouldn't come on for a few minutes. As time went on it got worse (after a few minutes of the screen being on, it would go black) so I just left it on. About 4 months ago, a big dark spot (about the diameter of a soda can) appeared in the upper left corner. About 1.5 mos ago, the tv died completely.

In that book, two very respected authors reveal to the world that the modern incarnation of Wicca is, in fact, a combination of the two separate religious and magical styles: Druidry and Witchcraft. So, if Druidry and Witchcraft have already been combined to form modern Wicca, why combine the systems again? If you wish to combine the systems of Druidry and Witchcraft without reading through tome after tome of Celtic Wiccan fluff, read about the two separate systems and combine them yourself.

Yolanda, a good student and a formidable presence (though not always well-liked by her peers), decides that her younger brother Andrew is a musical genius. Andrew's playful music is beautifully described and seems to leap off the pages into ones ears. Yolanda is a strong and unique character, flawed but always likable.

Their mother decided to move when Andrew got a packet of cocaine from school. They moved to Michigan where Yolanda was bored out of her wits by the calm lifestyle. Andrew, unlike Yolanda, did very badly in school, but he loved to play the harmonica. He could play anything. He could reproduce he sound of voices, food, people, moods, anything. Then one day something happens that changes everything for Yolanda and her family.My favorite character was Yolanda because she is kind to her brother, and makes him feel important .She respects him and thinks he is a genius.I would recommend this book because it is funny and fun to read. It is also exciting like when Yolanda beats up a kid and sad when her brother's harmonica gets squashed by a mean seventh grader.

The strong willed Yolanda tries to convince her mother that he is a musical genius because of the amazing music he is able to make with the harmonica that was from his father when he was two. Nobody believes her because her brother is not very good in school and after first grade is not able to read. That is not all that the book is about because it also follows Yolanda though her trials and coping with the move, new friends, new neighborhood, and new friends. This book is a great read for the age group, especially for the females.

They were old, ugly, and musically mediocre. I would say it was a fluke that these guys ever became popular. It didn't hurt to cover Shel Siverstein's material either.The saving grace for Dr. Hook was the fact that they never took themselves seriously.

The art of the ministrel of Italian music develops here through delicate sounds and crystalline arrangements, providing the listener with an imaginary journey across time and space in the company of a splendid collection of characters.

The question is, in what way is this story important? Why would people need to learn about this lady's case? It is impossible not to feel sorry for her ordeals and her son's tragic end but it tells little about Italy or even Mussolini. If the idea was to illustrate the degree of repression during the fascist regime, the movie failed to do so. Some degree of repression is the background to the story of this lady whose emotional stability is questionable at all times.Mussolini was a second rate dictator who got his country into a war it was unprepared for. Italy's modest infrastructure was destroyed and the noble values of its young generations was abused and their dreams frustrated.

Mussolini filled that bill. The film also showed Benito's fall into corruption via his relationship with one of his mistresses who foolishly sold everything to finance his cause. She bore him a son whose life ended in the hell of mental illness/insanity. The film was well-done showing the politics of Benito M. and his rapid demise. Interestingly he seemed to represent -- to me -- the current dictator of Italy, Silvio Berlusconi. And that makes me wonder when beautiful Italy will be rid of self-serving dictators. The citizens deserve honest politicians and politics, not degenerate mafioso."},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting bit of (possible) history, but a tedious movie.","review":"Some good, compelling scenes.

Needless to say, I was sorely disappointed in Hasbro's re-imagining of this classic toy. As other reviews have stated, the gears are much too small to properly maintain contact with each other, leading to stray lines across the design as the cog slips out of the form. The alternate shape form that insets into the main form is bowed, so maintaining contact with the paper was difficult for me, so my daughter found it impossible. It was also a good thing I bought a pack of colored gel pens to go with this since the included marker was completely dry. I can't speak for the durability of the toy since it won't be played with beyond Christmas morning. At $44.95, this is the absolute worst value I've spent money on for my child.

I am very disappointed with it!! The template does not fit flush with the table surface and therefore does not securely hold the paper. In addition, the gears are too thin and keep slipping under the template, ruining the design. My son found this very frustrating as it ruined picture after picture and it is very difficult to move the gears and hold the template down at the same time. I gave the durability factor a poor rating as the material is just cheap plastic that will definitely not last long. This is definitely a case of where the old adage that says, \\"If it ain't broke, don't fix it!\\" should have been followed!! The earlier design, though not perfect, was much better and much less frustrating! Save your money and buy something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but with a really dumb design flaw","review":"This would be a nice toy if not for one serious design flaw.The flaw is that the gears supplied are too thin and easilyslide under the main unit ruining a drawing. This happens ifyou don't push down hard on the main unit or use a perfectlyflat, hard surface. The solution wouldbe simple for Hasbro to fix this. Simply make the gears thatmesh at the teeth the same thickness. This would require a flatside and a side with a depression. This would still allow forthe pen to have a thin section to poke through. Alternately,a tapered opening could be used for the pen tip and the geardisk all the same thickness. But a gear that has the samethickness as the main unit would prevent the gears from slippingunder the unit. This is a no brainer fix, but it's doubtfulthat Hasbro will fix it.

Unfortunately in their effort to get more shapes they lost the concept of the original spirograph. I had trouble keeping the main part held down so the wheel that created the art form would not \\"slip\\" and mess up the design. Let alone an eight year to be able to do it. My opinion is thumbs down,bring back the original!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same","review":"This is just not the same. I bought this for my son. Now I am on the search for a different one.

It's funny. It's poignant. It's true to life. A great gift for yourself and a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming of Age - In Mid Life","review":"Told in first person, with lots of humor, but a deep side as well. The big questions come to mind as this 30's something gal consideres a move from city dweller to farm hand, from girl friend to wife. Causes one to ponder about the meaning of love, life and friends. Well written, enjoyable story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!","review":"This book has it all - animals, a farm, the country, love, marriage, and life's ups and downs. What a grand adventure of leaving the city and finding that dream house, er farmhouse, in the country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fifty Acres and a Poodle","review":"This book is absolutely delightful. An easy read. I laughed, cried, smiled and was intrigued with the characters... It's everything a good book should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for those whom love animals and wide open spaces!","review":"After reading these reviews I just had to buy this book and I'm glad I did... ...This is a memoir-style story about how two animal loving people, a mutt and cat loving writer (Jeanne Marie Laskas) and a poodle packing physchologist, (her long time male friend) that begin as friends in the city and end up sharing their lives with each other and the pets they cherish on a 50 acre farm. This is both funny and entertaining, mixed with the realities of life when it comes to losing beloved pets and family. For anyone that thinks animals are people too, you will enjoy this fast-paced and humorous adventure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous book!","review":"Read this book...you will love it! I put it on my wish list because I love reading Jeanne Marie Laskas's articles every Sunday in the Washington Post Magazine. Ms. Laskas writes with such wit and wisdom. You will laugh out loud and you'll be moved to tears. Ms. Laskas really has a gift. I was so sad when the book ended because I wanted more. I hope there will be a sequel. In the meantime, I'm going to share this one with my friends. It's truly a delightful book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great writing, mediocre story","review":"I enjoyed reading this book, but didn't find the story that compelling. The book is beautifully written and has wonderful lines that you will want to read out-loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh! Self-absorbed drivel.","review":"This is the story of a single woman living in Pittburgh. She has deep relationships with her dog and cat which consume a large part of the book. The pets do normal pet things like run and dig. The author also has an older boyfriend whom she wants to marry, but doesn't broach the subject.On an whim they buy a \\"farm\\" an hour outside of Pittsburgh. I say \\"farm\\" because in the 126 pages I managed to slog through, there is no farming. Once at the \\"farm\\" the adventure begins. Wal-Mart is visited for the first time where it is discovered that they have great prices. Hunters and honest mechanics are met for the first time. A satellite dish is installed. Hilarity does not ensue.Ms. Laskas explores her thoughts and feelings about this move, but there are no real insights here. Little is to be learned."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book stinks","review":"This memoir was self-indulgent and annoying, the tale of an urban woman and her boyfriend buying what was essentially a very large yard and calling it a farm, apparently in their mind becoming \\"farmers.\\" It is so stupid, and so insulting to people who actually do farm for a living that I felt compelled for the first time to share my views on a book to urge people to avoid it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined","review":"Hi. I liked this story. The writer did a great job of telling it. One problem. The main character repeatedly uses the word \\"Jeezus\\" as a cuss word. Like if it's spelled diffently God won't know. It ruined the whole book for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could anyone be that clueless?","review":"The unbelievably clueless move to the country where they continually display an uncommon lack of common sense and the apparent inability to plan ahead. It was funny at first, but I wasn't laughing with the author, I was laughing at her. By the time they moved to the country I was hoping some hunter would accidentally shoot her and put me out of my misery. I literally threw the tape out of my car window."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech.","review":"This book was well written and quite interesting with a good, solid premise and believable, dynamic characters. So, why didn't I like it? First of all, I didn't really like any of those characters, no matter how well-developed and genuine they were. The premise, which is that an unbelievably fat, disgustingly rich emotional vampire pairs up two very damaged people so that he can get a thrill off it when their relationship implodes, made me mildly queasy. The world-building was excellent, probably the best part of the book, but each of the disparate scenes (a low-rent tenement, a high-class restaurant built on the outside of a dome, the South Pole resort, the Moon Carnival, the high-class hotel on Titan) seemed cold and sterile, despite being imaginatively described. All in all, not Silverberg's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"The turning point for Robert Silverberg","review":"After making his mark with a series of clever but callow science fiction novels, Robert Silverberg set out to transform his work (and, by example, the entire genre) by holding himself to higher literary standards. Thorns was the first Silverberg novel to reflect this renewed dedication, and while parts of it have aged badly -- the science behind Lona Kelvin's fertility experience is no longer novel -- it remains a bracing, hard-nosed read. The idea of using mass media to manipulate weak and vulnerable people has, if anything, become more timely with the rise of \\"reality\\" shows. A watershed novel in Silverberg's career, and a must-read for anyone interested in seeing the best SF has to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Collection","review":"From Dr. No to Quantum of Solace, and even a slot reserved for Skyfall, this collection is amazing! Now that they are all available in one set, and not those outrageously priced 3-per-set editions, I finally upgraded my old DVDs. The movies all look stunning, and the HD surround is great. The special features give great insight to the movies. This collection will be one to cherish for many years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have","review":"If you're a James Bond fan, you must have this package.All the films, and even there's a space for you to place the Skyfall disc when you buy it (sadly, it doesn't come with the bundle).I was expecting more from a collectors version (a booklet at least), but overall, it is a nice and great item to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"This is a perfect gift for a Bond movie lover. Comes with two book style inserts that have pictures from the film as well as the disc. The have even left room for a Blu Ray for when you purchase 'Skyfall'. I got this set at the $99.99 price during the christmas season and by far was the best price you will ever get for 22 Blu Ray discs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous Storage Container","review":"I, for one, would not consider ordering this set, regardless of price. The container wouldn't fit on any normal storage shelf and, having handled it first hand, the discs are very difficult to extract without smudging them. I don't think much thought went into the design of that container. Since I already have some of these films on Blu-ray and don't necessarily like them all, I will wait until they are separately available at a good price and buy the ones I want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bond 50","review":"Another thing I got for my son -- he will love it, and SkyFall when that comes out.

Do not buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice collection","review":"This is a good collection for all the Bond movie lovers. The set is well designed and packaged. I watched 4 movies so far starting from Dr. No and the Blu Ray quality and enhancements were pretty good. I'd recommend this to any Bond movie lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but could have been better.","review":"As a set to honor Bond for 50 years its not bad. Some of the film transfers look better than others, but the bonus disc is a joke. I think it was under an hour of new material. Seeing that Sony, MGM and Fox worked together on this we could have had additional extras like the 50's TV version of Casino Royal included, or even the two unofficial Bond films. The 67 Casino Royal and 84's Never Say Never Again.The extras for the Brosnan films is pretty slight, most of the extras from the first issue of Die Another Day are not included."},{"rating":"2","title":"A review of the blu-rays and not the movies","review":"We all know these movies to this is not at all about the movies. Some of the blu rays have commercials (the newer ones it seems) that you are forced to watch. This is absurd. I have the old special edition DVDs and there were no preview ads at all. This infuriates me. Now for the real reason this set is not a 5 star. The audio track is only DTS-Master Audio 5.1. I have a 7.1 system and this is what blu ray was made for. I understand the older movies being 5.1 but not Casino Royal or QoS. Those should really be 7.1. The picture quality on the movies is excellent to the point where you see how cheesy the old movies are for the actions and stunts. Its very laughable but I do not care. I love these movies. At $150 it is a solid buy at the black friday for $100 it is a steal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bond 50","review":"This review is by a fifty-something male who has watched all the Bond shows previously. Some salient points I'd make are:1. I bought the DVD collection for about $100, so the cost per movie seemed acceptable.2. Show quality was good.3. Nice to have them all together, even the Roger Moore ones.4. Interesting to watch through the series how the Bond character evolves from the suave, rump-spanking chauvinistic character of the sixties (Connery) to the damaged-goods sensitivity of the \\"new millenium\\" Bond (Craig).5. The singular irritating thing that the producers of the DVD did was to make the audience endure a short commercial touting the Bond series, as well as the FBI warning. You can't bail out early. How f_______ irksome! Why advertise what we have already bought?6. I'd still recommend the purchase despite the forced commercial."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"My husband was more excited about receiving this gift than any other in the history of our 45 year marriage!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection for Bond Fans","review":"I loved this collection. It came relatively quickly, even though I purchased near the holidays. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was that the discs were kind of difficult to get out of the holders.

The packaging is top notch. The big \\"Flip Book\\" give a beautiful appearance. Each page has a nice pic of that eras Bond, along with the release year next to each movie. One of the best things about this is they actually left an empty space for the new Skyfall disk to be inserted."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for any Bond fan.","review":"Great content and has so many extras it will keep you watching for hours on end.

Will comment again when others are checked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dipping again","review":"These guys, i believe its MGM is the responsible party, are criminals. How many times have they double dipped these movies? There was i think three DVD versions, ON blu ray They released three box sets with 9 of the movies and then stopped, i assume due to their financial difficulties, although why you would stop producing one of the things you KNOW is going to sell seems a questionable decision. Anyway when they finally get solvent again they Dont finish the previous sets and try and make us buy the 9 we already bought on blu ray again? Im done with them. I already have the 9, there are 7 more available through walmart or because they were the newer daniel craig ones. I bet you they will eventually release these all individually after they have ripped all the hard core fans for a year or two. Dont give them more money."},{"rating":"2","title":"25! 25!","review":"The deal is good, even though there may be better, now or later, and even though incomplete. . But . . . There are 25! Not only Never Say Never Again (remake or not), but the 1954 Barry Nelson version of Casino Royale, and even the 1967 parody. So it's a parody: All of James Bond is a parody of real spies. The idea that any should be excluded as \\"unofficial\\", or made by \\"outsiders\\" is unacceptable. So Connery did Never Say Never Again for money? What were the others done for? Egoboo? Bond is \\"made\\" by his enemies very early. So what's this \\"secret\\" agent bit? If the badgize had half an ounce of sense, Bond would have gotten it between the eyes the first time he fell into their hands. I love all the Bond films, but get a grip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift!","review":"Cannot wait to give this gift this xmas.

Have read some reviews about difficulty getting tne dvds out of the set really not an issue. You just have to very slightly bend the pocket ever so slightly and lift the disc out. Would rather have it that way than risk having the disc fall out,so it's no issue for me. The quality of the movies are excellant even the earlier movies. I have watched four so far. I like having a space for the latest bond movie Skyfall. Have read some reviews saying all of the films not included.The two mentioned are the Original Casino Royal with Peter Sellers and Never Say Never again with Sean Connery. They should not be included because neither are Broccli Films nor MGM. Have to be bought separtly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Package BUT","review":"It is a nice set for the money but missing Never Say Never Again which regardless was still a James Bond Movie even though MGM may not have had their fingers in the till for it.

The package is great and has a spot for Skyfall. The films look great but there is not very much that is new here.

If your not fanatical, you might just want to purchase your particular favorites and avoid the ones your not crazy about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth it to buy!","review":"This collection has made my Husband very happy since he loves The Bond Movies.

You know about them unless you have spent the last 50 years on Mars.The restorations produced a clear picture. Doctor No has a special feature on how this was done.They show some pre/post clips illustrating the differences.The set has almost no information about the movies and special features. Title and some names are what is available.No movie length or what special features on the discs is given.There is a slot for Skyfall in the second album.

A must for James Bond fans as you get all the James Bond movies with the exception of Never Say Never Again starring Sean Connery which was not made by the producers of all the other James Bond movies! Not sure of the details but I know they weren't happy when Sean Connery promoted and reprised his role as James Bond for one last time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great tribute to the Bond franchise","review":"MGM UA did an outstanding job on this Blu-Ray release. Really classy packaging, and every movie is packed with loads of extra features. If you are a James Bond fan, you deserve to have this in your collection. Lots of great movie moments here, even though some of it is a bit cheesy I still love it because I grew up with these films. Can't beat the price either. If you bought each of these individually it would be a lot more expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks great on blu ray!","review":"Started out with the old Bond movies.

I have seen about 15 of the 22 now, and all of them have been fantastic. The only complaint I would propose is the fact that the cardboard holding the discs will see some wear and tear with frequent viewings of each film. The discs are not that easy to get out and get back in.

I was all hyped to purchase this set until I saw some unboxing videos of this set and it represents a major fail on the part of FHV because this is the same cheap and shoddy packaging that they used for the Star Wars Complete Saga set. It's too easy for these disks to become scratched and damaged and FHV did nothing to ensure that the quality of these disks would not get damaged.I gave this review one star because of the cheap packaging. Nice try, Fox Home Video, but we expect quality packaging, not the cheap packaging that's present in this collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor packaging and shipping","review":"The packaging for this release is predictably terrible.

The set includes 2 sets of books, each containing film releases from 1962-1981 ( book 1) and the second book is from 1983-2012.The bad side: well there is 2 -> one it doesnt include never say never again which sean connery starred in and 2nd its very difficult taking out the disc without somehow scrathing it. The blu-rays are really snugged into the sleeve where you have to kinda of pull it out and it causes some minor scratches. I give it a 4 star becuase of this reason. But dont worry,,,blu-rays are very durable compared to dvds and cds so minor scrathces wont affect play.....Overall its a must have and im happy with it and i only paid 130.00 plus tax so i got a good deal on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for the Bond fan","review":"The Bond 50 Blu-ray collection is the definitive boxed set for all Bond fans. It contains all 22 films from Dr. No to Quantum of Solace (and with a space for the Skyfall Blu-ray when it comes out).Quality of the remastering is excellent, especially for the old films, which look sharper and clearer than it's ever looked.My one gripe is that the hardback books which actually house the discs make the discs a little hard to remove, and I can see that the paper may tear if you're too rough with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The packaging is great, but many of the movies are not","review":"I forgot how many bad Bond movies there were until I bought this set for my son.

However on Bond, they had the 3 packs, which I avoided, but then they started releasing them individually (about half of the series) or so, so I figured it would be a two phase thing. Of course, no, this time they roaylly screwed me as I have all the ones already available and have been waiting patiently for the second half to be released with favorites like On Her Majesty's Secret Service, The Spy Who Loved Me and Octopussy...

I paid the full 180 for this with the book instead if the 150 discounted price that didn't have e book with it. The book is only 70 pages and abridged. The full book is less than 30 bucks and I could have had both if I'd just canceled my order and got the cheaper set and book seperately.Other than that I have no complaints. The case is sturdy and, with a little practice I can get the discs out of the sleeves unharmed. I like having the slot for Skyfall but don't know if I want to really use it when the film comes out. The movies look excellant in HD. I've already watched all the ones previously available so I am starting with You Only Live Twice and the video quality and sound are first rate.If you have all the previous Bond Blu-rays sell them to get this set (except for Casino Royale 2disc Blu as it has some features not found here).

Pan Sonic provide just the right edgy, noisy background/foreground(as it shifts before our ears!)to frame Vega's poeto-angst-rant. When I first heard this album I was transported back to the bad old days when walking down the streets of the Lower East Side was an exercise in fear, ears perked up, sensory equipment at full alert. While this album perhaps does not capture that feeling in any sustained way, it is certainly a compelling listen, pregnant with Vega's own brand of downtown horror coupled with a vision of American hubris that is sickeningly on target.

Copies are good and so far I am totally surprised and pleased with this little all in one. Lexmark is known for their expensive inks but this ink cartridge is only $19.99.

I even went to the website to see about the drivers there and the site even mentions that this printer is only for Windows. I like the fact that the printer is lightweight and easy to use but it's totally useless to me if it only works for the Windows OS.

I unplugged it from the wall and plugged it back in, and the cover open message was still there. I called tech support and they told me I needed a new printer. They emailed me a 20% off coupon, that you had to use as soon as you opened it, you couldn't reopen it.

This one refuses to complete the installation. With all the features, it uses USB drive, imaging, Human Interface, scanner, mass storage and storage volume to support it all but only half of them would install and tech support provided little information, discrepant information and virtually no help in getting this thing to run. I have to conclude that Lexmark doesn't care - it's just too cheap compared to their network laser machines. Buy something that has a better record.

Lexmark, you have screwed up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Print quality is awful","review":"Perhaps I got a dud but the print quality is completely unacceptable.

I've also tried a new cartridge but that didn't do anything either.Unfortunately, it's beyond the 14-day Staples return policy so I suppose I'll have to deal with Lexmark now to get this thing straightened out.

When I got rid of that, the printer would not take the paper in the right way no matter what I did to it for a good hour or so.

Also, the power button would not go off unless I unplugged it. I didn't know, before reading all the reviews, that this was a common problem.

It involves removing the lid, possibly removing the scanner glass, reseating a lever rocker switch, and praying to whichever deity you believe in.What was annoying was that I'd used the printer so infrequently that it had been 12 months nearly to the day before I had to replace the first cartridge (I don't print much, and I still have a five-year-old Canon inkjet for heavy printing; I bought this for the copy/scan capability).

I know now after him wearing it that if he wanted one to wear alone--he would want a larger size. It is comfortable and is lasting well.

This album is not the cleanest in sound quality, but it does what live albuns are supposed to do -- capture the excitement of the live date. And the music is good; very good. Far I is of course always hypnotic. This date draws that out perhaps better than anything else I have heard him on. The tracks are long, which means they can set up a groove, and then Far I can just go and go. There is a certain sameness to the material; it's not a perfect album. But a couple of the tracks are of the highest caliber, standing next to the elite of all time in the genre. \\"Brujo Magic\\" will amaze you -- it's trippy, entrancing, and matches a kind of disco-y, ahead-of-its-time spacy quality with Far I's most gravelly, haunting, droning, and chant-like vocal style. A fine purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice addition to Christmas CD collection","review":"The songs do sort of have the Merseybeat sound, and several of the songs have that typical British Invasion theme of boy done wrong by girl at Christmas, no less! Other songs recount happy relationships made even more special by the Christmas season. I like that there is a spiritual message in several songs, as well. Instrumentals are good; FLS has a so-so voice, but I enjoy the cd nevertheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounded Fun...","review":"...but was very dissappointing.

On a beat, I would even argue that it falls under some kind of terms of service violation.The book consists of sideways (landscape) scans of the original book. A baffling decision, to be sure: the reader sees the top half of a book page on one Kindle page, and the bottom half - on another. And they're sideways!But it's even worse, because every page in this book is an image. This explains something I wondered while the book was downloading: why it was 26MB in size. It didn't translate into quality, and at the default size on a regular Kindle, the text is about the size of 6-point type. The fact that it's saved as a raster image means that it's impossible to enlarge the text with the Change Font Size option, and to be legible, every page needs to get zoomed manually.This is horrible, and I feel used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early McBain","review":"This 87th Precinct story like most of the late 50s-early 60s books in the series is short by modern standards.

What makes this CD unique is the remix of themes from \\"The Mission\\", which I have not found in other Morricone compilations. If you like Morricone's compositions and orchestrations, but you don't want to spend over $25 on one of the more expensive compilations available, this CD is definitely a worthy buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bebop","review":"This record isn't my favorite document of Bud Powell's work, but nevertheless it is worth listening to, as Mr. Powell is one of the greatest jazz pianists. George Duvivier contributes a few tasteful bass solos (with equally tasteful comping by Powell), as well as solid rhythm-section work with Art Taylor all the way through. Mr. Powell seems a little shaky with the tempo on \\"Salt Peanuts,\\" but that is the only problem I find on this record. A standout to my ear is the performance of \\"In the Blue of the Evening.\\" I also enjoyed Barney Kessel's \\"Swedish Pastry\\" and Mr. Powell's several compositions (\\"Birdland Blues,\\" \\"Oblivion,\\" and \\"Midway\\"). Mr. Powell deserves much greater recognition as a composer and as a group player, and we all need to listen to his formidable right-hand lines."},{"rating":"1","title":"average at best.","review":"I find it hard to believe that so many people are giving this five stars.

There is only a handful of albums that deserve 5 stars, pink floyd's the wall, and maybe more recently NIN's the fragile and radioheads KID A and Amnesiac. Maybe I just outgrew this type of music or I was looking for \\"old school\\" KMFDM. Do not buy this new if you do purchase this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but that's less than i expected from Sascha & Co.","review":"I'm not gonna say that this album is bad, because it really isn't. But it certainly isn't great. It's hardly average. It's standard output from a dead industrial band. I loved the majority of KMFDM's output over it's 15 years, with the exception of the bland Nihil and the thrash-obsessed Angst. There are a few standout songs on here, like Witch Hunt, Stare at the Sun and probably Torpedoes, but the rest is pretty much filler, sub-standard for Sascha and company. I expected more, especially after last year's fantabulous Adios. No more to be said."},{"rating":"2","title":"A twist of the old with the incorporation of the old","review":"This is definitely the old KMFDM that we use to know and love with their cartoon like drawing, heavy and distinct lyrics and beats, with a definite theme of the album. Some old sounds can be found within the album, such as in the songs Witch Hunt and Rabblerouser. Otherwise, this is a totally new sound with hyped techno mixed in with industrial; a somewhat different band then the old KMFDM. Still, it was a transformation that was expected. There is no definite theme/sound for the whole album, unlike the past KMFDM albums. Overall, its still a great collection of songs, a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth 15 bucks.","review":"When i saw a television commercial for this alblum in a way i was distraught because Kmfdm had always presented a \\"subversive' image, but at the same time i had a slight tear in my eye. Having listened to kmfdm since '95 mdfmk is more than a continuation; it is an evolutionary leap. Kmfdm has always been producing cleverly disguised pop music and let that music speak for itself. this time it has produced a challenging alblum with some marketing muscle to back it up. All in all this whole alblum delivers quality chaos from start to finish. Two Gripes: 1. The song \\"control\\"'s lyrics suggest someone has seen The Matrix a few too many times. 2. Witchunt is the song that they had to write and is thus somewhat predictable but otherwise excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"the future will be synthesized? hmmm....","review":"i too feared that this cd would be merely a continuation of KMFDM's long career, mainly because i thought their albums were getting alittle stale toward the end (but they used more techno beats :)). what i found was a maturation of the KMFDM sound. it was less formulaec, and more experimental. But not experimental in that it was just random noise, no; their style merely loosened up allowing for more messiness and noise blending, but Sasha and Tim's experience gave them the skill to manipulate the newly created messiness artfully. The buzz-saw guitar riffs and crunches melt and fold into the lyrics and beats while the electronic components accent the song at all the right spots. Each part tumbling and rolling into the other. its one big beat blasted bouliabaise. lots of fun. \\"Torpedoes\\" is amazing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring on the noizzzzzzze... (yawn)","review":"It feels like KMFDM are trying too hard here to be erm... run-of-the-mill hard rockers. A disappointing album with great sounds (breakbeats, voice distortions & hard guitar riffs) but it doesn't quite pull it off convincingly. Exceptions are \\"Now\\", \\"Rabblerouser\\" and \\"Hydro-Electric\\". Luckily this was a temporary lapse and they soon returned under their real name with more of the good stuff. Oh, and I missed Brute's artwork on this one. Skold disappointed when compared to his contributions on \\"!@#$%\\" and \\"Adios\\", and Lucia sounded like a bad addition to the line-up. She would later find her proper role in the \\"WWIII\\" album."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow much better than i expected","review":"i must admit that i never really liked KMFDM (maybe with the exception of \\"nihil\\" which is great and \\"angst\\" which was decent). i bought this for about 9 dollars and i thought it was a good deal, even i expected nothing too mindblowing. i was wrong. this album is great. much better than anything KMFDM has done (again with the exception of \\"nihil\\"). very good stuff. much more guitar driven and not as *weak* as some KMFDM stuff. the songwriting is good, tending to great, especially on \\"rabble rouser\\" and \\"torpedoes\\". also, the female vocalist lucia cifarelli, fits in quite well, adding an iteresting aspect to the songs and never beeing obnoxious. this is probably one of the best industrial releases tocome since godflesh's \\"us & them\\". enjoy this great record"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain bad.","review":"Generic techno-industrial beats.

Their KMFDM roots are heard clearly in the opening tunes, but as the CD progresses, the music changes. Torpedoes is a great song, the catchy drumbeat in the beginning snags the listeners ear and doesn't let go until the end of the song. Get Out of My Head is so far from KMFDM it isn't right. The CD has a more mellow feel than expected, and is a wonderful purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"'torpedoes' will not leave your head","review":"i got this one about a week ago, and i have been playing it since then! 'torpedoes' ( a real infectious heavy beat)and 'stare at the sun' are damn good songs, the highlights of the album, and i would have spent the money on those two songs alone. but the other songs are pretty good too! :) if you enjoy KMFDM you will enjoy this, for the style (fortunately) remains very much the same in this new project."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHEDDING THE SKIN !","review":"The end of KMFDM brings a new beginning to another era, hence; MDFMK. There is no doubt that this will disappoint hardcore KMFDM fans but BE WARNED: THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING. Most songs are very similar from ADIOS but still lacks the same essence. Rabble rouser, Witchhunt, Staring at the sun, Gasoline and Torpedoes are worth listening. Heavy beats and electronics yet, of course, we will miss the true KMFDM sound and the usual BRUTE art cover but never underestimate Sascha's skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"The King is dead, long live the king","review":"The idea that people seem to believe that this is really anything different than what we expected from the corroboraters involved is rather amusing. That people would suggest this is a straying from the KMFDM formula is odd. This album is no less KMFDM than any album is. People first said Angst was to guitarry, then Nihil was to different, then Xtort, and so on. If we make a baseline average for the Sascha and Co \\"sound\\" , then no album strays from the baseline any more then the rest, and this is no exception. So should you buy it? Well, how much KMFDM do you have. the more you have, the more you need this to fufill the collection. And yes I enjoy it. But it's not a miracle to me. And I'll buy the next one the day it comes out too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible, Long Live MDFMK","review":"Sascha K. and Tim Skold have redefined the meaning of Rip the System with MDFMK. Each track is amazing. The ones that stand out the most are probably Torpedoes and Witch Hunt. Being a long time KMFDM fanatic, I didn't think anything could compare. Then, I listened to MDFMK and was completely enraptured by the noise. It's music that keeps you in its grip and refuses to let go. Do yourself a favor and BUY THIS CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant","review":"A brilliant composition of electronical art. This album brings new meaning to synthesis. KMFDM shouldve stayed broken up and kept that guitar hidden way.

It's almost a shame that KMFDM didn't stay apart longer, because I would love to see a follow-up to this. Favorites are Witch-Hunt, Torpedoes, and Hydroelectric.

I bought the KA004, the KA005, and the KA404R. I took it out of the box and began to fiddle with the switches and buttons. The back end telescopes out and twists for radio tuning.

I was ten years old when I first picked up the novel and I have accumulated numerous copies over the years. Shaara puts life into the personalities of the men of both armies. Their thoughts and dialogue, though not entirely recorded at the battle demonstrate their personal fears and opinions. Particularly enchanting is Shaara's approach to General Lee. A great hero or a great mistake? Shaara has an interesting approach to both blue and grey. His novel is well researched, but enjoyable to read. For those looking for an introduction to the American Civil War look no further. For those seeking more information concerning the events surrounding the battle try Gods and Generals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"This book is very well written.

I am a life long Civil War buff and have always lamented the dearth of good modern fiction about the Civil War itself ('Red Badge of Courage', also an excellent book, is not really about the Civil War, it is about personal courage and self discovery. The same story could have been told about any war). This book did a lot to fill that gap. The only criticism I have ever had of it, is that it really only told the story from the perspective of the leadership, and not so much from the perspective of the common soldier. Sgt. Kilrain, Chamberlain's first sergeant, gives a little perspective from the ranks, but there is no similar character on the Confederate side."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I read in 1997","review":"Years before I knew about this book, I saw the movie, \\"Gettysburg.\\" It was four hours long and felt as if it were over in an instant.

It was tremendous -- I could hardly put it down, and then my husband started reading it and felt the same way about it. It's interesting that the book, which came first, is so nearly identical to the screenplay. To me, that attests to the quality of the author's writing as much as to the good judgment of the producer and director of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST GETTYSBURG NOVEL IN PRINT","review":"I have never in my life read a civil war novel that was so interesting.

This is by far has the most realistic feel of any piece of literature about the period I have read. A must for all Civil War and History Buffs alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book really let me feel the horror and greif of war","review":"If you at all are interested in the Civil War read this book. The Battle of Gettysburg has became my favorite battle because of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Civil War Novel Ever","review":"This book was the basis for the movie \\"Gettysburg,\\" and it's easily the best Civil War novel I've ever read. The novel covers the battle of Gettysburg, wich each chapter written from the point of view of a different person.We see the battle unfold, with the armies coming together in this quiet Pennsylvania town. During the book, we get a close look at some of the officers of the two armies, their backgrounds and how they reacted to the events.If you want to learn something about Gettysburg, this would be a fun way to get started."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"I couln't put this book down you could feel the pain the joy and allemotions in between of all these charachters. I'm a southerner but I not only felt love for Lee but Michael Shaara showed me love for people like Chamberlin I love this book and would recomend it not only to those interested in the Civil War but those interested in great literature"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable","review":"I really liked the unique layout of the book; how each chapter went back and forth between the viewpoints of Confederate and Union soldiers. Also, I liked how he based his writing largely on the actual words of the soldiers in battle, not by interpreting history books and the like.This was a very good read on the battle of Gettysburg."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST CIVIL WAR NOVEL I'VE EVER READ!!!!!!!!","review":"This is the book you just have to read if you want to know anything about Gettysburg. All of the characters are so well written it's like you're standing right next to them. The well written veiwpoints of Lee, Chamberlain, and my favorite, General Longstreet, tell you just how these people fought the battle. You'll fell sorry for \\"The War's Most Hated Soldier\\" (Longstreet),and get mad at \\"The Man Who Lost Gettysburg\\" (Lee), while reading about Chamberlain's great fight on top of Little Round Top. You will be swiching backand forth from Confedret and Union. The best book in the world, even though it's disliked by Gettysburg park officals for being \\"Too Novelie\\". READ THIS BOOK BUT READ GODS AND GENERALS FIRST!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"brought the agony of war to life","review":"I just finished reading The Killer Angels. What a fantastic book. I have never been a Civil War buff but, this book brought the war to life. It is hard for me, living in 1998, to put myself in the year 1863. However, for a few days I felt like I was there. What a book!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning Novel of Combat and Sacrifice at Gettysburg","review":"This novel won the pulitzer prize for fiction and for good reason. It's superbly written with a keen eye for military and character details. The commanders come alive in this book like in no other except perhaps Shelby Foote's brilliant (non-fiction) trilogy. The movie \\"Gettysburg\\" was based on this novel. If you love historical fiction and the Civil War you must read this fantastic book. The author's son has made quite a career (Jeff Shaara) out of writing a series of novels based upon this one - before and after Gettysburg (which is the setting for Killer Angels). Unfortunately, in this instance, the apple fell quite far from the tree as far as writing capabilities are concerned. Steer clear of the Jeff Shaara books and read the non-fiction histories instead. But, if you need a good/great civil war novel, you're likely to find no better one than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh! How like a angel is man - a murderin' angel","review":"I have visted Gettysburg and taken the tour and all, but I never really understood the big picture of the battle until I read this book. Shaara documents the three days of the battle with amazing detail and clarity.The novel is not a straight chronology of troop movements, so it is not just a boring history book. Rather, it follows the battle through the eyes of several of the most important people during those three days (Lee, Longstreet, Chamberlain etc...). Also, Shaara does a great job describing the underlying reasons why Gettysburg took place - why the North and South were in the town in the first place and what this battle meant to the Civil War in general.Shaara's book is a beautiful account of the battle of Gettysburg, and I recommend it to everyone. You will finish the book with a better understanding of the logistics of the battle, as well as a understanding the underlying reasons of the war itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal!!!","review":"I became totally enthralled with the Civil War after reading this masterpiece. His story-telling style caught me off guard and I absolutely flew through this book. Thankfully his son has picked up the torch to complete the finest historical series I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Be sure to read Gods & Generals and Last Full Measure. I was moved to tears on more than one occasion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful In Audio Form","review":"There have been many wonderful reviews written about this book and there isn't a need for more. However, I chose to listen to the book on CD. The story wasn't just read, but the characters had their own accents and the descriptions were wonderful. Some characters had northern accents, some southern accents, one Irish, one British, etc. Hearing the characters talk and listening to their thoughts and feelings made them come very alive. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves history or wants to have a deeper understanding of the personal aspects and history of the Civil War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not my father's Gettysburg","review":"I ran across this volume purely by chance while searching for a gift for my father-in-law, who likes history and the civil war in particular. I bought a copy for myself to check it out and could not put it down. I loved Shaara's approach of injecting personal feelings and character attributes into the major players, while maintaining the historical accuracy of the events. It transforms the stories of the battles from a history of events to a history of people. These weren't just the dusty icons from my fourth grade history book - these were real men with families, foibles and personal challenges. Men from both sides endured terrible hardships and were forced to do horrific things because they were willing to give everything for their cause. I liked The Killer Angels so much I was compelled to read Jeff Shaara's Gods and Generals, and The Last Full Measure. They were also excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Favorite","review":"Classic and has become my favorite book! Currently reading for a business strategies graduate course. Its amazing seeing the parallels between business strategies and decisions and war strategies and decisions made by General Lee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talkingburg","review":"There is much to like in this novel, but it is my least favorite Civil War. All I remember about it is officers talking and talking. And the descriptions of the fighting have little impact. You never feel the blood and horror. I could care less about the generals, especially the venerated Lee. I want a novel that focuses on the poor grunts who did the fighting and dying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read","review":"I was so impressed with Shaara's classic work that it spurred me to write my own novel about the Civil War. While some of the action was a bit overly condensed, which gave me an opening to write more about Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, the writing is amazing. The Killer Angels is an excellent starting point for anyone studying the Civil War."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a challenge and it's difficult to understand.","review":"I was assigned to read this book, The Killer Angels,over the summer for my sophmore History class. Now, I hate war stories so this is the last book I wanted to be reading over my summer vacation, but my teacher gave rave reviews of the book, so I figured it may not be too bad. I started the book and found it boring and confusing right from the start, especially because I am not too familiar will military terminology. As I read on though, I did find some positive points throughout the story. I enjoyed reading the parts that explained about the soldiers lives and personal thoughts. I thought these parts were interesting and I wish there would have been more instead of all the battle descriptions. I guess that's not really possible though since it's main focus is the Battle of Gettysberg. One thing I know for sure after finishing this story is I would never read this book voluntarilly, but that's just me. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"If history were like this in school, I'd have learned more","review":"I am in no way a Civil War enthusiast, so I picked up \\"The Killer Angels\\" simply because it had won the Pulitzer. Well, no wonder. It is an incredibly rich, cinematic work. I was most impressed with Shaara's ability to get into the minds of Lee and the other officers at Gettysberg without reducing them to shopworn cliches. The true genius of the novel is that it is not about a war, or even about a battle, and certainly is not a polemic on the evils of slavery; it is simply about people we come to care about greatly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Love the story of little roundtop and 300 men charge an ocean of men and won. What a in depth look at a critical time in our history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reading","review":"Very easy to read and an excellent novel all around. Enjoyed the different perspectives in the great battle of Gettysburg."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"An original take on the battle Gettisberg.

A classic that wil be read by future generations."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"just great writing. you dont have to be a civil war buff to love this book. it's about the people"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written retelling of the battle of Gettysburg","review":"The author says he stuck to the historical record except for describing the thoughts of the main characters. The story of a complicated battle is told clearly altho on my Kindle 3G the maps are hard to read. The book would read better if the speculative descriptions of the characters thoughts were shortened.Enjoyable and worth while if you like history"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pulitzer Prize Winner Brings History Alive","review":"I am so glad my book group picked this book. I'm not a big fanof history books; I would not have picked this on my own. It is abeautifully written book about the battle of Gettysburg. I got to know the men,understand their thinking, feel their emotions, smell the trees, taste the coffee, and feelthe weariness. It's an old book; I wish it were required reading in school."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book and a great film","review":"This is a novel that I never would have expected to enjoy but I did. Shaara is a powerful writer in the sense that he effectively puts you inside the heads of the folks that made history at the battle of Gettysburg, especially Longstreet and Chamberlain. If you are interested in the Civil War but haven't done much reading on the subject this might be a good place to begin - the film, Gettysburg, that is based on this novel is also well worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Civil War Novel","review":"I have studied the Civil War for years in school, but they were all dates, statistics, names, not real. It didn't captivate my interest until I read this novel. It is an insight into the Civil War that you can't get from reading textbooks. The author portrays both the generals and the battles in a way that kept me reading until the end. He doesn't have any bias toward either side, which is rare in the Civil War books I have read. A must read for anyone because this is our past in a way that will please all and offend none."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suddenly, I find the Civil War very interesting.","review":"By now every Civil War buff in the country has read this book, and it appears that most of them have reviewed it for Amazon. I'm not a Civil War buff, and I'd just like to add that I was positively absorbed by this book. It's a marriage of conscientious research and remarkable narrative style. To have portrayed the leaders of the Union and Confederate armies at Gettysburg in a way that captures their humanity without lessening their grandeur is a monumental feat of authorship. I bought two copies of this book just so I would have a copy to lend."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a book","review":"What a great book it inspiared me so much!

I know they will be very good also!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If Mystery Science Theatre 3000 did books . . .","review":"Simply horrible! It is filled with cliches and mixed metaphors and did nothing for me on any level. Nothing rings true in this story: not the characters, not the battle, not even the small talk. You'll either laugh or cry, but you'll recognize it as just plain bad. Read it to be amazed that it won a Pulitzer Prize!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was a repeat of Gods and Generals","review":"This book was the same thing as Gods and Generals. Add Damn and hell to every page and you've got The Killer Angels. Jeff Shaara is a much better author than Michael."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy re-enactment","review":"Once in a while I get caught reading a book that I really do not enjoy, but the redeeming quality is their educational value. Like flossing your teeth, while not enjoyable, these books are at least good for you. Unfortunately, The Killer Angels, a story about the civil war battle of Gettysburg, was neither entertaining nor good for me. The writing is cheesy and was meant to be turned into a movie. Here is an example:\\" The rain had stopped, the mist was blowing off. He thought: good.\\" Who summarizes the characters' thoughts with one word? Show us - don't tell us.As far as educational value, the reader does not really get to understand the main characters. The made up dialogue is embarrassingly unreal. There is little analysis of the battle strategy. There is also little reflection on the battle's significance with regards to the whole war. The three day movement of troops is tedious to follow. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks!","review":"I had to read this book for my tenth grade honors history class. I had heard from several other people that this book was outstanding really gettin into the character's emotions, rather than all the factual stuff, like \\"They marched five miles north, turned, marched more\\", and that type of crap. That sounded pretty good to me because I'm not into that type of thing. So I decided to give it a whirl, and see how I like it. I read it, and I hardly got anything out of it. That's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not read this book","review":"I had to read this book for summer reading. I started on August 1, and its the 3rd of september and I am still not done. Why? This book is so boring and so difficult to understand. I have had to look at cliff notes online which are impossilbe to find. I am left completley blank on this book. Reading it was so boring that you dont't want to continue and even if you sit and make yourself read it, you are wasting your time because you dont retain any of the information. I am so upset that we were given this aweful book to read and I hope no one ever will again. If I was given a choice I wouldnt give it any stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero if I could","review":"We had to read this book in English class, and it is INCREDIBLY boring, and hard to even read one page.I do NOT recommend this book.Please, save yourself the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Book Ever written","review":"I despised this book! It was absolutely horrible! It was assigned as a summer reading book and it was just so bad! I enjoy reading books, fantasy, historical fiction, mystery, and even nonfiction! It was really really bad. I never want to read another book by Michal Shaara ever ever again! I never even want to hear or see the words Killer Angels again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable","review":"I was first encouraged to read Michael Schara's \\"Killer Angels\\" by my high school history teacher more than 15 years ago. It remains one of my favorite historical novels.While the book is a work of fiction, it presents the battle of Gettysburg so convincingly that you will swear you are there hearing the gunfire and making the decisions right alongside the generals.The film \\"Gettysburg\\" was, of course, based upon this novel, but the book is far, far better. It's reading I would highly recommend to anyone interested in Civil War history, especially students in middle or high school."},{"rating":"1","title":"The killer Angels","review":"This is a great book for an advanced reader. The book contains great images and realistic scenes. While reading this book a student is most-likely to get confused on the way the book is set up. There is a lot of action in this book and that's whats make it that interesting. However, I would say that this book should be read in highschool because of the way the book is set up and the words are a little advanced. Reading this book has helped me learn a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have an Enduring Work of Art","review":"A writer this good should have had a great editor who could hold his feet to the fire and show him some matters of craft that a few of the best writers of today employ.

With other good books piling up, figured the best way to \\"review\\" Killer Angels was to listen to it on tape while driving on business. Was not disappointed. Previous comments about the READER had given me some misgivings. And yes, perhaps Lionel Barrymore could have been a wee bit better.....but the reading was top notch and faithful to the story.Noticed just a couple a areas where the story dragged just a bit; this was not apparent to me when I was actually reading the novel. Nevertheless, the entire presentation was a great experience, from the prologue to the epilogue.HIGHLY RECCOMMEND this book, regardless of the format. And after you've read it maybe you'll be like me, and visit both Gettysburg and the Maine home and burial site of Joshua Chamberlain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior read","review":"Truly fine novel. Makes the war come alive with characters you can believe in and care about. You will want to read the other books as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Killer Angels","review":"As a self-described \\"History Nut\\" I found The Killer Angels to be the best book about The Civil War I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"on the short list of great historial novels","review":"all the great things said about this book are true. shaara uses fictional storytelling techniques to explore some of the great men of the civil war, and particularly Gettysburg. Lee...Longstreet...Chamberlain...Jeb Stuart...and many others. the end leaves you with the feeling of a great weight on your chest and sadness, but also exhiliration to look so deeply into the hearts of brave men in a terrible war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Historical Account and Fabulously Written","review":"A whole different perspective on the critical battle of Gettysburgh... rather than a dry, historical account containing facts, figures and personnel; Shaara tells the story from the perspective of the handful of key decision makers and influencers of the battle's outcome. In the process, he raises disturbing and fascinating questions, such as: Did Lee lose the battle and the war at Gettysburgh? Were the so-called \\"great generals\\" of the South really great tacticians, or simply brave, reckless fighters who's personalities elevated them more than their military skills? And, as any great Civil War novel should, he addresses the question of why did they fight, and fight so hard? The answers, of course, are as varied and complex as human nature itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye opening","review":"You never realize how amazing these men were when studying history as a subject. What these soldiers stood for, the decisions made by generals, the endurance is astounding. The war these men fought was brought to light so clearly and sacredly by Michael Shaara, what a great writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brought me to tears...","review":"I was incredibly impressed and I was moved to tears. I have not yet read Gods and Generals or The Last Full Measure, but I hope they are equally as good. The Killer Angels was brilliant, a personal-feeling, real-life look at the Civil War, specifically the battle of Gettysberg."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Historical Novel","review":"I generally prefer non-fiction to historical novels, but this book is exceptional. The writing is superb. Mr. Shaara captures the essense of what happened at Gettysburg. The mood and pace of the book are wonderful. If you have any interest in the Civil War or U.S. History read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most definative battle in the history of the United States","review":"The battle of Gettysburg is most likely the most definative battle in U.S. history. It was without a doubt the most important battle of the Cival War. This book gets in the minds of various different commanders from both sides over a three day period. It is extremely interesting to see how different personal descions effected the outcome of this battle. Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of this book is the fact that it outlines ways in which the south could have easily won the war had it not been for poor descions and personal pride at this single battle. Had I read this book in High School I might have been persuaded to seek an education from West Point, to walk the same halls that many of the characters in the book walked so many years before."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get the ratings","review":"I really thought this book was boring. I don't understand how people think this book is so wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiction pretending to be history!","review":"I liked the first page but the rest was boring crap. It would appear to be a simple rehash of Longstreet's self-serving biography written 30 years after the events. If you are interested in a better researched historical account of the events I would recommend Shelby Foote's \\"Stars in their Courses\\". Plus the writing is better as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of time","review":"I don't know what all the fuss is about. If it had a mildly good plot, I might understand.

The novel not only puts you into the bloodiest battle on American soil, but the novel also puts a human face on the well-known characters, as well as staying almost 100% accurate to the real events.* Michael Shaara proves that he is one of the greatest authors of our time. This is a must read for anyone who loves excitement, drama, and history. Followed by GODS AND GENERALS, THE LAST FULL MEASURE, and GONE FOR SOLDIERS, all three written by Shaara's son, Jeff. Grade: A+*Ronald F. Maxwell almost copied the story 100% for GETTYSBURG,the acclaimed film version of THE KILLER ANGELS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!","review":"Everyone needs to read this book!

I think I am now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great account of the battle","review":"This book is a great retelling of the Battle of Gettysburg. There is a lot of time spent introducing the main characters of the battle and some of the events leading up to the battle.The book somewhat focuses on the character of Joshua Chamberlain who leads a regiment from Maine into the battle. Shaara breaths life into all of the characters and handles details of the battle so well, that I did have trouble staying with the story. Some historical novels can get bogged down by details that a reader can loose interest. Shaara's treatment is wonderful and his characterizations allow you to enter the minds of Lee, Longstreet, Pickett, and Hancock.I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the Civil War and/or Gettysburg."},{"rating":"2","title":"the killer angles","review":"this book tells you everything a history major would want to know about what actualy happened in civil war battles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough to put down","review":"With most books I will read a chapter a night.

It's awesome!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Masterpiece","review":"Make no mistake, this is fiction, but historical fiction. The effect is that dry facts come alive as we learn the in's and out's of the battle of Gettysburg. We see the horror of war, the insanity of a country fighting among it's self, and the little moments that turn the battle from one side to the other.I have read this book many times and never tire of it. Even if you don't have an interest in the Civil War this book is something you would enjoy, it provides an internment look at men in war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer Angels","review":"Well written and hisorically factual. Provides the human element to a bloody event in our country's history. Portrays Civil War officers in a different light, especially Lee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding historical fiction","review":"This book fully deserves the Pulitzer Prize that it won. Michael Shaara tells the story of the battle of Gettysburg from the point of view of several central characters to bring the battle, the people, and the times they lived in to life. His son Jeff used the same technique with great effect in subsequent books. Learn history while having a great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Civil War novel to date","review":"The retelling of the Battle of Gettysburg can get rather dull, reading it in a plain history book or hearing about it in class or through television. This book defies the idea of just telling the events. Michael Shaara has taken three influential men from this battle (J.L.Chamberlain, R.E.Lee, and J.Longstreet) and shown us that this was not just one man against another. The Killer Angels describes the real story: the internal conflicts, feelings of betrayal, the desire to do what was right and honorable. Because of this book, no one who reads it will ever see the Civil War the same way ever again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic CD","review":"This is a wonderful CD, a great collection of songs.

He may be categorized as a folk singer or a lite rock performer but he is also much more than that. I first heard Cat Stevens songs when I saw the movie Harold and Maude. His music was such an integral part of the film and stuck so resolutely in my head that I immediately went out and bought one of his albums, and proceeded to buy more as he released them. (All on vinyl, of course. This was the early Seventies). Cat Stevens songs can range from heartbreakingly sad to fierce and proud. The lyrics, the melodies, the unusual and passionate voice all come together to create a unique artist. I'm not one for nostalgia, but amongst the oldies that I still play (Beatles, Eric Clapton, Simon and Garfunkel) Cat Stevens is still on my stereo."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW - Great sound like I remember","review":"I have always liked Cat Stevens. I really enjoyed his powerful voice and wonderful melodies again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Journey back in time...","review":"Cat Stevens was a household name amongst teens in the early/mid 70s. And I admit it: I bought this CD to allow myself to go back in time, back to when I was a 15-year old, when no party was complete without someone grabbing a guitar at some point late in the evening and playing \\"Morning has broken\\" or \\"Peace Train\\" for everyone to sing along.I was struck, however, how even today I am still captivated by Cat Stevens' wonderful lyrics and his characteristic \\"broken\\" voice. Songs like \\"Oh very young\\", \\"Father and Son\\", \\"Wild World\\" and \\"Peace Train\\", to name just a few, still seem to be relevant some 25, 30 years later.Cat Stevens the person may have moved on to different endeavours - Cat Stevens the singer & songwriter has immortalized himself for an entire generation of young people, and this CD testifies to it wonderfully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revisionist History Which Affects the Music","review":"If CS/YI just sang love songs, maybe his politics would be irrelevant to the music. But he doesn't, so it is. Make no mistake, the VH1 and other mumble jumble he's spouted during the promotion for this record is a lot of hooey - he was asked time and time again to clarify his remarks after two book publishers were murdered for putting out Rushdie's book and he refused. Nor has he ever said he *disagrees* with what he was \\"simply quoting.\\" How people can listen to a song like \\"Peace Train\\" or \\"Wild World\\" and force that from their minds is hard to understand, outside of nostalgia or historical interest... (By the way, anyone notice that everybody votes against the negative reviews no matter what they say or how they say it? Fire away!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent music - poor quality CD - skipped 1st time used","review":"I was very disappointed with the quality of the CD. It was skipping from the very first time I used it. I know it wasn't my CD player since the other CD I purchased was fine. Cat Stevens is one of my favorite musicians so I was very excited to get a collection of his best hits. What a shame to receive and pay for an inferior product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sure Sounds Different Now","review":"Strange, but now that I've lost my celestial image of him and see him as the Islamic fundamentalist who agrees with Khomeini's death sentence passed on Salman Rushdie, those same songs that once seemed so innocent and sweet just come across now as being a bunch of pretentious musical gimmicks aimed at the same kind of mass appeal as a TV commercial jingle. The only song I still love -- Morning has Broken -- is just the re-wording of a beautiful old church hymn (Praise of Thanksgiving) of the same tune. I prefer the hymn. Hey, Cat (or Yousuf, if you prefer), if you insist on hurling your thinking back into the dark ages, at least stop trying to market yourself as the New Age hippie we once thought you were. You can't have it both ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why can't we just enjoy the music for what it is? Just music.","review":"I really enjoyed the music on this cd and consider it one of my favorite cds. This collection needs Sad Lisa and a couple of other songs maybe. It is disturbing to see some of the reviews that focus on the political/religious side of the artist. Do you really aggree with the politics or religion of everyone you listen to?"},{"rating":"2","title":"great compilation, didn't miss anything","review":"if you are at all interested in Cat Stevens, you should definitely consider this collection. It puts all of the best work of anything he has done on one cd, it is a very well assembled best of collection without any ommissions that are noticeable. It leans heavily toward his Tea for the Tillerman album, which is considered his best work overall. He made some great music over the years, and though I sometimes find his holier-than-thou philosophy and weird fantasy bothersome, I enjoy the music and appreciate the outstanding contributions this makes to my cd collection. You should definitely get this if you want the most complete collection of Stevens on one cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Highlight of his career.......","review":"Its great to be able to listen to this mans music and thanks to A&M for making this possible. Sure loved so many of these songs growing up as a kid, and although I do not know Cat the Man personally, what he did back then in the PAST should be left in the PAST, we are a country full of causes, and people should just judge his music for its worth and all the hours of pleasure it brought to so many fans. My late brother-in-law really got me into Cat Stevens and everytime I hear \\"Tea for the Tillerman\\" songs, many included in this sampling, I smile and remember, 'back in the ol school yard' of life, rock on Cat."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE this cd!","review":"I was born in the early '70s so I had scarcely heard of Cat Stevens until recently. Of course I do remember \\"Wild World\\" and \\"Morning has Broken\\" from my parents listening but didn't know who the artist was. I recently watched VH1's behind the music about Cat Stevens and I was impressed! The man is a brilliant artist, songwriter and singer. I ran out to purchase this cd immediatly. I can't stop listening to it! My favorite tracks from it are \\"Father and Son\\", \\"The Wind\\", \\"Peace Train\\" and \\"Moonshadow\\". I can't get over how much I love Cat Stevens'/Yusuf Islam's music! I enthusiastically recommend this cd to anyone who appreciates and loves music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every song is great and the mix is even good","review":"Tea for the Tillerman is the must have cat stevens. Once you get that you will want to get this as well. I own only Tea for the Tillerman, this album and Greatest Hits and I feel like that is about all the Cat Stevens anyone could want. If you have cash to sling around then pick up Mona Bone Jacon and Teaser and the Firecat and you will really be in Cat Stevens heaven. He is unique but not in an annoying enya/bjork kind of way. Any music fan will be able to appreciate Cat Stevens, and in my opinion he is more essential to a music collection than even, say, a Bob Dylan, if not even the Beatles. Ok, so maybe not the Beatles, but he is a somewhat overlooked hit machine who never sold out and has produced some of the sweetest music of the last three decades or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for anyone who loves animals","review":"I was fortunate enough to volunteer my time twice helping to take care of the rescued animals after hurricane Katrina.I volunteered thru Bestfriends in Mississippi.It was probably the most satisfying work I've ever done. When I got home I found out about this book and couldn't wait to read it. I cried, I laughed I didn't want to put it down and i didn't want it to end. It made me more determined then ever to visit the sancuary in Utah as soon as I can.It explains how the animal sancuary first got started and all the ups and downs involved in getting it started. I would say to anyone who loves animals this is an absolute must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Honest & Out of Date","review":"Much has changed at Best Friends since this book was written. First, all the old founders are gone, and have been replaced with unknowns, some that have been fired under odd circumstances. Second, Best Friends has NOT succeeded at No Kill at their sanctuary. They turn away animals brought to them, and they have been getting rid of dogs they were committed to care for in large numbers, and are downsizing. Donors aren't aware of this. Also, information surfaced (documented by business records) that the merchandise purchased from Best Friends like Tishirts, mugs, etc. goes to a private corporation that financially benefits the founders, not the sanctuary. Something strange is going on at Best Friends, and there has been a troubling involvement with breeders and breeder groups who don't have the animals' interests at heart. This book is completely outdated, as nearly everything about Best Friends has changed since its publication, and not for the better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and Inspiring","review":"This book made me laugh and cry, and inspired me to tell everyone about the great work they are doing.

When compared to Maury Terry's book, \\"Ultimate Evil\\", you'll see the real true story of the world's most beloved animal sanctuary. According to public records in the state of Louisiana, Best Friends Animal Sanctuary originated as The Process Church of the Final Judgment. Incorporated in 1968, the name has changed several times throughout the years and this once apocolyptic/satanic cult is now a loving animal sanctuary. So leopards can change their spots! Their Articles of Incorporation show the same people still together after 35 years. Too bad this wasn't covered in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU NEED THIS BOOK!","review":"I loved this book, I couldn't put it down. I especially liked the fact that photographs were included in the book, so I could put a face with a name.

The translator should be shot!","review":"This Volume is beautifully illustrated. Unfortunately that is the best that could be said for it. The translation is a travesty, as Mathieu's takes it upon himself to express some of his own \\"artistic expressions\\" by inserting outdated and anachronistic euphemisms from the 60's!

Other than Rigamarole, I thought everything was nice to listen to if i'm just sitting at home reading. However, there was a score that I heard in the movie that i really like, but did not find on the c.d. It was a couple action scenes were shot, and they had a really good score for it.

Randy has really pulled it off with this score, the main theme reminds me of somewhere between a John Barry love theme and one of the funeral songs from the Butterfly Effect. Another highlight to this score is the thick tension it manages to sustain throughout it's entire runtime. I've never even seen the film, but the score really stands out as something amazing. The only reason I gave this score 4 stars instead of 5 is because there are portions that don't quite live up to the rest. For instance, one of the later tracks uses an electric guitar for a love song, and I think it sounds kind of eighties, besides that kind of thing, this CD totally will satisfy any film score lover, and will be spinning in their player for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skulls Soundtrack","review":"I really like this CD, it's very good, the music is haunting. I love the song \\"Taste\\" it's great, but I was a bit dissapointed because there are 2 songs missing, I don't know why. One is the song that plays when Luke steals the tape and the other is Creed's \\"Higher\\". I thought that song would be on the CD also which is why I bought it. There are 2 songs at the end of the CD I don't remember hearing and weren't that good, don't really know what the people who made this were thinking, but all in all it's a very good CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The soundtrack definetly matches the movie","review":"This soundtrack is mainly composed of background music and theme songs. The theme songs provide that spooky and secretive feeling that was simulated in the movie with the help of Randy Edelman and others. If you are looking for that sort of theme music, then this cd will be perfect. -Aside from the themes, there are a few songs at the end of the soundtrack by Lorna Vallings (\\"Taste\\") and BTK (\\"Rigamarole\\" - my personal favorite)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is only the movie score and a few songs from the movie","review":"I saw the movie, and I purchased this CD to get the cool music that I herd in the movie. I am very disappointed in that when I bought this CD it was mostly the movie score which is NOT what I wanted. The score itself is excellent, it's more classical than pop music. The CD did come with four songs from the movie, but they weren't the songs that I wanted. I'm frustrated that Decca Records had marketed this to the 18-34 year olds. This CD is for middle-aged people in their 40-50's who like musical scores. I'm not saying that is wrong. However the movie was marketed for the \\"Internet generation\\" and not the \\"Baby boomers\\". I'm returning this CD and will wait for the \\"Real\\" soundtrack to come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"fair","review":"Book could of gave more information like pace of play, drinking water, customer service, discount for seniors or ladies day information.

In order to continue, you have to buy the Red book which is another $7.99 and then there's the White book which is $8.99. I understand that it is a trilogy but I was expecting each book to have its own history with it's own ending or closure.Anyway I'm about to buy the version with the three books because it's actually cheaper than buying the second and third book...

The biggest problem with it is that I couldn't buy into the other more overtly dualistic dimension that the main character kept going into whenever he fell asleep in our world. It just felt like the author was nakedly pushing his religious views onto the reader. Of course, I guess I shouldn't be surprised since this is 'Christian fiction.' This is the first contemporary Christian fiction work I've read and I have to say that I am disappointed. I could not suspend my disbelief and get immersed in the author's world, especially the fantastic realm with the scary bats. The plot ranged from predictable to meandering and was generally unexciting.If you'd like to read Christian fiction read C.S. Lewis' Space Trilogy or his 'Til We Have Faces. Or read Tolkien or John Milton's Paradise Lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dekker's better than this","review":"While I usually really enjoy Dekker's books this series left me disappointed. The writing is far from captivating (boring is more like it). Like another reviewer noted the main character is just stupid, literally. I made it about half way through the second book and had to stop. Dekker should have cut this way down and made the main character more intelligent since no one that stupid could lead anyone effectively as Dekker tries to portray. Not his best by any means."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended for adult reading","review":"I gave this book 150 pages of my time before I put it down, glad that I hadn't purchased the whole series. I enjoy reading fantasy thrillers, and this was so lightweight that I had to assume it was written for the early teen, 12 to 14 year old age group. Such a disappointment, given how prolific a writer Dekker appears to be. Compared to a writer such as Terry Goodkind.... well, enough said. Buy this for your neice or nephew, but don't expect a rich, sophisticated plot if purchasing this book for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"Great story...keeps you riveted and makes you want more. Also inspires you and challenges you as you look into your own life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Finish It","review":"I bought a copy of this book at the recommendation of my brother. Not even half way through it, I had to put it down. The writing is very simplistic and the novel appears to have been written for young teens. The concept of traveling between two realities through dreams is what attracted me to the material in the first place, but I just couldn't continue with the book. Unfortunately, I purchased Black, Red, and White at the same time so I have thrown my money away. (I need to have a talk with my brother!)I would say for young teens, this may be a fine book but if you are looking for adult reading, think twice before picking this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dekker takes us to new levels.","review":"I have read all of Mr. Dekkers books and this one took me into a new level of reading. Black taunts us with questins about living in reality or a dream world or both. It leaves the reader feeling unfamiliar in a very familiar place. The possibilities exceed the readers imagination. Mr. Dekker let's your imagination and experiences lead you through this book. Every reader will read a different story and have a different ending.At first I was amused by the \\"fuzzy bats\\", however they quickly became life like with personalities and purpose. The fluid relationships were interwoven so delicately you too will wonder which is reality and which is a dream. I hope that all readers will dive into the water and experience the ultimate. I can't help but believe that if Edgar Allen Poe, William Shakespeare or Ernest Hemmingway were alive today they would be avid Dekker fans.

There's a conflicted romance, a paradise that's threatened, the world as we know it facing devestation, an evil drug company tycoon (how appropriate in today's world of hyper-inflated medicine costs?), and a wannabe novelist who becomes a reluctant hero. The pacing is intense, but deliberate. The descriptions are incredible--and yet I wanted so much to believe them.

Don't get me wrong, it was a good book, but not 5 stars good, probably only 3 1/2 stars good.I'm a fan of \\"The Matrix\\" and \\"LTR Trilogy\\", so I'm not being picky. I think it was the it was presented that I couldn't get into it. It took me a while to get past the \\"dream\\" thing and how silly the \\"future\\" world was. Once I got past that and got over how silly it all sounded to me, the book took off in the middle somwhere. At the beginning we were flashing back and forth to the realities so quickly, I got discouraged. But, I pushed through and finished the book just hours ago.Originally, I wasn't even going to finish it and definately wasn't going to read the second book, but I'm giving it a try. I'm hoping Red, the second one, is better. If it isn't, I'm done with Dekker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Reading - a worthy new Trilogy in the making","review":"This was fascinating reading - a story that is well developed, imaginative, and thought-provoking.

What an imagination Ted Dekker has! The plot was unique, the characters outstanding, and the meaning a lot deeper than the surface story. You won't be sorry you read this book. I'm so glad we won't have to wait a year for each of the remaining books in the trilogy - they are both coming this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting plot","review":"I think this book has an amazing plot. I really do love the concept of falling asleep and waking up in another reality. The thing is, plot doesn't make a book. While the story he's telling is great, Ted Dekker's writing style is just terribly simplistic. One of his descriptions is something like \\" it rumbled like the jet fuel underneath a rocket ship\\". I've heard a couple times his writing is disappointing, but I didn't expect anything like this.If I was 11 and read this book I would have loved it. However, I'm a little older and know that just because a book has an interesting plot, doesn't mean it will be good.I suggest buying this book if you are under 14 or if you aren't picky about the quality of writing a book has to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, on time","review":"No actual wear, but paper aged a bit more than expected.

I felt it was cheesy and at time found myself fast forwarding a bit as it got too boring.

Well aware it had religious undertones, it just was too flaky for me, although for others it might have been perfect.

They didn't put a black bar over them or strategically hide them, they actually removed them. So there's just an empty space there - and it looks _really_ strange. They also made sure you don't see much of the woman's genitalia or backside, either. So basically this consists of the couple demonstrating various positions without actually showing anything except them sliding around each other.

I was actually fooled into thinking the real-time into was a pre-rendered cut scene. The character design is really good, the story is interesting and has depth. The sound and effects are great. The only problem is that you spend 20% of the time playing the game and 80% watching the cut scenes, which you can skip but then have no idea what's going on in the story. The actual play scenes are fun, but do get a bit repetitive as they have the same 'hack everything to pieces' goal and your character doesn't seem to progress in any way (new weapons, skills, etc...) It's a lot more like a movie than a game, which is really unfortunate as it's obvious a lot of talented artists and programmers put a lot of hard work into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"There is nothing to do in this game its very redundant.Its only fun for 30 or so minutes...It is way too short also...But it is very detailed,like when you swipe your sword on the wall the sword will bounce back and make a spark and most games just have the sword go through the wall...The graphics are very good.The gameplay is ok,the guy swipes the sword fast as hell,the bosses are easy,or most of them are.I reccomend buying this game if you wont get tired of stuff and like a lot of bloodlust."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good scrolling fighter!","review":"I rented this game and beat it within 4 hours, it was quite hard in some parts but not quite challanging.

By the cover art I was like okay this game looks a little ghetto..But I went with an impulse and bought it anyway. When I got home and started playing through the mix of animated story line and sword hacking through bodies I almost canceled everything for the day to play this game. It has an incredible story line that makes you go ahh and awesome fighting with blood squirting everywhere that makes you scream with blood thirsty joy. From the makers of Legacy of Kain, this game does not have all the insane puzzles that Kain did. This game makes up in bloody fighting that Kain lacked in. Overall this game is great. The only two bad things are that the replay value will probably be low and the controls at some points make you angry that you can't kill that stupid dog biting your leg. If you love blood then I highly reccomend this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raining blood!!!!","review":"This is a great game! You run around with this huge sword chopping monsters in half in hope of saving your girl and trying to something so this guy can find a cure for the parasites in the people that make them monsters. You can hear the bone crushing sound as the sword slices thru the crazed monsters. If you get hit allot or hit people allot, a red meter goes up, once it is full, you are GODLIKE, you swing twice as fast and hit twice as hard, and almost always chop whatever creature you are hitting in half. In a very short time, the meter will go down, and you will be your old self again. In the time that your meter is red when you chop at the enemies they explode in half, Raining Blood!!! This sword is almost longer than he is, and Guts' is a tall guy.

The music is much more tunefull. There are two tunes. A heavy noise and a great tune. The voice is awful but the music makes up for it. I have given it 4 stars because even though the music is good.

I had high expectations for Children of Bodom after reading all the 5 star reviews, but this album is a letdown. Yeah, the musicianship is spectacular, technically speaking, with the guitar work being a real highlight and very good drumming too. But there's just no drive or power to the music, it's very thin and slicing instead of gut pounding. The keyboards are annoying and don't add any atmosphere. The singer's black metal vocals are incredible, I just wish he would stick to them instead of alternating with this embarassing half-ass would-be death growl that sounds more like a cartoon monster voice. There's also a lot less darkness than their image leads you to expect. Overall they seem more like a heavier version of Stratovarius than any death or black metal band. I'll pass on their other albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didnt even get it","review":"I didn't even get the item at all.

The band really starts to figure out what they're doing on Hatebreeder. As a whole, I find Hatebreeder is a bit weak. Not technically, not at all, but just not heavy enough, not enough of Bodom's signature hatred and terror. The album is inconsistent in that sense, but a couple songs break through, like Silent Night Bodom Night (one of their best songs ever), Downfall, Cowards Dead End and Bed of Razors. There is a cover of Aces High on here that doesn't do much for me. I know it's a tribute cover, but it doensn't work. Bruce Dickinson is one of a kind, that's all I'll say. I was expecting an album called Hatebreeder to be searing, but instead, you only get a 1st degree burn. This is due to too much neoclassical styling which downplays the construction of riff-driven leads, and emphasizes long runs of 1/8th notes. Regardless, if you have an hard on for COB, this album is essential to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums by Children of Bodom.","review":"One of the best Children of Bodom has released, \\"Hatebreeder\\" is a fast, hard-hitting album.

You can't critize this band for lacking diversity, as their albums all have a unique sound.

This is one of the best albums i have ever heard. When my friend showed me COB, i first listened to Bed of Razors, and that has become my favorite song ever since. Each song is heavy and loaded with doublebass, and amazing guitar and keyboard solos. There aren't that many songs, but each song is pretty long, and they are all great. Nice dark lyrics. This is definately the best COB album there is. I brought this cd once, and my friend accidentally broke it, so i bought it again later that day. That is how good this cd is. The only song i don't like on this album is...NONE OF THEM!! Every song is great and you will want to listen to them voer and over again. My favorite song is Bed of Razors, but also dont forget to check out Towards Dead End, Downfall, Black Widow, Children of Bodom, Wrath Within, and Silent Night Bodom Night. You know what? Just listen to each song and you will se how great they all are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Approved.","review":"The dueling guitar/keyboard solo on 'Hatebreeder' itself is worth the money. Along with that, 'Warheart', 'Bed of Razors', 'Black Widow', and 'Downfall' are also ass-kicking songs.All it took for me to fall madly in love with this Finnish f_ckers was a sample off of Follow The Reaper's 'Hate Me!'.

Newton sounds terrific on the CD, but most of the songs sound dted, with the exception of the timelss version of \\"Angel of the Morning.\\" This is a good CD for people who collects 80s compilations, but if a good repesentation of Newton's hits is what you want, check out \\"Anthology,\\" which was just released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angel of the morning","review":"Great album!

I remember it gave me goosebumps. So I was browsing through Amazon and came across this greatest hits cd and figured it was time to update the handful of vinyl albums I own. This cd has all her major hits and its great to hear that marvelous voice without all those pops and clicks of my old vinyl. And it may just be my old ears, but I swear the songs on this cd sound like re-recordings...not the originals. I could be wrong, but I've heard Heart of the Night hundreds of of times and on this cd, her voice sounds just a shade older.

Otherwise, the tub was convenient to store the powder in since I only used a little bit at the time.Also, I added some sugar under the advice of a hair stylist friend to help my results.

The graphics are good, the sound is very good even though the actual wrestler's entrance themes were not in the game, but the music sounds similar to the real themes. The list of wrestlers is quite extensive and the gameplay modes are the same. The wrestler entrances are pretty good, but there are a few wrestlers that have a goofy awkward walk. Some of my gripes are Sandman is not in the game, it is very hard to unlock wrestlers such as Taz, i wish they had entrances during the hardcore, cage, and barb wire match, and I think the Career mode needs some redoing. Overall I liked the game, it is basically the same game at heart as WWF Attitude, but if you are are a wrestling fan I suggest you pick this game up....you will have a good time playing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS GAME","review":"I bought \\"ECW Hardcore Revolution\\" back in December hoping that it would live up to all of its hype.

They said they don't sell just the bearings, only the base which was about $60 shipped each. I feel this is unacceptable.

I feel that anyone who didn't appreciate this book must be homophobic and that's sad in such a diverse society that we all share.

It truly covers every topic: anatomy, disease prevention, and further reading/viewing, etc. However, the details are somewhat vague. Everything is \\"either/or\\", and certain sections tend to repeat themselves. The illustrations are very helpful but there are only a few. Overall, it was useful and explanatory, and I am satisfied with the book. Due to its breadth and ground-up approach, I think this book should be owned by all, not only those interested in oral sex."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book, could use more images","review":"There is a thin line between using visuals to aid and using visuals to turn-on someone -- a book about sexuality should try to straddle that line well. Violet Blue has good tips and suggestions along with well-researched physical information. However the images, while nice, could be more numerous especially for beginners who may fumble over some of the terms and descriptions. There needs to be a bit more in the book about how to get someone comfortable with doing down on (...) the first place; social conditioning and past experiences can be a big reason why someone refuses (...)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graphic, but educational","review":"This book is instructional and informational, and approaches the subject from many perspectives.

Unfortunately, the book didn't teach me anything I didn't already know about fellatio.

Boulez is not my favourite Mahler interpretor but in this one he is more than good - he is great. The Fourth is surely not the most problematic of all Mahler Symphonies but is very common that conductors see it as a \\"Mahler\\" symphony (with whatever this may carry with it...) and trying to make it something it's not. Boulez reading is well paced and the playing is marvellous ( The Cleveland Orchestra has given us what I consider the best Fourth - Szell's Fourth).

I had to sweep every time he used the box. Perhaps it works for some cats, but not for ours. I, too was very glad that they offered the free bag rebate. Advice is to not buy too large of a bag.

I am so glad it was free because I think it was a 9.00 bag and I would have been upset had I paid for it since I had to throw it out almost unused."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tracks Dust ALL Over the House","review":"While World's Best does the job in terms of odor control, and does last a long time, after just 3-4 days, the litter crumbles to such an extent that it is like a powder, which sticks ALL over my two cats' paws and gets tracked all over the house, into my bed, and leaves a fine dust over the carpets. This happens even though I have a rug just outside the box to catch the worst of it, and sweep the room around it almost daily now. Each time, the dustpan is full of this powdered litter. The crumbling disintegration is part of what makes it flushable, I guess, but it also makes it unusable for me. I'm going to try the Healthy Pet litter, which comes in solid cellulose balls, so shouldn't crumble all over the place. It's also flushable, cost just $6 a bag, and has five stars here on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I'd discovered it sooner.","review":"I had been using traditional silica-based scoopable cat litter for years despite some reservations about its potential harmful effects on my and my cats' lungs. I just assumed that the alternatives would be far less convenient. But I actually prefer this product both in terms of quality, convenience, and environmental concerns. It has a pleasant and very mild odor and just \\"feels\\" more benign -- the thought of breathing or even ingesting it doesn't trouble me. It took my cats a day or so to get used to it, but I breathe easier (literally and figuratively) knowing that it is nontoxic and environmentally friendly. Although it doesn't clump quite as firmly, it is lighter hence easier to scoop, and doesn't seem to track quite as much. Great stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MITE INFESTATION FROM THIS LITTER","review":"I have used WBCL for about 6 months because it is more environmentally friendly than clay litter. until now I have had no complaints. However, yesterday I noticed what looked to be a layer of dust on top of the litter box, and when I looked closely I realized it was a MOVING LAYER OF MICROSCOPIC MITES. and they are ALL OVER MY BATHROOM. I couldn't tell at first because the mites are very pale and very, very tiny, but once I started noticing them I saw they were covering - COVERING - my sink, toilet, shower tile, floor, TOOTHBRUSH, everything. I am so disgusted. There must have been millions of them in the litter. they seem to be grain mites, from what I can gather online, and I'm not the first person to experience a bug infestation from World's Best Cat Litter. Oh my god, I am never touching this stuff again. If you decide to buy it, BEWARE and keep an eye out for mites!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome cat litter","review":"Reasons why this is the best cat litter1) No more urine smell or ammonia at all! You know how when you get near a litter box it usually smells like urine? Using Worlds best cat litter, there is no more urine smell!2) Clumping is the best. Clumps do not get stuck to the bottom or sides. Most cat litters get urine clumps that stick to the sides and bottoms of the litter box, not with Worlds best cat litter.These reasons alone make Worlds best catter litter the best, I use a lot less litter as well since I am not constantly changing the entire litter box to get rid of the urine smell like I was using regular clumping litter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing \\"Best\\" about it.","review":"I have been trying different litters over the last few months on a hunt for one that clumps well, doesn't end up tracked all over the house, and doesn't reek after our one male cat does his business.Imagine corn bread soaked in day old cat wee, and multiply by at least ten, and you have approximately the stink created by this litter after only a week. (And I do scoop every day!) It takes ages for the clumps to harden, and if you scoop before they do you end up with tiny little balls of funk that fall right through the scooper.After only ten days I threw the whole smelly mess out and moved on to the Dr. Elseys brand, which is nice but I think I will go back to the Feline Pine Scoop after this.Overall, totally disappointed and I can't believe how much this terrible product costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"When Best becomes Worst","review":"One star only, as a warning. I have been using this product for 7-8 months.As long as the weather is dry, this litter is very good (I have 11 cats, they all use it)...BUT, since june, since the weather is humid, it's a catastrophy : the litter sucks all the humidity, melts and becomes a sticky dust that the cats bring all over the appartment.AVOID it only if you're leaving in tropical (like) places. Elsewhere, it's perfectly OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cat hates smell.. Buy a small pack and try it first","review":"Although it clumps well,my cat objected to the smell. I introduced it gradually, but once litter was pure world's best, kitty pooped on the floor instead of in the litter. Switched back to clay and she was fine again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very good litter with one major drawback","review":"I used World's Best for about three years and really liked it for that whole time. It's lightweight, has a pleasant but unobtrusive odor, clumps well, and isn't dusty. My cats liked it fine. In short, I still really like the positive aspects of this litter.(All this refers to the World's Best in the green bag - the other type they sell has a nasty and fairly strong smell.)So why the low rating? Since this litter is made from corn, it's edible. As a few other reviewers have remarked, that means pests may be attracted to it as food. In my case, I discovered mice had invaded my apartment apparently just to get at the litter despite my five cats. Over the years I've also seen roaches around the litter boxes so they may have been eating it too.I like the idea of a green, biodegradable litter, but not if it means mice running across my floor. Ugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dusty","review":"I have a black cat and after filling the litter box with this he came out of the litter box beige. I have never had a litter that stuck to the cats this much. I had to clean him he left dusty paw prints all over. Having that much litter on them that they would later ingest can't be particularly good for their health."},{"rating":"1","title":"P.U.! This is the World's Worst!","review":"Holy Cow! There is nothing \\"BEST\\" about this litter! If you LIKE the smell of cat urine, than this is the litter for you. I have only 1 cat, ONE little cat...and good Golly, this is the worst litter I have every used! This \\"World's Best\\" is truly the world's WORST! After one urination, it smells horribly of cat urine in our laundry room. YUCK YUCK YUCK!!! Back to Fresh Step we go. I NEVER smell my cat's urine with Fresh Step...I use the carbon version along with Fresh Step Crystals, 3:1 ratio and its perfect. I don't have to scoop it out for days, just change out the litter every 3-4 days and NEVER have I had the urine smell or any other smell, just a fresh clean smell."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE TRACKING MESS & ODOR","review":"I must admit it clumped really really well. It had great odor control for about 5 - 10 days and then it smelt soooooo bad. Tracking was pretty gross. The litter ended up all over my room and the dust from the litter left prints on my bed rugs basically everything. This litter is much better than others but you will have to clean up around the litter box a lot! My cat would get this litter stuck in his paws! I must admit it is pretty expensive but if you have a small cat and you buy an enclosed litter box and a really amazing rug/mat you should get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't clump pee","review":"I'm confused at all the great reviews of this product. I've used both the single and multiple cat varieties of World's Best Cat Litter and neither one does a good job of clumping pee (sorry this post is sort of gross, but such is the nature of cat litter). The pee just breaks up and the litter becomes saturated with it until it's so smelly and gives off so much ammonia that you have to change it before the litter has actually run out. The only reason I gave it two stars is because it's biodegradable.For those of you who want an eco-friendly (biodegradable) cat litter that works well, try Swheat Scoop (sp?). It clumps well and helps control smell...I actually prefer it to any other cat litter, eco-friendly or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something is wrong with this picture!!!","review":"How does a company get away with claiming to be the BEST of anything? This is truly NOT the best cat litter. I bought it after given a rebate for a free bag and I'm so glad it was free because I would have returned it anyway. The concept is good; no dust, all natural, safe for septic tanks, no odor. But most of the claims are false and when I read the reviews I was shocked at how many people rated this litter highly. For the most part the odor control is non-existent. The clumping is good but it does resemble corn meal mush and breaks up in tiny pieces when scooped, which takes forever to remove. There is low dust and of course no tracks through the house, but that doesn't make up for the other problems. All in all if you claim to be the \\"BEST CAT LITTER IN THE WORLD\\", you should at least come close which this product does not do."},{"rating":"1","title":"We Needed Bug Spray When We Tried This Litter","review":"I would not advise anyone to try the World's Best Cat Litter. I was pleased about what I read - and was eager to try. I bought 2 of the small bags, saving them for an upcoming motor home trip. Oddly, none of our 3 cats would use the litter box - yet 2 of them crouched outside it, sort of in an 'observation' mode. Decided to look, and took the lid off. BIG mistake - little moths flew out everywhere. I clamped the lid on again quickly and we got the box outside - then made a mad dash for the nearest store to resupply our original brand of litter. So I have no real feel for how the product works - and don't intend to try it again. I also wrote the company twice and received no answer either time. Our advice is Don't Try It."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cat wouldn't use it.","review":"I wanted to get away from using clay, so I bought 2 bags of this stuff. I put a layer of clay on top of the corn litter. It smells like corn, and my cat thought it was food. He tried to eat it, once he got the litter stirred up a little. He used it a few times during the day, then later that evening I noticed he had not used it, he was holding it in. It also seemed to stick to his feet. We made a quick late night trip to the store and bought clay litter. We entirely replaced the litter with clay and he used his box immediately, biggest clump of clay I'd ever seen. I can't recommend this product to anyone, and I'm skeptical about using anything other than clay after this experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"World's Worst Cat Litter","review":"My cat will not touch this litter. If we didn't have two boxes, he would pee all over the house rather than use it. It's made of corn and it attracts bugs, as well.

Definitely will not buy again or reccomend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corn is food, right?","review":"My cat torn through the bag when I brought it into the house. I thought, \\"Oh Boy! This is going to be great.\\" The minute I poured it into the litter box, he hopped in and started EATING it. While it is non-toxic, it is CLUMPING! I removed him a couple times but he went right back to it even though it was clearly sticking in his mouth! I had to empty it right away and rush off to the store for a bag of my previous brand of litter. Crazy."},{"rating":"1","title":"World's Worst Cat Litter","review":"I would rate this 0 if that choice was available. I tried this product this summer when they offered full-cost (sans tax) rebate. My 9 year old cat, who's NEVER had a problem urinating in his litter box suddenly stopped using it (and used my kitchen cabinet instead!). Luckily, I caught him the 2nd day. I was so ?$#* I called World's Worst Cat Litter 800 number to complain. The CS rep told me I should have started using their product by slowly adding small amounts to my old litter.Gee, I must have missed reading that on the bag.Instead of donating the litter to the local shelter I threw it out.

This stuff is really good.","review":"I went overseas for a few weeks and my house sitter purchased a bag of this litter when she ran out. At first I was horrified at the price but after a few days I was impressed. It cuts the odor dramatically and it can be flushed. It actually falls apart in the toilet and goes right down the tubes. After all sorts of big bags and buckets of the cheap stuff, I won't be going back. I had no problems with dust at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY FROM WORLDS BEST!","review":"Where to begin? I had high hopes for this litter as it was recommended by a few fellow cat owners. What a disappointment! My cats hated this stuff so much that one of them started peeing on our living room couch and walls! I have NEVER had this problem with him before. I spent more money cleaning up and removing the smell than I did on the litter. Also, my orange tabby's white paws turned a disgusting yellow color like he had been smoking for 20 years. Horrible at odor control and super dusty. Switched back to my old favorite litter and everything is back to normal. Stay away from this stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It clumps.","review":"It clumps and that is about all it does in which I do like but I don't like the fact that I can be in my kitchen and once he is done using the litter box I can smell the litter when he scoops it over his crap.

I will not purchase this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"barely clumps, smells bad","review":"This does not clump very well, which means that odor builds up after a week or two, because you are not actually removing all of the waste.

It clumps alright, and there's not much dust, but the ammonia problem looms large.

I bought a small bag to try yesterday morning and later that afternoon we started smelling poop in our first floor. Take note: our cat litter box is upstairs hidden in a little cubby hole. I went upstairs and noticed the bad poop smell coming out of my only male cat's litter box. His poop was covered but it was still stinking!!There was no odor control at all!! There was only one poop but I had to clean it right away. Sad to say but I am greatly disappointed :( If it matters I feed my cat Dry food from Blue buffalo that has odor control and never had an issue regarding his poop being too stinky and unbearable.

Java seemed to me as one of the hardest languages to learn when I was 13, but last year when I got this book (I was 15 then), I was able to master Core Java and basic AWT/Swing in a matter of weeks (3 to be precise).

I was still hoping that Corky would appear in this book as an adult and help everyone deal with the evil...The thing that I find most idiotic about this book is how the evil comes back. Apparently Corky left a box with instructions on how to awaken the evil in a gym locker. What I'd like to know is WHY Corky would leave something so dangerous like that inside the school where anyone could find it and bring the evil back. She should have buried the box somewhere, or burned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Corky?!!!!","review":"I enjoy R.L. Stine, but this was his worst book ever.

Trust Me, it's worth it!!!P.S I acually give this Alive IV 4.8 stars out of 5. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The formula doesn't work here","review":"I feel let down with this album. Paul and Gene's voices are coarse and out of pitch; Tommy's guitar playing lacks the groove of Ace's playing; Peter's drumming has been completely muffled by the orchestra and the bass. (And perhaps rightfully so)And the orchestra--they make KISS's music a complete joke.This album is more Beethoven than Rock'n'Roll Over, with really bad singing on top of it. The orchestral accompaniments are out of touch with what works and what doesn't with Rock'n'Roll music.Also, did I mention that this CD has a whopping FIVE ballads, back to back?BethForeverGoin' BlindSure Know SomethingShandiMy recommendation is: do not buy this album, it does little more than line Gene Simmons's moneybags."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"A lot of us thought at first, \\"Symphony\\"?? LAME!! NOT SO!!! I was greatly disappointed when I found out that the original Alive IV was scrapped, but this is a great sounding album. The symphony adds so much to these great classics. I am a huge Ace fan myself, but he chose not to participate and Tommy Thayer does a fine job of keeping the Kiss vibe intact. Don't deprive yourself of this disc because Ace isn't on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something new from Kiss that's not a compilation!","review":"However this thing falls flat on it's face for two reasons; Peter Criss' subpar drumming and the precense of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra/Ensemble. Kiss music was at it's best simple and had a no-nonsens attitude about it. Here are a bunch of classics, first Kiss go themselves, then a minor input comes from the orchestra and the second disc is extremely annoying to listen do, due to the disturbing noises from the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra in the background.I would have preferred the original version of \\"Alive IV\\", which was to be released prior to their \\"Farewell Tour\\".Absent is Ace Frehley, but I couldn't care less.The packaging of this limited version is great however and the majority of the songs are excellent - no less than 7 cuts are from their classic \\"Destroyer\\"-album. These two things represent the two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow....the apocalypse","review":"I think the manufacture and sale of this cd is the 2nd sign of the apocalypse.

Do people really listen to this dreck?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Time for Kiss to pack it up !","review":"I have been a Kiss fan soince I was 11 years old ! My first album was Kiss Alive II.Jumping on the band wagon of band performing live with a symphony this cd is terrible. The sound quality is muddled and Peter Criss is slugging away at the drums out of time and was showed the door AGAIN by Gene and Paul.I would not buy this cd for a nickel and in fact the copy I have was given to me and does nothing more than collect dust.Go buy Savatage to hear Rock with a symphony !"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of the Live albums","review":"This is simply awful, and an embarrasment for Kiss. Alive had so much energy to it, I would never expect any other Live release by Kiss to come close. But this is so off the mark. The production is weak, distorted, and treble-happy. Paul Stanley doesn't sing anymore, he simply tries to see how high he can sing. Simmons has lost his voice. And worst yet, the orchestra simply doesn't go with Kiss Songs. The most enjoyable part of this CD are the first five songs without the orchestra, but then you realize that it's not ACE playing, but Tommy Thayer of Black and Blue fame playing Ace's chops, exactly. How about a little bit of originality? Couldn't you have added a little more guitar solo to Deuce or Strutter? This is a sell out, friends. Go listen to ALIVE again, and wish what was, and not what could be."},{"rating":"1","title":"made my stomach upset","review":"A talented band fulfilling a record company contract album quota by rehashing 20-25+ year old material.

I prefer the soundboard bootlegs over Kiss's usual over produced live albums. But this one rocks the socks off any live recording I've ever heard! I love it! This cd has the best versions I have ever heard of Love Gun, I Was Made, and Rock N Roll All Nite. It truly is a must for any Kiss fan of any degree of loyality. I can't wait until the dvd comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"KISS. What a joke.","review":"I personally never understood the immense popularity of KISS. To me they're just a bunch of fat clowns playing silly rock. Their gullible \\"army\\" KISSes the ground they walk on and throws money at them in exchange for some novelty rubbish with the name KISS on it. \\"The Very Best of Greatest KISS, Vol 12\\" clogs record racks the world over. Even in death, one is not immune (KISS Koffin, anyone?).And now this, KI$$' latest attempt to fill their overbloated wallets, another compilation of the same tired old obsolete party anthems re-re-re-packaged, only this time they have been undeservingly given the symphonic treatment. Yeah, hooray. It's like putting pearls on swine, dress it up all you can, it's still a pig. As P.T.

This is far from the Metallica treatment the orchestral arrangements sound silly (sorry that's the only word I can think of to describe it) and thrown in for the sake of having it there - thank God for the first six tracks which save this disc...and sorry Tommy, you're not Ace - the leads sound like a KISS tribute guitarist (which, suprise, he was) - playing very polished versions of leads that were raw. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your $$","review":"First of all, why did I spend my money on this? If you have any of the previous live albums don't wast your time/$$ on this. Most of these tracks are available on Alive I-III and certainly sound better on those. The only gimmick that seperates this album is the Melbourne Symphony, which can hardly be heard and the arrangements bring nothing to the songs. They could achieved the same thing with Paul Shaefer on keyboards. Buy this album only if you're from Australia and desperately need to hear a live version of \\"Shandi\\" that sounds almost as unappealing as...the studio version. As a HUGE fan that has every album I've finally gotten sick of more and more of the same. If you're a new fan: buy Alive I-III. If you're an old fan: Go listen to your copies of Alive 1-III instead. This might be decent when they release it on DVD though. Save your cash for that and buy a concert ticket instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"There are few who are bigger fans of Kiss than myself. With that in mind (so you don't think I'm just randomly bashing the group)this CD is sorely lacking. If you like your Kiss neutered, this might be the album for you. I realize this is a 'symphony' cd, but some groups just don't take well to this type of mix. Well, it just doesn't work here. All the spice is gone from the songs and what you're left with is bland, uninspiring music. To call this Alive IV is blasphemy and soils the previous great Alive LPs. All that being said, as much as I miss Ace, Tommy Thayer really kicks on the first 6 tracks which are just the band without the symphony. Since they had to do it,they should have made the Farewell Tour PPV Alive IV, and put this out on it's own separately. Seeing how greedy the band is now I'm surprised they didn't think of it. Buy the remastered Alive II and listen to what a kick a$$ band sounds like."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's an ok album, but they need to do some real work.....","review":"I give this 4 stars, because it's a decent record. The band sounds tighter then they have in years. Peter is still not great, but he's making an effort here. Paul is losing his singing voice. Gene has already lost his. Peter was the only one that could still sing. This disc is worth it just for the version of \\"Beth\\". Tommy is a good guitarist. Ace isn't hear, get over it. He wants to record new music, which he could have done while still in KISS, but he's not known for smart choices. The production is pretty good. Overall, I would say this is worth owning if you're a KISS fan, but don't expect anything shockingly new here. \\"Lick It Up\\" was included, which is pretty cool, as that was one of the band's best albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy re-packaging....","review":"I've always been a Kiss fan but ever since the reunion of the original line-up in 1996 their (old) songs have been rehashed and repackaged too often. The DVD version of Symphony is AWESOME and the sales figures of it say it all: Kiss is an audio-visual spectacle, hence the excellent sales of the DVD. On double CD -especially the 'limited' (ahum...) edition digi-pack - the band rocks equally fantastic but the general audience didn't buy the album so saleswise the CD version failed miserable. Let me make clear that this album deserved to be #1 but this cheaply repackaged single disc.... what a joke !!! The beautiful digi-pack double CD only costs some $ 4 more than this sh**ty CD and who oh who is gonna buy it then ??? If you want this CD, spend the $ 4 extra and get the digi-pack double CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU WANTED THE BEST...YOU DIDN'T GET IT...","review":"Let me start out by saying that I'm as big a KISS fan as anybody can attest to - 30 years of amassed albums, memorabilia. etc... That being said... this album deserves a collective YAWN... It's not REALLY KISS - Ace Frehley bailed out...I swear I'll never buy another KISS album that's just a retread of everything else, a bunch of the same stuff in different wrapping, and that's all this is. Sure they added an orchestra - unless somebody told you it was there, I'm not sure you'd realize it on most of the songs, and where you can hear it, adds no real value, anyways. I'm sick of the same ol' renditions of Detroit Rock City, Shout it Out Loud, R&R All Night, Duece, blah, blah, blah... Shandi was a nice touch, but stuck to the studio sound...Don't waste your money - there's nothing ear-catching about this CD...NOTE TO KISS - How about either hitting the studio for something new, or digging into the vault a little bit for something new and different..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special.....nothing special at all","review":"I have been a KISS fan for 25 years and this concert could have been so much more than what it was. With the exception of 2 songs, Shandi and Great expectations, it was practically the same set as there last 3 tours, (and what did ever happened to ALIVE IV?!?). As far as the orchestra goes, it was overpowered by the guitar, and as far as the two together, you can be just as satisfied listening to \\"Destroyer\\".It could have been sooooo much better if they didn't play the standards, and dusted off more of there catalog that was more disserving of an orchestra."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Horrible!!!","review":"If I could give it 0 stars I would!

The only time I saw that \\"hunger\\" again was their reunion tour in the late 90's, but that was fleeting.This is a great package, as KISS has never been known to skimp in that area, but the music itself adds to the parody they have created. The orchestral arrangements are predictable and do nothing for the songs.I was embarassed to hear a 50+ year old Paul Stanley stating \\"is this cool, or what?\\" into the mike more than once.What would be \\"cool\\" is for Simmons and Stanley to bow out now with whatever grace they have left."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go to the studio or go away!","review":"I am a huge KISS fan and I am going to see them with Aerosmith in October, but if they put out another album with versions of old songs I'm going to puke!!!

While the string arragements on some songs (most notably \\"Beth\\" and \\"God Of Thunder\\") are worthwhile, this album is barely better than Metallica's S&M.While alledgedly attempting to broaden their horizons and adding to the \\"Alive\\" legacy, this album does not come close to the others. I'd even go as far as to say it tarnishes the body of work left by the other \\"Alive\\" albums. The idea of performing with a symphonic orchestra is no longer original and is slowly becoming something that the music business and music fans alike can easily do without.On the upside, I got this as a Christmas gift, so I didn't have to pay for it.

There is no hint that this is a re-release on the cover. Since I already owned this recording, I was rather annoyed on reading the inside jacket copy that this was the same.

It's very much a companion book to \\"Under the Duvet\\" - so if you enjoyed that, then you'll enjoy this.However, don't let this be the FIRST Keyes you read. I think after reading some of her novels and getting a feel for her style/characters then the essays are eye opening and touching.

Especially when it's accompanied by swearings, warning labels, explicit subject matter, and anything else that can possibly upset people. Don't get me wrong, I love heavy metal.

There is a difference between noise and music and a couple of these tracks cross that line. Sure, there's the small universe of ultra-hardcore fans who love anything Pantera records (\\"best album ever\\"? Give me a break), but anyone else can hear that this is pretty weak material for the most part.It's sad to see a band that was so good implode on itself.

It certainly isn't! All it is is a bunch of earsplitting noise that has no melody at all. What's even worse is that 'Suicide Note' sounds like a horrible(words can't describe) ripoff of Gn'R's 'November Rain', which was such a wonderful song. I betcha it's a parody(like old Weird Al). And of course, we all know what's on the rest off Trendkill, nothing but songs filled a stupid cussword every other word. After about the 8th billionth(I know I'm exagerrating) I heard that f'word I just turned it off. It shows that Pantera thinks swearing is cool. Not if has to be 40 times in a song. All in all Pantera isn't metal. Or music. Go listen to NIN and Manson, and see what music IS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sickening!","review":"I laugh at those who say this is music. It's just plain noise. Every other word in 'War Nerve' is the 'f' word or some other cuss-word. The same with the title song. F this and f that, how can someone who is mature possibly love this. Phil Anselmo must love to cuss at the listeners. Worst yet, he screams \\"F--- METALLICA\\" in the middle of 'Living Through Me(Hell's Wrath)'. My favorite band on Earth. That really turned me off to Pantera. I gave this CD to my brother, who doesn't even listen to it(he plans on returning it to the used CD shop).

The guy(aaron or something) who said \\"no sellouts here\\" was obviously refering to Metallica and KoRn \\"selling out\\". Which they didn't(of course Korn did play 2 rap songs, but let's forget that). Pantera has neither the talent nor the guts to make a good record. James Hetfield and Jon Davis are so much better singers than Phil Anselmo. Hetfield and Kirk Hammett along with Munky and Head are GREATER guitarists than Dimebag.

He uses the f-word more than 30 times each on the first two songs, the title song plus War Nerve. That said, this is a bad Cd by an even worse band. Don't buy it or anything by Pantera.

The songs on this album and Phil's vocals on this one are awesome. \\"Suicide Note Pt 1\\" doesn't sound like anything pantera would write, but they pull it off and it sounds amazing.

Phil's voice screams till he is out of breath. And the lyrics make absolutely no sense. Filled with a bunch of swears. The only break is Suicide Note,Part 1, but even that song is terrible. Pantera's first attempt at a ballad is pitiful, especially since it is surounded by noise. Worst yet, this CD is less than forty minutes long(39:04, to be exact).Compared to Cowboys From Hell, Vulgar Display of Power, and Far Beyond Driven, which are in the 55-60 minute range.

Metallica's guitarists, James Hetfeild and Kirk Hammet are much better. So is Eric Clapton. All Great Southern Trendkill is is a load of trash that is a pathetic attept at thrash metal. What a waste.

First of all, the only thing that is heavy about Pantera and G.S.T. is Phil's screamings, cussings, and rude subject matter. His vocals and lyrics are terrible. As for Dime's gtrs., who wants to hear the same 2 chords(3 at maximum)over and over. Usually the riffs aren't even in chords. Just single notes(gasp). And there's usually only one guitar playing. Most metal bands have two and sometimes three guitars playing generaly 4/5/6 chord riffs(Metallica for example). As for Rex's bass, you never can hear it. One wonders if it's even there. Vinnie is the worst drummer ever. He drums worst than a gorilla and rarely uses a bass drum. There is hundred's of other great metal bands out there other than Pantera. Go listen to Slayer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will Pantera Ever End?","review":"Don't listen to anyone who'd give this CD four or five stars. One star is bad enough.

Anyone who loves this, is the high school punk who loves profanities, obscenities, screams, grunts, and bad subject matter. Don't waste your hard-earned cash on this load of noise called The Great Southern Trendkill. It's a shame I wasted mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"This is a terribly made album. The music makes absolutly no sense. The lyrics are terrifying. I don't see how anyone would want to listen to this garbage. I miss real metal. Pantera have lost their will to live. The first two songs have an endless, and needless amount of swearings. Tool is much better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"I thought this cd was better than Far Beyond Driven, for one it was heavier. It's a good album, it's been in my cd player since it came out. But I fear the end is soon, for March 21st will bring forth the wrath of PanterA, the best band in metal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO!","review":"How can you guys possibly call this talent? anyone who gives this 5 stars has something wrong with them. Trendkill is just noise filled with bloodcurling screams. And like tonsa swearing. This is what happens when record companies allow bands with no talent to get record deals. Phil Anselmo just wish he had talent. So he just makes an album filled screams. Go listen to something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"???????????!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Pantera sounds just like Fear Factory? They sound NOTHING like Fear Factory. FF is sooo much better than Pantera. The have a great guitarist and a MUCH better singer. And Factory is Industrial. Don't ever compare a great band like FF to Pantera. Sepultura is much better than Pantera too. Also check out Prong and Testament. Two of my favs. As for Great Southern Trendkill, it's the worst metal album yet. All Phil does is scream and swear. Every other word on War Nerve is the f-word or any other cuss word. That shows Pantera has no talent whatsoever. Go listen to Fear Factory, Sepultura, Prong, and Testament. Also check out KoRn's self-titled debut. It'll blow you away. As for Pantera, don't waste time on them. There's hundreds of other metal bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Pantera's older CD's are very good indeed. But that doesn't mean that their new stuff isnt. i listened to this album and was blown away at the intensity and range that Phil, Dimebag, Rex and Vinnie brought to this album. Their best.... VERY best.. buy it....... FAVORITES: The Great Southern Trendkill, Suicide Notes Part 1 and 2, 10's and Floods"},{"rating":"2","title":"they experimented a little and made a good metal album","review":"Seriously, yes I am a big fan. But this album is pretty good depending upon what kind of metal you like. the lyrics are deep and true with a hard to see postive message(don't do drugs). War Nerve is a real hateful POUNDING metal song. Drag the Waters is a solid all around metal song. Suicide Note Pt. I is by far the most soothing sound i've ever heard. And with phil's singing voice it easily became my all time favorite song. Suicide Note Pt. II is really fast and basically chaotic. Floods has an incredible solo. It's an all around good solid album. check it out. Tracks 3, 6, and 9 are worth the money alone. So Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"POWERFUL","review":"THIS IS A GREAT CD, AND TO THOSE PEOPLE SAYING THAT DIMEBAG HAS NO GUITAR SKILLS, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? HE IS ONE OF THE BEST AROUND IN THE BUISNESS TODAY. THIS CD DOES HAVE SOME WEAK MOMENTS, BUT IF YOUR LOOKING FOR SOME REALLY POWERFUL STUFF, THIS IS IT"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a better band.","review":"There's one big reason Pantera's still around, and that's Vinnie Paul. A superb drummer will hold ANY band above water (get it?). The guitar work is simplistic, and though I applaud Phil's ability to scream for 20 minutes straight without taking a breath, it's not that impressive. GST is uninspiring; Pantera is loud, but unispiring. Go buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pantera: excellent guitars, horrible singing","review":"Pantera really should be an instrumental band. Their singer is really really really bad. He cant even sing. He just yells at the top of his lungs throughout the whole album. However, the nails on the blackboard singing is offset by excellent guitar playing. Those are some of the best solos I've ever heard in my life. Too bad it gets ruined by a guy who sings like Celine Dion. The only song here that I can honestly say I like is Floods, mainly because it has more guitar than vocals.Thank God for Iron Maiden. They have an excellent singer to go along with their good guitarists. Long live Bruce Dickinson!"},{"rating":"2","title":"To Pantera Hater","review":"for someone who Hates Pantera you sure are fixated on them, especially dimeDo us a favor...Post a link to a recording of you playing guitar so we can see how better you are than Dime...who knows, you might be, but i doubt it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably my favorite Pantera","review":"This is probably my favorite pantera album. It has great songs like \\"War Nerve\\", \\"Suicide Note Pt. 1 and 2\\" and \\"Floods\\". I know everyone may think Vulgar Display of Power is the best one but I personally think this is the best one. All I have to say is where is Pantera Cd NO.7? Come on boys, quit the side projects and get to work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great metal album.Simply gorgeous.","review":"I like Pantera a lot but like Slayer I keep the volume down because I dont want to disturb my parents.I think it disturbs them enough that they know I listen to this stuff but thats cool with me.I also dont listen to it very loud because its pretty loud to begin with and very rarely do I listen to music on my speakers really loud unless its something more accesible like Guns N Roses or Metallica.Still Pantera is a great band and this is a great cd.My favorite songs by far are Drag The Water Some More,Floods and the unbeatable title track but the other songs are really cool too.Some of them are slower than others but just as good.I love metal and Pantera is one of the best bands in the genre but my favorite is Slayer.This is still awesome though."},{"rating":"1","title":"PANTERA USED TO BE 80'S GLAM ROCK!","review":"well, pantera sucks, funny how they say don't be trendy or you suck when they are one of the most trendiest bands on earth. korn sucks, limp bizkit sucks, metallica sucks, those are all fake metal bands, cannibal corpse, mortician, disfigured,jungle rot, those are real metal bands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugggh..............","review":"This is the worst CD I ever heard.

Just another pathetic attempt to get the Parantel Advisory label on the cover! Phil Anselmo continues to use the 'f' word non-stop!

If this is real metal, than it's dead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can wait till March 21st!","review":"March 21 will be the day of Armageddon. Pantera's new album is coming out. And it will be just the same as Trendkill or anyother cd by this untalented band straight outta Texas. It's gonna do considerable damage to the music scene. Hopefully though, it will flop. Or better yet, Pantera will sell out. Or else, the end is near! Apocalypse is coming! Repent! Repent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Phil Anselmo is really a woman","review":"I thought this was the worst thing ive ever heard until i flogged reinventing the steel over the net and that is an absolutley shocker"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why won't they discontiue Pantera albums?","review":"They should consider it.Pantera is a absolute pathetic joke on metal, and a plauge on music in general.They should just ban this god awful music for good.All this is is macho man, bravodo chest thumping from baggy short-wearing posers who want you to THINK that they are tough-guys, much like Fred Durst or Eminem.And as for Dimebag Darrle?, he was never any good. I'v never seen such mediocore tripe be hailed and praised on the level that Pantera is, only Slipknot fans are worse.Just listen to this music and think to yourself that, if it was YOUR band that had wrote and recorded these songs, you would most likly be laughed at and branded as a bunch of posers.It will only be a matter of time before this band and it's career are completely laughed at and realized for the cr@p that it really is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heaviness","review":"This is Panteras heaviest album. While everyone lists the classics Floods, Drag the Waters, 10's and Suicide Note Pt 1&2 as the highlights, the other songs are not to be overlooked. The title track starts out screaming with hardcore guitar work and then turns into a southern Lynard Skynard-but-heavier sounding jam which is actually one of my favorite peices of music. War Nerve is one of the best songs on the album, better IMO than Drag The Waters. 13 Steps to Nowhere is another one of my favorites that further establishes Vinnie Paul's greatness. The Underground in America is by far one of the heaviest songs OF ALL TIME. You can come at me with all that weird nuremburg death metal and hardcore, but none of that is nearly as legible as The Underground in America, which uses drop G guitar tuning and still keeps its clarity. This is a truely heavy album and one of Pantera's finest."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worrth the money!!!","review":"My dogs don't even care if it goes off, they stare at it for a minute then lay down on the couch.

If you're trying to train your dogs to remain interested in getting on your sofas, this is the product for you.The extremely limited return policy included with the product (that's not described prior to purchase) suggests the manufacturer knows that this thing is largely useless.

It works pretty well and the noise do keep them off the couch. HOWEVER, it's a 3 seater couch so 1 device is not enough to keep them off. I would need 2 and spread them out, otherwise, the cats will jump on whichever side of the couch that's not effected."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Tattle Tale is a waste of $$ for use with cats!","review":"Don't waste your money, especially if you buy it online/Amazon because you can't return it! I put the device on my couch and my 21 lb cat jumped on the couch, walked around it and sniffed it. The Tattle Tale never went off. Cats land too lightly and, seemingly, make no vibrations. I tossed a coaster on the couch and the device went off, but didn't really scare my cats anyway. The sound isn't very loud or startling. I recommend Ssscat. I bought two of them from PetSmart and they are the only cat deterrents that actually work."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more dog fur on the couch","review":"My dog is great, the one thing he was doing was sneaking on the couch when I was not home. He is a bulldog/boxer 85 pound dog. Placed this on the couch and magically he has not gone near it since.

This has dated very badly and while there a few excellent underlying notions it is impossible to ignore the clunky technology and out-moded social ideas that inform the work.This is almost certainly a work of 'historical importance' within the SF field and it is that alone, I feel, which explains why it was placed so highly in the 'SF Masterworks' series(one of the things that nudged me into reading it) but I can't recommend it as a reading experience.Whatever you do don't make this your first journey into 'Classic SF' try Dick(The Man in the High Castle), Bester(The Stars My Destination), Asimov(Foundation),Clarke(The City and the Stars)..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cities in Flight","review":"Even though the science is out of date, it is still a great adventure.

I have never read any science fiction that manages to encapsulate the entire galaxy so well. Many have tried, but few have come close to succeeding as well as Blish does.

Its great example of cold war era science fiction. Don't look for sophistication in writing or character development, or the kind of dark but hip view of the future you might get from a William Gibson; this is fiction more in the Asimov tradition -- a little more serious, better written than the Foundation Trilogy, but it feels like that kind of read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have the hare copies.","review":"They are the same storeis that I have singly in my library.

Probably 50% of policy books today have some kind of serious bias, but I found Mr Pollack's assumptions to be fair & his conclusions to be well-reasoned. He seems to have a good command on different sociological, psychological, political and religious aspects of the Iranian society, and he presents his case without relying on guess work or unsubstainted/dishonest assertions.I do think, however, that Mr. Pollack should have included more material on the role of Sunni-Shiite tension within the Islamic world, and its effect on Iran's policies. In addition, the author could have focused more on the perceptions Muslims in other countries have about the US & Israel. After all, while devising a strategy for relations with Iran, it is imperative that such basic complexities are considered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bias","review":"This book has numerous flaws in accurately portraying Iran and its conflict with America, but the most important is the bias of the author. Mr. Pollack writing a book about Iran is like having your worst enemy write your biography. In a nutshell this is a highly biased book by a man who has strong ties to the American Israeli Poliitical Action Committee and was named for a time in an indictment by the U.S. government as an national security advisor in the Clinton administration that provided secret information to high ranking Israeli AIPAC employees. He also works at the Saban Institute which is named after and run by Haim Saban who is who is an Israeli billionaire who is generally believed to use his hefty campaign donations to further the Israeli cause.There is no problem if your beliefs are the same, but just know you'll be reading a book which isn't accurate and more likely to fall under the category of propaganda."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"after reading the reviews by other amazon buyers and being a big thunderbird fan i bought the book. i am really glad i only paid a few dollars. while its fairly good reading the majority of the color pictures appear out of focus and for some reason dark. the black and whites appear good. as a collector of automobile books i rarely see pictures this bad, especially in a anniversary edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Great CD!","review":"If you want to start a Jan and Dean collection, this is THE CD to buy.

Worse than all of this is the contempt the author seems to have for 2,000 years of Church history.

[It is available at a more reasonable price, by the way, at amazon.uk]Much of the best Renaissance vocal music is to be found in motets, which provided the composers more freedom of form and inspiration for emotive coloration than the movements of the mass, yet recordings of the masses are far more common, with the motets treated as addenda. Josquin is no exception; his motets are extraordinary and rival the best of his cyclical masses.The Orlando Consort sings everything one-on-a-part, for the very good reason that they CAN. Their richness of vocal timbre and their fine unity of ensemble make their performance a \\"bigger' experience than a full choir of twenty-four less expressive singers.

NFG takes classic easy-listening songs from movies and puts their own spin on it. The results will make you smile, rock out, tap your foot, nod your head, maybe even laugh. This CD marked the end of the raw sound and minimal production for the band. This EP wouldn't be the same if it didn't sound like it was recorded in someone's basement. Jordan's voice still sounds like he's singing in the shower, which is not to say that he sings off-key.

These guys are really good songwriters. So why did they waste their time doing this? I mean covers can be a cool thing to do at a show, or on a comp or to just have one on a regular album, but to make a whole album is just asinine. Well, if you like hearing punk versions of songs that aren't punk in the slightest, then buy this album. It does absolutely nothing for me, but, hey, at least it's only 8 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Excited for NOTHING","review":"Honestly, I was expecting a good CD when I ordered this one. The track selections seemed outstanding. But what I got was a Blink-182 sound-alike. Really, the original music had many different emotions. This junk has only one--a whiny, complaining tone. After listening to this CD several times (hoping I would grow to like it) I snapped the CD in two and haven't regretted it since. It's almost insulting to think that such a horrible rendition could deface these otherwise well written songs. Unfortunately, there is no rating less than one star.If you are the type who likes Pogs, Pokemon, Furbys, Tickle-Me-Elmo, Billy the Bigmouth Bass, and other change-with-the-wind faddish things of that nature, you may like the CD. However, I believe this one is best left on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heartless, Lifeless, Souless; the tale of a musical joke","review":"this cd? is a joke...why it is in national stores, and available for anyone to hear is beyond my belief. sounds like crap, no time or thought was put into it, and is really really horrible...

You're off buying your 18th Larks Tounges remater, just to reestablish your hippness.Ok. \\"Traces\\" is sappy and ridiculus, but, like the two other hits, there is a nice, bouncy bossa flavor to the song. This stuff has vibraphones, and nice jazzy rythms that you would not hear on a Gary Pucket or Bobby Goldsboro record. Listen to the guitarist: he has a nice, Wes Montgommery comp style, and a lot of this material would not sound out of place on a Jobim LP.I am not going to take this out once a day, or even once every six months, but as far as 60s AM pop stanards go, this stuff goes down nice and easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"classics iv greatest hits purchased at amazon.com","review":"I love all the songs on this CD.

Tons of fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible quality","review":"I read the poor reviews before I purchased, but decided I would order anyway. I just wanted something I could play with my kids on occasion. No real need for top quality.When I received and opened the (undamaged)box, there were screws everywhere, loose in the box. At first I thought I would just get a screwdriver and put the screws back in and tighten them. The problem is the screws had been stripped out of the pressboard base of the table. There was no way to get the screws to tighten.I am making do with it as is. The hassle of returning for refund or replacement is just something I don't have time for.Bottom line, the workmanship and quality as delivered is horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth purchasing","review":"I purchased this table, with a 50/50 chance of getting a decent one, reading previous reviews.

I probably could have delt with that but the construction was very poor. The screws were very small with no depth and coming loose as some where already loose in the box.

Would not recommend this purchase to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Condition","review":"Just as another buyer mentioned, as soon as I opened the box screws and washers flew out all over the place. I attempted to simply screw the loose tabletop into the base myself but it was impossible because the screws were stripped. One side of the table was also bent and there were several scratches on the table top as well. I highly suggest not wasting your money on this table.

It's so much fun to put together different variations of robots and to use them for imaginary play. Some of the parts got lost over time in our house but now he just saw me looking at it for my nephew and my son wants it again! He is six now and misses playing with this toy.

And in response to the other reviews, why would he talk about things that don't have anything to do with his main points? And besides those points, he gives the disclaimer at the beginning: \\"Though I have studied history for many years, I am not a historian or an academic. This book is not intended to be an academic or objective view of history, but a cursory examination of history for the sake of insight in our on times. Keep in mind that this is necessarily a superficial study of this great subject.\\" So take that into consideration when reading the other reviews. I would HIGHLY recommend this book, to anyone who is interested in church history, simply the part about Constantine is worth reading if nothing else, it will explain a lot about how the church got so off course."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed Ideas","review":"This is the second book by Joyner I've read and he really confuses me. On the one hand he seems sincere about his praise of God and seems to understand who Jesus was (is). On the other hand, Joyner continuously misapplies scripture to suit his purposes and he treats biblical narratives like they were just allegories. In \\"Shadow of Things to Come\\" he jumps around so much in his topics that he really doesn't say much. He claims to be well-read and well-studied in the history of the church, but he really isn't; he misses so much and emphasizes a very narrow understanding. My main complaint about this book is that he abuses the Word of God, he uses scripture inappropriately."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful, awful, awful","review":"i just finished reading this book called vampire blood by kathryn meyer griffith. anyone read this? (anyone ever even heard of this book?) and i have to say it was just awful. i don't quite know why i continued to read it. the plot was a standard plot. the story was not well written, the dialogue was cheesy. the most interesting characters, the two main vampires, were not explored at all, while the reader learns about the main char and her family, and these people are boring and not at all believable. the ending was predictable. and the main char's ex-husband comes back into the picture, and i know that i was supposed to root for these two to get back together and triumph over the vampires, but all i wanted was for the vampires to kill them...i mean put me out of my misery. and jeff (the ex) was such a whiney baby...i don't know what the main char. saw in him. talk about whipped...anyway, if you haven't read it...don't. trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Product - But Bait and Switch","review":"Product from this company claimed to be New, When Arrived the package was opened and product parts looks used.

I ordered this for my son and he really likes it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Cool","review":"FFVII is such an amazing franchise, and this figure is a top notch quality replica of the story's angst ridden hero.Well built. Very pose-able. The bike feels heavy, very sturdy. Cloud is a bit flimsy, however, one should not be moving this piece too much as it is made for display purposes...and looks great doing so."},{"rating":"1","title":"O.K","review":"I got this item today and im not impressed.the first thing that happened is that cloud's leg came off and I swear there is no way to put it back on without using glue.If you do use glue cloud wont be able to move his leg.his hair is REALLY messed up and looks almost nothing like clouds hair.he doesn't have that much of flexibility so you have to be really delicate.the sword is great....but there is a part you take on and off to make him hold the sword which can really break the handle of the sword.he comes with a hand that he can hold the sword with.the Fenri looks great and realistic but it is really hard to put cloud on it without breaking him.and it doesn't include the ability to store cloud's sword."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cloud and Fenrir","review":"The Cloud and Fenrir combo from SquareEnix is amazingly detailed. Then again, every single product from them is very detailed. I thought Fenrir(Cloud's motorcycle) was going to be small, but it was bigger than I thought. It's approximately a foot across and it's beautifully colored. It looked so real you can almost ride on it, if it was life-size. This product is a great collection for any Final Fantasy fan. I love Final Fantasy!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Geller and the great ZIGGY VINES","review":"The review of this CD by Jazzcat \\"stef\\" is right on the money. I agree totally with everything he has to say about this CD so I won't say anything more about the CD, but I MUST mention Ziggy Vines who plays on this great CD. Melvin \\"Ziggy\\" Vines, was a Philly LEGEND. He was a favorite of Coltrane and Charlie Parker. History has it that Zack Zackery and other Philly giants raved about Ziggy. Ziggy Vines was on Clifford Browns' last recording, made at Music City in Philly the night before he and Richie Powell's tragic accident. I am trying to find other recordings of Ziggy Vines, but so far have only found him with Clifford Brown and Herb Geller. His playing on this album with Geller is superb. What a sound. I wish I could get my hands and ears on more Ziggy Vines recordings if there are any. Another unsung hero that hardly anyone knows about or remembers. What a shame. This CD is GREAT and worth it just to hear Ziggy Vines play that tenor. WOW ! ! ! !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chased Success and Finally Caught It","review":"Charlie Rich was a regional favorite both before and after \\"Lonely Weekends\\" sparked a minor dance craze at the University of Tennessee (\\"the U T\\"). As he bounced from one record company to another, he rerecorded his non-hit records until, well, they were hits (to varying degrees). \\"On My Knees\\" and \\"Midnite Blues\\" (not included on this album) were two; there was more than one effort with \\"Sittin' and Thinkin'\\" and alternate takes of \\"Big Boss Man\\". There is a slow, growly blues version of \\"There Won't Be Anymore\\". This album is a fair representation of Charlie's best. For those of us who grew up in the listening area of Memphis radio, when Charlie hit it big in 1973 with \\"Behind Closed Doors\\", we thought it was high time that he got the recognition he deserved. His \\"countrypolitan\\" sound lasted for several years. I would recommend this album to everybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I did receive the CD quickly but it was defective, playing a couple bars of each song and immediately skipping to the next. This happened with the first 4 songs or so and I stopped checking, returned the CD. It was confirmed received beginning of month and it's now the end of the month and still no refund. I have e mailed the company twice and finally received a response saying when they received it and processed it I would get my refund. They received it over 3 weeks ago! I won't be purchasing from ImportCD again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good beginner's guide to yoga","review":"I have enjoyed doing the flow yoga on this DVD. I think the trick is to not emulate everything Shiva Rea does, but to work at one's own pace and gently learn the movements without over-doing them. I have had a lot of success with this routine and find it very helpful for the breathing techniques it develops also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast-paced, but a fabulous workout!","review":"I started my yoga journey with Kundalini, and then this DVD was recommended to me. WOW! This DVD moves quickly, but you do each set multiple times (as is standard in vinyasa flow). My entire body was sore after this workout. In fact, the first time I did this DVD I absolutely had to take breaks because my arms, legs, and core were shaking. Mind you, I am an avid long-distance runner and am in pretty good shape. From that moment on I was hooked. It's fairly tradition, but the instructions Shiva Rea gives are so amazing. She explains moves in a manner that allow me to open up to them in entirely new ways. The background on this entire video is all filmed on location and it is just breath-taking. I have watched this DVD just to relax after work before, not even doing the yoga set itself. Highly recommended, whether a beginner or an advanced student!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shiva Rea is great...love the workout!!!","review":"I just received my order today. And this DVD was one of two that I bought. I would have to say that I own other Shiva Rea yoga DVDs and this one has quickly become my favorite!! As soon as I got done with the workout I had to come on here and write the review!! It is a true \\"flow\\" workout, but is ok for beginners. I am so excited, I will have it in my DVD player for tomorrow!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not so simple to follow","review":"Ok, I really need to get this out and try it again. I guess I just figured I could take it out and be able to flow with it the first time...which was not the case for me. I found it a little hard to follow. I attempted to do it once, got frustrated and on the shelf it went...(been doing on and off yoga practice for 20+ years)The set is awesome, Shiva Rea is awesome, but for a true beginner I think this would be a little frustrating unless they were really motivated...so if you are a beginner, hang in there, be patient with yourself, and this DVD...the rewards are there for the taking."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 3/4 stars","review":"I agree with others who argue that this isn't for beginners. While it might be considered beginning material for a yoga veteran, it would take a newbie several passes through the four sessions to grasp how the movements are performed. Even then a raw beginner might have problems since there is little explanation as to the nuances and elements of each posture.I'm in good shape: weight training, martial arts for four decades, and occasionally yoga. While I didn't find the poses particularly difficult, I did have trouble keeping up from time to time because the changes were so quick and done without a how-to-do explanation.Now, if you have practiced yoga in the past but have been away from it for awhile, this would be a good DVD to get you back into the groove. You could begin with one session a day, progress to two a day and continue until you're doing all four in one day for a good, relatively easy yoga workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best yoga instructor!","review":"I've taken classes with Shiva Rea and she's one of the best yoga instructors out there, so I'm really excited that she now has a program specifically for beginners. It's gorgeous to watch - shot in Hawaii - and, while still challenging, it is a great introduction to flow yoga."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautifully produced, but NOT for beginners","review":"Given the excellent production value, this is everything I'd want in a yoga video. Unfortunately, it is far too advanced for beginners.I really wanted to like it. Shiva Rea has a calming, elegant voice, the nature setting is gorgeous, and the music is great. But I was ready to give up halfway through! I've taken yoga classes before, and now I'm in the process of becoming a serious student, practicing most days out of the week. I am 5'8, 120 lbs, exercise regularly, in my 20s...I'm not some huge weakling. But I feel like these poses were very advanced, and I needed more guidance and explanation than was offered.I would like to give this video 5 stars, but I think I'll have to wait a few years untiL I can enjoy doing a lot of these poses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great beginners Yoga DVD","review":"My mom and I enjoyed doing Yoga to this DVD. My mom was new to Yoga, and I am intermediate. I still enjoyed it and my mom felt comfortable with this DVD being her first Yoga experience.This tape only has four real parts. You can either watch them chapter by chapter, or all in a row. You can also choose to watch them with music only, or with her verbal prompts. I like that you can select different options so you can customize the DVD to the time you have to do the workout.The only critique I have is the same as other reviwers with there being some technical difficulties."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shiva is the BEST!","review":"I think Shiva is the best yoga instructor around! Her voice is soothing & instruction is easy to follow. And what a beautiful production!I've also purchased a couple of her other titles, Creative Core Abs & Fluid Power. They're also fantastic and the results are even better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor viewing quality","review":"My grandmother downloaded this video hoping that she could watch it on her new computer.The video quality is HORRIBLE.

However, not totally bad.","review":"The only thing that kept this from getting a 5 rating is this author seems to think feminism and women in general are against Christianity and the church. Total hogwash! Considering that Conservative Christian American churches have a female majority (65% female members) I used to be a born-again Christian for 20 years (no longer, but I won't go there) .

Good enough to be viewed once and the fact that it is a true story might make it more interesting for some people."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Killing Secret","review":"I really liked this movie, it was an intriging true story, that tells about the pressures of teenagers and the decisions that one makes.Not always the right decisions."},{"rating":"1","title":"FAKE JOB FROM THE ORIGINAL ARTIST","review":"I got tricked into thinking this was the newest, remastered, and most comprehensive Goldsboro anthology there is. Instead I got newly recorded fake versions of the original. Saddest is Goldsboro being an active participant in the project, and he didn't bother to make it more respectable (it even comes without a booklet!) What I don't get the most is they've used real strings and drums, and Goldsboro's vocal was fine, but it was utterly spoiled by cheesy synth embellishments. Get the Honey compilation, or better still, the Honey/Summer two-for-one remastered CD from the UK...don't get this substitute."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the original recordings.","review":"FYI--these are not the original hit recordings, but newly recorded by BG.

Nonetheless, the photography in this book is a brilliant work of photojournalist art.They take us from the tender beginnings of a Revolution of bearded young men against a bloody tyrant. They are young gods in olive-green uniforms. The photo of Camilo Cienfuegos and another unidentified bearded guerrilla in front of the Lincoln statue in the Lincoln Memorial in DC is magnificent. What did America think of these young white men, in their dark, long hair and their huge beards? It stunned and seduced the nation and the seeds of the hippie movement were planted.The book delivers with visual insight and power. The photographs are vivid and full of history. My highest possible rating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. My whole book club hated it.","review":"This book got a loud, unanimous thumbs-down from my 9-member book club. The woman who suggested it came to our discussion meeting deeply embarrassed and apologetic. I was so disgusted with all the references to sourness -- such as bile, vomit and rot -- that I started marking my book. I had hundreds of markings! We all hated the protagonist and his arrogant rantings. One member described Collins' writing as a \\"pretension-fest.\\" The protagonist's relationships with and views of women are so dark and pathetic. This is really one of the worst books I've ever read, and I only finished it because it was a book club book. You'll need lots of breath mints and showers to get through it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Collins, The Keepers of Truth","review":"The Keepers of Truth by Michael Collins is one of those books so full of the authors own opinions that it should have a brain-washing warning sticker on it to warn people who's brains are easily washed. Anyway, the story is interesting if not all that original. It is a murder mystery, but the way it is written and presented to us is what made this a five star read for me. Knowing the author helped make this even more fun as well. As I said, I can see this book angering some hard-core Americans. You know the ones I mean: people who take pride in their town and country no matter what. People like that probably wouldn't read a book like this which talks a lot about the decaying American Dream and so on and so on. The only scene that angered me was when the story's antagonist, Ronny Lawton, throws a bag of perfectly good Burger King food out the window in his hostage situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"none too subtle","review":"This book definitely held my attention, but it's not close to being a 'great book'. Most of the characters--especially women--boil down to tired stereotypes. And the philosophical and political passages are heavy-handed and belabored. It reads like a pseudo-intellectual miniseries. Get 'The Corrections' if you want to read something with philosophical and political content that's done really well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A key academic work in 19th century social history","review":"This not-huge volume has become the basic work on the life of the servant class during the 19th century. (I believe it's based on the author's graduate thesis.) After a brief chapter on the origins of domestic service in Britain (and why it was so much different from the equivalent situation on the Continent), she delves into the daily round of both male and female servants (whose functions were very different, and for largely economic reasons), the nature of social life (such as it was) below stairs, relations between master and servant, how training and discipline was handled, and how it all came to an end in the decade following 1914. She includes a number of statistical appendices and quotes frequently from the memories of those who lived the servant's life. And the bibliography is very extensive indeed. An important work in modern social and domestic history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough is enough already!!!!!!!!!","review":"Many years ago Dame Ninette de Valois said to Richard Buckle that she thought everything that had been said about Diaghilev had already been said and how right she was.If ever a lemon was squeezed dry it was Diaghilev's.Please, everybody, enough is enough about Diaghilev."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a lovely coffee table book and that's about it.","review":"The paper is lovely and the photographs, well, I've seen them a hundred times before. It's a lovely coffee table book, anyone can look cultured if they have this is on display.I agree with other reviewers who think that a/it's enough about Diaghilev, and, b/the articles are almost too esoteric for words, and c/ Diaghilev would, indeed, not like all this intrusive, not to say, mis-conceived, in-depth analysis, of his world.I also have the feeling that the writers involved couldn't even pronounce Diaghilev's name correctly.

A better description of the products actual size is needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This is definitely something different, a medieval forensic pathologist written by a retired modern British forensic pathologist. I got this book overseas and the writing definitely has a very British flavor to it. To me, it has a slightly different vocabulary than what we use, very proper and also slightly slower paced.However, it's very well written. What I like most about it are the descriptions of medieval life and the characters. The characters are very well written and come to life nicely. The plot starts out as quite complex and broad but comes together satisfyingly at the end. If you like medieval books and forensic investigations, then this book will be right up your alley. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sanctuary Seeker Review","review":"I really enjoy this series of Crowner John Mysteries.I am trying to get the set, book by book.

What a bargain. If one can wear out a compact disc, I'm going to suceed. I, like another reviewer, was a closet Fleetwoods fan during my high school days in the late '50s & early '60s.

I recently bought the Basement Tapes with the hope of finding some newly discovered examples of Mick brilliant guitar work. What I found was profoundly disappointing and I can't believe that he would have ever authorized this albums release. At best, some cuts are simply average performances of old tunes, at worst Mick sounds rusty and out of practice, struggling through poor performances of his earlier brilliant solos. Perhaps this is another example of how the inspiration, ambition, and hope of the sixties, as manefested through rock music, can never be recreated. Micks exciting, spontainious, and original guitar work seems to have been a product of his place in time, now long gone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"Bought this for a Christmas present after attending a concert.

I would recommend Into Paradise for anyone who loves sacred music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sissel Finds Her Niche with the World Audience","review":"Sissel has been all over the musical map, but with this album, really finds the spot where she belongs with the audience outside of Scandinavia.Even with the unique gift that is her voice, the pop versions of Nordic traditional songs that she sang earlier in her career would only take her so far. Her pairing with PBS a few years ago opened her up to a large new audience, but she was singing Grade B or C pop songs. Her new repertoire has favored some classical and neo-classical chestnuts (not unlike Josh Groban) and these works have really worked better with her vocal instrument.I've LOVED Sissel ever since I first heard her sing with the Chieftains and have waited for her to sing material that suits her exceptional voice. I am happy to report that this latest album puts her right about where she belongs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now THIS is Paradise!","review":"I was first made aware of this CD by \\"Book and Music Lover\\" while reading through the reviews of Charlotte Church's \\"Tissues and Issues.\\" \\"Book and Music Love\\" recommended Sissel's \\"Into Paradise\\" CD. I fell in love with it just by listening to the excerpts, and when amazon.com had a special sale on it, I took that opportunity to nab it!This is a truly wonderful CD that combines Sissel's beautiful, bell-like voice, diverse repertoire and beautiful orchestrations. I especially loved \\"Dusk\\" and her wordless interpretation of the non-choral parts of \\"Wachet Auf, Ruft Uns Die Stimme,\\" as well as \\"In Paradisum,\\" \\"Sancta Maria,\\" \\"Ingen Vinner Frem\\" and \\"Adagio.\\" All in all, very satisfying.

I found that the buttons weren't pushing down hard enough so I pushed on them to ensure it's set. The next day I come back and it's off yet again. For kicks I turned the dial all the way around and noticed it would come on about half the time that it was set for, on/off/on/off, etc. I then again pushed the buttons, it worked fine for several days until I had to touch it. I had to unplug it to move some cords around, plugged it back in, worked fine. The next day the problem came back.Needless to say this timer is not reliable, I will never buy another Sylvania product again.

The operation is very simple and it has some nice features. I bought two new and one used. Both new ones work like a charm. The used one does not work and I'm returning it. I'd add only one additional \\"con\\" to the other things that have been written: depending upon the positioning of your outlet it might be awkward or impossible to use the adjacent outlet. This is helped by the handy alternate socket on the timer but I also have an outlet that is positioned right above a trim board so I cannot use the alternate plug in the timer or the other socket in the wall plate.

This timer would work the first night, but by the second night, several of the tabs got pushed back up and so my air cleaner turned off and then back on several times, waking me up each time.

Many, if not most, have published 10, 20, or 30 bestsellers in the past 10, 20, or 30 years. Over and over the writers say that 30 years ago they did this or they had this bit of luck, which started their career. The Internet, self-publishing, print-on-demand, e-books, etc. are mentioned maybe once in passing, or not at all. What's repeatedly discussed is enduring reams of rejection letters from agents and publishers. I don't know any aspiring writers who worry about that. We're too busy finding ways to sell directly to readers to worry about agents and publishers. This book will give you great insights into what it took to \\"make it big\\" in publishing 30 years ago.

He is ambitious and smart and knows how to make a dollar. He is also a good person. But he is not perfect - he marries the wrong woman at first, a woman who loves someone else - and he fails with a close friend and his son.

By using a translation with inclusive language, there is a greater danger for misunderstanding the teachings that were presented at this Council. The second reason is because I have found pieces missing.

The films are high quality and as complete as possible. You can just watch them without John Canemaker's insights or turn on the comments to learn even more about the man and what he was doing. Winsor McCay created the art of animated movies. You can see in these films the ground work upon which the Disney Studios built their captivating movies. You can also see for yourself how modern producers pay subtle homage to McCay in their movies. It's even fun to just watch them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The real McCay","review":"This collection contains the surviving films, complete and incomplete, from the man who called himself the \\"inventor of animated cartoons.\\" Although McCay's animated output dates from 1911 to 1921, other American animators would not produce work comparable to \\"Gertie the Dinosaur,\\" \\"The Sinking of the Lusitania,\\" or \\"The Flying House\\" until well into the 1930s.Because these cartoons can be found on YouTube and other streaming-video sites, only die-hard animation buffs need purchase this particular DVD. Still, the presentation here is superb, especially given the condition of the materials. Animation historian John Canemaker provides knowledgeable audio commentary, and even tosses in a brief archival interview with one of McCay's assistants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Winsor McCay DVD and Marwhal","review":"DVD is Excellent and in perfect shape.Arrived past the 14 day delivery date,but it did arrive."},{"rating":"1","title":"yet another example............","review":"Hollywood has managed in this film to once again showhow really great it is to be a thief.....And they managed to use, in my estimation, the top worst to do it.Clooney, who always portrays himself in no matter what role he takes...Pitt who walks thru his role like a zombie throwing in one liners to make it interesting???? And let's not forget the token female, Roberts, who I am still trying to figure out how she can be the most beautiful woman in the world, or is it one of the top five in the world? I forget......The only redeeming thing about this film was the presence of Garcia and maybe the Las Vegas location. I have no plans to see the sequel as I am sure it will be more of the same humdrumas this turkey was. To me it was just as boring as the original one only an updated version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haven't seen the original, but this one was pretty good!","review":"I liked this film, although it appears that many reviewers here hated it. I thought the story was intriguing (you have to watch it from beginning to end), and the comedic elements added to it (my favorite was watching the young Hollywood actors learn poker).I'm not a big Clooney fan, and Brad Pitt hasn't ever really impressed me either, but this film does make my high list of stuff to watch on a lazy Saturday afternoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"[STINKS]","review":"They could have named Clooney's character John Smith and named the movie \\"Smith's Twelve\\" and have it go on its own instead of calling it a remake of the original \\"Ocean's Eleven\\". While the original had a campy simple plot, the Rat Pack made it entertaining and one always knew how they were getting this heist to work. The remake, while it has a super cast, bounced around with such a complex plan that it took away from the actual heist. It moved slow, had too many, some stupid, mini plots and by golly I should have switched it off and gone to bed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Horrible; Unconvincing Characters","review":"Just because you have a bunch of \\"beautiful people\\" in a movie doesn't make it good. The characters are very poorly developed. Brad Pitt has no place playing a tough guy casino robber. His character is very unconvincing. And also, Julia Roberts? She's much too prudish for such a role. This plot would have been much better if the characters would have been more serious and sinister. This movie was awkwardly not funny despite its frequent efforts. Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow,Dull setup with No payoff.","review":"This film is exceptionally dull...it has no heart,no pulseit's all cardbored...yes I ment to spell it like that.You can spend millions to get the best and best looking starsbut it doesnt assure your films success...or maybe it does.The 1st film tried the same thing with the same result."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimaginative","review":"There is nothing new or exciting about this movie. You know the premise already. You wait an hour and a half (it felt much longer to me), then what you expect to happen happens. Maybe a slightly interesting twist, but nothing spectacular. There is no reason to see this in the theatres or to rent it when it comes out. Completely forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely, utterly disappointing!","review":"I am shocked that anyone would take the assembled talent in this film and force them to act out such a worthless script. George Clooney mails in another \\"look at how cool am I\\" performance while the rest of the gangsters are as wooden as toy soldiers. And why is Julia Roberts even in this film? Andy Garcia is OK as the one dimensional villan and the technical aspects of the heist are intricate but so much more could have been done with this film. I am no film critic, but even I was wondering what was motivating these characters and there was zero chemistry. I would give it zero stars if I could, save your money and wait for a slow night to even rent it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action without senseless violence","review":"This movie was highly entertaining, not to mention all the eye candy of the all-star cast, but just watching a cast of actors by skill execute a brilliant plan. I was more than thrilled with everyone's performance. They were humorous and had the audience cheering for the robbers!!! By the way, did I mention all the eye candy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away!","review":"Although the cinematography is slick, the lack of character development turns this movie into nothing more than fluff. The title of the movie is Ocean's Eleven yet we are only given glimpses of Ocean's character.Even though lots of big name actors were used, there seems to be no chemistry between them to the point where a lot of the actors lines seem forced (especially noticed when Brad Pitt and George Clooney were explaining the heist).I'd avoid this one and wait until it comes out on cable"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"Ocean's Eleven, if you can get past the blinding glare of beautiful people, stylish costumes, and slick cinematography, is an extremely boring movie. The characters have no depth, or any genuine connection to one another, and the plot could be mistaken for that of a documentary. The viewer simply sees a group of guys plot and execute a robbery. Oooooh. Aaaaah. I hate using cheesy \\"criticspeak\\" cliches like \\"eye candy,\\" but I really can't think of any other way to describe this sugary, empty [movie]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood Has Long Been Out of Ideas","review":"Let me see if I get this striaght: We're supposed to pretend that George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Don Cheadle (who?) are Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Peter Lawford and Sammy Davis Jr. Give me a break! I could barely sit through this self-serving slice of backhanded hommage. What a slick and disingenuous waste of time and money. But, this is to be expected from a Hollywood totally bereft of any new ideas. That Steven Soderburgh is being touted as some kind of \\"auteur\\" is an even sicker joke. Andy Garcia and Carl Reiner, what were you thinking?This film is my nominee for a moritorium on remakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love this movie yet due to ongoing problems with Amazon streaming it is unwatchable.","review":"I love this movie yet due to ongoing problems with Amazon streaming it is unwatchable.Quite simple this is a wonderful movie.Problems with Amazon streaming are still major.It makes watching the movie not worthwhile.Audio is out of sync.Artifacts and dropped frames.I have high speed broadband and no problems streaming Netflix or other programming on either my Samsung Smart TV or my computer. Yet with Amazon it is a PITA.Now works with my TV. Not willing to make all of the changes Amazon suggested to my computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!","review":"This is one of my all time favorite movies!!! AWESOME cast and lots of great qotes:)If you have not seen this movie you are missing out!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My go to sleep movie (in a good way!)","review":"It's called my go to sleep movie because I know it by heart, backwards and forwards, so it helps me fall asleep with some noise on insomnia ridden nights. The lines between Clooney and Pitt still crack me up - and watching it w/ commentary has never gotten old. Though I loathe the next too I will always love this one. And with my upcoming trip to Vegas, it helps get me pumped to hit the strip once more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"I'll admit, I've never seen the original, but I love this remake of it with a super blockbuster cast. This really set the bar for the series for me, and I was drawn in 100%. I'm no movie buff, but I loved this movie! The 2nd one though, well that's another story. The blu-ray features weren't any more amazing than the DVD, and wasn't anymore clearer. It was a lot sharper and crisp, but a DVD version would have been more than enough for a type of movie like this. But for the price of the blu-ray I couldn't refuse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well rounded but still lacking.","review":"I will admit that I have not seen the original version of this movie, though I wish I have. This movie in general was very glitzy and inspirational. Starts off with George Clooney getting out jail and reconnecting with old acquaintances for the biggest heist ever planned. His scheme is elaborate, a little too much so. His plan is easy to follow, that wasn't the problem, it was too absurd. The thought that someone could construct a plan so precise as this is nearly impossible. That was my only real quarrel with this movie, his outrageous plan. Other than that, it was very action packed and humorous, with depictions of Brad Pitt eating whenever in view. The movie hides a little from you until the end, but I think this was necessary to build up the finale. You can imagine the ending of this movie pretty easily, it was predictable but enjoyable. Bottom line: enjoyable and lighthearted but a little too predictable and unrealistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Movie","review":"I bought this DVD after seeing a preview on a flight.Clooney's name draws people into the theater, but I think he is just one of the many actors that put in a flawless performance. If you like seeing plans come together, this movie is for you. I have watched this again and again and each time I notice a new detail. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"OCEAN'S ELEVEN","review":"I'm a big fan of every actor in this movie. I've seen the orginal with Frank Sinatra. I couldn't wait to see this film. When I did I was A little disapointed. It wasn't quite as good as I thought it would be. Julia Roberts who played George Clooney's ex wife didn\\"t have a very big part in the movie.On a scale OF ONE TO TEN. I give it a FIVE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I didn't think I'd like this movie because I know much more than I'd like to about these actors lives thanks to entertainment shows and cheesy news programing. But the movie had a great, fast moving story and I loved it. I just hope George Clooney wasn't kidding when he said Barbra Streisand would appear in the sequel 'Ocean's Twelve.' I think she'd be perfect in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch out! All the hollywood boys are back and together!","review":"An amazing picture featuring the much loved George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck's brother Kasey, and many other characters. Its a wonderful comedy and action adventure. The awesome acting talents all mashed togeher in a movie that will keep you laughing for hours afterwards. Its the type of movie you can watch over and over and never get sick of it! You just keep finding more and more clues you missed the other times that all lead up to the splended ending that leaves you impressed and wanting more. A great movie i recomend fully!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"This movie provides an interesting 90 minutes, particularly if you just want to be entertained. No preaching, no hidden messages, no subtle imagery - just a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"exactly what I expected!","review":"The service was great and the movie was in new condition. And the movie was good also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun movie","review":"The movie unfolds in a deluxe cast is very interesting.blu-ray is a good video and sound so beautiful.I love work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ocean's Eleven is Excellent!","review":"I just love the pure intellegence and planning in this movie. The way everything was planned was cool. George clooney plays the role of ocean who is a thief..he gets out of jail..and the next thing you see him do is try another robbery...three casinos all at once. the thing is he didnt do it for money.. he did it to get back at the guy who took his wife from him. And to show his wife/ex-wife how much she meant to him. You will love the ending.. I know i did."},{"rating":"1","title":"too artificial","review":"Well Cloneey face is really fashioning, and I love to see Elliot Gould on screen, but Julia Robert is a skeleton. And the film is impossible story and Mr Sodelbergh must do something better than remakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"YA..A..A..A..A..A..WN!","review":"A dud pure and simple. Period. Agreed some films call for a suspension of disbelief on the part of the viewer but this is ridiculous. Clooney and Pitt play ultra cool crooks in this ultra cold turkey. They spend their on-screen time looking good and talking smooth while hatching a harebrained plot to rob a casino owned by Andy Garcia, who looks his usual quiet menacing self. There's the mandatory (and wholly unnecessary) love interest in the form of Julia Roberts... what's SHE doing in a dud like this?The only reason I've given this movie 2 stars is because of the star cast.I got so bored watching the movie the first time that I switched it off after the first few minutes. It was only because a friend had lent the DVD to me that I decided to watch it once before returning it. Big mistake.My advice: this film's not worth buying - it's not even worth renting, unless you want to waste a precious couple of hours of your life.You've been warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring and stupid","review":"Just one but great thing about this film: THE CAST.BITT, DAMON, CLOONEY, ROBERTS, GARCIA, AFFLECK(Casey).All this, great actors.But the movie was so stupid and predictable I just wanted to get out of the theater."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome movie!","review":"Oceans Eleven is an awesome movie which includes witty remarks and cool stunts! It is one of my favorite movies (the other, being ZOOLANDER) because it is so funny. Also, it amazes me how smart the group of 11 is in pulling of such a major heist! I am really excited for the sequel, Oceans Twelve, and definetly reccomend this movie. If you haven't seen it yet, you are DEFINETLY missing out on a fun and exciting experience!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie ever","review":"This is my favorite movie of all time and I'm a 15 year old girl, so this movie has not only been seen by adults, but also many teens. I loved the plot, the setting, (that being Las Vegas) and the sexy/billiant cast. The men were all perfect and Julia was the best ever, I can't imagine anyone else in the role. I especially loved Casey Affleck, he is a little known actor who is excellent and should have more roles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good.","review":"At first you wouldn't suspect this movie would be any good but..It is directed well, good plot, good characters... except perhaps the harelipped Julia Roberts that in my opinion had no business being in this movie. The actors are enjoying working together on this movie and it shows, Bernie Mac is not dissapointing in this movie, although he doesn't get much time on camera..., Clooney's acting is superb, he was born to be 'Danny Ocean', Matt Damon puts out a nice performance... what can I say, everyone seems to have a good time acting together..A movie you'll want to watch over and over again. There's a light, comical flow throughout the movie with many witty comments that keep you interested throughout and a touch of sophistication.Not a hard core heist movie like Ronin or The Score for example, but something more relaxed..Worth the money, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Enjoyment!","review":"Ocean's Eleven sets out to please the viewer from beginning to end. It succeeds just splendidly!George Clooney and Brad Pitt work together very smoothly with wit and slickness. They seem to genuinely enjoy working togehter and just sparkle on-screen. The rest of the cast are all-stars, too - Matt Damon, Carl Reiner, Julia Roberts and Andy Garcia. Everyone enjoys a showcase moment that highlights his or her talent.The plot is intricate and exquisitely executed. The story line is suspenseful and thrilling. It is an edge-of-the-seat, popcorn chomping experience that will delight you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun slick spoof to relax with. Not to be taken seriously.","review":"This lighthearted romp of a caper movie is a remake of the successful 1960s film staring Frank Sinatra and the rest of the Las Vegas Rat Pack. The title refers to the name of the lead character, Danny Ocean, played by George Clooney, who assembles a team of 11 men to steal $180 million from a casino. Directed by Steven Soderbergh, the film is a slick spoof all the way, the high profile cast being the glue that holds this film together. There's Brad Pitt and Matt Damon and Julia Roberts and Andy Garcia and Elliott Gould and Carl Reiner. And there was no expense spared on the wardrobe or the glittery sets or the use of modern high tech special effects. Forget about the story; it's not supposed to be real. But yet there's fast paced action and tension throughout as the cast deals with setbacks and complications leading up to and including the caper. It's fun all the way. Just relax and don't take it seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Send the EPA to investigate this Ocean - it stinks!","review":"What a waste! Good actors reciting brain-numbing lines; acting that was flat, uninvolved, and uninspiring. So many good actors given such dreadful lines. Was this movie filmed in parts, based on the actors' availability and schedules? I got the impression that the actors in this movie were not connected to one another when this movie was made. I rented this and the most fun I had was sending it back down the return chute at the video rental store. Ocean's Eleven is a zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Julia Roberts What Were You Thinking???????","review":"Two issues here ..... as a major Julia Roberts fan, it is a shame to see her sell-out. How could she let herself be talked into a 'walk-on' role, surrounded by that much testosterone. She looked lovely, and that was all... a strong non-verbal statement about the value of women everywhere. We count on her for better than that. Then, if the talk shows are true, she demanded the standard $20 million for the \\"work\\". Bad call.The story is an interesting one and could have been fast moving and entertaining with all that star power. But there was no focus, other than the stars, even the soundtrack was a cop-out.How insulting to viewers who actually thought we would be getting something for our movie ticket. I suppose it proves that I am not much of a viewer. They were right....one can make a lousy movie and if the superficial elements look right, we will go and pay to see the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slick but Shallow","review":"This is what passes as entertainment today....Boring....so shallow they couldn't even drown in it....And I want to know who crowned Ms. Roberts....beautiful? Maybe,in another life...but honestly, she looks like she's been hit in the face with a frying pan!.....Save your time and money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ocean's Eleven","review":"What a disappointment! I fought to stay awake this was so boring. The only redeeming qualities were good looks and some witty dialogue. Otherwise, the plot plodded along, the techiques for robbery were predictable and the actors were hugely under-utilized. Don't waste your money; save this one for library check-out!I'm going back to the original rat-pack. At least there was some style of new, hip sophistication underneath it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls Flat","review":"I recently rented the movie; and apparently I'm in a small (but vocal) minority. This movie had lots of star power, but the script gave them no place to go. No chemistry among the stars, either. Many scenes people looked, frankly, bored (... or perhaps the director was going for 'cool'. Who knows?)I'm willing to suspend disbelief for a decent movie, but this movie asks viewers to stop thinking all together. So much of what was done was not even remotely plausible.Too bad. This could have been a great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as exciting as I thought !","review":"I rented the movie and I thought it should be nonstop with a lot of action. The movie had too much dialogue and not that much action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oceans 11 Sinks","review":"The cast had such great potential, so did the plot.Vegas was rarely seen.People huddled in a room doesn't cut it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oceans sleepingpill.","review":"The purpose with the Ocean-movies is to make the filmstars look cool and smart.

Zzzzzzzzzz...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A VERY GOOD CAST!","review":"THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE WITH A GOOD CAST, THAT WILL ENTERTAIN YOU, IT HAS A GOOD PLOT AND STICK'S TO IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kosher Champagne","review":"Clooney and Pitt have never done a lot for me, but here I find them doing a particular shtick that they are very good at. Not unlike Burt Reynolds in \\"Boogey Nights,\\" the guys play smirking jerks and they pull it off. The casting is brilliant: Cheedle is always fun, as is Matt Damon, but the real stars are Elliot Gould, who manages to play his signature role, the shlump, to perfection, and Carl Reiner, who is, in my opinion, the last survivor of the greatest generation of comic geniuses. Reiner has more talent in his pinkie than most actors today. It's all in the timing, no profanity, fabulous facial gestures. His son pulled a great deal of attention away from the grand master himself; it is good to see him again. The entire enterprise works, because the dialog is clever, the story engaging, and the location fits the plot to perfection. Is it a great film? No. It is a Pink Panther-like caper film, with an all-star cast. Were David Niven around, it would be shown nightly in heaven."},{"rating":"1","title":"I FELL ASLEEP","review":"I can't honeslty review this movie, because I fell asleep about 20 minutes into it. I'm a movie freak, really into popular movies, and I never fall asleep in the theatre. However this time I did.I just thought the movie was boring. There was nothing to stay awake for."},{"rating":"1","title":"can't compete","review":"I have seen several remakes of older films done & in my book you can never make a remake as good as the orignal. Why don't film makers realize \\"You Can not replace old movies, no matter who stars in it\\"!."},{"rating":"1","title":"They should have hired a writer","review":"This is probably the worst written movie I've ever seen. There is no character development, the plot is tedious and predictable. The actors walk through their roles like they can't wait to get out of there. I'd avoid this one like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sad state of filmaking","review":"This film was awful. Let's get a whole bunch of big-name actors, throw in Julia and it'll be a blockbuster...NOT. Very poor script, acting and a complete lack of chemistry.

I love the whole series. Looking forward to see some more movies like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Action, less plot","review":"This movie is definitely filled with action from start to finish. However, it's a little skimpy on the plot. Entertaining, but not a memorable movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Viewing Quality","review":"Ocean's Eleven arrived on time, in good condition, and with no problems concerning the shipping and handling.I may have been mislead as to the description of the product. I bought this movie 'used' and its condition was prescribed as 'good.' I figured that since it was labeled as 'good' then the viewing quality would be good. However, there were multiple scenes that would not play due to the extremely scratched nature of the disc. At least three of the scenes in the movie were impossible to watch and when reached during the flow of the film, the screen would pause. I could not change scenes or fast forward from this point. The movie stopped completely and ceased to run.I still made it through the movie by reaching these scratched scenes, stopping completely, then skipping that scene and choosing a previous one in the scene selection part of the main menu. It was frustrating to watch. I will try to improve the disc by waxing it. We'll see what happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable Action Flick","review":"A glittery heist flick that wants desperately to be old-fashioned. It rounds up huge movie stars to fill predictable types, and it has a lot of gloss but not nearly enough camp. Soderbergh busies himself with a lot of retro-style film tricks left untouched sich 1972--wipes and split-screens--and there is a lot of 60's lounge music, but they aren't enough to save the film from staying one big, empty, slick, somewhat entertaining set piece. George Clooney, Matt Damon, and Brad Pitt manage to be more irritating together than separately. Julia Roberts has some witty, rapid-fire Hepburn-and-Tracy style banter with Clooney; as the villain, Andy Garcia is exceptionally well-combed. Despite or perhaps because of its cliches and far-fetchedness, its implausibly narrow escapes and fairy-tale plot devices, the film is almost self-indulgently enjoyable. Thankfully, it is so rapidly paced that its two hours pass by in the blink of an eye."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun rubbish","review":"This film does not bear too much talking or thinking about. It is a predictable and extremely far-fetched film, but still manages to be entertaining. Analyze the plot and it is clearly absurd. But that is not the point of this male oriented kind of film. The actors are \\"cool\\" as is the \\"late-night\\" soundtrack and everyone can say smooth, sassy, lines in improbable situations and spend ridiculous amounts of money and drink lots of cool-looking hard liquor in crystal glasses. Did I say the film was cool? The only difference between this kind of film and many others is that they get away with it - that is because in Hollywood rules they steal from a \\"bad\\" man who has stolen Ocean's girl (the swine!) so it is okay.It is a fun load of nonsense. It was nice to see Elliot Gould reappear (where has he been?) and also Carl Reiner was nice to watch. The best absurdity was the EMF pulse generator - a nuclear device without the destructive power. Hmm."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of film's all time best crime capers!","review":"This is fun from beginning to end...clever, fun, fast and funny. Every component is there: from the direction and writing, to casting and editing....incredible score, effects and production values. In spite of the fact that it's about a huge robbery, it manages to be entertainment devoid of Hollywood-style violence and profanity. A true blockbuster!This bargain DVD includes two great, warts n' all commentary tracks: one smart ass track with Soderbergh and Griffin, the other with 3 of its stars (Damon proves again that he's the smartest, most savvy of today's underestimated film hunks).You won't care that Don Cheadle's dialect coach was overpaid or that, for all her glamour, Julia Roberts still has difficulty walking in high heels...you will love this great movie, again and again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"One of the best remakes I've ever seen. I watched 4 times right away. Have watched many times since. It will definately become a classic remake, even better than the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I frankly can't understand the great buzz about this movie, the reason I went to see it. Besides some nice beefcake and male bonding humor, it was pretty average. None of those guys had a sympathtic enough personality to make me care about his problems, and Julia Roberts seemed like a token."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable remake","review":"In this movie George Clooney plays Danny Ocean, who has just been released from jail. He has two goals--to rob three Las Vegas casinos and to win back his ex-wife (played by Julia Roberts) who is dating the owner of the casinos. He assembles 11 men to help him and they are played by such crowd-pleasers as Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Carl Reiner, and Elliott Gould. The movie is fun, slick and full of high-tech and low-tech gimmicks which help Ocean's 11 gain access to the casinos. My biggest complaint is that Julia Roberts is miscast and underutilized as the trophy wife/girlfriend of the two adversaries. However, if you can put that aside, Ocean's 11 offers an enjoyable evening of entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie Overall","review":"This is a very good movie. However, some parts are better than others. Same with the acting but I still like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie, Good Plot, Great Cast","review":"Ocean's Eleven was a very good movie. I have not been fortunate enough to see the original so my review is based on this movie standing as an original work and not comparing it. The way they introduce the charachters is amusing. It slides into the plot pretty quickly. There are a couple of points in the movie where u might glance at the time, however those are towards the end of the movie. All of the actors seemed to work very well on screen and while i thought that the screen might be bursting with too much talent, such was not the case. I'm willing to bet the actors had a great time filming the movie because it sure was fun and definitly is a movie that should be in any dvd owners collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie with great action!","review":"This movie is a classic remake of the old Ocean's 11. This movie has great actors in it who really hit their parts in this movie. I owned both the Blu-ray along the DVD and the Blu-ray is the way to go! Don't let the 1 and 2 star reviews fool you, anyone who says this movie was poorly written does not know anything about movies or has not seen the first Oceans 11. This movie grossed over 450 million in the theaters alone world wide and not including DVD/Blu-ray sales."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Movie!","review":"I loved this movie so I had to buy it on blu-ray. I think it is the best of the three so it is a must. If you've ever seen a blu-ray movie than you know how great a quality they are. No complaints here."},{"rating":"2","title":"'old on to yer knickers.........'","review":"A cracking film, full of great performances, excellent set-pieces and plenty of tension, however most of this is undone for me by the sheer nail-biting awfulness of Don Cheadle's accent in his patronisingly wanky portrayal of the character 'Basher'. The man surely deserves an award for the worst atempt at a British accent since Dick Van Dyke's benchmark setting, textbook writing cockney stab in Mary Poppins, or 'Merry Bobbins' as he would call it.......Still, Cheadle aside, I really enjoyed this film and would recommend it to everyone, not just as eye candy for the ladies. And Carl Reiner is excellent as Saul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ocean's Eleven","review":"I rate this 4 stars. The story is pretty good, amusing, smart, & detailed. The cast is excellent, hats off to Brad Pitt & George Clooney, Don Cheadle, so many others.....though, I was expecting a bigger role from Julia Roberts, something to really make her talent shine through. Over all, this is very good. A criminal gets out of jail ( George Clooney) & is seeking to rob three casinos,...all owned by the same man...the man who is now with the girlfriend who left HIM.Sound typical & ordinary? No. Which is what makes this movie simply fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"I have not seen the orginal version of this movie, but can imagine that it was not good or there would have not been a need for this remake. The only problem with this movie is George Clooney. He lacks the depth that all great actors must have. It has taken some time, but Brad Pitt is finally coming around as a good Actor and someone I now enjoy seeing on film. Acting aside, this is a good movie. I am really glad that more and more movies are being made where the BAD guys get away. We have seen strides like this before with love stories....Girl Meets boy, Boy and Girl fall in love, Boy or Girl Dies. I can't think of too many people who would watch [movies] like that. But when someone robs three casinos and makes out with the money and the girl and they do it with Class, how could anyone not like that. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good way to spend two hours in front of the TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly BORING!","review":"Despite the star-studded cast this remake drags, big time. I went to see this in the theater and desperately want the [money back] I wasted on this movie back. I didn't think the plot made a whole lot of sense either. So I strongly suggest you skip adding this flop to your video collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Ending","review":"The film was a little stale in the beginning, but by the end of the film, I completely adored it. The film happens to be chocked full of beautiful men, which doesn't hurt either. Brad Pitt and George Clooney do a great job as the center of the film, being the ring leaders. I happen to think that George Clooney steals the show. If you plan to watch the film, the ending makes the entire film worth it. I don't want to spoil it, but it's really, really good! Overall, the film gets a 4/5 because of the somewhat boring beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another \\"Sting\\" movie","review":"We've seen it before but usually done better, we are teased with a few short scenes of Julia Roberts but nothing to wait for"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated Junk!","review":"This is one of the worst films I have seen in recent years. It is very shallow, even by Hollywood blockbuster standards. The \\"plot\\" is unrealistic ... (are there really any criminals who are this nice?). Some say this is one of the greatest casts ever assembled. I don't agree with that. Roberts, Clooney, Damon etc are big stars, yes, but that does not mean they are good actors.

What went wrong Soderbergh?"},{"rating":"1","title":"sinks to the bottom of the ocean","review":"What a steaming pile of horse manure. This film should never have been made the first time, let alone twice. The original was just a vehicle for the rat pack anyway. Why did this film get made? Better still, how did it get made? Well, if the big names commit to it, some schmucks will pour money into anything.

A good, solid, slick, Hollywood big budget production with an all-star cast and in the hands of an assured director. What I like about it is that it never took itself seriously. However, the supposed love between Danny Ocean and his ex-wife Tess is utterly unbelievable. No chemistry between them and no playful confidence and intelligence in Julia Roberts, either. If I were the casting director, I'd pick Cate Blanchett as Tess, because she is sophisticated, altra-cool (in matching with the male cast), stylish, and smartly funny and playful, so to win the attention of a master thief and a wealthy, powerful, being-there-done-that owner of a mega gambling group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clooney and Soderbergh at their best","review":"Daniel Ocean has just been released on parole after 4 years in prison, with 10 other guys he is planning one of the biggest job ever by robbing 3 casinos at the same time.

The movie was fast paced, unpredictable, and a lot of fun to watch, there was never a dull moment. Even though the movie lacked character development, but a decent plot and solid performances by Clooney (as Daniel Ocean,) Roberts (as Tess) and Pitt (as Rusty) more than made up for it, and created an enjoyable experience for me.I've never seen the original and therefore cannot make any comparison with the 1960 film, but I can say for sure that Ocean's Eleven is a great way to spend 2 hours at the theater, and I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ending to the Oceans movies","review":"I love Ocean's Eleven (pass on oceans 12) and oceans 13 is awesome.Great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the talent?","review":"There is a reason why the original version is called a \\"classic.\\" Classics SHOULD not be tampered with and someone in Hollywood told the cast of the terrible remake that they could act.

In other words, the producers must have paid/offered an insane amount of money to all these (usually) top-rate actors -- there's absolutely no other explanation for it.George Clooney and Brad Pitt basically phone their performance in, while Matt Damon runs over during the intermission. And for Pete's sake, if Julia Roberts grows any more teeth, they'll have to go vertical.It's the most banal buddy movie that's completely implausible, has no depth and the quickest wrap-up you'll ever see.RENT it (if you must) -- save your money and do NOT buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does everyone like this?","review":"This film was neither interesting nor entertaining. It was just boring. The scenes were not exciting, the jokes weren't funny. Julia Roberts, who is talked about in the film like she is the most beautiful woman alive, seemed fairly ugly in this movie to me. The characters were hollow and uninteresting. Some have said that they liked seeing how it all came together at the end, and I did too, but not nearly enough to make me like this awful awful movie. I went to see this movie expecting to see a movie that wasn't good but was entertaining and fun to watch. It was not. I repeat, it was not.-One last note: The coloring irritated me. There were no particular colors or changes in coloration throughout, nothing done with the color that was consistent at all. After Soderbergh films like Traffic and Erin Brockovich this was something I was looking for. The only element of consistency I saw was that in every scene, the colors present were intensified.

The story is predictable and unoriginal. The acting is average and the only thing worth seeing is the technology and special effects, which of course is used to help drown out the boring storyline. Andy Garcia plays a good bad guy, but that is about it. Also the film does not do a good job of explaining what exactly happens at the end of the movie. Also, what is up with the appeal of Julia Roberts? I will never get that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, GREAT movie!","review":"I cannot tell you how well this movie was made! It just screams genious! It's not a family movie, I can say that- the scene with a hooker, and some other things are really not intended for little John who's 12 or 10 years old, but it's great for mature teens who want to see a little 'heist' without any guns, guts, or gore! Yes it's glorifing robbery, but who cares? The way George Clooney and cast do the robbery, at the end you really want them to pull it off!THE NUTSHELL: Buy this movie- if you have any doubts, I think you won't be dissapointed! The only people who hate this movie are like my Mom, and you don't want to be in that category!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want my opinion!","review":"I thought this movie was great.

We have a great cast, with a great score and brilliant direction from Steven...he doesn't seem to dissapoint me.Great video quality with some good extras. The commentary does seem to dissapoint me, both of them do. Damon and Pitt are funny, but that's about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great form of Soderbergh entertainment!","review":"This was a fairly enjoyable film with a good deal of suspense. Good acting and clever dialogue make this an entertaining movie to watch. Though it lacked the thing that most major successful motion pictures have, the acting was better than it could be and the story wasn't bad. Also, David Holmes music was exceptionally great and created the right kind atmosphere that was needed in the film to create suspense in the movie. Though it isn't a movie only suitable for adults, children would probably get bored when they watch this flick. The film is slightly dragged at the beginning but it didn't take long for the suspense to build up. Overall it's an exciting movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"This is a great movie. It keeps you guessing and has a great twist to it. I would really recommend it to anyone.

The heist is well setup and planned by the writer, and its execution is even more scintillating and brilliant. Some ideas in the movie are a bit far-fetched for our times, such as the electromagnetic pulse device, but the movie, however, is well worth the two hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made him happy!","review":"My nephew loves this movie.

Worth renting later only if there's a great special bargain price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Remake EVER!!!!","review":"This film has a bad story, a big budget cast that cant act, and a good director. I was very excited to see this remake of this 1960 classic RAT PACK caper,because I loved the first one and after seeing this I went home and watched the original but all a side let's get back to this remake. The first 45 minutes of this film were good, but by the time they got to the heist I wanted to leave the teather, one thing I loved about the movie was the sharp classy dressing by Brad Pitt, George Cloony, and Carl Reiner, It was good to see Elliott Gloud and Carl Reiner back on the big screen after all these years that's one thing Hollywood should do more often because there part of the reason I gave this movie two stars, but i think the biggest problem was just these two things (too many actors with no room to act) and (not enough chemistry between the actors) if this movie would have had that much i think it would have been as good as the first one ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"no","review":"I tried to watch this movie but after the first seconds of hearing Clooney's voice I got sleepy.

It is just one out of many."},{"rating":"1","title":"This becomes more and MORE unbelievable as it goes","review":"Flashy but typical remake of the 1960 Frank Sinatra film about ex-con Clooney, who is just out of prison and already planning yet another heist. This time on three hot-shot Vegas casinos, worth one-hundred and fifty million smackers. He also plans to win back his ex-wife (Roberts) from cut-throat casino executive (Garcia). Not only do they expect us to believe that Clooney is the good guy but also that Julia Roberts is actually worth over $150,000,000. To make things worse, the ending looks as if it was rejected from an episode of DAYS OF OUR LIVES. How can anyone care for such unlikeable characters?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I tried to put \\"no\\" stars in but it wouldn't let me so, I give it a GENEROUS \\"1\\" and here is why: Take a decent tale that takes some imagination, great stars, great locations and an audiences desire to see such a film and make it into the slowest, boring piece of drecht! I blame the director, who it appears wanted all his actors to play it \\"cool\\" and laid back - so most of the film sounds like people causaualy rehearsing lines.. absolutely no energy!

More reccomended for older people."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Well put together\\"","review":"Ocean's eleven is a well put together movie. It was well directed and acted out. There is also a good story line. I think the best part of the movie was the ending. It made you think, and what happens is totally unexpected. There are a few drawbacks however. The story is very unlikely to happen. There are also some parts that move slowly. This movie is for the thinker, not for one who craves action. Buit I would still highly recomend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAD....REALLY A PITIFUL VIEWING","review":"I can't believe Pitt, Roberts and Clooney stooped to this type of acting.

Never having seen the original with the RAT PACK, I could tell that it would stand out on it's own.

I couldn't help but love it. Plus Julia Roberts and Matt Damon, who could ask for anything more.

It's an amazingly cool and complex tale of a man on parole who gets 10 men together and attempts to pull off a heist on three casinos. This movie made me laugh and worry and wonder. The plot is suprisingly complicated, so I wouldn't take anyone under 12. If you haven't yet, watch Ocean's Eleven!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"It's rare that you see a film where the cast seemed to have fun with making the film and outside of it.

Fun movies don't get any better than this.The video transfer is very nice. There is the occaisonal artifact, but that's a common occurrence anymore. The audio is best in 5.1 Dolby Digital, catching every bit of sound and shaking the room. The extras sadly are not quite up to par. The feature-length commentary by the actors is better than Steven Soderbergh's. It's too bad there aren't any deleted scenes or anything else.

Yes, the basic storyline is there, yes it is well acted, yes the story has great potential, but I've seen better editing and scene transitions in High School productions. I forced myself to sit through the whole thing in hopes that it would get better, but it didn't. Additionally the movie is so dark in places I felt like turning on the lights in my home theater just to see what was happening.If you really are considering purchacing this film then I recommend that you run down to Blockbuster and rent it first just to be sure that you arn't going to regret your purchace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here's a brilliant idea...!","review":"This movie actually feels as though Clooney and Soderbergh had started with the premise -- Here's a brilliant idea!

George Clooney seems bored. Brad Pitt looks like he regrets agreeing to join this mess. There is no chemistry between any of the actors. The dialogue is trite, stale, and lazy. The photography is mediocre and the settings are cliched. One dreary scene follows another, to be followed in turn by another, and then another. Nothing crisp, nothing fresh, nothing original. \\"Ocean's 11\\" is a very weak echo of the wonderful caper movies of the 1960s. If Soderbergh doesn't like caper movies, then why did he bother to remake the genre's quintessential example? Is this really the director who made \\"The Limey\\" and \\"Traffic\\"? Hard to believe. Avoid \\"Ocean's 11\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING AND OBNOXIOUS.","review":"I am a big fan of George Clooney and Andy Garcia.

This whey powder is unflavored, but I would say it has a mild taste that is easily masked by whatever you mix it in. It does not affect the texture or thickness of the food or drink it is mixed with. Overall, its a good product and I will probably use it for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Whey powder","review":"I use this in my smoothies (and often my coffee) every day and I couldn't be happier with it.

Protein drinks are never AMAZINGLY delicious, and quite often I almost gag just trying to drink them. This one is so mild and so plain. It's also the best protein I've found that is the \\"most protein for the least calories\\". I just put a couple scoops in a simple bottle (no weird mixer ball necessary), add water, shake for a few moments, and chug it down. Is it like a delicious milkshake? Of course not. But to make a protein drink taste like a delicious milkshake, it also becomes EXTREMELY calorie dense.My theory, get my protein from this simple powder and water, and then get my calories from DELICIOUS food, not \\"sort of tolerably delicious\\" protein drinks/shakes/bars/etc.Works for me. I recently tried a cheaper Vanilla Cream powder and about died....I'm now (once again) a LOYAL fan of this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Optimum Nutrition Any whey protein powder","review":"Optimum Nutrition's Any whey protein powder is a great means of adding protein to your diet. It can be mixed with oatmeal before cooking, for instance, to make a complete, balanced breakfast. It can be used cold to make nutritious shakes. For those who can't digest casein milk proteins or soy proteins, it is a means to get the benefits of the whey milk proteins. It is not flavored with chocolate or vanilla or other flavors, so it does not add those to foods. On the other hand, one could easily add those flavors on the occasions when they are wanted. I have used this product daily for many years and highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff","review":"Since Any Whey is virtually tastless--I start my morning with a scoop of Any Whey in my coffee with coffee mate.

The label says you can cook with it, mix it into soups, etc. etc. Well, I've been using protein powder as a supplement for decades and I'm very disappointed. This powder clumps and sticks together worse than anything I've ever used. It does work well in cold drinks if you mix it with a blender but even after mixing it with water and a blender before putting it in hot soups or oatmeal it clumps and froths sort of like cooked egg whites. So sorry I spent so much money on this stuff. I'll put up with the vanilla flavoring from my other protein powder from now on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great item","review":"I used to be able to buy this in the store but when they stopped carrying it I found it on Amazon.

It has a slight taste to it, but what do you expect when you by protein powder. Buy it because its the healthy version out there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this stuff","review":"I wanted an unflavored protein supplement that I could add to a variety of foods like soup or protien shakes. This product is perfect. It dissolves well and has a very pleasant odor. It's really good in tomato soup. As other's have noted, it does add a creaminess. As a highly lactose intolerant person, I can vouch that it does not contain lactose (at least enough to cause symptoms).I'd like to share my own personal protein shake recipe: 1 cup orange juice, 1 scoop Any Whey, 1 cup ice, (optional) handful of blueberries or strawberries.

In my car, at my house, walking to class, always. That's how good it is. The Light is one of my favorite love songs of all time. On some of Common's earlier albums I thought that he was just trying to sound like he was smarter than other MC's. On this album he proves that he is smarter, and that I was the one trying to sound smart. Plus, he gets much love for the D'Angelo laced Ghetto Heaven, Pt. 2.

All i want to know is what is the big deal with being true to hip-hop. I mean if someone from the westcoast puts out an album with g-funk it's considered commercial or fake.Where do people get the idea that G-funk is not real.People dont understand the skill in producing a g-funk or P-funk track, but when someone from the eastcoast comes out with an album with lame repetitive beats and lyrics that revolve around similes and metaphors people seem to dig it. I'm sick of people now days talking about the significance of hip-hop and how so many rappers lack true hip-hop skills. I agree if you enjoy listening to depressing music and rap with no sign of flow then this album is for you.

So many rappers today are all about material possessions and don't give a damn about the children that look up to them. Common is different. He uses the mic as a way to vent his anger and just share his views about subjects that affect our very own lives. And for that I would like to say thank you to Common, dead prez, Mos Def, The Roots, and many other philosophical rappers that keep it real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic chicago Rap!","review":"Soulful, meaningful, classic are all words that will describe this release. You can tell when an artist puts his heart and soul in the lyrics of a song because it comes off dope as hell and becomes classic material. That is exactly what common did.

If you don't have this one your collection is suffering."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Sound, Same Flow !","review":"Long time listeners of Common may get caught off guard a little bit with the new sound of this album instead of the conventional sampling of tracks this time he uses live instrumentation on majority of the tracks but he still drops the science only like he knows how..

That being said, I think that Like Water for Chocolate embodies the best of what I feel hip hop has to offer: consciousness, clever lyrics, experimentation and good beats. The first single I heard from this CD was the Premier-produced 6th Sense. \\"If I don't like it I don't like it, that don't mean that I'm hating\\" became my new mantra when discussing music that did not move me. From the unconventional rhyme style on Funky For You to the tongue-in-cheek Film Called (Pimp) with MC Lyte to the back-and-forth with Mos Def on Question, Common provides a complete CD that remained in my changer for almost a year, and still gives a good listen. Less experimental than the later Electric Circus and farther reaching than his earlier One Day It Will All Make Sense, Like Water for Chocolate should occupy a place in any hip-hop head's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well made","review":"I initially bought this for \\"the light\\"...My favorite track on it.The rest of the album isn't that exciting, as most of the songs sound similar musically.

I think this music is an acquired taste, something that after repeated listening will be more appreciated and understood as well crafted music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended","review":"This should really be three and a half stars, but it's closer to four than three. Common's album has two sides to it--his delivery is highly enjoyable, and his topic matter is quite refreshing in this rap world of \\"murder, murder, murder.\\" However, I'm not a big fan of the beats on this album. Jaydee's beats just don't mesh well with Common's great delivery. The best track is definitely \\"The 6th Sense\\" which happens to be produced by DJ Premier, but \\"Doonit\\" is pretty good, too. Other than that, there are no real standout tracks, but no tracks are really weak, either. Again, his delivery is great, but the production is the downfall (and the reason this CD doesn't just get 5 stars). That said, I still recommend the CD AFTER you get Common's \\"One Day It'll All Make Sense.\\" However, if you really liked D'Angelo's latest or if you liked the Slum Village, then I would recommend this CD to you unconditionally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average at Best","review":"I Like Common's Vibe as a Lyricist&Rapper but the Music feels too Much Like Formula.IRespect Quest-Love The Roots&Crew but I'm Getting tired Of Hearing Q&D'angelo on everything.they should have made his Album More Original for a 5 year Wait.Quest didn't give D'angelo Nothing as far as Beats so I Knew it would be Worse for Common and it is.COMMON reminds Me of ICE CUBE in The early 90's when his voice would hit but the music was wack.same case here.I Prefer One Day It'll Make Sense Better Overall.Still COMMON can Drop SCIENCE he just needs The Best Production to make it hit all the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about damn time","review":"common has always had a nice flow, but his previous albums had awful beats. but this cd flows the whole way through. it is on par w/ the solo joints he's done on other groups cd's."},{"rating":"1","title":"another boring record","review":"i used to love common (sense), just like he used to love h.e.r., but common comes of terribly in this record; the beats all sound the same and the lyrics are both boring and hypocritical while maintaining a nausiating self-righteousness. there is something seriously wrong with common, i really don't think he would have released this record if he were well. it does not surprise me that the public likes this record, it just saddens me. this is the post-rawkus common, with ready made lyrics and beats for the masses (but packaged so as to make them believe they aren't the masses but part of a renegade hip hop club). trust me this album is TERRIBLE, and this is coming from a long time hip hop fan who once considered common his favorite MC. things have changed...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Soul Music","review":"People just hit play and let the raps move you. common went all out on LWFC.

The entire novel felt like attending a dinner party only to end up stuck next to a guest who rattles on all night about the soporific irrelevant. Others praised it, but to me, the humor felt strained--as if, page after page, the author was trying way too hard to be clever.

It's to bad Jay only had a few really good songs to work with. How could you have a hit like \\"Come a little Bit closer\\" or \\"This Magic Moment\\" and then record all the junk songs around them?

I could rave on and on about his voice, which comes through wonderfully on this CD.Most of their biggest hits are here, like the incomparable \\"Cara Mia\\" and \\"Come a Little Bit Closer\\". Also here is one of my heartfelt favorites, the tragic \\"She Cried\\". While not as commercially successful as other songs, this was ... Obsison-like in its tragedy.I took away one star, though, because another Jay & the Americans collection called \\"Originals\\" (also available on Amazon) has a handful more songs. Some, like \\"Let's Lock the Door\\" were commercial successes. Others were not as popular, but equally as good.Either, way, though, you cannot go wrong with these guys or therse collections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!!

Where to start... well the anime takes place in between Devil May Cry 1 and 4, and it works to bridge the two stories together. Each episode has it's own story, with a series-long storyline in the background until the last couple of episodes. The great part about this series is that it shows Dante's life as a demon mercenary rather than him inadvertently following in Sparda's footsteps in defeating a major threat. Madhouse and Capcom did a great job appealing to fans as well, as they brought back Lady and Trish for the storyline. There is quite a bit of character development in Dante's sidekick in the series, Patty, but other than that the recurring characters are the same that fans know and love.I give this anime a 4 out of 5 only because I wish there were more episodes and I wanted to see a bit more of what Dante exhibits in the video games. Other than that a must-see!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"First episode was good, then it was all downhill.

Weak as in not very exciting, I could almost guess the plot when it reached the halfway mark. The only funny thing is when Dante is in the prison but I will not spoil it for anyone who really does want to see it. I just felt they could have done something different. There were only one or two fight sequences the last one was pretty good but the first one bored me to death.

My husband and I have been married twice, divorced once(you read right) and not once has HE had a wedding band. His job requires extensive use of his hands with small parts. This ring will withstand the dings other rings may be subject too. Since my husband isn't into the shine and sparkle of gold and diamonds, I was looking at white gold and saw this ring. I may buy it for him. Of course I need to finish my scouting first but this #1 so far. I think it's a beautiful, practical wedding band for any man who uses his hands a lot at work. Since this will be the first band he gets, I want it to be special, and I'm on a budget of 500 dollars so that works. This is a one of a kind.

This book muddles the concept of \\"natural\\" and \\"native\\" to the point that an inexperienced gardener is likely to plant invasive, non-native plants and never realize they have created a disaster where they hoped to create environemental harmony in their yard. Awhile after the fact they may realize what has happened - I speak to disappointed homeowners often.Diekelman's book of the same title is much better, especially for folks in the Midwest.It is somewhat techincial, so may be a little dense for beginners, but at least it won't cause mistakes, disappointment and regret."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prejudist's view with age old myth","review":"I have watch this show and did not like it due to the fact that it makes cats look like a criminal.

Which resulted in him disliking cats. It is to my oppinion that this video teaches a kid how to be prejudice.

I would understand if the CATS are the ones who chase and kill DOGS, but it's the other way around and they STILL make cats the enemy! And it's not only in this movie that they make cats the enemy, it's happened in a ton of other movies (ex: Lady and the Tramp, Cinderella, Tom and Jerry, The Great Mouse Detective). No offense to you dog-lovers out there, but cats are actually smarter that dogs (face the facts) and this movie makes them look stupid (and you CAN train a cat to do tricks, I've done it with my cat. It's just that cats work for treats and dogs work for praise). I am a cat-lover and I think that this movie is extremely unfair to cats. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE IF YOU ARE A CAT-LOVER!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's OK","review":"This is not exactly a cool movie.

That's no news. But no one could have guessed how far this animosity would go. When a professor invents a formula that will stop people being allergic to dogs, the cat population is horrified. Foreseeing a future where no one wants a cat as a pet, they decide something has to be done. And that something is drastic. Led by evil genius Mr Tinkles who looks like a direct descendant of Dr No's cat, they come up with a plan to steal the formula, invert it effects and make everyone in the world allergic to dogs. Tobey Maguire is the voice of Lou, the cute beagle pup entrusted with guarding the potion from the feisty felines. Crazy fun and mayhem ensues and will no doubt keep kids of all ages entertained. But best of all, is watching our furry friends use computers, flying planes and excelling in martial arts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cats and Dogs","review":"This movie is very entertaining for my grand daughters.

I also have a Persian cat and I thought the animation would be wonderful. Well, to put it bluntly - if you have a Persian, DO NOT see this movie. To see that beautiful face in a hideous, twisted form is heartbreaking. But enough..what about the film? Disappointing. I was expecting a lot more from the story line and a lot less of stupid, mean-spirited behavior. I did not enjoy seeing a dog run into a glass wall; nor did I enjoy see a cat flying into an open window and crashing, etc. My kids will not be seeing this film, into the trash can it goes.

And also I should mention that I haven't seen the whole thing -- my wife and I walked out of the theater after about a 1/2 hour. Obviously it wasn't meant to be War and Peace or other high-brow theatrics, but I've seen some great movies oriented towards the younger audience, most recently Spy Kids which is a classic in my book (if you haven't already seen this one I strongly recommend it). I actually had rather high hopes for Cats & Dogs, it seemed so cute in the previews. But it's just too juvenile, not particularly great special effects for the pets, certainly not good acting (esp. not from Goldblum). Anyway, what more can I add to the fact we walked out of the theater. I think younger set, probably 8-10 and under, might like it, but if you're an adult who often likes the innocence and fun of Disney/Spy Kids/et. al. I'd say this one isn't worth the try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prejudice movie!","review":"This movie is NOT good for the kids! It teaches them how to be prejudice and will probably result in them hating cats! Cats are actually really sweet animals, like the complete opposite of what's shown in the movie. People, you shouldn't get this for your kids unless you want to teach them prejudism.Besides, the movie is full of lame, dry humor that's not funny at all. I saw it at a friend's house and I practically had to force myself to stay awake through the whole thing!It's not that I don't like dogs, cause I do, but this movie is a bad influence for the kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible and misleading.","review":"I saw this movie in theaters when I was 9 because it seemed like a cute story: Cats and dogs in a fight with each other to take over the world. BOY were those commercials misleading. Even back then, I HATED all of those stupid cats and dogs and race cliches. You don't know how tired I am of seeing evil siamese cats that look asian and have funny accents. I would never want my children watching this garbage.

It's fairly entertaining for a parent to watch also, unlike a lot of kid's movies. My husband and I especially enjoyed this movie since we have 2 beagles and 2 cats. The special effects that animate the animal's faces are well done. The story is cute and coherent. If you are a pet lover or your child likes pets, get this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, fun, cute","review":"This is a great movie! We all sat together to watch this movie and really enjoyed. We loved the characters, the dogs and the cats. It was especially cute when they showed the dogs wearing earphones and the cats dressed in spy suits carrying messages. I agree that the plot of cats battling with dogs is a little bit strange, but other than that, the movie was great! We have watched this movie over and over again and can never stop! The voices that were chosen for the animals are very good, too. What I also liked about the movie was that there was not too much violence. Their is a little bit at the end of the movie, but the rest, just pure fun!

It focuses on dogs like they are the saviors of humanity and cats are terrible,wicked,mean,cruel and evil. The only three words that dogs rely on to survive as heros in this movie is MAN'S BEST FRIEND. I have five cats and NO DOGS AT ALL and this film promotes what I call 'cat racism'. A friend who makes cat comics has told me that dog people are jealous of cat people so they make stuff like this to 'get even'. I don't recommend this piece of trash to anyone,even dog people because the beagle gets pushed around and thrown in different ways. So do the cats. This is the usual garbage that WB makes,so I would recommend cat lovers toss this aside and get WB's better work,Cats Don't Dance,or dog lovers to get Shiloh,My Dog Skip(touching) or the classic,Old Yeller."},{"rating":"2","title":"CATS & DOGS rule!","review":"How cute is this movie? Very cute! I enjoyed it a lot. The special effects are great. It's basically about cats wanting to take over the world and it's up to the dogs to stop them. Yes, they talk which makes it even better! CATS & DOGS is filled with laughs from start to finish. The interations between the cats, dogs, and humans are hilarious and well done. CATS & DOGS battle it out in this slapstick comedy.

Do you want to be a secret agent????"},{"rating":"2","title":"Might not be the favorite of cat lovers, but...","review":"Might not be the favorite of cat lovers (cats play the bad guys here), but this movie definitely will entertain you. It's about a struggle between cats and dogs for world domination, but depicted in a way that suits both kids and grown-ups with a sense of humor.

I mean, the technological factor really was blown out of proportion. If humans can't even do these things, how will these animals do it. But that's what movies is about, right?

I like dogs because they let you pet them when they're sleeping. I had a cat that got angry over every little thing you drop a bowl of his food accidentally and if he saw you he would attack. Sure dogs can attack too but they only want to wrestle and they may destroy everything but that's only because the're bored. Cats destroy stuff too you know they scratch and grab and scratch everything up.

The only drawback I found was that the general construction directions are at the front of the book (same technique for all) and then the various projects follow with some added instructions and/or references to the front.

On the one hand, it delivers what it promises: a biography of the adventurer, criminal, spy, and policeman Eugene Vidocq. On the other hand, the book is so badly written that it makes reading about this fascinating man a chore. Although the book is organized (I use the term loosely) more or less chronologically, the narrative sporadically jumps forward in time at several points, such that I often found myself looking back through the last coupe of pages I'd read to make sure I hadn't missed anything. I put the book aside in frustration and/or confusion more than once, and it took me several attempts to slog through the entire thing.

Nathan McCall holds nothing back and puts it all on the table. He's very honest about his anger and other feelings towards himself, his friends and whites. I found myself apalled at his actions and attitude before he went to prison. Then while he's in prison and sees the need for change, you really start rooting for him to succeed. I liked how honest he was because you saw how thick the racism was back then. I couln't believe racism was still heavy in the 80's. It shows you how ignorant people are and how the racism took its toll on Nathan and the black community. I read this book for a college class but I'm glad this book was the assignment.

I read the first third of this book, then pages here and there, and I was disgusted. I was digusted the same why as when I read American Psycho years later, but at least in AP's defense, it was FICTION. This book had potential, it could've been a real look at a system that doesn't care about the people that are in it, how he rose above all of this and achieved anyway. But Mr. Mcall seems happy just telling us how it's everybody's fault but our own, and \\"did I tell you the time I gang-raped this girl?\\" \\"Or how it was some girl's fault that she got pregnant, and I'm not taking care of it\\". This book marked my one and only failed class in college, I refused to finish it. I let my mother read some of it, and after she read about 10 pages, she completely supported my decision. There are much better books about the human condition, don't waste your time here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book detailing the frustrations of black males.","review":"Nathan McCall has written a awesome book detailing the frustrations of being black and male in the 1970s and much of what he felt then, is the same frustrations that our males are still faced with in today's society. McCall givesmore than enough realism as he depicts his life from the oldNathan to becoming the new Nathan. It is indeed a challenge and through the book he keeps hope alive and tries to do the right thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Finish Reading","review":"I have been an avid reader all of my life but I can't finish reading this book. I can go no further than page 49. This man and anybody like him should be locked up for life, his parents should be in the next cell!!!!! I am a Black woman, the mother of black men, but this book has depressed me and changed the way I think of life forever. Where were the parents, the teachers, churches, and the leaders of the community? My heart goes out to the Black women whose lives could not have turned out as well as Nathan McCall. I cannot think well of Nathan McCall or any other men like him, no way!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Profiting from pedophilia","review":"I have some serious ethical concerns about this book. While I admire the author for turning his life around and for the positive things he does to educate people about race relations, it is fundamentally unethical for him to profit from his crimes by writing them down and selling them to people. One major point of this book is his detailed confession of violent crimes, such as participation in the gang rape of a 13 year old girl. Every book that is sold advances this author professional and financially, thus allowing him to launch his professional career and bank account on the back, so to speak, of a child.People who participate in the rape of children should not get paid to report that experience: they should get imprisoned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nathan McCall is a racist given a free pass because he is black","review":"Nathan Mcall boasts of hunting and assaulting whites and pounding them into the sidewalks during his youth. He doesn't change his attitude as he grows older. Late in the book Nathan Mcall runs into an old buddy and the two black gentlemen, now well dressed and well employed with Nathan having received awards in' journalism for his work over his career, have a nice dinner in a popular restaurant. The topic of the conversation? How good it really felt to pound on the whites back in the day."},{"rating":"1","title":"racist book by a lowlife loser","review":"it's amazing (and a testament to mistaken guilt in this 'free speech' (at least in one direction) country) that something like this could get published. this racist piece of trash (mccall) makes all blacks look bad. it's too bad that with >75% of all black kids growing up in single parent 'families' they will probably never be told that they have a duty as a human being to be responsible for their actions. where are you, dr. king???? your beauty and power will never be forgotten..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book I have Ever Read","review":"This is truely a masterpiece.

He's seen and done it all from gang beatings, to murder, robbery, and rape, but he can only keep his head above the water for only so long. He gets arrested and becomes a rehabilitated man as where he writes his own novel in prison, which is the very same exact book that you probably have in your hand.

Needs to be read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insightful & Irresponsible","review":"I first read this book in 1995 when it was released. Mr. McCall's struggle out of poverty and achievement of success as a reknowned journalist sets an excellent example.However, I was consistently surprised and dismayed by how he refuses to take responsibility for his actions as a youth, instead blaming white society for his troubles. This is a disturbing thread that continues throughout the book, and causes me to wonder if Mr. McCall really learned anything from his experiences, other than blaming everyone else for whatever problems you face in life."},{"rating":"1","title":"chmod 000 thisbook","review":"Not what i expected.I expected an overview of Linux aimed at the \\"Rest of Us\\":a.

Well, the social and philosophical speculation is intriguing; the glamor of the musician's life is attractive.

I am still waiting on codes for Castlevania Harmony of Dissonance.

I was really looking forward to reading something by Anita Blake as I heard so many great things about her books, but I could not even finish this book. (that is not common for me). I read over half of the book hoping that it would improve and it did not.This started off sounding pretty promising....a case that involved a dead man's wife and mistress (who are now friends). Quickly though, the case seems to be left behind. I found Meredith was having (mostly meaningless) sex with pretty much every male creature she encounterd. I like the supernatural type books, but some of the creatured were a bit over the top.Very disappointing. I did purchase the audio version of this book (I was pretty sure I would like it) and the reader was okay, but did not like the way she portrayed the male characters.I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book I've Read in 30 Years","review":"I have been a fan of science fiction since I was 10 and rapidly adapted to fantasy just after college. This is perhaps the worst trash I have ever read. I actually stuck with the book to the end because I felt a book so highly rated ... would eventually recover. The book has absolutely no plot, none! With science fiction and adult fantasy you have to develop a believable world with a set of rules that seem to fit. There are no rules here, and this world is strictly helter skelter. Finally, although I can occasionally enjoy a good sex scene, this piece of trash is nothing but one soft porn scene after another and take my word for it this porn is BORING! Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clothes and sex, clothes and sex.... zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"I have loved some of Hamilton's other works, specifically the early books of the Anita Blake series. She has created an entire reality that incorporates the creatures of myth and legend into every day life, and has done so in an entertaining, engaging and believable manner.That said, this book was not up to par. I felt like Hamilton was more preoccupied with what everyone was wearing and how much bonking was going on than with, say, writing a story? With a plot? I was bored and had to force myself to finish it.Merry has the potential to be a great character, but she needs to be in more than an erotic fashion show to lure me back.Next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fair to middlin","review":"Pretty good stuff in here.. I was borderline 3 or 4 stars for this, so when in doubt, I will give the benefit... I like the Faerie princess who is displaced angle, and the palace intrigue and strange bedfellows can keep you guessing.Plus what guy wouldnt like to read about a woman who likes it a little rough ? Come on, the sex in this book is HOT, if sometimes a bit overblown. Sometimes even to the point of the sex scenes seeming like the sex in a slasher movie, in that they can detract from the story, rather than move the story forward."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!","review":"Wow, is all I have to say. Laurell K Hamilton has moved into an entirely new realm of writing but has still managed to let me lose myself to the real world. Never before have I gotten lost so deeply in a book! This book is just as good as the Anita Blake series but in a different way. I look forward to reading the 2nd book! Way to go!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money.","review":"If you want to read a book about sexual escapades, this is the book for you. If you prefer a little plot with your books, pass on this one. Had this been the first Laurell Hamilton book that I had read, I would never have picked up another. The early Anita Blake books were excellent, however I think the writer has begun to believe that all we readers want are sex fantasies. That has made up more and more of her latest books. The action was always the best part, there really was none in this. This one was just pure trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Erotic, sexy, and definitely a departure from Anita Blake!","review":"To be frank, I actually prefer the Anita Blake books, but only because I really enjoy the gritty, bloody world portrayed therein. However, _A Kiss of Shadows_ certainly has its place on my bookshelf. The prose is definitely sexier than in the AB books, and much of it is actually sensual and erotic as opposed to out-and-out sex (as one of the other reviewers pointed out). Ms. Hamilton has painted a twilit world of sensual beings in this book, intertwining fey politics and Unseelie violence. I would love to see where Ms. Hamilton is going to take this series -- I'm quite sure that her readers will be in for an adventure. That said, I found that this first book is setting up the backdrop for the rest of the series.All in all, though, I really did enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"FROST FROST FROST FROST FROST","review":"I have a new favorite character.

A poor excuse for not being able to write a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"trash","review":"A friend gave me this book to read. Thank God I didn't buy it. This is a pornographic version of a penny dreadful. It seems to consist solely of sex scenes ( I cannot say erotic because that implies some degree of artistry)loosely strung together by an unfathomable plot centered around unlikeable characters. I could not finish-just gave up and threw it in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I really loved this book, although it took me a while to get use to the fae people and their way of life, which is VERY different from ours. Once I did I fell in love with this book. Although I did feel that the ending was a little abrupt, but no fear there is a sequel in the works. Meridith is suppose to be dead for she ran away fearing for her life years ago. Once found her Aunt who is Queen and the rest of the Fae world finds out she is still alive. It is a race to see who gets to her first, with her life in the balance she has no idea who to trust. The Queen does turn a fast one on Meridith that left her having no choice but to return to the life she left behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Life Changer!","review":"All I have to say about this book is that it is the BOMB! I could not put it down and when I finally did finish it I went directly back to page 1. I almost read it a third time, but thought that was a bit obsessive. I am waiting with bated breath on the sequel. This is actually the 1st fantasy book I have read and as strange as it may sound it changed my life in more ways then one...literally. The characters are wonderful and add a slightly different twist on the Fae that you are not used to seeing. This book is filled with lust, passion, danger, action, comedy...need I really go on. My favorite was Doyle. UUHH!!! He made me wish I was Meredith. I really can't wait for the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Kiss of Shadows","review":"Fairies and magic, goblins and brownies, buff, handsome males and bold sensuous women all make up the world of A Kiss of Shadows; a fun imaginative fairy tale for adults.On reading the first few pages it takes some getting used to the writing style and content, but once you are drawn into this world of magic and atypical characters you will find it nearly impossible to put the book down. This book makes you want to belong to this mystical imaginative melee of a world where anything is possible and no one is as they seem."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fae -- As you have NEVER seen them before!","review":"Laurell K Hamilton's books have always been captivating. Hamilton features strong, self-sure women who aren't afraid to stand up and fight for what they believe. Kiss Of Shadows' Princess Meredith Nic Essus is no different. A mortal princess caught up in the immortal world of Faerie, \\"Merry Gentry\\" has spent years hiding from her blood-thirsty relatives. When her identity is revealed, she has no choice but to return to court and face her inherited destiny. As an heir to the throne however, she has many enemies, and few friends who can be trusted.

It's like Cinderella meets Hamlet via Tracey Lords! Incredible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Off the beaten path...","review":"This was classic Hamilton work and I'm looking forward to the next sequel. I was at first disappointed because I was into her vampire world so deeply that moving to a fairy world was a bit of a jolt, but after reading the book, I'm beginning to find intrigue in this story and a have a lot of unanswered questions, which of course Laurell does on purpose to keep us all going to the next book! I have recommended all her previous books to all who say they like that sort of thing (some can't handle the sex or the violence), but I've loved everything she wrote and am looking forward to more! Thanks, Laurell!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk About A Sellout!","review":"I've been reading Laurell K. Hamilton since the Nightseer book came out and I was in Middle School. I would buy the Anita Blake books the first day they were available at the book store and stay up until 5 am reading them. I love the writting style and the plots within both Nightseer and the Anita Blake books. This new series is a serious disappointment to me. It seemed as if sex was the focus of the book and plot and character development were thrown to the wayside. Everytime I thought the book was moving toward character development or \\"gasp\\" plot, more sex! This is nothing like I expected and I think that Ms. Hamilton could do a lot better. I realize that it's hard to stay creative with editors breathing down your back, but that's the way to keep an audience - stay true to your genre and don't sell out for a buck."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good start to an excellent series","review":"A Kiss of Shadows was the first book I read by Laurell Hamilton. She had already written the first 2 and the 3 one was due out. I read all three and while waiting for 4 I began her Anita Blake series. I disagree with the reviewer who said that all the men in the Merry series were alike, but there are similarities between the two series. Also let it be known that Ms. Hamilton herself has said that she is still finding her way with Merry. That said, I enjoy BOTH series (putting me in the minority) and recommend them to anyone who enjoys adult fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Bad...","review":"Honestly this book was so bad that it holds a special honor in my life, it's the only book I ever actually threw in the trash.Sure it has erotica and no it's not on every page so I guess it's not \\"filled\\" with it...I'm not a prude to be bothered by erotica, heck I'm an artist who gets paid to do erotic images. It's just that in this case it seemed that the majority of the book is all filler around those portions where it seems she put the most of her effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"She does it again..","review":"Laurell K. Hamilton whips up another book..and once again,I love it. The main character in this book is so unique,and so interesting,that it makes this book twice as good. \\"A Kiss of Shadows\\" is well written,and it looks like she has done quite some research to write this book. This book caught my attention rather quickly,and once again I love all the characters. It was oddly sad to me when I read it,but it is none-the-less a great book. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk About A Let Down","review":"I had been eagerly awaiting the new series by Laurel K. Hamilton as her earlier releases with the Anita Blake character where spell-binding. I found myself turning page after page of her new release KISS OF SHADOWS hoping to come to some plot or purpose to the book. I was sorrly disappointed and felt that she introduced an assingnation plot that was a big flop--It went no where and left you wondering what was the point of the book. The book was also filled with reminants and reminders of Anita Blake melded into her new character Meridith Gentry not to mention the unbelievable even laughable non-plausable historical references. All in all I would say if your expecting anything close to Hamilton's earlier work don't bother reading KISS OF SHADOWS unless you enjoy big letdowns!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair. Not what you usually expect.","review":"I thought Kiss of Shadows was going to be great. You had Merry, a Faerie Princess in hiding and as a detective. It was a great setup and had lots of potential for a great series with Merry on the run, working behind the scenes, trying to be a detective and not be detected....Too bad LKH threw it all away in one fell swoops, early in the book.The rest of the book was simply sex scene after sex scene. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anita Blake is the most perfect woman ever dreamed of.","review":"I remember reading my first Anita Blake book by Laurel K. Hamilton so many years ago and thinking that Guilty Pleasures was one of the best books I had ever read, I have not been disappointed by the books that have followed. Anita Blake is everything I have ever wanted to be in a person and she lives in a world that is so unreal that you just want to be a part of it. There is about a 6mnth to a year between books and my only regret is that Laurel cannot put them out faster! This is one series that is sure to please no matter what you love: horror, romance, comedy, tragedy, science fiction and drama. This series has it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This may be a problem with my expectations, but after reading the description of the plot I was really looking for a more tongue in cheek attitude in telling this story. The author really seems to take the whole plot too seriously and needs to infuse a little more humor to make the book work for me. I lost interest in the characters about half way through the book, and in the story shortly after that point. The sex scenes are fun, but not enough to carry the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Torn between two men no need to fear ANITA BLAKE IS HERE","review":"I thought that I had seen it all, but when I picked up the first Anita Blake about 4 years ago I had no idea what I was getting into. The characters are carefully crafted, the scenarios play out well. There is enough suspense, intrigue, romance and gore to keep the most die hard of romance readers turning the page. I had never read a really good romance novel that acted on the part of things that go bump in the night quite like this one. Laurell K. Hamilton is gaining ground with a series that will certainly change the way you see Dracula and the Wolfman; especially if they look anything like Jean Claude or Richard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing But Fluff","review":"First and foremost, I could care less about the main character, Meredith. She's a big egoistic woman who can do no wrong who keeps discovering she's more and more powerful. And she apparently has the power to \\"inadvertently\\" seduce everyone around her. If you like soft-core porn and one-dimensional characters, then you might enjoy this book. If not, then I'd recommend not reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good. Very, very good. Not great.","review":"This is a well-written book starting a new series by the author of the \\"Anita Blake, vampire hunter\\" series. In terms of explicit sexuality, it starts at about where the Anita series was at book ten; pretty explicit, but not up to X-Rated yet. In terms of characters and plot, this series seems to me to start somewhat more slowly than the Anita series did, but that may just be a prejudice on my part in favor of the character of Anita; I simply like Anita better than I like Princess nicEssus. The secondary characters are about on a par with the secondary characters in the Anita series, and if I'm not much taken with the background plot, I really haven't seen enough of it yet to judge.

Second, i would like to see a little development of what andais is queen OF; she is queen of the unseelie; but her kingdom seems to consist of a single underground castle in illinois. Is this it? do all the sidhe who arent hiding among the humans living in that mound? if so, the \\"alternative worlds\\" of amber were more satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware, this series degenerates quickly","review":"Although the first book is intriguing, I had to give the series as a whole only one star. Each book was worse than the previous one, primarily because:(1) too many plot threads dangle forlornly(2) Those that she bothers to address are wrapped up too neatly, as an afterthought(3) The characters do things unexpected and out-of-character. If her Guards inspire such fear in Fairie, why are they so bad at it?(4) The middle books introduce so many characters Merry has sex with, I struggled to keep track of them all -- and then they inexplicably disappear(5) the last book (7 -- Darkness) is truly awful.I found these at my library, thank goodness... if you want to read them, be sure not to spend too much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero star rating, where are you when I need you?","review":"I checked out the audio version of A Kiss of Shadows from the library. I only made it through Chap 6 before I gave up. The lack of plot, repetitive (read: on and on and on and on...) descriptions of body parts, clothing, hair, etc. were agonizing. And, what was worse is that with an audio book it is pretty much impossible to skip to the next actual development in the plot (such as it is, and as of the end of Chap 6, it isn't much). Because I enjoyed the Anita Blake series, I really wanted to like this series, too. I thought of trying again with a hardcopy version of the book, but then I checked out the other reviews. Uh-oh, looks like reading this un-edited drivel is just as bad as listening to it. I'd give this book zero stars if there were such a rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overdone","review":"Let me preface this with saying that I am a huge Laurell K Hamilton fan.In particular, this book took me three tries to start, and with force I finish it. It was difficult to keep track of all of the characters. The 468 pages were devoted mostly to lengthy descriptions about each characters clothes or body features.As a relatively recent reader of this genre, I found the whole Sidhe/Fey/Faere/Goblin/Brownie culture difficult to understand. Hamilton didn't provide enough information to help me separate each unique culture and then see their inter-relationships.I hope that Hamilton rescues my waivering trust and salvages the storyline in A Caress of Twilight."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time!","review":"I am so disappointed in this book! It seems the author wanted to write a book of erotica that could be sold to a wide audience. Nothing wrong with that, but it is not how the book is advertised. There is very little happening in this book in terms of coherent plot, it's all about sex with as many people as possible for our little Merry. It's obvious the plot is very much secondary, it doesn't matter to the author except as a thread to tie together all the S&M encounters. Again, nothing wrong with erotica, but label it what it is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly ghastly","review":"I love the early Anita books, but this was ghastly. In the Anita books, there are two kinds of sex. Sex between Anita and characters the author has developed and made me care about and sex with characters who have been given no introduction except 'he was a hunk', whom I do not care about. The first kind are really good, the second kind I skip because they're dull.This book had only the second kind.It would have been easy to spend the first half of the book introducing the boys and raising tension by having her unable to touch her Aunt's guard, however much she wanted to, then saved all the sex (except for Roane) for the end, or even the next volume, after I had some reason to care about these characters.Very disappointing. Hoping later books in the series will improve."},{"rating":"1","title":"What do you want?","review":"If you want a soft (or not-so-soft) porn adventure story with lots of abs and mouths then go for it. The author writes fairly well, but the plot is repetitious. The heroine can't touch a man (and she touches many, many men) without having an orgasm. In the next book, lucky her, she must bed 27 men who are forced celibates, some of whom haven't had sex in 1000 years. If the thought of this turns you on...."},{"rating":"1","title":"bleh","review":"I have read all of Ms. Hamilton's Anita Blake stuff. I really enjoyed them, and I even re-read them when I'm low on reading material. In a moment of weakeness, I decided to give her Faery/detective tales a try. Oy veh, that's $6.50 I won't see again. Hell, that's lunch.Kiss of shadows was a combination of all the things I DON'T like about the later Anita Blake books. There's TOO much sex going on and not enough story line. There are interesting faeries, but they are all busy trying to get in each other's pants to really move the story along. First 40 pages is almost exactly like my least favorite part of \\"Narcissis in Chains.\\" It's so purile and hormonal that it borders on a bad Romance novel. Frankly, if I wanted to read Romance/sex novels, I would, and not worry about the extras, like a plot. I expected so much out of Hamilton that the last few books have been so disappointing . I wish she'd get her mind off her hormones and get back to the storylines!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"Hamilton writes great characters and brings you into her world of fantasy.

The main character has a distastefull enlarged ego and sexual appetite. The encounters were so often that they were not even interesting.When you take away the plot and add sex, it is usually called porn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Merry Disappointment.","review":"The book is full of rich descriptions. Page long descriptions. However, if this book was a movie, by watching the trailer you would feel you have seen the whole thing. Reading the review gets you the story completely!After reading some reviews and Amazon recommending this book based on my liking of the Kushiel trilogy, I was eagerly waiting to read this book.I loved the Kushiel Trilogy. It has great characterization, and sex scenes (even some crude ones) that really add to the story. A Kiss of Shadows has shallow characters that are mostly interested in having sex. Again, if this book was a movie, it would be an adult film with some story in it to justify the sex, and not the saga I was expecting."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was NOT worth the wait !!!","review":"I LOVE the Anita Blake series- Kiss of Shadows, however, is a bad blend of that series and Anne Rice's pseudo-erotica Sleeping Beauty series with the faerie court thrown in. Meredith comes across as a dog in heat, and the other characters are just dull. Hopefully Laurell's next book will be a more enjoyable read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of mead","review":"Though many people like this book, I must conclude that it's not my thing. Laurell Hamilton promises a story of modern-day faeries and their complex court intrigue, which in theory is right up my alley, but I didn't really get into it.I agree with a previous reviewer who complains that \\"every developing scene is a sex scene\\". By about page 100, my significant other was laughing because I kept yelling aloud, \\"Is she going to sleep with HIM TOO?\\" The entire plot of the book seems to consist of Merry's sexual adventures. That would be OK if it were good erotica, but there is far too much gory violence to sustain the sexy mood. To sum up the book: Sex scene, gore scene, sex scene, gory sex scene...well, you get the picture.For urban faerie adventures with more plot, try Charles de Lint (Jack of Kinrowan), Emma Bull (War for the Oaks), James A. Hetley (The Summer Country), Diana Wynne Jones (Fire and Hemlock), or Nancy Springer (Fair Peril)."},{"rating":"1","title":"What in the...?","review":"It was bad enough when the Anita Blake series degenerated into a horny hick needing to bonk one of the two hot, prissy, whiny men with the personality of cardboard. I thought that was as bad as this author was going to get.But this? LKH seems to think 'pretty' is a personality, 'sex' is a plot, and its okay for characters to forget about life-threatening other plot points that don't involving 'tab A into slot B.'Nothing is resolved in this book, no characters are developed, and the only thing entertaining about this book is the cheese factor of half the scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A KISS OF SHADOWS","review":"This was the worse book that I have ever read. I had to force myself to finish the book. The book was boring, no plot & frankly I thought it was stupid. There was no pace or energy in the movement of the characters.

I have gotten half way through with it and had to put it down. In ordering this book, I've went ahead and bought books 2 and 3 of this series which will promptly be going up for sale. This Meredith character's integrity has alot to be desired - basically very shallow and pretentious. It is narcissm at its worst. Perhaps that's the shadow side of the fairy world but they can have it. There seems to be a debate on whether this is sex porn or not. The book cannot get through 5 pages without some sexual content. Whether it's porn or not/hard or soft - doesn't matter - it's mainly about lust gratification and you have to read alot to get to story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap porn","review":"You know those awful porn movies with no plot other than to have sex every scene?

You got Merry, a strong and powerful character trying to survive in the lonely human world trying to avoid being killed by her Sidhe Aunt, the Queen of Air and Darkness.The book starts off like a detective film or book. Two beautiful vixens need help. Suddenly you have dark demonic creatures, lots of blood, then sex sex sex and more sex and some sadism and blood drinking thrown in for good measure.Not to mention butterfly winged little psychos. I love them.Yes, it's not Tolstoy, but it's filled with engaging characters (DOYLE!) interesting images, one has to admire how imaginative the writer is to come up with these things.Hand of Flesh? Male models with tentacles coming out of... various parts of them and a whole array of weapons and stranged coloured creatures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Read!!!","review":"I ordered this book on a whim after reading a review of it on Charlaine Harris' website (she is the author of the Sookie Stackhouse \\"True Blood\\" books) I have to say I am enamored by this book. The sexual content is strong so if you are adverse to that then dont bother. It is so beautifully written I find myself putting it down because I want to save it! It makes me sad to know it will soon come to an end! Hanilton has a SERIOUS imagination and the way she weaves it all together is seamless. Get lost in this magical adventure. You will never think of fairy princesses the same again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Felt like watching anime...","review":"Quick and to the point. I loved this book. I watch japanese animation and love reading japanese comics for girls. Laurell K Hamilton has a way of capturing the most beautiful men and writing about them. But because this new series is so different from the Anita Blake books, she can give them any hair and eye color she wants so it's just like reading manga (japanese comics) by artists that draw very attractive personalities on beautiful bishounen. It's good to know alot of women prefer beautiful men, not just buff and handsome. Can't wait for the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! Laurell K. Hamilton always delivers!","review":"In this start of what I hope will be a new series, Hamilton delivers her usual combination of darkness, action, sensuality, and supernaturaal. She handles the new topic, the fae, with an dge. Her heroine is, of course, tiny, but extremely tough and capable, yet sensitive to the feelings of her friends. Very well-dimensioned charcters, great plot, constant on-the-move action. A great read. Highly recommended for fans of the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful start to a great series!","review":"I couldnt put this book down for a second! Normally im a fast reader and can read a book in about a day, but this book of about 400 plus pages i read in one afternoon! It was that great. I was already addicted to Anita Blake and thought LKH couldnt possible match her , boy was I wrong . This book is imaginative,thrilling and Merrys character just shines! I have already read all the books to this series up to date and just had to read this one again.

However, I am of the distinct impression that Hamilton relies so heavily on physically describing the characters that she overlooked the actual \\"character\\" development. These people are quite shallow and unconvincing as thought bearing creatures. The plot is not really all that fabulous either. Even still, Kiss of Shadows is a good enough book to take on the bus or to your lunch break. Skip it if you want to sit down for some quality reading time. Get it if you want a quick, uninvolved read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even finish it","review":"Lately it seems like Hamilton's books (including Anita Blake) have just gotten to be sex, sex, sex.

Fine. There has been plenty going on to carry it.But this one!I don't read \\"Romance\\" novels because I get bored with plot-lines that have little to offer beyond sex. And that's all this was. There were maybe fifty pages of actual action involved. The set-up was interesting; we have a princess in hiding, and her relatives are her most dangerous enemies. OOH! What a premise! But nothing happens!Our heroine does maybe four things in the entire novel. Beyond that, we have lots and lots and lots of sex. This was a yawner. I guess I'm just not enough of a voyeur to enjoy it.Don't buy this in hard bound. If you decide to buy it at all, school yourself to patience, because there isn't much plot here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Kiss of Shadows doesn't measure up to LKH standards!","review":"I realize Hamilton is introducing a new alternate reality, a new batch of characters, and a new story line. However, A Kiss of Shadows was a total disappointment. There was virtually no plot, no character development, and no resolution to any of the situations presented within the story. The reader is immediately thrown into an intense sexual venue merely for shock value. If you make it beyond the first 200 pages, it gets truly boring. The book has the feel of Anne Rice or Stephen King writing about the Hatfields vs McCoys without the pleasure of their style. I'm very glad I borrowed the book and didn't pay money for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fantasy novel!","review":"A Kiss of Shadows was the first Hamilton book I read.Got me hooked immediately . I think I have devoured all or almost all of her other books. LOVED the Gentry series and am always on the look for the next Blake book.

At first I was a little skeptical about the manufacture's claim to having razor sharp teeth but now that I've tried it - I know they are for real. The grater seems to effortlessly shave through everything without tearing or shredding the food. And b/c it was so effortless, I could just hold the grater over my food and grate right onto it. I would highly recommend this grater and will definitely be looking to getting some of their other graters.

The grating blades are at an angle that causes the food to want to slide to that side...then the fingers get grated. A little practice avoids that though.2.

When it arrived, the base was scratched, and now only after having it for only a month, the finish is cracking and falling off. The quality is very cheap, and the description is misleading, as is definitely the price. I now would not even pay $100.00 for this lamp.

I figured, most iPod accessories are way overpriced, finally here's one that isn't. I have a small room, so I knew it wouldn't have to get very loud, and I thought it would be adequate for that.It wasn't. There is virtually no bass response at all, and even from day one higher frequencies produced a noticeable buzz. I was replaced a similar looking Bose sound dock that was about 4 years old and had gotten pretty beat up, and the sound quality was drastically better on the Bose (granted, the Bose was $[...] when I got, but Satechi wasn't an option).Beyond that, the other day it stopped producing and sound at all. It still powers on and responds to the remote, but I get no sound output at all.Save yourself the trouble. If you like music, don't buy these speakers.

After 10-15 times of usage, the iPOD connector bends and do not hold the iPOD any more. I had to buy a new speaker for playing my iPODBAsically, i was placing the iPOD to the docking station and used the iPOD by its mousewheel for song selection(mine was iPOD classic edition) without using the remote. Becuase of pressure from your fingers during song selection, the iPOD goes back and forth. As you continue this kind of usage, the docking connector to iPOD becomes loose and do not maintain correct contact with the iPOD. Hence, iPOD does not transmit the signal to the docking station.I think its a design flaw. Solution is you will have use the remote.

It does not take up much room on my desk and the sound is wonderful. The remote control is an added bonus when a song comes on that I don't particularly want to hear at that time, and it can be muted if necessary.I would highly recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a speaker to be used in these conditions.

Although the book is very well-regarded in Denmark, Arabia Felix and his Slave Trilogy are all often out of print, difficult to find, or expensive in English. Nevertheless, I definitely recommend Arabia Felix. It is a fast-paced page turner (I finished it in three sittings) and reads more like a novel than non-fiction. Furthermore, the real life cast of characters is great with the rivaling personalities and heroic lone survivor.Originally published in 1962, some of the terminology may appear out-dated, and Hansen also tends to embellish the story with his own interpretation of events. Nonetheless, Arabia Felix is such a good read that I am surprised it is almost unknown in the English reading public, especially at a time when the Middle East is very much on the radar."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Book Filled With Great Resources!","review":"This book opened my eyes to the overall business and culture of the fur trading business.

The book drew me in and made me want to keep reading from beginning to end. The book also was an amazing resource, and was filled with facts and figures about so many of the trading posts.

The writer never bridges the gap between Notan and art. And I don't care what anyone says, there is absolutely nothing interesting about a misshapen abstract version of a pair of scissors. And primative indian art is fine for what it is but attempts to glamorize it to be something it is not is totally unnecessary. This kind of illusion in design was interesting for about 5 minutes back in the 60's and 70's. If there is any value in this book, it's really well hidden. If you want a good book for ideas on composition, I recommend you keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I bought this book on the recommendation of an artist I admire.

It was a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caused vomiting","review":"The first time I gave my cat the treats (just shy of 1 year old, seemed to have an iron stomach) he was fine. The 2nd time, he vomited one time shortly afterwards. At this point, I didn't put together that it was the treats, we have two little kids and I berated them for feeding the cat something he shouldn't be eating. Third time, I knew the kids hadn't given him anything and he vomited almost immediately and continued to vomit until all he had left was bile. I see the pattern now. NOTHING else has made him sick.If you check the reviews for this product, but the hairball control variety, you will see NUMEROUS reports of cats getting sick. In to the trash they go.Cat will be 1 year old on Feb. 29th (yes, leap year, so we will count Feb. 28th instead) Snowshoe/Manx mix, being fed Blue Wilderness Evolutionary Diet Indoor dry and canned. We have no other instances of him getting sick. ONLY in direct connection with these treats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful science fiction","review":"If you are looking for the gung-ho, high action, special effect filled type of science fiction film then forget this. If you like your sci-fi to be more thought provoking then this is for you.Starring George Clooney the movie is about a space station orbiting the planet Solaris. Things start to change, the crew are going mad and no-one can figure out the problem. It is decided to send a psychiatrist (Clooney) to the stricken station to try and resolve the problem. However Clooney, when he gets to Solaris, is visited by his dead wife. Is he starting to lose his mind or is his wife real? That is the mystery of Solaris.A slow, but thoughtful film that is well worth watching and certainly not deserving the savage criticism given by some."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and Boring","review":"The only reason I don't give this film one star is the performance of Viola Davis. She is the only one in the cast that seems to care if the audience is awake or not. However , the slowing moving screenplay also does'nt help..Save your money and see it on cable.."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BOY A GIRL AND A PLANET","review":"Natascha McElhone may be a fine actress but her 'who am I, where am I?' portrayal of a deceased woman materializing in outer space lacks much conviction of whatever the film is trying to convince us of. There are moments of intense drama here; George Clooney blankly staring at a torn jagged hole in the spaceship wall, but there is also a dreary unsensational flashback romance occupying most of the film that moves like a wedding march to a funeral drum and does little to build suspense or understanding. The movie intersperses to the image of pink neon gasses surrounding the planet Solaris constantly as if saying, to increasing annoyance, 'meanwhile back on the ranch\\". \\"Solaris\\" could have been intriguing if it had realized it's psychological and cinematic potential as alternative science-fiction. Come to think of it, haven't I seen all this before, albeit on a much smaller budget, in an episode of the original \\"Star Trek\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"an insult to your intelligence (but only if you have any)","review":">Indeed, Soderbergh's *Solaris* is remarkably free of dialogue altogether, which I personally found refreshing.It is also remarkably free of content. Do you find that \\"personally \\" refreshing as well?Unfortunately, Soderbergh's adaptation \\"Solaris\\" is not COMPLETELY free of flashback dialogue (dialogue contrived especially for this adaptation not found in its source), for that dialogue is distinctly puerile and insipid."},{"rating":"1","title":"2001, this aint!","review":"I'd like to add to the reams and reams written on here about this movie and I wish I could add something positive, or at least comment on Clooney's performance, but unfortunately I feel asleep 20 minutes in! This movie is so slooooow! Highly recommended for insomniacs though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant film","review":"Though many people I've spoke to think the movie is boooring, I find it intriguing. The cinematography is classy, and the soundtrack is haunting. There are many aspects to the film that question creation and psychology. This isn't your action packed-blow stuff up kind of flick. It's definately a thinker's movie along the same lines as Gattaca. I highly recommend if you're into deep concept sci-fi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring back the Soderberg of Schitzopolis","review":"What happened to that talented and original director who took quirky subject matter and made it brilliant?Who is this imposter making nothing but half-baked remakes of perfectly good movies?A pod person?If you want to see Solaris, a very good film of it was made in the Soviet Union back in the 70's. It was mysterious and tragic and, at the same time, hopeful.All qualities the 2002 version lacks. Characters are merged. Families obliterated.George Cloony may be a pretty face, but any demanding character is beyond him. Solaris is far to subtle a project for him. He needs much more obvious formulaic roles to really shine."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE MOVIE","review":"I was forced to go see this god-awful movie with my girlfriend, and it was a total waste of time. This movie dragged on forever, and it had the worst storyline ever created. The acting is so poor that I was laughing during some scenes. When the movie was over, I heard people in the theater saying things like \\"Well that was the worst movie I've ever seen.\\" and \\"What a crappy movie. I want my money back!\\"Avoid this movie at ALL costs. Don't even watch it if someone rents it for you. You have better things to do with your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please","review":"All these rave reviews must be from geeky sci-fi lovers whose genre is usually filled with monsters and busty babes. So when something comes along with a pretention to solemnity, they feel validated and appreciated, and they return the favor by writing raves. But this is truly the emperor who had no clothes -- I defy one of these writers to admit that when they saw Solaris in the theater, they had to pinch themselves to stay awake. This movie is so low-key and somnambulistic that the entire point of the novel is glossed over if not altogether trashed in favor of lots of languid images of Clooney, his bare [rear-end], and his lost love. In the theater where I saw it, people were actually booing when it ended (and not because they wanted it to keep going). Movies are entertainment. They can also be edifying and informative, but beyond those three, there isn't much else a movie can or should do. Solaris fails on all three counts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Philip Glass make films now?","review":"This film is an unbearably boring, irritatingly pretentious waste of celluloid. Were it filmed digitally, it would have been a waste of precious binary code. It raises rather under-elaborated metaphysical questions about life and death (at a sub-glacial, coma inducing pace) then fails to provide any meaningful message. After 90 minutes of waiting for something to happen, something actually does, for which I was extremely grateful: the credits rolled. Video stores should be forced to apply warning stickers to the boxes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far Inferior to the Original","review":"Solaris is a movie that moves so slowly, it is often near the point of rigor mortis. It is a dumbed down version of the original Soviet movie. It is proof that sometimes American movies can be far inferior to Communist flicks.George Clooney continually has this look on his face like he's wondering just how did he let his agent talk him into this film. The rest of the acting is similarly poor.Watch the original movie before you ever watch this, unless you are suffering from an acute case of insomnia."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLOW AND TIRING/I WANT MY MONEY BACK","review":"George Clooney did good when he was in ER. Then he decided to be a big shot and I haven't seen one movie he was in that was good. Every movie he is in is not his movie. The best thing about \\"The Perfect Storm\\" was Mark Wahlberg. The best thing about \\"Batman\\" was the scenery. The best thing about \\"Solaris\\" was the ending. It was finally over and I went to sleep or was that during the movie?"},{"rating":"1","title":"the only movie I ever wanted to walk out on","review":"I just didn't get it. Maybe I fell asleep during it and missed something because I didn't get one second of it. snooooooooozer!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice concept...bad movie.","review":"I gave this movie a fair chance even after I was warned that it was a bomb. I suppose that this film was intended to be \\"artistic\\", but instead seemed silly and contrived. In a sense the concept of pet semetary (yes, cemetary spelled with an s..don't ask me..lol) is conveyed....the bringing back of loved ones lost, no matter the costs...but without gore, zombies or excitement whatso-ever. Maybe Solaris tries to be a love story...but fails to capture your heart like the likes of \\"somewhere in time\\". The longing is there...but the purpose and script are lacking.The only point made clear by this film: Georges naked [bottom]. I almost got tired of seeing it....Bottom (pun-pun) line: It will bore you to sleep. Skip it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Unbearable Density of Solaris","review":"I recall seeing the original Tarkovsky film in the then dirty and dingy Cinema Village on E. 12th Street. It struck me as an ambitious mess, at times, even crude, hardly crying out for a \\"re-make\\". Unfortunately, egos not reasons rule in Hollywood.That said, I have enjoyed the non-commercial films of Mr. Soderbergh (THE LIMEY; sex, lies, and videotape,etc.) as opposed to his commercial (ERIN BROCKOVITCH, TRAFFIC,etc.) ones. This time, Mr. Soderbergh's creativity seems to have been subordinate to the company he kept during its making. The filmakers seem so determined to make the viewer prostrate before their consideration of \\"serious issues\\", the film becomes pervaded by a smugness that renders the material as leaden, inert and lifeless as a small moon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lukewarm, Melodramatic","review":"This is a barely lukewarm (i.e., almost cold) and overly melodramatic movie. Although short by typical movie standards, by about 20 minutes, it seems to have been twice as long. This is the type of movie that tries to force its self-importance on you. Like the boyfriend or girlfriend that plays hard-to-get and once connected, you wonder what the suspense was all about -- all surface, no substance.Unfortunately, it seems to be a poor space rendition of movies like \\"Sphere\\" (which was an excellent book and mediocre movie, but better than this movie) and several others. In other words, a cookie-cutter movie that is run at half-speed."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE masterpiece of mediocrity...","review":"WOW! To take a great book (\\"Solaris\\") of a great author (Stanoslav Lem) AND a great movie (\\"Solaris\\") of a great author (Andrei Tarkovski), both full of sence and philosophy and to create that... WOW!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"This movie was boring beyond belief. Thinking it would be scary and a mystery before viewing it i was very wrong... it was very confusing with no scene of fright. It is not worth paying this much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame, Boring, Dull, Pointless, Waste of Time & Money","review":"I was so excited when I heard about this film. Steven Soderbergh, James Cameron, George Clooney, it's Sci-Fi, remake of a classic... But I'm sorry to disagree with everyone else here but I have tried to watch this movie three separate times and cannot get past the 45 minute point. It has a very disjointed feel to it, you don't care about any of the charracters because by the time you meet them they already uninteresting. Hardly anyone speaks and I just cannot stay awake. If you have difficulty sleeping, throw away your Nyquil and pop in your copy of Solaris...or better yet, take mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of those movies you might just walk out early","review":"There aren't very many movies where I'm tempted to walk out early, but this is one of them. In short, this movie is awful. It's slow paced from the get-go, and never picks up the pace. About a half-hour into the show, I silently gave my wife \\"two thumbs down\\", and she agreed, as did the rest of a very small audience after the show finally ended.Don't waste you money on this snoozer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away From Solaris!","review":"I can sum this \\"film\\" up in one word.....BAD. Clooney brings unsuspecting movie goers into the theater, however Solaris will send you packing. I sat through the entire movie. Many in the others left midway through the film.Save your $$$!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely BORING","review":"I love all types of movies but, let's call this like we see it ok?This has GOT to be one of the most boring movies I have ever seen in my life.It seems as though the director was trying to copy a Stanley Kubrick style film and most assuredly DID NOT accomplish this.The story made no sense and had no resolution! TERRIBLE.Buy this if you have trouble going to sleep at night because believe me, it will put you RIGHT OUT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignore \\"top 500\\"-ers","review":">The movie has an eerie but not scary tone to it.

This HAS nudity. What do you think we've been going on about?(And let's stop pretending all those who give this an unfavorable review do so because they were disappointed not to find \\"Terminator 800\\".

Perhaps if we had read the book it would have helped but this is definately a video rental waiting for release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs Cliff Notes","review":"This will be very short, but I just have to say that this has to be one of the worst, if not the WORST, movies I've ever seen. Also, a quick warning for anyone thinking about spending the money to see it in the theater, don't waste your money. Not even seeing Clooney's bare butt is worth the price of admission, and that's about the best part of the movie.A man that came out of the theater right behind me said, \\"I hate it when I feel like I should read the cliff notes before going to see a movie,\\" and that's the best description I can think of. It's not that it's hard to follow, it's that there's no action, and not really any point, and barely even a story.It's just plain TERRIBLE, and i had to warn others so they don't waste their money like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"See the Tarkovsky version","review":"Having read the Stanislaw Lem book and having seen the Tarkovsky film of the same name, I was curious what Hollywood would do to the material. They have made a thorough mess of it, adjusted the plot badly, and altered the ending in a way that doesn't make sense. The performances, however, are fine. The 1972 Tarkovsky version unfolds very slowly (which may make some people crazy) and makes very effective use of a minimal budget, but builds to considerable power. It's a haunting film and thought-provoking, and is far truer to the book. I had hoped the 2002 Soderbergh version would at least make use of Hollywood's considerable CGI abilities to give a visual rendition of some of the strange formations that the Solaris ocean comes up with, but no such luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"What planet is this from? Uranus?","review":"Take the boredom and disconnection of \\"2001\\" and combine it with the intelligence of \\"The Cell\\" and you get a movie that will put you to sleep wondering what on earth is happening. How did George keep a straight face? What sort of movie did he think this would end up being edited into? So many questions, so little time. In honesty, this is an all time fizzer. Maybe it is trying to be intelligent, or maybe I'm just being unfair, but whatever is happening here doesn't end happily for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Awesome!","review":"I fell in love with this movie from the start. It had a calm sort of atmosphere to it, almost an erie quitness that stuck throughout the film. It sure is a \\"thinker\\" movie and that's what makes it even more interesting. The idea of a ship discovering a source of energy that could replicate lost loves and friends is amazing!! Definitely worth seeing if you like Sci-Fi / Romantic movies. I rate it 5 stars and will definitely be purchasing the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Film","review":"Joseph Campbell once said, \\"If you ask an artist what his painting means; if he wants to insult you, he'll tell you.\\"This film is wonderful mind trip. My friend and I talked for hours about this movie afterwards, and are still tying break apart what we thought it meant.I agree with most reviewers, that this should have been an Art House release, to lower people's expectations. This is not a popcorn movie. This is much more a film for the \\"Pi\\", \\"Brazil\\", \\"2001\\" kind of crowed who enjoy a thinking movie. For people who want to interact with their entertainment, rather than be passively entertained. If you like things spelled out for you and answers handed to you on a plate, there's nothing wrong with that; but this movie is NOT for you.I can't wait to go back and watch the original and read the book!In fact, I can't wait to go see this movie again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to follow the plot","review":"Didn't like it.

Hate it, hate it,, hate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little slow and confusing","review":"Although I understood and could follow the plot line of the story, it was confusing.. Most of the movie was done in semi darkness so that it was hard to really see what was happening. At times the music drowned out the voices so that you could not hear what was being said. It reminded me of a low budget film.. This is a movie that I would not have purchase if I had known what it was like before hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Solaris' worthy of comment!","review":"I personally, enjoyed 'Solaris', for 2 reasons. #1 I think that George Clooney, is the up & coming, in most of his films, #2 the science fiction, that is portrayed on this film, is just enough to capture the attention of the non-science fiction fan, as myself.. It was not a lot of 'over your head' vocabulary, and 'way out' scenes, that took over the purpose of the film.Steven Soderbergh did a wonderful job in his direction of the cast, and the filming. The supposed 'nude' scenes were tastfully done, and I felt comfortable taking my two young sons to see it, as well. However, it was somewhat over their heads, as far as, the story line goes. But, the films PG rating was right on!If you like movie topics that leave you walking from the theater, scratching your head, and looking for good conversation, then this is the movie for you! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Is that what everybody wants?","review":"Brilliant Movie!!

This movie will be on Rotten Tomatoes site very quickly if it hasn't already been added.Clooney should stick with ER or movies with fishing boats in them, because this movie doesn't cut it, or if it does it is cutting cheese.There is no story to the movie, and the acting is horrible. James Cameron should also stick with movies about boats and let the Sci-Fi movies be directed by people that have seen a good one.Good luck if you buy this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was This an Action Film????","review":"Seriously, I was Sold to see it because of the previews. I was falling sleep on the 1st 38 minutes. The only good parts ( of the first 38 minutes) was the scene when he was recruited and when landed in the Space Station. The Movie is not for everyone. If you are looking for an Action/Mystery/ not so slow movie...then avoid Solaris. Be sure you walk out before the 30 minutes if you want your money back. If you don't, You'll get movie passes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anything lower than 1?","review":"Think of the worst movie you've ever seen. Put this one right below it!

This is the most enoying, slow and useless film that I have ever seen. The reference made to Kubricks 2001 is an insult to the director. This is the first DVD ( and I do have a few) where I FFWD most of the time because nothing is hapening - don't we all love seeing empty corridors during 5 minutes. Slow camera moves with nothing hapening.If you want to get bored to death buy it, all others should avoid this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst movie in the rental store right now","review":"This has to be the worst movie that is out right now for rental or purchase. I run a video rental store and I have heard nothing but bad news about this movie. Half the people couldn't get through it because they fell asleep, and another 25 percent stopped watching it before the movie ended. I disliked it to the most intentions. The music in the background has one tone playing from soft to loud for 2 hours straight, after hearing this I got a migraine and got dizzy, which I cured with some medicine. the plot goes nowhere and at the end of the film you say this \\"bluwah?\\" I recomend this movie to no one. Even if you read the book you should not see this movie because it will probably ruin the book. This movie should end George Clooney's career because it is such an embarassment to both him, his fans, and the entertainment world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought as a gift","review":"I bought this movie as a gift for my dad for Christmas last year. I had no desire to see it but we ended up watching it. I enjoyed the movie a lot. The movie is emotionally compelling, mentally stirring, and leaves an air of mystery about it. One thing that surprised me was that I found myself really caring about the main character and his wife. It surprised me because I rarely get that engrossed in a love story. What was happening between them stirred the same emotion as the end of Romeo and Juliet. You watch those final scenes helpless to do anything but with a glimmer of hope that everything will be allright (although you know it isn't). It is that mix of emotions the movie stirred in me that made me love it. I would suggest this movie to people who are like movies that work with human emotion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't watch in a dim light","review":"I almost feel bad writing a bad review for this film, but honestly, I am off to the store to go get some more NO-DOZ. This movie is as slow as any that I have ever seen. I've watched half the movie so far, and after seeing George Clooney's but two times too many, I had to run to my computer to warn all potential renters to not rent this movie. Many of the other reviews state that this movie will make you think, well it definately does that. I was thinking about how boring this movie is, and what else can I be doing to keep from wasting my 2 hours, not to mention what other movies I could be watching.Maybe I will finish watching this movie tonight when I have trouble sleeping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst ever-do not waste your time","review":"I have been watching the DVD version of this movie for an hour, and still have no clue what the point is. If I were in a movie theater, I would get up and walk out. About the only high point for a female viewer would be to see George Clooney's rear end. Totally confusing movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable","review":"I saw about an hour of it I think...then I just had to turn it off. No pay-off can be worth sitting through more of this. It's just all so lifeless. If I paid to see this in a theatre I would very pissed off! There's just no energy at all. The subject matter seems like it COULD be interesting, but the director apparently fought hard to make it all as boring and dull as can be imagined."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recommended To Insomniacs","review":"SOLARIS will prove itself more effective than most sleep aids - both prescription and over-the-counter.

Science fiction the way it's supposed to be done!\\" Something to that effect. If that sentiment is true, no wonder I've never much cared for science fiction. One of the most god-awful boring movies I've ever sat through. Suitable for pseudo-intellectuals to ooh and aah over, but normal humans should keep away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recipe for Disaster","review":"This is the formula that was used to create this movie.Start with Tarkovsky's 1972 version of Lem's novel and do the following1) Strip it of all its mystery, creepiness, and hazy imagery, replacing that with Hollywood-style psychobabble and expensive sets.2) Cast George Clooney in a role far beyond the scope of his acting abilities (thanks for the shot of his muscular ass, by the way).3) Remove the seldom-seen and seldom-heard basketcase crew members that haunted and confused Kelvin in the book and original movie, and replace a) the pilot with a slacker moron who behaves like a David Spade character and replace b) the mad physics genius with (of course) a black woman actress. A little bit for the PC crowd and a little bit for the teenagers to laugh at.4) Lots of flashbacks of George Clooney dressed smartly in his pseudo-James Bond milieu.What a piece of trash this film is. It is about half as long as the original by Tarkovsky, but it seems to be twice as long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my god!!!","review":"This is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen. My thoughts were backed up by the other unfornate souls how happened to go to the same viewing as me. Out of the 30 or so people how were in the theater, about 20-25 of them walked out within the first hour. This movie is so slow and boring, and the ending is so cheesy and stupid. If I had to sum up this movie in one word, it would have to be torturous. Avoid this movie at all cost, you will be sorrily disappointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Your shrink would like Solaris, but it's not for normal folk","review":"On the up side, good sets and costumes. Lame special effects combo with a plot so crippled that it's wheelchair needs crutches. George Clooney, bless his handsome heart, is unable to rescue this total waste of mind with his limited acting range, although you can see him painfully trying. Unless you are really into abnormal foresnic psychology then within 15 minutes of watching Solaris you will be asking yourself if you really want to sit through the rest of it. I did, and I did sit through the rest and it wasn't worth it. Buy another movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls short of expectations","review":"The argument for Solaris is that it is an intelligent, though provoking literary movie based in a science-fictional context. One reviewer calls it a \\"taut psychological experience that will leave you breathless.\\" It is not. It is simplistic and unchallenging. The emotional connection between Clooney and his wife is never convincing enough to produce the conundrum of circumstances that are portrayed. I did enjoy the movie. It was beautiful to watch and the performances were excellent, but it simply is not psychologically, emotionally or intellectually intense enough to justify the slow and drawn out pace. It had potential, but comes up short."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've had migranes that were more pleasurable","review":"Upfront let me state that I love independent, unusual and foreign films, the ones that many people often have never heard of, or dislike. That said, let me state without question that I hated this movie, in fact every single person within earshot expressed loud and long how much they hated this movie. So what is the biggest problem with this film? Simply this, it is interminably dull both visually and in story. Perhaps those [induced in a] haze might find some redeeming qualities in this movie, apparently those I was watching it with were not suitably impaired to fully appreciate it. I spent most of the film waiting for it to end, just to put all of us out of our misery (the audience and the characters). Do not waste your time or money on this film, even a few glimpses of George Clooney's bum don't make it worth the effort required to sit through this. Truly painful to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much like 2001...","review":"It was obvious to me that they were trying to emulate 2001 with the music and the camera shots. The sets were really neat. The acting was pretty good. The idea is intriguing. Sounds all pretty positive huh? I did give it two stars....What I didn't like was the dialogue, the pace of the movie. The actors did a great job with what they had. I didn't think the nudity was neccessary. It didn't help the story at all.Like I said before it was a lot like 2001. That's treading into some sensitive territory. I liked 2001 a heck of a lot more than Solaris. Solaris was really a drawn out film. 2001 at least had a unique vision that should be left be alone. Solaris didn't give me that. I don't think the story justified the direction they went into.I think if it was filmed differently it could have been a great film. Of course, this is just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Move over Barton Fink","review":"The benchmark for all things video awful has been, for us, the overrrated self-important Barton Fink. We rate all movies not by stars but by little Bartons. Well move over Barton - we now will live by Little Solaris's.God this was awful. I wish the guy who edited this with a meat cleaver would have gone after that irritating 'Snow's' hands. I wanted to just rip his hands off . Agh! Agh! agh! stop moving those weird fingers of yours!!!I love sci-fi and have no trouble following some complicated ether-world story lines but I really had a hard time with this. So where were they in the end? The Nexus err... Solaris?Thankfully the DVD skipped and froze a few times so I can get my $1.88 back."},{"rating":"1","title":"A subtle masterpiece? Which movie did he watch?","review":"I had heard this was a 'slow' movie and I had adjusted my expectations accordingly. I looked forward to uncovering the riddle. The movie contains, on average, about 10 lines of dialogue for every 7 minutes of film. I cannot remember a single satisfying scene. No music. No laugh. Not even a thoughtful epiphany. I kept expecting to be drawn-in by thoughtful dialogue about humanity reaching the stars. I did NOT enjoy one minute of this movie. It has absolutely no continuity - due in large part to endless (and quite meaningless) flashbacks. Even more frustrating, it lacks any sense of chemistry - I couldn't care less who dies and who lives. It lacks a protagonist and an antagonist. It lacks any sense of suspense - other than the viewers' own longing for thoughtful diaglogue to cause us to question our own existence. Some have touted this movie as sublime or sutle - hog wash. This movie is a TURKEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOBODY TALKED THROUGH THIS ENTIRE FILM","review":"Throughout this entire film, the actors just STARED at each other. Nobody answered any damn questions, they just STARED. Nobody conversed - THEY JUST STARED. That's all this was. Staring. And George Clooney's naked ass. Hardly worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really sci-fi","review":"This film is more about a long winded love story between two people, and most of the film takes place in flashbacks. Why anyone is wearing a space suit or on a space station, is beyond me. The replicants in this film are just an excuse to make this into a boring love story that I ended up caring nothing about. As a true science ficton fan, I wanted to know more about the planet Solaris, the space station, the crew, but I was bored with the characters, and they might as all well have told their flashback story from a cavern in the Mojave desert. This was a sad excuse for science fiction. If I wanted a boring chick flick with George Clooney making love and war with a woman for an hour and a half, I would have rented one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This film was amazing. I actually heard the score before I saw the film and that was my hook. I realize most people will dislike and even hate this film for the slow somber nature but it really is great. I hate to be cliche but the film is haunting and mesmerizing and I loved it. Soderbergh shot the film in his usual beautiful way. Clooney gives a great performance along with McElhone. Cliff Martinez finishes the film with an amazing score. A film that never got noticed for what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Bizarre","review":"I enjoy science fiction movies. I have always like George Clooney's acting ability. I thought this movie was going to be great. After all, George Clooney is in it. While my friends fell asleep, I stopped myself from falling asleep because it has to get better because George Clooney is in the movie. It never does get better. I dont know even though how to begin to describe this movie. It was the most bizarre movie I have ever seen in my life. When my friends woke up, they asked me about the ending. I told them that I dont even know how to begin to describe it. I asked them if they wanted me to rewind it. They all say at the same time, never mind. I should have rented Ocean's Eleven. He was good in that."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"deffinately one of the worst movies i've ever seen. movies that have five minute scenes of some guy sleeping cant be that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAAAWWNNN!!! zzzzzzzz....","review":"What a waste of time and money this movie was!George a word of advice:Your mostly middle aged white female fanbase wants to be charmed by your smile...not scratch their bobbed-haircut heads in perplexity watching you brood and meander through a dark and dismal flick which doesn't make much sense to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solaris is a Waste of Film","review":"This movie came on last week.

There is a lot going on in this movie, while also being easy to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pseudo-Intellectual","review":"Soderberg tries very hard to be a grown-up but he lacks the gravitas. He's just kid looking for approval by aping other people's art. It's weak. THIS is weak. This is not an homage to the greatest Soviet film ever made, it's a Xerox dressed up as a Hallmark card pretending to be a Bible. It's a failure. The Soviet film is so much greater even as it is much more flawed. This is not a \\"bad\\" film, it's the abortion of a great one. See the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give this one a second look...","review":"This movie was not what I had been expecting. It was not a sappy love story, but instead was more focused on the unexplained events on the space station. The writers never quite explain exactly what is going on, but they let you make up your own mind. George Clooney does a great job, as usual, but could not have pulled it off without the rest of his cast. Give this movie a try, you may be surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"See George Think","review":"Truthfully, I wanted this film because I wanted to see George Clooney's bare bottom and anything else. But if you want this film just to see that great sight, you may be disappointed. Don't get me wrong. I loved this movie. But this is not the usual Clooney vehicle. No swaggering Dr. Doug Ross here. No echoes of Ocean's Eleven. Instead, we see a haggaard man, overcome with grief, struggling to find sense and answers in a place where confusion and fear reign. The starkness of the space station beautifully reflect the main character's mind set and the state of grief in general. This is perhaps the best acting Clooney has done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite dull","review":"I couldn't get through this. It's an interesting sci-fi concept movie, but the tale is just not told fast enough, I guess. I got sick of flashbacks to George Clooney's idyllic married life with the clone who haunts him on a spaceship off the planet Solaris. The soundtrack is nicely atmospheric and the photography is great. Just doesn't cut it as a night's viewing pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad but true","review":"I nearly fell asleep in the first 20 minutes, and frankly I could not get past those first 20. I wanted very much to like this film because it seemed like an interesting premise/idea. The Russian original was certainly to my liking. Unfortunately, though, this was just very dry and difficult to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great idea to make this kind of movie","review":"I think you need to understand and love Andrey Trkowski's ideas and then make a movie. It was the most stupid idea for an American director to do it. He doesn's understand it himself, so how he can lead his actor's team. J.Klooney was worried about his reputation as an actor. And he was right.This movie is a looser."},{"rating":"1","title":"And the award goes to.......","review":"This movie won my \\"Worst of the year\\" award.

The music was annoying, the lighting dark, the acting almost non-existent and the story ridiculous. Even a die hard George Clooney find would find little to like in this amazingly bad movie.

I wish I had read more reviews before buying it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommend: See this movie at least twice!","review":"I was completly entranced by the hauntingly ethereal music of Cliff Martinez and the mysterious plot when I first saw this movie. And something about this movie stayed with me long after it was over. I just had to see it again to experience the journey one more time. I'm glad I gave it a second look. After watching it again, I have a much greater appreciation for this movie. Yes, it does require a little more effort from the viewer to watch this movie. But, I think it's well worth it. It leaves you with lots of food for thought. On my second viewing, this line from the movie particularly stayed with me: \\"There are no solutions -- only choices.\\" Well said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clooney is anti-America","review":"So outspoken politically, I think he should stick to politics because I will never buy anything that has to do with him again."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck was this?","review":"Ok, I must admit that I never saw the origial movie, but this one was a turd... it doesn't explain anything, one character is severely agoraphobic for one scene and spends the rest of the movie out and about like nothing is wrong, another character chews his gum so loud that it's actually more interesting than his dialogue and will someone tell me why a psychiatrist/psychologist (a civilian nonetheless) is sent to some mysterious planet.... alone to determine what's wrong on a space ship? I could go on, but I'll sum up... don't buy this, just rent it and you'll see that you've saved yourself some money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Una agradable sorpresa","review":"Soy un amante de las peliculas en las cuales el casting, la fotografia, las actuaciones, la musica, la direccion, etc. forman un todo en armonia que le agrega valor a la pelicula. Solaris, es para mi, una agradable sorpresa. Segun las criticas que habia escuchado por ahi, era una peli?cula mas del monton, asi que cuando la vi, no tenia grandes expectativas. Pero tuve la oportunidad de juzgar por cuenta propia, y tengo que decir que resulto de esas en las que uno se prende de tal modo en la trama, que cuando termina se queda con ganas de ver mas. Y como broche de oro, me encanta esta peli?cula en cuanto a que deja muchas preguntas a criterio del espectador:\\"Muchas preguntas y pocas respuestas\\" Como dijo alguna vez el Capitan Jean-Luc Picard. Mejor no podia ser. Creo que va a entrar en mi lista de peliculas que las veo una y otra vez."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Nearly As Good As The Original","review":"This new Hollywood remake of the classic Russian sci-fi film from 1972 is not nearly as intelligent, nor will it be as lasting. Indeed, this modern \\"remake\\" will likely be forgotten in a few years, whereas the legendary original will still be respected.The Clooney remake lacks the philosophical depth of it's predecessor and cheapens it into a sappy love story with New Age trappings and the typical plot-twist at the end. It's formulized whereas the original truly was an original in more ways than one.It's fun comparing these two films side-by-side. It clearly shows the money-driven ambition of Hollywood today and the dumbing-down of modern cinema. But if you haven't, you MUST see the original Solaris by Tarkovsky! The main difference between these two films is that the original Tarkovsky film is a masterpiece, whereas the Soderberg remake is something to do for two hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting Spiritual excursion","review":"I highly reccommend this movie if you like a thoughtful mysteriousstories.

It strives for a transcendent, even apocalyptic note, but winds up being just plain silly. George Clooney struggles manfully to breathe some life into this stillborn turkey, but it's more than mortal actor can do. Natascha McElhone (who?) is the forgettable romantic interest, and Jeremy Davies as a crew member is such a mannered ham you long to make him sit on his hands. At 99 minutes this is not a long movie, but it's a lot longer than it ought to be, if you catch my drift. Do yourself a favor and save your time and money; I wish I had. I venture to predict that if this dud is remembered at all, it will be recalled as the movie in which George Clooney unveiled his bare ass. Maybe he was trying to tell us something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surreal film with sci-fi backdrop","review":"I saw the film on the strength of Roger Ebert's recommendation. The only warning I would give is that the action is mostly psychological, through various devices where characters flip back and forth while remembering events. So if you are looking for a traditional action or scifi film, this is not it.Especially effective is the use of specific shades of color to show changes in settings. A beautiful, thoughtful film that is about as far as you can get from another entertaining film by Soderbergh & Clooney, Ocean's Eleven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout CD--upbeat!","review":"Includes a few songs I don't remember from the era, but it is an upbeat CD that'll keep you motivated.

It easily converts from an airplane to a gun, no skills or adjustments needed. I like that the toy is sturdy and looks like it WILL last (I just bought it so I can't asses on its longevity that is why I gave it 4 stars for durability). It is made of all hard plastic. Also, the mechanism for the gun works great. It doesn't get stuck, like a Nerf gun I just bought for my son.

Critics say that the story glorifies drugs. I disagree. Ron O Neal (a brilliant actor who simply came on the scene before his time) as Priest is an intense and intelligent character. He knows he's in a dirty game and he's sick of playing it and longs to get out. Junkies are portrayed as pitiful creatures that no one in their right mind would want to emulate. Priest's partner is a greedy, blind fool and his mentor Scatter is living proof that the game can bite you.

Superfly is indeed a great movie, from its gritty ambiance, outlandish costumes, superb soundtrack, unsentimental dialogue and straight-up action. However, the sound quality on the DVD is quite poor, which is an absolute shame in light of the music that is a genuine reflection of its place and era. Even with the volume turned up much higher than for any other DVDs I have, the dialogue and music were still extremely muffled.

This is beyond my comprehension that Curtis Mayfield's great musical work, clearly worthy of an Academy Award, should be undervalued and demeaned in this manner.

Superfly really isn't very exploitative, it's more like film noin instead. It centers around a big time cocaine delaer named priest and his attempt to get out of the business, but not without at least one last score. Ron Oneal is cast perfectly as priest the pouting, long haired anti-hero.

It was the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting was so bad that I have yet to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Fan Service","review":"This series continues on making absolutely zero excuses for itself. It doesn't pretend to be intelligent or witty and will attempt to make you laugh with fan service and physical jokes that will occasionally have most of the male population crossing their legs. Providing that you can allow yourself to just enjoy the humor, you should find yourself having a mostly enjoyable experience. The lack of a real story to tie it all together though continues to work against this series that continues to leave me with an empty feeling every time I finish a volume. I enjoy it while it's in my player but once it's done, I don't find myself wishing that there were more to watch right away. It continues to be worth checking out but unless the final volume provides a HUGE payoff, I'm not predicting that you're going to find much replay value out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"this soap burns it broke me out in blemish marks.it may work for you but it didnt work for me an it took me using this soap for 2 days to see this one time aday.have a back plan for when it doesn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Works","review":"This product is fabulous but it is not designed for everyone.

BENEATH THE MOORS AND DARKER PLACES succeeds in achieving the essence of Lovecraft's works and paying respect to the master supernatural writer yet feels fresh. Brian Lumley includes a potent novella (BENEATH THE MOORS) not published since the 1970s (at least in the United States) and a new gripping ending to the powerful \\"Second Wish\\". The other seven stories are terse thrillers too. The reader has nine taut tales in which each one entertains the audience in a manner Lovecraft and other horror grandmasters would have been proud to claim authorship. Fans of Mr. Lumley (see Necroscope) or Mr. Lovecraft will relish this trip to darker places.Harriet Klausner"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book...horrible transfer to ebook.","review":"Please note that the low rating is for the transfer to Kindle ebook.

What a time it was to be caught up in Kubrick and Bach while my highschool mates played (what?) Mott the Hoople! I've hummed the song to my wee one every night for two years; finally I can play the lovely mix of passionate, rousing, and in turn melancholy tunes to him complete! The flute alone can break your heart. And oh the remembered passion of the line \\"But I cannot find the ribbon. . . .\\" What a movie! what an album! Listen to it and remember \\"how love fled, and hid his face amid a crowd of stars.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Mix","review":"Yes, a wonderful mix of some traditional Irish music, some arrangements of classical pieces and a bit of martial music as well. It's all here as part of the soundtrack for Stanley Kubrick's film Barry Lyndon. Each track leads naturally right into the next as we relive musically the odyssey of Mr. Lyndon, but even if you haven't seen the film -- and you really should -- this album provides a nice unified but flowing musical journey. Handel's Sarabande, itself an arrangement of the traditional tune La Folia, bookends the entire disc, and occasionally we hear variations on that theme in between. The traditional melody Liliburlero is dished up twice, once for drums and fifes and again for wind ensemble. And near the end we get that exquisite second movement of the Schubert Op. 100 Piano Trio. I can almost hear the narrator intone, \\"He never saw Lady Lyndon again....\\" A fine release, and one worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Soundtrack","review":"This is a well-done and elegant movie with a superb soundtrack. The classical selections used in the film fit the scene where they provide background music. The emotional element of the score is perfect. If you like Mozart, Handel and Vivaldi, this is the track to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great period music. Period.","review":"One of the best things about the movie Barry Lyndon is how it conveys the atmosphere of 18th Century Europe. And one of the best things about this soundtrack is how it brings the atmosphere of the movie back to life. It's a great mix of music - from Celtic to Baroque to military marches. Of course the Chieftans are outstanding as usual. Buy it if you can get your hands on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unreliable and fails","review":"I recieved one for my birthday in May 2008. It worked 1 time and then failed completely. We returned it for exchange without a problem. Now, 7 months later, it failed completely again.

Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome- until it dies","review":"Excellent product for about 6 months. Then it refused to brew.

This one did not last the week. It worked great at first then one morning I made one cup was going to make another but got nothing out. All it did was create steam. No matter what I tried it did not work right again. The heating element became to hot. So I wonder if it could be a fire hazard as well? Anyway, look else where for a good one cup coffee pot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not last long","review":"I purchased item in May 2008, it died in October 2008.

But it costs $5 in shipping to get it, down to two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for coffee and tea!","review":"Love it!!! Both my husband and I are tea drinkers, however I like coffee on occasion. Makes a perfect cup of tea in our travel mugs. It's hot enough to be good, but cool enough to enjoy. Also works with senseo pods. I wanted a pod coffee pot, but really didn't want to pay the $100. Was going to break down on the $64 model, but found this randomly on clearance at Target for $13 (MSRP is $30) Found this review while looking for a second (in case of breakage-we can't live without) and another filter. Filter is a bit grimy after 2 weeks of bagged tea, so will probably need replacing at some point. Coffee without pods didn't taste bad, but was messy to clean up. Wonderful wonderful machine. Won't pay over $30 for it, but it's perfect if you are looking for a pod machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars; does NOT work!!","review":"I bought this because I was tired of paying for the K-Cups for the Keurig one-cup brewer. Thank goodness for store refunds! This item worked over one weekend, although the brew time was very, very slow...particularly compared to the Keurig.It then crashed out on Monday morning. It spit out a few drops of cloudy coffee into my mug, and it was over. Pulled the Keurig back out; it's worth paying for the K-Cups, especially with the reliability of that brand. Hamilton Beach really disappointed on this one. Used my refund from this item to buy more K-Cups...would not recommend the Hamilton Beach to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the price!","review":"I'm glad this is the machine I ended up with after searching online and comparing for days. Very easy to use and the coffee is ready in less than 3 minutes. I would purchase again if this thing died tomorrow....not that I think it will!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap, great coffee","review":"I bought this thing at Target last Winter for about $19. It has a flimsy, plastic build, and is a little messy to clean up. But, the coffee that this thing makes is really, really good. I have a manual pump espresso machine, an Aeropress, and about a half-dozen drip, pour-over, or pod (pump) coffee makers. This little one is what I use to make most of my coffee. In fact, after getting this little thing, I threw a couple of my drip coffee makers away (only keeping one for when company comes).Grind it fine and use a liberal amount of coffee with about 8 oz of water (Don't be tempted to make two cups at a time). Or, use 4 oz of water and cut the result with 4 oz of boiling (or near boiling) water after it finishes. It won't disappoint you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Four months and out","review":"We had the black Hamilton Beach 42115 3-in-1 Hot-Beverage Center and enjoyed it for 4 months. It was just the right size for a cup of coffee or tea. But after four months it has stopped working (though we've followed all of the cleaning instructions). It will heat up for a while, and produce some steam, but little or no hot water/tea/coffee actually comes out of the nozzle any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken afert four cups!","review":"Sounded great, a way to brew pods and ground coffee on the cheap. I literally brewed five successful cups of coffee with it. Now its a piece of junk. I think the pump may be broken, very little water makes it to the coffee grounds. I fill the reservoir with water and end up with half an ounce of liquid in the cup. Even when it was working, I considered it a very unsafe product. I burned myself a couple times with the escaping steam ( pretty bad rate when you consider it had five successful brews. Maybe I had a bad unit, but I'm just going to go with a more expensive one after I return this piece of junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does everything is says it can","review":"We picked this up the other day and it is fantastic. It really can use pods, bagged tea, and loose tea or coffee and can handle them all perfectly! It can make up to 14 ounces at a time and has an adjustable shelf to hold a coffee mug or travel mug. Ours will be getting a lot of use in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for loose coffee grounds!!","review":"I bought this to brew loose coffee grounds, and I wound up with a cup full of grounds and a very messy machine to clean up even though I hadn't filled the basket too full. This might work for pods or tea bags, but I sure wouldn't recommend putting anything loose in it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"I got this beverage machine as several guests like coffee and my husband and I do not. It does take some getting used to (approximating water levels, amount of coffee grounds for each person's taste), but it works very well and quickly. I have also made a cup of tea with it and was satisfied with the results - it was definitely faster than boiling water on the stovetop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product is 5 years old, distributed thru S and K Wholesale !","review":"DO NOT purchase this unit!

An excellent choice!In about the time it would normally take for me to heat up my water in the microwave, I have fully brewed tea! I can also use my loose tea without first putting it into a container to brew it in the mug and not worry about floaters. If I want it double strength, no problem!Not only tea, but coffee as well because I can grind it and just put it in the filtered basket. I've even used just the hot water feature to make some cocoa and it works great as well. As a PSA I did pick up a small packet of coffee pods to try and while it brews them just fine, the coffee is nasty.The only downside is that I have a couple of pretty big mugs that it can't fill up due to the water tank capacity. However, it does do a larger coffee mug just fine. I like it so much, I think I need to pick this up for a friend for Giftmas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"I received this for a gift. I LOVE it! It's simple to use and works great with Folger's Pods or regular coffee. I was actually considering a Flavia machine, but this makes great coffee and great tea. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for that 1 cup a day!","review":"This is the best invention ever! I bought little 1-4 cup filters and then I just trim the top a bit b/c the filter doesn't filter all that well - plus it's a heck of a lot easier to clean.I'm the only one that drinks coffee, and I only have about a cup a day so this was the best thing for me and I really didn't want to spend so much money on a Keurig. Plus it's outstanding b/c I can buy any coffee that I want and I don't have to buy special \\"K-cups\\" to use it. It also travels really well so if I'm visiting my mom (who doesn't drink coffee or have a coffee maker) I can just throw it in a bag and take it with me. It's pretty awesome.If you're not a heavy coffee drinker and just need/want that one cup/day I would HIGHLY recommend this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it at first","review":"When I first got this it worked great, but soon it started leaking all over the counter, popping, steaming, not brewing a full cup. I de-scaled it like recommended and cleaned it all up but it still keeps doing it. Love the concept, not this design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea - bad engineering","review":"The first one of these we had was great! My wife made her tea and I made my coffee with it, and it produced excellent results. That lasted for about 5 months. Then it started to just pop and steam without pumping any water. Thinking it needed descaling, I tried that - - several times to no avail. So I finally called Hamilton Beach customer support, and at their direction sent in the cut off plug of my broken unit and $6.95 s/h. After several weeks, I received the replacement unit. It worked exactly one time before the spitting and steaming took over. I called H-B again, and this time they shipped a replacement unit immediately at no cost. It worked for exactly 2 cups before the exact same problem. Obviously there is a major flaw in the design of the water heating/pumping. Wish it worked!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea but.....","review":"This is a nice idea but not worth it. It stopped working after the third use, however, KUDOS to Hamilton Beach - they replaced it without any problem. Item is large and takes up more counter space than I would like. I made coffee with it but the clean up is not worth using it for that. Even after getting the replacement, it now sits in my garage. I strongly suggest buying the Sunbeam HotShot, which works faster, is small and attractive and is a much better value. I actually had an older model and wound up replacing it with the newer model- should have done that first. Do check it out and consider it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for making hot tea or coffee","review":"I really enjoy the tea that I make. I drink a lot of hot tea.

Dollarite owes me money, and I should have had it by now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally disappointed","review":"I purchased a Hamilton Beach three-in-one hot beverage center as a gift for my friend. She was only too delighted to receive and use it. Everything was good - performance, design, ease of use and accessibility, which was a drawing card since both my friend and I are totally blind. But after a week, the appliance stopped working for no apparent reason. Thinking it was just a bad luck with a defective unit, I purchased another one. It only worked for an hour and quit just as the first one did. I would not recommend it to anyone, as I consider it unreliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD CONCEPT - POOR PERFORMANCE","review":"Unfortunately, when this item was received, it was defective and I was unable to use it.

And the top area gets really hot so don't get near it while it's brewing unless you want a second degree burn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it worked for 9 months","review":"I bought one for myself and one for my mother at the same time. My mother's stopped working after about 5 months and mine just over 9 months. Both the same way, the coffee maker made all the sounds but it stopped pulling the water from the reseviour to brew the coffee. What a shame, it was great while it worked.

Very easy to use and produces hot water for your choices. Two thumbs up!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice machine for $30","review":"First of all, I have high respect for the company. When the first one came in the mail broken, they replaced it free of charge, no questions asked.The second one works great so far. You can tell it's not a super expensive coffee maker, but it does the job. The only complaint I have is that it leaves a fine coffee grind \\"sludge\\" at the bottom of each cup. I think this is typical with one-cuppers though. Doesn't affect the taste of the coffee, just don't drink that last sip!All in all, I'm happy with what I have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burn out","review":"I liked the single cup plan with little prep time.

It's a great concept kitchen item, but I got the defective one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for freshness every time","review":"For years, I have been the only coffee drinker in my house, and hated the taste of coffee after sitting in a carafe for more than an hour. I came upon this beverage center in a store about four years ago and have been hooked ever since. Every cup of coffee I make is FRESH and quick without the weird taste of instant coffee. Even if someone comes to visit, I can quickly brew two cups (one after the other). A few weeks ago, it started to show signs of wear as in water buildup (because I didn't vinegar clean it ever), and in a panic of maybe not being able to use it soon, I went on a search in the stores. No luck. Good old Amazon.com. Got my new beverage center within a week, and now I have it still sitting in the box with the peace of mind that when my old faithful gives up, I won't be without it for even one day. By the way, I now clean my beverage center with a vinegar rinse once a month like they suggested, so between the two of them, I'm set for years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money.","review":"This brewed about four cups of coffee before it stopped working. Just like so many other people's experiences with this machine, I fill the resevior and no water comes out. Clearly, something is seriously wrong with the design of this product. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 3 months","review":"I originally got this coffee maker using rewards points from a credit card. I ordered this particular model for it's low price and features. I mostly used it to make one cup of coffee in the mornings. The water reservoir holds about enough to make 6-8 ounces of coffee, if you want to use a larger cup or a coffee mug, you have to refill the reservoir once the coffee maker shuts off after making the first cup. After two months it started making popping noises, but that was not the main problem. The instructions say to wait 30 seconds before turning on the coffee maker to make a second cup. But pressing down on the \\"on\\" switch to make the second cup becomes difficult. After 3 months of use the switch broke. I will ask for a refund as I plan to buy a different model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice features, but has its flaws...","review":"I purchased this product for my husband after he requested one for Christmas. (He didn't request this particular brand...just a single cup brewer).PROS:It does what it promises...it brews very hot water/coffee for use into a cup.CONS:The handle to remove the filter from the unit is the same 'neck' that is used to dispense the hot liquid into a cup. Therefore, if you remove the filter and accidentally tip it towards you, any remaining scalding liquid dispenses onto your unsuspecting hand. This is an incredible design flaw.This unit makes more popping and moaning than our 10-cup brewer. There is absolutely nothing quiet about this product.Granted, this item is only in day two of use...but as of this writing, I am not a very happy owner."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay, but a bit disappointing","review":"This coffee pot has some good features to it. It allows you to use podsIt allows you to use different sizes of cups.The bad thing is that when you plug it in, the hot water starts, there is no buttonto turn it on or off, so you better be ready when you plug it in.My son wanted it for at his fraternity house and he seems okay with the design,but, if it were mine, I would have sent it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Design","review":"My husband bought this and we have had it over 2 years without any of the issues others have experienced. However, the water reservoir is a bad design. It constantly sticks and you have to use a lot of strength at times to pull it out and I always feel like I'm going to break it. You also really have to jam it back in and water sploshes out when you do. It is also a very small reservoir. It only hold enough for a small to maybe medium size cup. I like to make a large cup of hot tea, but it doesn't hold enough water. I just don't like it and would never purchase this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine sucked, too","review":"I asked for this for Christmas and was really looking forward to receiving it.

I got the usual telephone menu, sat on hold for a few minutes and finally a non-English speaking agent answers (no surprise there!) and asks me my name. I decided to see if they could help, which became evident (within 10 seconds) that they couldn't, I hung up.Totally frustrated, I decided to return this and just get a plain no-frills coffee maker, which I did and have no complaints.This is my third Hamilton Beach purchase and I have concluded with absolute certainty that their products are substandard, defective, poorly made products."},{"rating":"1","title":"POS product","review":"I received one of these as a prize for a fundraiser.

After hearing the first single and following the Tony3 over the years, I thought this would be a guaranteed hit. Unfortunately it was a bonafide MISS! Enough to make you understand why Raphael may have changed his last name to Saadiq - to avoid any association with this Wiggins."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love everything about it","review":"How can it be that the group on his production label (Destiny's Child, who is on Dwayne's Grass Roots Entertainment label) can sell millions, but Dwayne's own stellar album can't? He has a nice tenor voice, his lyrics aren't that run-of-the-mill R&B stuff that you keep on hearing, and the production is top-notch. My favorites include \\"Don't Sleep\\", the title track, and the Maxwell-esque \\"Let's Make a Baby\\" (co-written by Jamie Foxx [!]). And I didn't even know until I read the reviews here that the guy he sings with on \\"Music is Power\\" is Darius Rucker, the black guy from Hootie & the Blowfish. Though his brother Raphael Saadiq released his good Lucy Pearl project that same year (2000) and his decent solo album this year, I would recommend Dwayne's album over those two any day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"It deserves 4 stars because it has the melody, harmony and the lyrics to make this album a hit.

Worse, when she is told that the man in the car with her was murdered and she is being turned over to her estranged husband's custody, she doesn't remember him.Patrick reluctantly allows his wife to come back after her car accident. After she supposedly ran away with another man (one of her many lovers) all he wants is for a quick divorce. Unfortunately, he can't get rid of his feelings for her.Molly doesn't remember what she did to be hated so much, only that she wants to find out what and get on with her life. Unfortunately, someone is trying to kill her and she doesn't know who.Winter's Edge is a good book, but not as good as her others. Shadow Lover and Ritual Sins are by far her best. If you're looking for a quick, good read this book is for you. I read it in one afternoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a very good book","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I've only read one other Anne Stuart book, but after this one, I wlll definitely ready more. As soon as I finished reading Winter's Edge, I started Meg O'Brien's Crashing Down. It is about a woman author who has written a book titled, that's right--Winter's Edge. Which by the way is another great book. I have several more Anne Stuart books and can't wait to get to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um ... not one of her best","review":"Anne Stuart is usually a dab hand at romance writing, but here she (unusually) fails to transcend her maudlin genre. Oh dear, the old hackneyed memory-loss plot device. And am I really expected to believe that two supposedly non-stupid people madly in love with each other completely mis-read the other even through marriage? The heroine's character undergoes drastic change when she loses her memory (even though the book itself admits that amnesia does not bring on personality change) which is never satisfactorily explained. The plot is not only predictable, it is too incredible to work for me. Sure, romance is never realistic (by definition; life is not romantic) - but good romantic writing should bear at least a passing resemblance to reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hefty and warm","review":"My daughter wanted a Korean Mink Blanket like I had, but she did not want the safari scene.

Then the dog crawled in, so it was a go!!The price here on Amazon was much better than any price I had been able to find at the Oriental stores, which is where I had purchased 2 Solaran Mink blankets. Except my first one, it was purchased from a street vendor at a highway exit. $40, never found that low of a price since, but it was also a very ugly flames colored orange, green, red and purple with a Phoenix like bird.

All of the text is the same color and the text placement is all in one column. This makes the concept of trading off who reads really hard to get.

It is labeled as a thin padded sliding short. Please show me where the padding is, because all I see is a double layer of fabric over the hip and outside thigh area. My daughter is a highly competitive player on both travel teams and high school varsity. These shorts would offer no protection in sliding circumstances. However, she loved how they fit and felt; they are very comfortable. As a compression short, I would rate them very high, a definite A+. Unfortunately, we need padded sliding shorts that offer protection to a player. These don't fit that bill, due to the lack of good padding."},{"rating":"1","title":"a jumble of disorganized anecdotes","review":"this is a book that both benefits and suffers from extensive research. It is entirely undigested and frequently wrong on the facts. While the writing is good during the telling of each anecdote, the failure to develop any characters or for that matter a plot quickly makes reading tedious. A shame, because there is a lot of first-rate raw material here. The author just doesn't evaluate it critically, or tie any of it together."},{"rating":"1","title":"$87 ????","review":"Great book. Question :Why is this being offered for $87 when new from publisher it is $14.95 ? Certainly do not get this. I am looking for 4 or 5 and just bought one with cD on Craigs list for $8."},{"rating":"2","title":"Progressive Rock Classic","review":"This album marked the transition between old Rush (Hemispheres, long songs, sci-fi lyrics) and new Rush (Moving Pictures, shorter songs, more mainstream lyrics). In turn, it ends up having the best of both worlds. For example, the great opening combo of Spirit of The Radio and Freewill gave a taste of what was to come on Moving Pictures with Tom Sawyer, Limelight, etc. And Natural Science was a sort of mini-epic comparable to (and actually better than) Hemispheres. Those three songs are absoulte classics, but Jacob's Ladder is nearly as good, and Different Strings and Entre Nous are about as close as Rush ever got to a ballad, and they are both adequate songs. Geddy arguably turns in his best performance ever on bass here (with the possible exception of MP), and, the lyrics are, of course, excellent (especially Natural Science with it's usage of tide pools as a metahpor for the human race in a sort of future Utopia). Overall, just an excellent album."},{"rating":"2","title":"End of an era","review":"Rush said goodbye to the sci-fi tales, the ten-minute epics and the complex arrangements for a more commercial, radio friendly sound, with successful results. A change of decade bought a change of approach in their music, with lyrics that the man in the street can relate to, the right to choose (\\"Free Will\\"), the communication barrier (\\"Entre Nous\\") and the environment (\\"Natural Science\\"). Opener \\"Spirit of Radio\\" was a hit on this side of the Atlantic, and unbelievably can still be heard on radio today (albeit not very often) Had I reviewed this without hearing \\"Moving Pictures\\", I would probably have given it 5 stars. \\"Pictures\\" is in every aspect better than \\"Waves\\" and is probably the best rock album ever made (check my review), but this record still stands out on its own. Worth purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab Release","review":"This review refers only to the MFSL gold disc release.There are some MFSL releases out there that, in my opinion, warrant the high price tag. But this isn't one of them. The sound is fine, but I didn't find it to be notably better than other versions of this album I've heard. On top of that, there is a good amount of hard limiting, particularly on the first two songs and the final song. Rush in particular is a band that benefits from lots of dynamic range, and it's baffling why an outfit in the business of producing audiophile releases would sabotage the final product by cutting the dynamic range down in order to make the CD louder.Steer clear of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe if they were an all instrumental band ...","review":"I think Lifeson and Peart are fine enough musicians in their own right, but I can't really hear them... first, because I can't get past the insipid, pseudo-cosmic lyrics. Add to that the fact that they're sung by what I can only describe as a squirrel on helium. That's far too much to ignore when trying to listen to their music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rush Classic..","review":"This album is great because from beginning to end there's no filler!! All songs on here are solid and can stand by themselves easily.Track 1- Probably the most heard Rush song ever..still rocks2- Another smash hit for them, signature Alex sound3- overlooked killer, epic rock song4- this is a great melodic song that flows easily5- moody, solid, delicious Alex guitar parts6- the epitome of what a prog-rock song should be; probably my all time favorite Rush song...if not..close...It comes in three distinct \\"waves\\" or parts, and they're all excellently crafted.You must have this album if you are a Rush purist and if you're just discovering them it's a great place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This is Rushes greatest album. Jacobs Ladder is cool, Natural Science is awseome and Freewill well what can I say its one of the greatest songs ever written. My favorite song would have to be Spirit of Radio. The first time I heard it was on the radio and I liked it but didnt know what it was called. The next day I got the Album. Geddys voice combined with Alex's guitar and Neil's Lyrics are awesome in this song. My favorite part are the hard riffs at the begenning middle and end.The Album it self is a master piece of music. This album was made right at the end of retrospective one when Geddy first started with the keyboards."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for any Rush fan.","review":"I have always considered this to be one of the best records of 80,s \\" Rock with thought\\".A must for any Rushhead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine mix between classic prog and radio friendly songs!","review":"Okay, the Prog years of Rush are over now with Permanent Waves, but it doesn't fail to please!

It's hard to describe \\"Jacob's Ladder.\\" Whatever it is, it's FREAKIN' AWESOME! \\"Entre Nous\\" and \\"Different Strings\\" are cool too. Probably one of the last prog songs by Rush is here. \\"Natural Science\\" is a 3 movement piece (IMHO), about their philosiphy on life. I don't know if it is, but whatever it is, it's SWEET!!!

I don't know if this is band approved (i doubt it), but it looks like filthy rich record companies have no qaulms about milking fans into buying CD's they already own. I guess when the money stops flowing from from bands back catalogs they have to start pulling stunts like this...I don't think Rush would do this to their fans, I bet this thing isn't even band approved, official licenced, therfore Geddy and the boys get screwd out of hard earned balloons.Don't buy this sad attempt at a record executive ca$h grab."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prelude to Moving Pictures.......","review":"Another classic recording from the Canadian power trio. Permanent Waves is the first album to go mainstream on radio. Most of the songs are short except for Natural Science and Jacob's Ladder.

Permanent Waves is the perfect transition between the epic concept stories (2112) and songs concerning everyday life(Limelight and Subdivisions). Alex Lifeson provides versatile guitar solos, Geddy Lee is in good voice providing both bass and keyboards. Behind the percusssion orchestra and poetic lyrics is Neil Peart. \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" is interesting and futuristic and the sole ballad is \\"Different Strings\\" (much better than the sappy \\"Tears\\"). \\"Free Will\\" deals with spiritual questions and \\"Entre Nous\\" deals with the communication barrier. \\"Natural Science\\" is ahead of its time with its environmental concerns. Last but not least, there's \\"The Spirit of Radio\\" which was reportedly dedicated to a Canadian radio station (and one of Rush's 1st big hits!). Finally, we have a \\"rock anthem\\" with intelligent lyrics!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really, I need to review this album!!!!!!!","review":"When I think of Rush, I think of this album. Not MP or 2112. Why 6 more words required?

A very crisp and energenic work. As such, this may in fact be the most accessible album that Rush has delivered.If you're curious about Rush, this is probably one of the first discs you should pick up."},{"rating":"2","title":"PEMANENT WAVES BRILLIANT..","review":"Permant Waves is maybe one of the best albums, Rush ever made ,outstanding tracks include'Spirit of radio','Freewill','Entre nous'& of course'Natural science',excellent.A good place to start,what are you waiting for?,go and buy it..Cygnus.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Triteville","review":"Pettersen could be the next Ani DiFranco... except for her non-existant guitar skills, transparent lyrics, and meaning as deep as a fetus's wading pool.

A few of the groups lesser known singles (\\"Robert DeNiro's...\\" is one) are here, along with some interesting album tracks (\\"I Can't Let You Go\\"), and a handful of 'Rama Rarities. \\"Scarlett\\" has a nice bouncy edge, but the girls' vocals are pretty sloppy; \\"Ghost\\" is likely the worst cut, with solo vocal lines so flat that you can't help but understand why the girls usually sing in unison.

They did seal ok though, so if you just need to keep things dry and airtight (camping gear, comic books?) but not vacuum-packed, these are a cheap alternative to Foodsaver brand rolls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loops? Spindash? Cutscenes? Yeahhhh!","review":"Sega (at the time) really cared about the quality of their Sonic games... so they tried to put a genesis style game onto the gamegear! IT IS EPIC!

It's written for children and tells a tale of how an entire village celebrates a man's death!

What exactly is the author trying to teach kids? How to make money by hoping someone dies, or even better how to kill for money? This book isn't fit reading for any age."},{"rating":"1","title":"real bad","review":"Just like the previous reviewer said, it is a realy bad book. What it says is: scalping is good, it gives you confidence, losses are small, profitable percentage is high, you get low drawdowns using it... That's about it. The rest is just nothing. There are some phony setups, plenty of meaningless examples: you get in here and get out there, it goes up further but we don't care etc. Some discussion of level II screens, mostly irrelevant, and some weak attempt at trading psychology, about one paragraph long. That is it.When buying this book, judging by author's reputation and the price, I thought that it is going to be a comprehensive reference on scalping. It's not. I did a search on Google and found an article (free) discussing in great detail six setups for scalping the S&P.; That article is more valuable than this book. And it is free. Make your conclusions.Don't buy it. Most basic books for beginners have more info in them on day trading and scalping than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost the best set!","review":"i am happy that this awesome set comes with all you need to start a great family of awesome sea monkeys, considering i have some of my own. these are the best!!!!!! you can actually revive your sea monkeys if they are dead!!!!!!

Although both sets are relatively the same, the instruction package with my second set is much better. The sea monkeys in the \\"Executive\\" set lasted about a month and a half. This was due to the fact that the instructions on how to care for them were very vague. We did not know that you needed to add air to the water or that over feeding was extremely bad for them. The instructions in the sea monkey set we bought locally were very good and we have now had sea monkeys for over 3 months.

Historical discussions of cities and towns in this book are organized, not chronologically, but arranged by genre, such as orthogonic, concentric and linear environments. This book chronicles urbanization from the ancient Greeks through the dreams of futuristic idealists in the 1960s. Moholy-Nagy's text is vivid and engaging, and the plans and photographs complement it nicely. Equal discussion is given to many major cities around the world, although the evolution of New York City seems to the focus in the latter part of the narrative. Overall, this book earns its place among the many works out there on urban history, and is a must for anyone interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional Music","review":"A very unusual Phil Woods album.

The strings are are just a little thickly laid on in this recording for most Phil Woods' fans. That said, the title cut Images should be in the dictionary as the example for \\"Tour De Force\\"! Not only is the piano playing by LeGrand exemplary, but the ballad section is one of the most beautiful written. And of course, Woods shows on this one cut that all the other pretenders to the Alto Sax God throne are just that, pretenders. The title cut is clearly worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funky Rhythm Tap DVD","review":"I bought this DVD recently.

It is the worst excuse for a horror movie I've ever had the displeasure of wasting my precious time on, as well as my hard earned money, neither of which I can get back.

The plot was wretched and pointless."},{"rating":"2","title":"SPOILER ALERT!!!","review":"Don't read this review unless you've read this tpb already! This was an excellent story about a possible future of the Avengers. Although the art is great and the plot dramatic (dramatic in a good way), some of the scenes were predictable (the last page for instance). This is all made up for though with the explanation of the Hulk's death, as well as Kang's death (even though he probably wouldn't have really died due to the device he uses [read Avenger's Forever TPB]).The whole Ultron in charge thing was good, as was the blood and tragedy thing of a certain brother and sister.

This book is sure to be a best seller! Katheryn's Secret is a weaving of suspence and intrigue. Right when you think you're on the right trail, she throws in another twist. Anyone who loves a great mystery will love this book. It's a tale about family secrets, the effects of a legalistic, religeous upbringing and how God can work through the misguided mistakes of family. It's about love, lost love and love rekindled. Linda shows us--without being preachy--the difference of being religeous and having the love of God in our hearts, where we learn to love others. Her characters are real and well developed, as is the plot. By the time you finish this story, you may find that you identified with one or two of her characters and hopefully--learn from their mistakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Lamps for the Money","review":"Cute lamps, with lots of adjustability, which is nice for projects.

You can get the same thing by buying a blank VHS and recording the episodes.It wouldn't be so bad except the fact that they included the begging and the end after each of the four episodes and you have to reach for the remote to fast-forward to get to the next episode.My recomendation is to save your money and wait until January for the DVD's of the Sailor Moon S series by Pioneer. Or the VHS's at least they seem to do things in a sensable order. Beginning, all the episodes, ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definetely Not for hardcore fans!","review":"I absolutely hate this video! DiC did a horrible job with the censoring and wording.

Everybody knows this stuff is worthless with it's highly censored and edited storylines, poor voice acting, and tacky 3D computer generated images flashing over at every scene change. Save your money, especially now when there is something of a chance that sometime in the future an unedited Japanese language/English subtitled version will be made available. The Japanese version is much better (from my own personal experience). Save up for that. Besides, this show airs on at least *ONE* TV station everywhere in the USA weekly. Or maybe even daily. So if for some reason you're stuck on getting the dub, just buy some Maxell VHS tapes and record your own version off TV for free. Am I the only person realizing that even the art on the cover isn't a Japanese peice, but a poor American immitation?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be much better...","review":"This DVD is good for little kids. The storyline is much easier to follow than if it was taken straight from the Japanese version (and a little more appropriate), but you sacrifice a lot of the good storylines. If you want the real story, go for the boxed set of season 1 and 2 DVDs, in Japanese with subtitles, or try the \\"Heart Collection\\" and \\"Pegasus Collection\\" DVDs. although they are seasons 3 and 4, they have the option of watching it, uncut, in the original Japanese with subtitles, or in English.

I know alot is left out of the DIC version but when I watch the ADV it seems like the characters are dull and lifeless? It seems like ADV is missing something...I didn't enjoy them at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this version","review":"Very cute and entertaining. Too bad it''s no longer on TV. Oh well this DVD brings you Sailor Moon in her earliest endeavors. Great Show. Give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only average, but a must for new fans!","review":"Let me start off by saying this- Sailor Moon is great. But this particular DVD is only average. Why? Well, first of all, it is the TV version- not a good thing for most people. The voice acting literally makes me cringe. It's the best you can get, however- there is no subtitled version out currently. Also, the animation is merely average- chunky drawings, solid colors, not as fluid, etc. Yes, the storyline of SuperS (not Supers!!) isn't that good, but the animation is beautiful compared to this. However, the thing that saved it from 2 or 3 stars was the story. This is definitely the must get DVD if you are not familiar with the story of Sailor Moon. But again, if you know the story already, invest your money in Sailor Moon S (personally my fave season) or SuperS (for the gorgeous animation). (By the way, I may be only 12, but I know my anime and manga. I have been a SM fan even before its US release.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"A big Sailor Moon fan, I know DiC took out a lot and changed a lot too.

Some of the INSERTS are cool too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aww finally you get to see the orignal Thank you!","review":"Don't buy this its all chopped up. DIC took alot of the parts out.

The voices in the american version are alright but not very good. Go to ebay you can get episodes 1-200."},{"rating":"1","title":"A DVD Nightmare","review":"I CAN NOT stress enough that the dub version chopped half the original show. And one would think that after the wonderful release of the Sailormoon S and SS seasons, the classic season DVD's would be just as great-think again! Not only are the episodes in dub format only, the covers in my opinion are nothing compared to the previous DVD covers, and the titles are ridiculous! \\"A Heroine Is Chosen\\"? Get real! They could've at least said something like, \\"Sailor Moon- Classic Collection I\\", even that would be OK. The only somewhat \\"good\\" thing about the *\\"classic dub\\" DVDs is that they aren't $26....4-5 dubbed episodes isn't worth the money. I only gave it 1 star because they actually released it, cheaply too-in both price AND quality.

It's just that until Sailor Moon S came to the U.S., it's like it was adapted so it'd be better for little kids. Everything had to be right for the parents to let the kids watch it.

Don't get me wrong, the Japanese version is great...but when is translated, they turn it into a G rated show by editing out important things and changing around entire episodes. Some episodes were not even aired in America, because they were thought to be too \\"riske'\\".I hope, for the sake of myself, and many other fans, that Naoko Takaushi decides to release the series with a subtitled bonus.

After five minutes out of the freezer they were back at room temperature. I grabbed a pair of scissors and cut them open. What did I find?

Out of all the tracks, I would say that three of them are worth listening to. You can't sing along, you can't tap your foot to the music, because it wanders and skips all over the CD. Save your money......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good.....","review":"I really don't like this CD very much. After Yearwood's last album, I decided I wouldn't buy anymore of her VERY BORING collections. The only thing that made me buy this one is her version of Linda Ronstadt's \\"Try Me Again,\\" which is good, but too much like Linda's (Linda's is much better, too). So, no, I don't reccomend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"What exactly is this? Dissapointed","review":"Ok, in the past she's had some maybe good songs, but what is this supposed to be?

But Trishia Yearwood has come through with a wonderful new CD. Its a little less a country but fans will not be put off. \\"I Did\\" really blew me out of the water. There is a song by Bruce Springteen (\\"Sad Eyes\\") and no less than three by Matraca Berg. Among those \\"I'm Still Alive\\" is amazing. Yearwood is a great performer and has chosen thoughtfully this time around. Jackson Browne, Emmylou Harris and Berg have guest appearances. This CD is a must for all Trisha Yearwood fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy listening at it's best","review":"When I first listened to this album, I did't know who Trisha Yearwood was. It was a very good surprise!In most albums, there are very good, nice, not so good, and really bad songs. But this album is an exception, like few others (eg. Eric Clapton - Unplugged). I've found them all to be very good songs! I have no favourite one because it could be any of them.Trisha's commitment is amazing. Her voice is lovely, her feelings sincere, her passion so strong that she couldn't have made it better! As for the other musicians, they are as good as it gets.I would classify this as one of the best easy listening albums, ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is my inspiration.","review":"I just purchased this CD.

Was disappointed all the way around with this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trisha is AMAZING!","review":"All I have to say is WOW! I bought this CD a week ago and I haven't listened to any others since! This has got to be one of the best CD's I ever bought. Trisha's voice is just amazing in every song - she puts in so much emotion. I am also happy that there are no Diane Warren songs on this album - I like her songs but they were getting a bit old, I think. My favorite songs on this album are \\"Real Live Woman\\", \\"Sad Eyes\\", \\"One Love\\", \\"I Did\\",\\"Try Me Again\\" and \\"Wild for You Baby\\". One of my friends, who normally doesn't like country, listened to \\"Try Me Again\\" and loved it! She also liked \\"Sad Eyes\\" Buy this CD - I promise you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Yearwood's Best","review":"At first when listening to Trisha Yearwood's new cd, Real Live Woman, I had to adjust to the new sound. It is a very eclectic collection of music, but it is perhaps her best yet.Some of the best tracks are One Love, Sad Eyes, Real Live Woman, Wild For You Baby and When A Love Song Sings The Blues, although they are all really good.I highly reccomend this new cd by Trisha, go out and get it~"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"I am a huge Trisha Yearwood fan but this album is not her best.

Not sure whether such a thing existed, I searched Amazon and found this product, listed as \\"Keri Advanced Moisture Therapy Extra Dry Skin Lotion, Enriched *Oil Free* Formula.\\"This is not oil free! That phrase appears nowhere on the bottle, so I assume the merchant (AmericaRx.com)chose to include the false phrase in its listing.

I compared it to my VHS copy, and the audio mix is decidedly different - and much, much worse. The video seems to be fine, however. Still, I find myself wondering why Amazon chooses to sell products like this; it seems it must be illegal somehow, but I really don't know. In any case, before you buy \\"The Return of Spinal Tap\\" on DVD, know that what you're getting is probably not an authorized release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money unless you're a die-hard collector","review":"I was disappointed. Essentially, the video is a low-budget film of a Spinal Tap concert, with a few silly moments. The best parts are interviews with people like Rob Reiner and the Air Force base captain (played by Fred Willard). If the video contained more of those interviews, I would have rated it higher. Too bad that such interviews lasted only a few minutes. I liked the original movie, but I wouldn't necessarily want to sit through an entire Spinal Tap concert. Unfortunately, this video asked me to do so, and I respectfully fast-forwarded my way through 90% of it. Save your money, unless you're a die-hard collector of Spinal Tap memorabilia."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Return of Spinal Tap falls short.","review":"This movie had a tough act to follow, and it clearly didn't meet my expectations.

The funny thing is that I didn't think that it was that harsh when I was washing my face with it. I used the same lotion that I always do, my skin never peeled or flaked.

However the next day, the skin around the corners of my mouth and around my nose got really really dry and started peeling. I stopped using the product for several days, but the skin still remained dry, even when I put lotion on it.Also, my face started breaking out in weird rashes when I exercised and sweat, which was irritating.

It is in that spirit that LEGO has come up with the LEGO Sopwith Camel. This is not your traditional LEGO product; there are less pieces than you would think because they are so many bigger pieces. This is not a LEGO product (like their train set for e.g.) where you can let creativity reign.

Infact, I didn't see a single loop, or any spirals, or anything relative to one. there is hope though, sonic chaos is so much fun that it's probably worth 12 copies of this game. the most important thing to remember if you want to buy sonic 2 for game gear is not to expect anything nearly as good as the console version, so get sonic chaos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but the game is hard","review":"Well, I don't have a Genesis but I tested both.

How many are there now, 500+? Speaking of which, my mother bought a second copy of the first 1986 printing of BSC #1 and still has it sealed in plastic like a mint-condition comic book.

So I was disappointed when I found they weren't being printed anymore, but even more so when I discovered the new graphic novel version in the book store.

Even though they are close friends, they argue and get mad at each other from time to time. What this shows is not \\"easy\\" solutions, but that you can argue and get mad and not end the friendship.

Just listen to the floetry on intro and outro tracks, he addresses the death of his father and friend, and also has one of the better spanish rap love songs perhaps every produced with Latin star Ken Y. Of course he is going to make club songs, it's not like many other southern rappers got anything else to say.

I played with it installed for about a half hour (and used cheat codes to investigate all the new things) and then promply uninstalled and sold it.

A campagn with 12 missions and almost no story line is NOT what I pay $30 for. I agree that the graphics and AI are well done, but my favorite thing about any strategy game is the campagns. They are what made Age of Empires II so playable, the campagns were awesome, and you almost got some history in them. I think a campagn based on the Iliad or Odyssey would have come out fabulous. But this....War Craft III on the other hand has several campagns ranging from RTS strategy to a sort of RPG. They did a excellent job in my opinion. I honestly think that the campagn for The Titans expansion was just not the bang for the buck."},{"rating":"2","title":"not worth the price","review":"the titans expansion pack adds a new civilization, new gods, and a new creature - the almost invincible titan - to age of mythology. there is also a new campaign, in which the atlantean civilization is highlighted. overall, the game play is great. there is a significant depth of strategy involved, and excellent multiplayer gives the game unlimited replay value. however, the price, almost equating that of the original game, is a bit steep, seeing as that only one civilization is added.

I am hoping this is a highly specialized album for a niche group of musically impaired D&B listeners, not the ultimate representation of its genre as its touted. I would be embarrassed to have this in my collection in the same way I would be embarrassed to have a Kenny G. album while considering myself a jazzhead. Since when did shmooz become high art?

Arrive timely and is better that what I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great size!","review":"This step stool is the perfect size for getting on and off the toilet and for washing hands at the sink. The non-stick grip on top is nice so the child doesn't slip. I purchased this along with the Baby Bjorn toilet trainer seat and they work perfect together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy and light weight","review":"This step stool is great - sturdy and very light for the little one to carry around.Our 2 year old loves his stool. He has used it for the last year, mainly in the kitchen. He will carry it around and be able to use it to reach for his toys or other things... Good and bad!I just gave one away as a present at a baby shower - now it turns out that the new \\"big sister\\" took the present from her baby brother and she just loves this little stool.The step stool stays put on the floor and doesn't slide around on our wooden kitchen floor, very safe!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not high enough to wash hands at sink for a 35 inch child","review":"not high enough to wash hands at sink for a 35 inch child. Otherwise sturdy and good product. also very light"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short!","review":"This is an incredibly short step stool. My son is 36\\" and isn't tall enough to use it to sit on the toilet or to pee while standing up. It is also quite expensive for a simple plastic stepping stool. I bought it since it was so popular/highly rated. I just went out and bought one from the hardware store that works much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Safety Hazard","review":"This step stool is a safety hazard. The sides are not angled enough so a two-year-old can easily step too close to the edge and tip it over. In fact the stepping surface is so small that it's hard for a little guy to stay in the middle of it. And when the stool is tumbled over a little explorer can hurt himself badly when he falls onto the sharp edges of the legs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless for Potty","review":"I bought this stool for toilet training. It does not get my 36 inch tall son anywhere near the potty seat except to peer down into the toilet. I moved the step into the kitchen so he can use it to get water from the refrigerator. False advertising."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Safe\\" Step is far from being safe.","review":"This step was terribly disappointing, the grips on the bottom don't keep the step from sliding right out from under my son's feet. The third time he stepped up it went right out from under his feet and he fell over and landed on the edge of the tub, it was awful. It seems to work okay on the carpeted surface, but I'm not really giving it much use anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sturdy but not useful","review":"Like all Bjorn products, this stool is well-made. However, it is too short to be useful. We have a tall 2.5 year old and the ugly $5 Target version is the one we have to use simply because it's 1-2 inches higher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"We use this cute little step stool all over the house. We use it in the restroom so that my toddler can brush her teeth and wash her hands. I also use it in the kitchen so that I can reach things on the higher shelves without having to climb on the counters or bring a chair in from the dining room. We really like that it has the non skid rubbery traction on the top and the legs so it's a little more stable. I would recommend the product to anyone looking for a great little stool. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but not cheap","review":"This is a great little step but it is not cheap. Recently I found a functionaly equivalent step (non-slip top, broad stance, rubber feed) at a local hardware store that is a little bigger and taller with a weight capacity of 300 lbs for half the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"great step for learning toddlers","review":"Great step. We paired this with the Baby Bjorn toilet training seat and are very happy with both. The step is sturdy and has a thick rubber top and base creating superior stability for toddlers learning to use the toilet and step up to the sink, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so safe","review":"This product is not the safest step stool for kids especially little kids. My twins are 2 years old and we recently start using the step stool and the matching potty and to be honest both products are disappointing. This worked perfect in our guest bathroom where standing on top of a rag is well support. But my other bathroom is tile and it slides a lot regardless of the rubber underneath. Also the stool is quite small and both of my kids have fallen from it few times because they will step on the corner first and before they get the chance to put the other foot up they are on the floor. Before I even decided this will be a definite return my kids did not care to use it almost as if they were scared to go on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything I wanted","review":"I bought this in white ann love it! My 2 year old got a wood 2 step Stool for his birthday and would carry it everywhere. But it had sharp corners and was very heavy. He tripped and fell on it once and I said \\"that's it, we're shopping for a new one\\". This one is perfect, rounded corners, lightweight and a slip proof base. My son carries it all around the house and if he falls with it it's no big deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"helpful and safe","review":"This stool works great for getting on and off the potty. I like that the top is skid proof and the base is wide to allow for stability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luc's mom","review":"I love that the entire top of the stool is rubber as well as the bottom. This keeps the stool from being slippery when water is dripped everwhere when our little one is washing his hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short...","review":"This stool is only 6 inches tall (or a little less...the box it arrived in was 6 inches tall). There is no assembly it seems to be really great quality. Rubber skid resistant top and legs.I went to Target and bought an 8\\" stool near the mops & buckets for $5.99 and will be returning this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Injured my son","review":"This stool can flip completely over if your child tips it and they can land squarely in the middle of the overturned stool. This has happened to my son more than once but this time he got a huge deep scrape from on e of the legs. I am going to complain to the manufacturer as well but am hoping to save other children from injury!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short to do any good","review":"We agonized over which stool to buy our 2 yr old daughter. We wanted one that could be used to help her reach the toilet and later the sink as she got older. It's great for reaching the toilet and even eventually the light switch. But it's very short for trying to reach the sink.I do like the wide base (although she's still fallen off of it) and the rubber top."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best stool!!","review":"I bought 2 other stools before (reluctantly) deciding to buy this one. This truly does not slide around on my bathroom tiles! I also like that it has the big cut-outs on the sides, easier to pick up. I wish i had found this one first, one of the other ones cost a bit more and was the worst one of them all! I definitely recommend this to anyone! No more sliding and falling into the toilet while potty training!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Item","review":"Nice little step stool for the children too short to reach the faucets. Seems to be sturdy and should have a good useful life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This stool is nothing special AT ALL! I paid like $16 for a stool that is not slide proof and is not tall enough to get my daughter's face over the bathroom counter. It was a total waste of money. I got a better stool from the dollar store!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great step stays in place","review":"I really like how this step was designed to stay in place. We have a cheaper plastic stool in another bathroom that tends to scoot too easily as our son climbs up on it. This one stays put! The only reason this stool didn't get 5 stars from me is because of the textured top. It is a little difficult to clean. Since this is a potty step stool, it has gotten some messes on it that I wish would have been easier to get rid of!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid step stool, worth the price premium over other stools","review":"This stool is solid and not flimsy at all. The top surface and legs are rubber coated and don't slip on my lineoleum bathroom floor. It is very stable. It is well made and can easily support my weight without any flexing. My 2 year old son uses this for potty training and the height is perfect where he can stand over the toilet. Compared to the cheaper step stools, this one is worth the extra $$$ spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Step Stool","review":"I bought this step stool to go with my daughters new potty chair, it is wonderful! Very sturdy and looks so cute!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Stool","review":"I purchased this stool with the matching seat cover for my daughter for potty training. I like that the top has a non-slip cover on it to keep my daughter from slipping when getting up on the toilet. She really likes that she has her own special stool for going potty, it has helped in encouraging her to start potty training."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nina having fun!

I like all of them simply becuase they are FUN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is so not Nina","review":"I don't understand why she makes such a turn in her music style, from Smack Jack to Sunday Morning I think she should stayed the way she where a punk queen. Nina's vocal range has turned down a lot but it's still a good voice. The annoying song Born To die In Berlin is the only song i like, it's annoying but still gives a good message. I haven't really been so impressed of Nina Hagen's latest work, including her new album, I like it but it's not Nina as we know her. As Nina once said, I'm one of those angels you see flying whit a beautiful voice and a instrument."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy this dvd if you expect nudity","review":"let me first say this dvd is a waste of film and money it is pure rubbish, i could of made a better steamier dvd that would melt your dvd player and keep some very erotic memories in your head for years.

First of all, if you are expecting to see smut, you can order something from a porn site. This DVD is showcasing beautiful women in beautiful environments.

In terms of content and substance, I don't know if it is accurate. However, from the aesthetic point of view, the book is full of disgusting images and negativity that wastes anybody's reading time. In my view, it is impossible to create a work of art out of depressive images, sad emotions and vulgar language. I could not wait until I was able to throw this book down my trash chute.

The levels all build upon each other so that as you progress you build gaming skills that help you in later levels.As with any GBA game, the 3-D levels are kinds difficult to play due to the small GBA screen but refreshing none the less.The only thing that would keep this from becoming a classic is repeatability. Once you beat the game there are not too many reasons to go back and replay unlike the true classic games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I bought this game thinking it would be good (because the movie and show are good).

I mean, after you defeat all the levels and collect all the parts you have to find Jimmy's lab in a tiny shack. I spent hours of looking and still couldn't find it. After all how fun is it when you cant even GET to the last 2/3 of the game? Believe me this was a waste of very good money and it made my baby brother cry of frustration when he kept on dieing.

This is one of those novels. I never really got a good feel for when and where I was, nor did I ever get a good feel for why I cared about the characters, and at the end I didn't see why it mattered what happened to the \\"aliens.\\"There are far better RCW novels to read.

Copey drood. This album is a real disappointment & sounds like a lot of lazy demos strung together. It's the least appealing of any of his albums. It's worse than Jehovahkill & 20 Mothers. If you really like his \\"pop\\" side try Interpreter instead - that's a great album."},{"rating":"1","title":"The effects of hallucinogens - laid out plainly & poorly","review":"Julian Cope has created so many wonderful songs, but he's never \\"gone album\\". Cope's imagination and truly fearless musical adventure guarantees that each release will have some highs and often embarassing lows. This CD is just a big low. Only studied (but not excited) fans of obscure 'kraut rock' could even appreciate this, let alone love it. It surely sounds like noone else, but it has maybe two hooks in the entire CD, used not as a chorus or a melody, but as middle-8th breaks. 'Fried' was and is a truly psychedelic pop record - 'Autogeddon' is just free-form jamming. Without direct lyrics (never a Cope quality), or sly accessability, this CD is the only Cope studio album I've traded in. (You'll find many copies at your local used store). Too bizarre to be a disaster, too meandering to be a success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete INXS plus excesses","review":"This is a real great offering of INXS music, it has the same tracks as the previous double disc release but now with their best MTV's. It is also in a double digipak sleeve which resembles a DVD packaging. The 10 From The Years MTV tracks on disc 3 has a really extensive liner notes from the band, making you realize how they felt during those efforts.All in all, 4 stars however due to the slightly high price. For critics and fans alike.Cheers Michael!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive collection","review":"As a previous review mentioned, there are very few hits or favourites missing from this collection.Recording quality is good, considering the songs, from different albums, have probably been normalised (same volume level).Despite the band having a signature sound, there is enough difference between the songs to keep interest throughout this \\"hits album\\". Live in a stadium, they would have been a knock-out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable Stuff","review":"This was one hell of a ride, a tense cop thriller and an incredible cast, what more could you want? De Niro and Pacino are brilliant as usual and Val Kilmer plays a great role also. The best part has to be the shoot out in the street when a perfectly planned robbery gets foiled and turns the street into a warzone, a part you can watch again and again. And a film which never lets up even until the exciting climax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warner Brothers Fails Again","review":"As Mr. Davidson mentioned above, my two stars aren't for the movie which is great, but for Warner Brothers \\"cheap\\" presentation for this movie. No \\"high definition\\" transfer, no DTS soundtrack. I'm suprised because Michael Mann has generally stated that he really cares about his movies in the DVD format.The gun battle in this movie is one of the all-time best in movie history and Warner Brothers couldn't do it justice.Do not buy this DVD and waste your money. Maybe one day, somebody at Warner Home Video will care about the consumer and put out a quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie gone bad!","review":"Ok gang I purchased Heat years ago when It first came out on dvd. This was my all time favorite movie. Michael Manns camera angles and night shots are great the original sound track was great especially the gun fights, helicopter passes and planes at Lax landing. Purchased the blue ray with high hopes. I saw some improvement in the picture, ok not bad, But what the heck happend to the sound track? Its like watching a Japanese Godzilla movie. Very obvious delay in sound track the mouth moves and a second later the word is heard. The shoot outs are worse, you hear a bang and count to 1 and theres the flash. Some one was enjoying to much Jack and Coke while editing this redo! Please fix and send me a new disk or a refund....."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not get this dvd in this order","review":"i am still waiting on this blue ray Heat. It was not included in package. I realy wanted this blue ray. it is ok if you did not charge me for it. I will look in the store for it but if I was charged I will like to receive it . Thank You"},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael Mann isn't quite the man....","review":"The main problem with this movie is that it is too long: all the key events in the movie are stretched too far in between. I realize that the director most likely wanted to present an uber-realistic 3 hours of an epic story, which would also explain the lackluster and ho-hum dialogue. If the director only cut more of the fat, HEAT could have been a worthy addition to the crime-noir genre rather than a see-saw ride from peaks of non-stop firefights to sedative dialogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grew on me","review":"When I first saw Heat I liked it, but I thought it was too long and I didn't really like the ending. I thought it dragged at times and I wanted the other guy to win the duel. When I saw it again I had the same feeling. But now after watching it for maybe the fifth or sixth time, it hit me in a different way. Now that I am more familiar with Michael Mann's style, I have a better appreciation for Heat. The acting is superb and the writing is tight. And Mann's signature detached, surreal style is perfectly done. Heat is a bold and dramatic epic of right versus wrong, ideology versus ideology and man versus man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"My big complaint is volume dynamics. There are at least a dozen spots where you dive for the remote to turn down bullets and helicopters or turn up mumbled or manic dialogue. WHY couldn't this be fixed? Both of the principal characters are original and compelling. Their love interests and associates...less so. The cinematography captures the look and feel of L.A. exactly the way I remember it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst dvd transfer i have ever seen","review":"Buyers beware dont buy this Heat dvd .It has an awful dvd tranfer.How can they release a dvd with such print quality,simply awful"},{"rating":"2","title":"~Captivating~","review":"Superb casting and dark, realistic character storyline make this one of the best crime dramas ever.Deniro's character really deep inside does not want to live anymore since life as he knew it is basically over (the life of crime that drives him). He is also in love and does not understand that and does not know how to deal with it. He makes a stupid mistake at the end letting his emotions cloud his decision making, but is it really a mistake or a death wish in disguise?Pacino fulfills his wish.Pacino's character is just as driven but in the opposite direction. Two sides of the same coin, same coin, different face. Just as Deniro cannot let go of what is killing him neither can Pacino. It takes Deniro's life and leaves Pacino alive but missing the best of life, thus he is also dead, the walking dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why can't I put more stars?!?","review":"WOW!!! Pacino and DeNiro in a first rate motion picture. Focus on characters was excellent, action sequences were hair-raising, and the dialogue was right-on. My wife and I watch this at least every other month. What an incredible film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece!","review":"This has to be one of my favorite movies, if not my very favorite. There is not a person in this movie who does not blow you away with superb acting. Deniro and Pacino have been mentioned several times, but besides them there is the always brilliant Val Kilmer (who once again proves he is the greatest actor of all time), Hank Azaria , Ashley Judd and plenty of others.Everything about this movie is great, but the best thing would either have to be the story or the acting. I don't like cops and robber movies, but there is a really inventive and original story here. See this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Acting","review":"You may need to watch this movie twice before you get a sense of how lucky you are to witness such fine acting - all in one movie! Pacino and DeNiro are at their best in the restaurant scene - just the two of them. When you think of the magnitude of their presence, it should send shivers down your spine. A truly great film and one that deserved better attention from the Academy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pacino Vs. DeNiro","review":"The biggest showdown ever? Yes! Al Pacino is a Los Angeles cop who wants to find the most sophisticated burglar in the country, Robert DeNiro. Aside from personal problems, the men are well respected by both worlds and when they meet in a diner, it's stone setting! DeNiro's character robs the biggest bank in L.A. and the shoot-out on the streets is remarkable. An extravaganza with a huge cast including Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, Natalie Portman, Tom Sizemore and Jon Voight. Michael Mann's vision is crystal clear and this police-crime saga will never be forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE GREATEST CAST/MOVIE EVER!!!!!","review":"When you have a killer cast like this, how can you go wrong? This movie combines drama, action/adv., and is a heart stopping thriller. De niro and pacino give a great performance and the camera shots and angles are great. 5 stars doesn't even rate how well this movie is made. I would check it out sometime and see the great actors in this masterpeice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Film Ever!!!","review":"Grandmasters Al Pacion and Robert DeNiro in one Film! Great! This Movie is a MUST SEE for all Pacion and DeNiro Fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Many Flames of Heat","review":"Heat offers textured characters in what otherwise would be a a \\"cops and robbers\\" movie. The networking of criminals and police is interesting in itself. Add the emotional toll taken on Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro, Val Kilmer, and Dennis Haysbert and their women, and the viewer sees the police and criminals as real people with real emotions. Even the coldest melt. Pacino's and DeNiro's characters meet one-on-one over coffee, and the arch-enemies reveal their mutual respect for one another--and their dedication to their craft. A classic scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ridicously Awesome","review":"This movie has a mafia feel, mostly due to DeNiro, (my favorite actor ever), who is spectacular, as is Pacino. It pulls you in and the three hours fly by, (unlike a ship sinking or something stupid like that). If your home theater is half-way decent, you'll absolutely love the gunfight at the bank...trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, POOR bluray","review":"I'll keep it simple. The audio and video quality of this Bluray release are the pits. My advice is to buy the regular DVD version, as the quality is much better. The audio of the big gun battle was such a let down on the Bluray, I may never put it in my player again. Whoever mixed this for Bluray oughta be ashamed of themselves!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest movie ever","review":"I cannot praise this film enough; Heat is an absolute GRAND SLAM by brilliant director Michael Mann. Even though there may be a few spots in which the movie drags on a little, you just have to get past that. Heat was filmed ENTIRELY on location, and every single frame in this film is magnificent, a testament to Mann's sheer genius. It has the greatest bank heist and subsequent shootout scenes in cinematic history, and the ending is phenomenal and heartwrenching enough to practically leave you in tears. Do not hestitate to buy this true masterpiece of American cinema."},{"rating":"2","title":"pacino and de niro what else do you want?","review":"ok, so two of the best actors meet face to face, but theres more, this film is great. I have no reason to feel that the film should have been shorter. At the end i knew both the characters, i lived with them and they were both great at what they did. To shorten the film would merely fall it short. Appreciate the beauty and intelligence of what happens. Hell, just have fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful Crime Story","review":"Michael Mann's hand can be felt all over this movie. I mean, we grew up with Miami Vice and then Crime Story, so the groundwork was well-laid. But you never get the sense at any point in any one of his movies (up until \\"Ali\\") that the director doesn't have a clue.... The acting is first rate (although Pacino often throws a bit too much ham onto the plate), the script is fantastic, the pace, conviction, editing are all brilliant, and the musical score (various artists) is perfectly suited throughout.Truly a 5-star movie, extras or no extras. This is why you buy it on DVD; because it will stand the test of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heat","review":"In The Crime Infested Streets of Los Angeles Detective Vincent Hannah(Pacino)has never lost a case,never given up,and has allways stayed on top.But now he must test his skills againts a new enemy, he will meet his match in a master theif(De Niro) and his equally brilliant group.Pacino and De Niro finally meet again since THe GODFATHER Part II."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpleasant characters in a confused and disjointed story","review":"Stopped watching after about thirty minutes.

It arrived on time, A+ for that, put the disc holders inside the Blu Ray case were broken so the disc moved around and put scrathes on the item, so it is impossile to watch without some skipping and pauses while it plays. Bought around 15 DVDs in the past 2 weeks and this has happened to at least 4 of them!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stanard Excellent Performace by De Niro and Pacino","review":"I bought this movie used from the video store as soon as I could. Great cops and robbers story with the typical excellent performaces from Robert and Al. One let down of the movie is that there is only one sceen with the two of them and it was kind of lame. Other than that a really great movie. I suggest you wait for it to come out on DVD.Don't have a DVD player, buy one. DVD is the future and the prices are reasonable. Once you get DVD you will hate watching VHS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-Ray Review - Presentation only","review":"This transfer is the worst I have seen. The picture looks like a dvd and it lacks all sharpness and \\"Pop\\" that we have come to expect with most BR discs. The audio is horrendous. Who ever did the audio mastering at the studio should be fired. The dialog is so low it is ridiculous. You are going to sit there with the remote in hand going up and down with the volume throughout the full 3 hours of this movie. IT IS JUST LIKE WATCHING THE DVD! What a disappointment.Amazon really needs to change the ratings with BR discs. They should not be mixing the dvd & BR ratings!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible audio!","review":"Great movie but the Blu-ray is a comple waste of time and money.

Technically, the worst Bu-ray I have ever watched."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent video, horrible audio transfer......","review":"I was so excited to get this Blu Ray. I LOVE this movie but was extremely disappointed. The video transfer is great, but the audio just flushes it down the toilet. There is no consistency between the sound effects and the voices. The dialog seems muffled and drowned out.It's very difficult to understand what the characters are saying. The sound effects such as explosions and gunshots are very loud and I was constantly adjusting the volume to my AV receiver. I agree with other reviewers on this terrible Blu Ray transfer that ruins a Fantastic movie. Hopefully a new release down the road will fix the audio issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"The DVD is Better","review":"This is a great movie, but a terrible blu-ray disk, and a bad release.The audio is fine, but the video is awful. The focus is completely off in some scenes. In a few places, the video visibly jumps in and out of focus. In other places, the background noise is more animated than the foreground action. The DVD release up-sampled to 1080p is actually better looking than this disk.Even without that, several memorable lines have been removed from this version, with editing that makes it pretty obvious in at least one place.Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Special","review":"This movie is the boston creme amoung the jelly's in the box of dougnuts. The filet minon of movies. This is one of the best movies of all time. It features agruably the two best actors ever. You could shoot these two in just a room with chairs and a table for 3 hours and it would still be good. Instead with Heat, you get these two legends playing a game of cops and robbers, with a great scene where the two end up talking in a coffee shop. This is one of the greatest scene's in movie history. This is a must have for any movie goer. It has all the great acting you can fit into one film. And a few great action scene's. With a running time of almost 3 hours, it will leave you truly satisfied. It is a shame they don't make more movies like this. The DVD features your usual movie trailers and the like. Sound and video are excellent. This movie gets a 5 rating on the hype scale. (See more about me for more info on the scale.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pacino & DeNiro are the greats, a true crime saga.","review":"The sound on it is awesome especially with Dolby Digital on it, Sounds Spectular.

Those 11 deleted scenes would not have made any significant impact of the story line at all. I own the original DVD release and because Heat is my all time fav movie I went and bought the double DVD special edition, otherwise I would not have wasted money. Picture and sound is not improved in any way but if you're looking for good commentary from the director get the special edition.Movie gets 5 STARS, the Special Edition gets 1 (and I am being generous with 1)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does everyone think this movie so great?","review":"I bought this DVD because it was a bestseller and had so many great reviews. Not to mention the great actors in this movie. But this movie blows. It falls short in so many areas i wonder if the reviewers have ever seen a good movie. Way to long, only 1 good long action scene, and the ending has to be one of the worst ever. There was no suspense in the Pacino/DeNiro face off it was so damn boring i fast forwarded it till someone got shot. Seriously people rent this DVD before you watch it star power alone doesn't make a movie good."},{"rating":"1","title":"very average","review":"much like with Harlem Nights that had Richard Pryor&Eddie Murphy i was all hyped to see it and it was not to good.well the same goes here i thought wow!

Whatever you gotta do to get it, watch this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie.. not terribly great DVD","review":"Okay.. now the technical details reviewer gave the picture 5 out of 5 but one of the technical details reviewers gave Highlander 3.5 out of 5 when it is easily worse than a 3rd generation VHS tape. So I don't know what's wrong with the technical details reviews, but they are incorrect.Anyhow.. the movie is fantastic. There are almost no extras (3 trailers), but the picture quality is pretty good except for the really high black level. I can't actually adjust my set low enough that the 'black' doesn't look like dark brown. Other than that, there are no motion artifacts that I could see except for some shimmering in very dark textures (because of that bad black level). otherwise.."},{"rating":"1","title":"BETTER PICTURE? NO","review":"If you're thinking about buying this 2 disc version to get a better DVD picture transfer; don't bother. I couldn't tell a difference from the original release, which is good but could be much better.Only buy this if you're interested in the special features."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"For an action movie it went slowly. Good editing would have improved it; made it move more quickly. It progressed by following the relationships between the characters and their families/friends, rather than following the progression of each character toward definative goal. The characters were real, with normal everyday problems, which take up too much of the movie, slowing it down - a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie review","review":"This was a really good movie.

Smart robbers: love them."},{"rating":"2","title":"the pump-gun is cool scheme -- not in this movie","review":"There are only a few pump-guns in this movie.

They're so obsessed with what they do, that they're driven by it and of course their personal lives are devastated.This film isn't a shoot em up action, Steven Siegal type movie, but rather a deep physchological journey into the obessions, sacrifices, losses, and sadly lives of men driven by obsession, unable to let it go.I thought the ending was quite ironic, man has chance to escape, but could not resist last score. I'd recommend it anytime."},{"rating":"2","title":"De Niro, how did you do that?","review":"I only want to acknowledge one thing. De Niro's character in the film. He is sublimely mezmerising. You just can not stop looking at the character, and wonder what a great actor Bob is. It is just, incredible, what a method acting he has used to become Neil. The rest is good also, but De Niro is the winner here, without a doubt.

Mann tells his stories in such a unique and captivating manner. Heat is a movie with a somewhat implausible storyline, that is told with incredible realism. Every event in this movie is shown with such detail and with such a realistic, \\"in your face\\" feel, that every one of it's 3 hrs is intriguing. Maybe this is just one of those movies that only select few are going to enjoy, but I think it's incredible, with excellent performances by Pacino, de Niro, and a young Portman. (alright, her performance isn't anything special, but she is.) Each actor shows us a unique and believable individual, which is what should happen. At the very least, the shootout in L.A. is one of the best of it's kind in any movie, at least that I've seen. These are my thoughts on one of the best movies ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Al, and Robert at their best!","review":"Two of the best Italian actors at their best.

Technical aspects of the BD can be seen at this website:[...] Although I do see the color tidbits and editing changes, I cannot overlook the fact this is still a great movie with great picture quality. My nitpicks are few: ADR mismatch, Mann's small dialogue edits, and color-matching scene with Eady but still worth 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heat","review":"Have been trying to get this movie for some time.

Real piece of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I the only one who did not like this movie?","review":"maybe my expectations were too high but I thought this was a huge disappointment. The action scenes were not exciting and I don't think they really did a good job with the story. That whole scene where DeNiro and Pacino are in the restaurant talking seemed so contrived I just could not buy it. Maybe with some more judicious editing I would have a different opinion, but I can't reccomend this film to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"an awful waste of some incredible acting talent","review":"Al Pacino,Robert DeNiro,John Voight...You'd think with actors as great as these (along with such talents as Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore) this movie would be put in the hands of a brilliant director.Martin Scorsese?Nope.Sidney Lumet?Wrong.John Frankenheimer(R.I.P)?Think again.Sadly,this movie was directed by the guy who did Miami Vice.This movie is built more like a TV crime drama-with many plots going on at once-than a great crime film.And then I see Henry Rollins on the phone with DeNiro.Okay,I can take that.But Tone Loc sharing screen time with Al Pacino???Who did the casting for this film?Carson Daly??Trust me,instead of this incredibly over-rated waste of celluloid,check out the very under-rated \\"Carlito's Way\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael Mann's Theme","review":"Somebody, maybe Pauline Kael, talked about the pornography of violence. In that sense, Michael Mann makes pornographic films: very hard guys, very lovely women, very little dialog, and lots of automatic weapons fire and spattering blood sacks for the jaded audience. No actual humans need be portrayed, no actual interaction is therefore required; just pretty people banging away. Only Mann's films, pretending to be something other than what they are (not sure what, though), go on forever. At least porn's unpretentious and quick. Honest. Give it a try. Rent something XXX and compare it with \\"Heat.\\" You'll see."},{"rating":"1","title":"No collision","review":"It's really troubling to see all the reviewers talk about how great Pacino and De Niro are together, when actually there is only one scene they share.Moreover, the two probably were never even on the set at the same time, as the coffee scene is shot in singles and over the shoulders. Now wouldn't any director, if he had the chance (even one as stupid as Michael Mann) die to have at least one shot where we could show these two giants together? So each actor was shot separately with probably a stand-in or the script girl reading the lines of the other."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a four-letter word, all right","review":"The Good - Al Pacino versus Robert DeNiroThe Bad - Val KilmerThe Ugly - A Michael Mann filmAnd the winner is...no drum roll needed here...the ugly. Michael Mann can't stop sucking. No surprise there.We begin with minimal dialogue and exposition through words, a MM trademark. Then they did finally \\"act\\" and were howlingly bad, another MM trademark. The writing, the delivery, and the overblown \\"action\\" scenes. Give me a medal for lasting 15 minutes. Okay, 10. It felt like many more. Please, MTV, give MM a job before he films again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, Unbelievable and not worth purchasing","review":"I bought this DVD based upon comments on Amazon. Pacino and DeNiro put in fine performances in an otherwise slow moving movie. The movie would have received possibly 2 or 3 stars if it weren't for the unbelievable shooting scenes, which I found an insult to a persons intelligence. The plot was reasonable just too slow, and certainly not worth purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST film of the 90's","review":"Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino are two reasons to see any film. Add in Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd and Tom Sizemore and you have what we call an all-star cast. The acting is superb, better than any [-thing] Hollywood puts out. This picture has suspense and thrills. It also has the best bank robbing scene I have ever viewed. It can match up with any work Pacino has done, and falls short of every DeNiro film besides Taxi Driver and Raging Bull. This is the ultimate crime drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"Burnin Heat!","review":"This was a collosal movie that I was tired of hearing about so i purchased it and I was not let down excellent stuff!

The jumping is a pain in the butt, but I'll keep it because I don't want to pay anymore to get it replaced. It was new when I bought it & I have watched it 3 times, and always regret having bought it. It's a shame the movie that is new has to come with one of the tapes defective. If I knew I wouldn't have to pay more $$$ I would have returned it. Every time I watch the movie, I regret having spent $$$ on it. Guess I'll have to buy DVD's from now on. Darn shame. Ralph Sherrow 510-397-0951"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absolute Classic.","review":"This was a very good movie, but what made it truly spectacular was having De Niro and Pacino alongside one another in the one film (Godfather II was good, but didn't necessarily have the two actors working directly with one another).Either way, from directing to the screenplay, this film is hard to fault."},{"rating":"1","title":"What... is everyone afraid to say anything bad about a film with Pacino/DeNiro?","review":"Actually, the acting was close to perfect, and all roles were developed nicely, so kudos for casting (but how can you miss with this cast???). The big weaknesses here were the plot and the direction. These were very sophomoric. Seriously... right down to the last scene. Predictable. I actually guessed the last line in the movie right after the coffee house scene. Plot and screenplay were very poor. Unoriginal. Cinematography was uninspired. Actually... a bad movie made no more than 'OK' by a stellar cast.Ok. I watched this movie again a few days ago... and I have to say it. This movie sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing but where's multi-angle?","review":"I loved this movie in the theater, I love this movie on DVD and I will continue to love this movie for all time. Great story, great writing, great cast (make that AMAZING cast), one of the best shootouts ever done in all of movie history and an intensity few movies can match.The only negative that I can think of, as far as the DVD goes, is that there is no multi-angle for the shootout. I've been waiting to try the multi-angle on my player since the day I read about it in the manual and I thought that this movie might be the one. With the complexity of the shootout, I was sure that they could manage a multi-angle section for me, but alas no.Other than that one complaint, this is a phenomenal DVD, with amazing picture and the sound rivals that of The Matrix.This one is going to see some serious play time at my house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great motion picture...","review":"Nicely done all around. Great casting, writing, and cinemetography. IMHO, one of the very finest crime dramas ever made. Although the moive runs around 3 hours, you will find that the time never drags. In the end (like all movies) there is an underlying \\"love\\" theme - see if you catch it. At the end, when DeNiro has a choice, he chooses revenge rather than love. Look what happens to him. Val Kilmer, haha, he chooses otherwise. And...the dialogs!!! Awesone throughout the movie. Just a great film, and the Blu-ray meastering is quite good. Very higly recommended film!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie","review":"One of the best street shootouts ever.

A great movie to have in your library. One of Al Pacino's greatest performanences. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story but Predictable Ending","review":"It seems all movies of this type always end in a shootout between the good guy and the bad guy, with the good guy winning. A surprise ending would have made this a 5-star movie. Otherwise, you have good acting, lots of action, captivating plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie thats worth every penny","review":"From watching the original movie LA Takedown from which Heat has been remade, it has not lost it's thrills and excitement a movie can bring. Heat offers viewers the chance to get underneath the characters and understand their thoughts and feelings.Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro play their roles with such passion that they are able to bring to the screen a slik story of two completely opposite men, one a cop and another the master criminal. The movie is revolves around Pacino who plays the cop trying to capture the slik and itelligent criminal played by DrNiro. Micheal mann's vision and direction are superb throughout the movie keeping you hooked to the very end. The score gives it that extra special ambience.Although the DVD does not offer any special features, the movie alone is worth every penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip the Blu-Ray for now","review":"As other reviewers have noted here, this Blu-Ray (unfortunately like Miami Vice, also from director Michael Mann) lacks the crisp HD picture detail that the Blu-Ray format should have on every title. Once you've seen a good Blu-Ray (think Public Enemies, Fight Club or 2001), then watching a sub-par one is that much more disappointing.Maybe the studios think we're daft in the head, that they can churn out Blu-Ray titles that lack true HD picture and we won't notice the difference until they can then issue a remastered version for yet another unit sale. Since the DVD format is going away, there's a lot of this going around it seems. Skip this version unless you really don't care what it looks like. This is a great film. It deserves better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely underrated","review":"Any reference to a lack of character development in this movie is a downright lie. De Niro is the obvious focal point, as he deserves to be in ANY cast and he lives up to his billing as always. Pacino's character is a little harder to grasp, however. Anyone watching for the car chases and the action scenes won't spend enough time thinking about this movie to realize how his performance is equal to that of De Niro's in its own way. The sleeper in this movie is the relationship between Kilmer and Judd's characters, dealt their hands at birth and trying desperately to make their marriage work in the face of insurmountable obstacles. Anyone who doubts the power of this on-screen romance need only watch the last scene between the two characters, where they don't even speak a word. A movie not only about bank robbers and cops, but about life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Action Flick with some of Hollywood's Best!!!!!!","review":"If you like shoot 'em flicks, this is, without a doubt, the best in years. The extended shootout after the doomed bank robbery is incredibly violent and actually has you rooting for the bad guys!Val Kilmer is peerless and Al Pacino's personal battle with DeNiro pits two great stars against each other.Not as much gore as you might expect but relentless fun and action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pachino is awful","review":"What could have been a brilliant film is turned into a mess by Al Pachino and his PCP addict-like performance.

It sounds like a female in someparts, but then ultimately it sounds like a male...singing aboutor to another male. Whichever, it's a good song to dance towith a very catchy hook.I'd also suggest other Daddy DJ releases such as \\"Girl In Red\\"and \\"Over You\\" if you're into eurodance pop with lush synths andmelodic choruses.

I thought that it might get better but when I came back I saw this big boy pushing his little brother around. This was not a normal boys fight, it was definetly violent.

The story is meandering and disconnected and the prose is so mannered and purposefully arched that it takes the reader right out of the story.

The description is not thorough enough. 1.3 Megapixels is for STILL images, and the images are decent but there is no flash so limited when lighting is bad. Video modes are 640x480, 320x240, and 160x120. Probably my biggest dissapointment was that the best video mode, 640x480, only shoots at 8 frames per second, which is very choppy and fuzzy. The other two modes shoot at 15 frames per second, which is a little better but they are small screen sizes. Audio is pretty good. If this was my first digital camera ever I would probably think its ok, but I was looking for an upgrade to the video capabilities of my current digital still camera, and this was not it. I will probably give it to some 10 year old as a gift or to a friend who has never had a digital camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool camera","review":"This camera is really cool. It takes decent videos and pictures and is still inexpensive and small. The only drawback to this camera is the fact that it has a small internal memory.

It includes a biography of Jane Austen; a summary and analysis of the story; list of characters; bibliographies of her works, and works about her; information about contributors and an index.About half the book is taken up by excerpts from articles and essays about the work written by a variety of authors. I think that the pieces suffer a bit from being cut down, but they do raise some interesting questions and impart some interesting information. They also help serve as a basis for further research. My personal favorite was Donald Gray's work on Money.Not an essential work for understanding Pride and Prejudice, but a good starting point for studying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I purchased this book thinking it would be a scholarly look at Pride and Prejudice given Harold Bloom's Yale credentials. However, it was disappointing from page 1, full of errors. For example, the book lists the publication date for P&P as January 29, 1813 but it was actually released January 28, 1813. There's also a comment that Darcy didn't find any of the women in Meryton pretty but that's not true either - he refers to Jane as \\"handsome\\". There are many more inaccuracies. I was also disappointed by the writing. I was expecting much more from a Yale professor. Perhaps adequate if you have never read P&P and need to write a high school paper but Sparks Notes would be cheaper and just as inaccurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"I love the Thea Kovacs series-this is the first in the series and an easy great read. There are at least 2 others in the series and all of them are engaging and worth the it. She makes the characters evolve and mature-what happsn in this one is reflected on later in the series.

However, the two bonus tracks are proof that Nash WAS involved in at least the early stages of the album when David and Stephen came calling.Musically, the album is a treat for Hollies fans. The alternate version of \\"The Times They Are A-Changin'\\" is the first official release of any live Nash-era material. Track 13, \\"Blowin' In The Wind\\", was originally issued only in West Germany well ahead of the album and extraordinarily rare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Im glad I didnt listen to the critics","review":"Well this hollies release was pretty much hated by just about every critic. After hearing it Im so glad I didnt listen to them. First off we have one of the greatest song writers teamed with arguably the greatest vocal harmony group ever so how bad could it possibly be. I suspect that any band trying to cover the \\"great\\" and \\"untouchable\\" bob dylan songbook was going to be scrutinized regardless of how good it was. There are a few misteps however, Blowin in the wind is heavy handed, but tracks like I shall be released and this wheels on fire are so good they are sure to give the listener goosebumps."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hollies Sing Dylan? It's Better Than I Expected!","review":"For me Bob Dylan is the top artist in the last 50 years, even above Elvis Presley and The Beatles.His songs have been covered by many acts including Peter, Paul And Mary, Joan Baez, The Byrds, The Searchers, Johnny Cash and Neil Young.I understand from the notes included here that the band's songwriters were having a lean time and they decide an album of Dylan covers would give them some breating space.However Graham Nash was no very keen and soon left to join Stephen Stills and David Crosby in Crosby, Stills and Nash.The album has 12 tracks and some have 2 live songs, Blowin' In The Wind and The Time They Are A Changin'Two songs which are rarely covered are When The Ship Comes In and Quit Your Low Down Ways, both well worth hearing.All in all a higher standard than I had expected, I recommend a listern to decide for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Post Bop Pleasure!","review":"R Beirach is a fabulous pianist with great improv. and Geo Coleman also inspires and improvs well!

However, after some play, you can't resist Toby Martin's vocals which are as soothing as they ever have been. On a string, TJ and Chrismas windows are notable.

I must admit, I came into this study with my mind already made up the other way, and I was amazed at the fact of my transformation. I think Dr. Denny Nissley (on the back cover of the book) said it very well for me (and some of my colleagues): \\"Dr. Walston has thrown a 'big wrench' into my tongues-as-evidence doctrinal gears. I am now working through what I thought was a foundational doctrine that I also thought was settled long ago.\\" Kudos to Walston for taking this biblical stand in spite of the flap (and grief) that he has gotten from his Pentecostal brethren."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battery MINDer Charger","review":"Seems to be working exactly as advertised.

Romans good, Gauls good, Germans bad, and no shades of gray. The principal character, the centurion Rufio, is a master at all his crafts: forger of men, psychologist, lover, linguist, military tactician, and motivational speaker. He is in mystical communion with the goddess of Victory and is an invincible warrior who loves cats and children.

I recommend Breem's \\"Eagle in the Snow\\".)"},{"rating":"1","title":"New Age Roman Band of Brothers.","review":"Without a doubt the most ridiculous book on the Roman Legions I have ever read. It appeared that the author was going for a new age Roman Band of Brothers. He managed to turn legionnaires into sob sisters. The love interest of the main character had the most preposterous back story that I have ever read. It was completely unbelievable. These type of plot inconsistencies threaded through the book. For example; the legion commander won't release the sister of the wife of the local chief and ally from a slave trader because he didn't want to interfere with commerce and after all she was just a slave. Really! The dreaded German tribes are threatening to attack and you won't release a slave to keep you ally happy? Really!

The characters are flat and uninteresting, the action is questionable, the dialogue is worse than awful, it's as bad as one of the new Star Wars movies.If you loved Eagle in the Snow, you will despise this book. Everywhere Eagle in the Snow shined, Legion falls flat.

I'm happy to say I was wrong. While a few reviewers were less than enthused with the novel, for whatever reason, I enjoyed it and the way Rufio whipped his century into shape. He was a noble character and I cheered him along. I hope Mr. Altimari decides to write another novel about Rome.(Feb. 27, 2012) I can't believe I wrote the above review back in 2005. But, after leaving this book on a shelf for all those years, I decided to return to the First Century B.C. I'm glad I did. My opinion of LEGION has changed a bit. After reading this exciting novel more closely, I think it is even a better story the second time around. 5 Stars.Thank you, Mr. Altimari!

Laymon!A pretty long book by his standards, I liked how Toby Bones, once finished with Sherry goes after her sister. But by all means Sherry is no-where near done with Toby Bones.

I'm sure that would be a Laymon no-no, but geez this book just gets farther and farther away from reality. I found myself saying \\"oh, come on-this can't be happening.\\" When a book just gets to unrealistic for me I have a hard time staying interested. This is one of them. I love Laymon and will continue to hunt down books he wrote. I just hope this is the worst!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, how I wish I could get the time I wasted reading this trash back","review":"This book is ridiculous. Not one believable character or situation. I wasn't expecting great literature by any means but the entire premise of the story rests on a character behaving unbelievably stupid and unrealistically. I can overlook a lot while reading horror fiction, but there was just nothing in this book that was remotely believeable. Laymon is actually a half-decent writer - easy prose, and he keeps the suspense going to keep you reading. I've read a few of his books and enjoyed them. But his characters tend to behave stupidly and seem to have been created by a 12-year-old boy's dirty adolescent fantasies. Teenage boys looking to get off on sex and gore will probably love this - everyone else should avoid it like the horrendous trash it is. 0 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of all Laymon's novels.","review":"I've read about 20 of Laymon's novels, and they were always at least entertaining. But this book goes so far into the ridiculous, that it didn't even pass as entertainment. The characters are just too stupid to believe. At one point the main heroine (a 25 y/o school teacher) is nearly raped, and runs into a fast food bathroom instead of calling the cops because she's embarrassed to tell anyone her boyfriend has gone missing when he went out to buy condoms. No kidding. There's another scene were two teenage boys find what they believe is a dead woman's body, and instead of calling the police have a ten minute debate over whether to call for help or rape the dead body. This might be mildly amusing if it were meant to be over the top tongue in cheek horror, but Laymon's playing this straight. Not only the worst of his books, but one of the worst books I've ever endured."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!","review":"I picked this up to read on a plane flight and was horrified over what I had just wasted eight bucks on. It is nothing but sick pornography as dreamed up by a thirteen year old boy. I lasted until the girl escapes from a madman and runs into a restaurant. There, against all common sense, she hides in a rest room. A normal person would have run in screaming for someone to call 911. After she accepted a car ride from a strange man she meets in the restroom, I threw the book in the trash---she deserved every bump, bruise and rape she got."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"I am an avid Laymon fan, and have loved all 12 or so of his novels I've read up to this one. There wasn't anything in thsi book that really turned me away, but there wasn't anything that made me want to keep reading either. Picking up this book reminded me of the feeling of having to read books for high school. I was reading it just to finish the book, not because I wanted to. That said it wasn't a bad book. It's just that it doesn't offer anything aside from sex, violence, nudity and a psychopath. Some people may enjoy it, but there are much better Laymon books to read other than this one. Check out Island, Night in the Lonesome October, One Rainy Night, and The Travelling Vampire Show if you haven't yet read them."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've been robbed!","review":"I bought this book at a yard sale for 50 cents because the lady saw me swooping up all the Koontz.

The book itself is terrible. The female lead is a complete moron. She makes bad decision after bad decision. She's kidnapped, attacked, sexually abused, raped, sees people murdered, and is left for dead. After every single one of these incidents she has an opportunity to call the police for help and opts not to with no other reasoning than that she wants to avoid the hassle of dealing with them. When her family is in danger she chooses to leave a message on their home machine stating that if the see someone who looks like they male lead they should hide or just shoot him. Her sister is equally as stupid, going off with someone simply because he stated he knew her sister, getting her friends raped or killed in the process.The moral of this story really seems to be that most women are incredibly stupid, and if they are, they deserve whatever horrible things happen to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gory, and Fun !","review":"I think this would make a sick movie lol I mean it !!

He's even written one of my favorite novels, \\"The Traveling Vampire Show.\\" But of his books that I've read, this one may be the worst. It starts off with a quick, engaging storyline. The first 1/3 of the book was quite the page-turner. Then, the story seems to switch focus from a tale of survival, to one of revenge. This is where the entire novel falls apart.

The plot is nonsensical. Just as one example, the main character refuses to call the police for no apparent reason, even while being pursued by a psycho killer. The characters are ridiculous: they're all gun-toting Rush Limbaugh fans (even the rich suburban teenagers have loaded guns in their houses)with no depth whatsoever. Add in some slapstick violence, gratuitous teenage sex (and why does the main character spend most of the book half-naked?), and I wish I could have given this book no stars instead of one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoroughly Repellant","review":"I am a fan of Richard Laymon. In the past, I have enjoyed many of his novels,\\"The Traveling Vampire Show\\" being one of my favorites, but this is one of the worst books I have ever read. I wanted to wash my brain out with soap after I read it. It's one extended rape fest that reads like a porno snuff film put to paper. The characters aren't fleshed out enough for you to care about them and the so-called heroine makes so many unbelievably stupid choices that it just beggars the imagination. The women are all portrayed as empty caricatures motivated either by their sexual allure or lack thereof, and all the males (with one exception but he's only in the book for a second)as insensitive sex-crazed savages, willing to do anything to anyone alive or dead. I hated this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo!","review":"I am a classical music newbie but I was simply blown away by this CD. The sound of the violin is so pure and yet so warm (not surprising considering that the violin David plays is a 4.5 million 1718 Stradivarius), so heart wrenching and some of the melodies are really haunting, especially serenade and Eliza's song. I bought this CD after hearing David at a live performance at the Royal Albert Hall and have been captivated since. I listen to this CD everyday. My favourite is Toccata, a crossover between rock and violin. You can definitely sense the rebel streak in David. The flight of the bumble bee is just wow. My only regret is that the tracks are so short, I just cant get enough I guess. So bravo, and I cannot wait for the next CD 'Viruoso' to come out in the UK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another amazing work!!!!","review":"I continue to be blown away by David's work.

Worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it, but it has a leak after only a couple of months","review":"My 2 yr old girl got this for her birthday. It took her awhile to warm up to it, but once she did, she loved it! Unfortunately, it has developed a couple of leaks which we haven't been able to find yet, and she's (ahem, I'm) not happy as its a good toy in which she gets out her excessive amount of energy. We've only had it for 3 months, and she's been using it moderately/heavily for only about a month or so. I have been very, very careful to not let her wear shoes in it, keep things that might puncture it out, etc, for fear of this exact thing, but its happened anyway... Sigh."},{"rating":"2","title":"lots of fun","review":"Our 5 year old and 18 mo old grandsons are both having lots of fun with this bouncer. They use it to bounce, but also as a \\"clubhouse\\" or \\"hideout\\" or \\"fort\\" as well. It's good for coordination, balance, imaginary play, exercise. Some advice: Directions don't tell you, but you must inflate each section separately (floor, side walls, top). Once each section is inflated, the bouncer holds air quite well. We've had it outdoors on the patio for 2 weeks now, still inflated and doing fine. It does not come with a pump. You will need to buy a pump to do the inflation. Also, there are some colorful balls that come with the bouncer and add to the fun experience. However, you will need to purchase many more if you want this to be a ball pit. Overall, the kids are happy with this bouncer, so we are too."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is awesome","review":"My son is 20 months old and absolutely adores his castle.

It unfortunately, didn't hold up well enough for her to enjoy it very long - and it wasn't because she was overly rough or abusive.Leaks developed all along the seams, and there are a lot of seams. So, after about 5 minutes, there would no longer be enough air in the bouncer for her to bounce. We repaired the first few, but then it developed so many leaks we simply couldn't repair them all, and the repairs did not hold. (All the initial repairs were made using the supplied repair materials. These materials covered about 4 repairs total. We had to resort to trying other repair methods after that. Those didn't work much better.)This was a total waste of money - especially since we could have purchased 3-4 regular trampolines for the same price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks are unfixable...sad because son loved it...","review":"We have never used this outside - yet we have 2, or more, leaks that we can't seem to fix. It came with one patch, but that didn't work...so we've got it covered with electrical tape, etc, yet air continues to leak out. We inflate it before each use, which is loud and ridiculous, but our son loves to play on it. It's also really big."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy!","review":"We purchased this for our 17 month old son. He absolutely loves it! We can't keep him out of it. I followed other reviews and bought an air pump. Worked like a charm! Hubby & I were able to inflate this in no time. However, there is an air plug inside the castle that our son found rather quickly & learned that he could deflate that chamber. I thought it was going to be a hassle to re-inflate it but nope, no problem at all. The number of balls included is a joke & we even purchased a pack of 100 balls on the advice of another review. Umm, yeah, we need to purchase another 2 or 3 packs of balls in order for the bottom of the castle to be filled completely. That really is the only disappointment in the whole thing but our son doesn't seem to mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable, Durable, Durable","review":"We bought this jump-o-lene for our 1 year old.

I highly recommend this toy no matter how tough your kids are."},{"rating":"1","title":"full of holes","review":"This would have been a fantastic winter toy for my 2 and 5 five year old children...but of course it was too good to be true. The first bouncer had three pinholes in the 2nd tier near the spears. Yes, amazon was helpful with the exchange but the same problem existed with the replacement but only in the third tier. Each time it was very hard to find the leaks... always around the seams. I would not reccomend this model unless they've improved the craftmanship around the seams. This item should only take 10-15 minutes to inflate wth the recommended electric pump. If it is taking longer start running your fingers around the seams feeling for the leaks. Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of fun, but no lasting playability","review":"I bought this item for my 2yr old son for Christmas this past year and when it arrived we got it setup for Christmas morning. He loved bouncing around in the castle and playing with his friends, they enjoyed playing pretend and battling with the swords. But the disappointing part was it only lasted for about two weeks because the seems in the castle started coming apart and it all started to deflate. And let me clarify, these were not holes but the actual seems where the compartments were put together were just coming apart and leaking air out. So I am now in the process of trying to return this item for a replacement, we'll see how that goes.

Already bored with it. First of all we found that if 2 children leaned on the same side, it tipped over. This was the most fun for my son. Other than that, he grew tired of it VERY quickly. It constantly needs to be reinflated as it tends to lose air quickly. One of the swords has had a leak in it since day 1. I consider it a waste of money. On the other hand my 2 year old nephew loves it. I would not recommend it for over 3 years of age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great fun...but won't last long.","review":"My kids (1 year and 3 years) love this thing.

I recommend this for any child that has a lot of energy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Think twice before you buy","review":"I bought this for my son and he didn't like it as much as I thought, I bought it instead of a trampoline, the castle is not the same effect. Before anyone even used it, it lost a ton of air, we had to re-pump it all the time.

Skip this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jump house gave out","review":"My children received this jump house as a gift for Christmas. We put it up two days before Christmas and the kids loved it. It does take up a lot of space and even with an electric pump it took us 30 minutes to inflate it. Unfortunately the castle deflated two days ago. I found one hole at one of the seams of the bottom and the walls have another hole which I have not been able to locate.I am very dissapointed that this structure gave out so fast. We never had more than three children jump in it(more than three don't fit in anyways). And none of my children weigh more than 35lbs. It should be able to take the weight of three kids - but I guess not.So this jumphouse has lasted three weeks - very disappointing. I am going to contact Amazon for a replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huge Castle--Huge Hit","review":"If you have the space for this item in its inflated state, (it takes up more space than the average round kitchen table and 4 chairs) and your kids like to bounce and roll around in balls, then this item's for you. It's not recommended for kids under 3--getting in and out and the bouncy inner surface is a challenge for little legs. An electric air pump is a must. It took us about an hour to fill (and we used the pump's bigger attachment to fill the base). We also bought the \\"100 Balls in a Bag\\" and there's plenty of room for one or two hundred more balls. Only 2 kids (max) are supposed to be in it at once. My child likes this toy and we like watching her play in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"This is my first review... It cost $28 to ship this thing, we spent another $50 on a high grade electric air pump and it still took over an hour and a half to inflate! It is too big for inside the house, but it takes too long to inflate for any short term use outside. Seemed like a really great idea...but I was wrong!!! My 2 1/2 year old was tired of it by the time we got the thing up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"The bouncer took over an hour to pump up the first time ON AN ELECTRIC PUMP. And on the second day I had it, I discovered that there was a small, impossible to find, leak in the base of the bouncer. So, every time my 2 year old wants to play with it, I have to refill the base with the pump. It's too big for the house but if you leave it outside, it gets all disgusting from the elements. Pumping it up and taking it down every day is impossible unless you have an extra two hours every day (and who has that extra time with a two year old). So for now, it sits, like a white elephant, in my back yard and I keep filling it up every day when my son goes outside. I would return it if I could. Bottom line. I'm sorry I got it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandma in South Carolina","review":"When I received this product I followed the direction's completely in letting it sit 24 hrs. before inflating etc... It is big too. He LOVES putting the balls in the holes and play fighting with the inflated spear's. He's only 19months old but he can use this for year's. This is a float and I would suggest no shoes and pay attention what goes inside. No Dogs, cats sharp toys etc...I get inside just so he will play longer but I only lay there and move around as he play's. He does enjoy it alot!!! I have it inside in his playroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat in a week","review":"Not durable at all, flat in a week, patches do not work as kids want to jump on it, waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great toy ... if it didn't deflate after a month","review":"My daughter loved this toy when we bought it. I didn't get the pump, and it took us forever to inflate it. so if you have to have this toy, make sure to get the pump or use an attachment that works with a vacuum cleaner. Within a month, the seams were splitting and it would deflate.

I had read other reviews about how it got holes in the seams, but thought \\"that won't happen to me.\\" It did.

We were very careful about what could go in, such as no hard toys, no shoes, no clothing with zippers, etc. We bought two sets of balls, which were suggested. We have a 4 yrs old and a 2 yrs old. They loved the idea of the bouncing / jumping castle but quickly converted it to a castle fortress, using a king size sheet to cover it, because of the lack of \\"bounce\\" when inflated. They quickly lost interest in using it as a fortress, because the castle material stays cold. We bought this castle to provide entertainment and exercise during the winter months, but it didn't last one month. We would not recommend the Jump O Lene Castle Bouncer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you love holes and poor customer service","review":"We've only had this bouncer for a month and are already on hole #6. It is not overinflated at all, and my 1 and 4 yr olds mostly just use it for a tent (It is so underinflated they can't get good bounce). The company has HORRIBLE customer service and said they offer no warranty on it (probably b/c they know it is made so poorly). I had high hopes for this, but now it is trash. If it was made better I might like it, but since it is so poorly constructed and the company obviously does not care about their consumers I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only lasted 3 days","review":"This product only lasted 3 days.

Our 2 1/2 year old LOVES this jump-o-lene. She gets in it as soon as she wakes up. Our 1 year old likes to climb in, retrieve a ball, throw the ball out onto the floor, and then play with just the ball. I'm sure as she gets physically stronger, she will enjoy the jump-o-lene as much as her sister. It has been up for about one month and is just beginning to lose some air.

It fit nicely in our dining room (we removed the table and chairs) which is a fairly small room - but it's wide enough to fit two or three toddlers all at once.

I was very happy to find that I was not alone in my love for the movie and soundtrack.

The only GOOD song is Evilmania but since this is the USA version,it had to be edited because some of the moments in said song were too awful to show to little kids. So even that is ruined.

To make it worse they introduce one main villan at the beginning and switch to another later.This was one movie in bad need of a rewrite. The committee who wrote the first script probably never even met.The only thing good about this film, aside from a few interesting scenes -- most likely manufactured for promotional reasons -- is the self-promotional warning they give at the start of the film.

But this book left me very disappointed. The book was rather a rambling transcription of tapes from his classes involving comments on movements we could only visuallize. Also, Al Huang has a unique \\"dance\\" approach to tai chi that differs from most teachers approaches in the way that Jazz differes from Classical music. I suspect Chaungliang Al Huang's approach works wonderfully in a seminar, but it did not translate well into book form. I do not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious and potentially misleading","review":"I purchased this book because it had 5 star reviews and I thought it might be worth adding to my collection of books on tai chi. I was sadly disappointed. This is not really a book about tai chi chuan; at least not as it is generally understood, particularly in China. Rather it contains the author's musing about forms of slow meditative movement loosely based on certain tai chi chuan principles. I say \\"musings\\" because on the whole what the author has to say is vague and not very coherent.Perhaps the character of the book can best be described as self-consciously \\"new age\\". The only reason I can think of for buying it, is as an illustration of one of the directions in which tai chi has developed in the west.

Ray Boltz didn't try to \\"copy\\" the original artists; instead he gave the music an updated sound and feel.

Clarke's short story \\"The Sentinel\\", published around 1950. Kubrick and Clarke, together, expanded this short story into the screenplay for the movie, while Clarke wrote the novel based upon that screenplay. Matter-of-fact, I have the novel published by Signet Book (copyright 1968), and the cover states the following:\\"2001 a Space Odyssey. A novel by Arthur C. Clarke.

Even if you found the film incomprehensible or boring, you must read the book, because it's hugely readable and not boring at all! The ideas involved by Clarke, such as the monolith, HAL and a civilization independent from matter are not only ingenious and creative, but it also goes deeper than sci-fi and makes us wonder about existence, God and the meaning of life.If this book has a defect, it is the fact that it's hard to find a novel as good. Since it was the first Clarke book I read, it made me read 7 other Clarke's books since then(including the 3 Odyssey sequels) but none as brilliant and uncanny as this, even though Rendezvous with Rama and 2010 are almost as good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic voyage to the stars!","review":"2001: A Space Odyssey was everything a great science fiction novel should be. The day I started to read this book I found it so engrossing that I finished it the same day! The book does a magnificant job of rendering detailed images to us in mankinds' quest to reach intelligent life. The book touches on so many powerful themes, like man vs. machine, the struggle for survival, and humanity's rise to the space age that one can't help but think about these issues in a whole new light after finishing this great novel.The addicting storyline, along with its pleasant, easy-to-read style will help make this book a favorite of everyone's who can get their hands on it!My personal thanks to Arthur C.

The description of this is so vivid, and really takes you there, that I must think that Arthur C. Clarke went there for himself! So how is this possible? Hm.. Well, the definition of what a human is or can be is actually an open definition. So I think that Arthur was carrying a universe around inside of him. Personally it's my experience that there actually exists super-human powers, Arthur actually also touches upon this in the book, where he describes the ultimate Extra Terristials, not as some human-like creatures, but as forces which works on the universe.

It took me quite some time to read this, as I was not terribly engaged with the tale except during Hal's defection. Even that, though, was a little telegraphed. The alternate creation myth was thought-provoking, but not terribly engaging.

Clarke's 2001: A Space Odyssey is a breakthrough for it's time. Clarke describes black monoliths that help aid the man-apes of prehistoric times and try and stop nuclear warfare in the future. Clarke does a great job of showing how the human race is buiding weapons that could be our undoing.The book also tackles the issue of man building a machine too powerful for man. Hal 9000 was built as the perfect computer for the space shuttle Discovery which makes its way to Jupiter. During the mission Hal begins to show emotion. Hal's emotion gets to the computer's \\"brain\\" and havok occurs on the Discovry. The proceeding events show a great example of machine getting too powerful for man.Overall Carke gives us an entertaining novel, while warning us of letting our technological power go to far. The accuracy of his fortelling of future space travel also makes 2001 an interesting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very thought-provoking story","review":"I admit I watched the movie before I read this book and although certain parts of the movie greatly amused me I was confused beyond belief. The book is far better. It explains everything in detail and really gives you a sense of bizarre isolation in a way.Hal the computer still remains my favorite character and in the book his murderous tendencies are not only explained in detail but also have reasoning behind them. Not only this but the monolith and the apes seen in the first scene of the movie are not nearly as ambiguous and they do connect very well with the rest of the story in the book. Nothing is left dangling in the air for the reader to figure out on their own. The ending is the strangest most thought-provoking finish I have read in any book.

This book, though, is remarkably bland, and lacks any sort of focus. Written awfully literally, it leaves little to the imagination and bores the reader with a word for word, often technical account of what is going on.

However, when I finished the book I was trying to interpret the ending, which, from reading many reviews I know I wasn't the only one somewhat perplexed. The ending is open to interpretation; you'll just have to read for yourself to determine what I mean. Nothing else I can add that hasn't already been said.

When they find a strange object on the moon, they call Dr. Heywood Floyd from Earth to check it out. It appears to be a black monolith that was made 3 million years ago, long before there was any life or civilization on Earth. The book had some interesting ideas, such as the fact that every star in the universe is actually a solar system. The book had a great story. Actually, it was 3 stories, but the object was in all 3.

The things that make a film great a different from the things that make a book great, and a book that dumbly follows its parent film's lead cannot amount to much. I can think of one, and only one, (weak) reason to read this: if you are curious about all the weird stuff at the end of the movie, Clarke offers an explanation, of sorts.

A deep examination of the book is beyond the purview of this review, but let me say this: this novel and the film it inspired may bring tears to your eyes, but they will certainly bring a quizzical look to your face and a leap to your heart. Inarguably one of the most philosophically deep SF novels I've ever read. A hearty recommendation to the great Mr. Clarke and this magnificent novel.The only caveat is the apparent lack of major action sequences: if you're accustomed to less cerebral work, you may have to stay away from this. But the problems it poses (Is HAL insane, for instance?) will trouble your mind for long hours after you've completed the book. The rest of the saga also makes for great reading, but this is the must-read.Quite simply one of the landmarks of science fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incomprehensible","review":"This book it better the best.

However the next day, I read the next few chapters and then could not stop reading it. I read all day for the next couple of days and finished the book in under a week. The book is very easy to understand and follow.You should read the book before you see the movie. The book however, is a lot different from the movie. For example, the HAL 9000 computer does not deny Dave entrence to the ship as he does in the movie. Instead, he lets him in and then tries to kill him by cutting off the ship's air supply.

It shows you an interesting idea of the rise of man and another look into its future. The book also has several plots that link and merge together throughout the course of the book.If you enjoyed the movie, you'll love the book.

Further, there's only one creature in this film, and his costume looks so much like a man in green rubber (by comparison, the low-grade costumes in Humanoids look more believable).Even when he 'mates' with a human its less explicit than Humanoids, he only thrusts into the air over one woman.Given that this film is made more recently, you'd expect some improvement over the 'big-hair' 80s feel of Humanoids. But this film is the lesser brother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Horny Toads!","review":"Nice parody of films like Roger Corman's original \\"Humaniods of the Deep.\\" I especially loved the scene where the guy couldn't hump his girlfriend right, so the frog took over. She was smiling pretty good until she opened her eyes. I guess she wasn't too happy about giving birth to a frog 9 months later, oh well. Now this is the kind of movie ol' Joe Bob used to show on his \\"Drive-in Theatre.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Ribbit","review":"Overall a good movie if one is in the mood for it. Some reviewers have complained about the lack of action, obviously they have never watched a 70s drive-in movie which Frog-g-g is honoring/spoofing. The dialogue is part of the joke, dialogue is cheap compared to action scenes, and more nudity would also be beyond a typical 70s drive-in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking For A So-Bad-It's-Good Movie? KEEP LOOKING!","review":"The beginning is great. Nice and campy. Then the rest of the movie takes itself seriously until the last five to ten minutes where it gets campy again. Maybe they could have pulled this off if the actors could act, but I doubt it.Here's the essence of the thing: It's a boring movie that the producers realized was a boring movie and so they are trying to sell it as an homage to old sci-fi/exploitation flicks. The trailer for the movie is great. It's too bad the movie never delivers what's promised.I'm giving it 2 stars because I still respect that someone in this day and age made a man-in-frog-suit flick and it got distribution. I just hope this doesn't close the door on potentially good campy/homage horror."},{"rating":"2","title":"start here","review":"this is the perfect set for anyone who has not heard a lot of the clash. it has in my opinion their two best albums (the clash and london calling) and one album that is their most popular and would be better for someone whose taste is more mainstream and more acustumed to todays pop music. the clash have catchy songs that use a number of different styles and influences. the lyrics make you think and almost always have an important social or political message.

If not, avoid it.Instead, look up Dorothy Canfield Fisher's books. Today she's known for her children's book, Understood Betsey, but she wrote many fine books for adults.

I am actually a big mystery fan. However, I read one of Rosamunde's stories in a Reader's Digest condensed book, and have been hooked ever since. Yes, these are romance stories. But Rosamunde has an incredible ability to weave descriptions of the countryside and homes in her stories so that you can truly picture them yourselves. It has made me want very much to visit Scotland, to see the wonderful scenes she talks about.I don't feel that the romances are \\"sappy\\", either. I would highly recommend Rosamunde's stories to anyone. They are not complicated stories, so a fast read, but you do feel at the end you have read something worthwhile.Wild Mountain Thyme was quite fascinating. You find yourself wanting to tell some of the characters to \\"wake up\\" and see what they are getting into. In other words, you are woven right into the plot of the story.Enjoy reading her stories, everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Escapist Tale (If You Ignore the Flaws)","review":"Pilcher has a wonderful knack for storytelling, and this book engaged me as all her others have. That said, there were times when I struggled with some outdated attitudes that clashed with the contemporary tone of the story (the book was published in 1978, though you might not realize it at first), especially from view of the female protagonist, Victoria. Many dynamics that she took for granted would be now recognized as abusive. The role of the positive male character was still more the prince-charming rescuer than I was comfortable with. Also, the child's characterization stretched belief a bit, as he often seemed unnaturally docile. Still, other episodes and characters rang truer, and I enjoyed the story for what it was, particularly for the descriptions of life on a Highland estate and other evocations of place. Altogether, a cozy narrative if you don't mind ignoring these flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild Mountain Thyme","review":"Pilcher took me on the most fascinating journey in her book.

Of course, we as a modern people will \\"technologize\\" the Ezekiel account, since people in Biblical times didn't know how to interpret a UFO and aliens except to refer to them as a wheel and creatures who ran like lightning. This is because there was no concept of technology and space flight in those days. Notice the word \\"creatures\\" was used in Ezekiel, not angels or demons. Hello! I do not appreciate authors who presume to know all the answers about UFOs and who simultaneously intermingle their presumptions about UFOs with their religious beliefs and their opinions about other religions.

Not in any particular method though it has a few that i have used profittably, but more in an understanding of the markets and some insight into making one's own trading system. The thought process into making one's own system(s) and following it is where i feel many people lack, and most traders are losers.

There are a few spelling mistakes in the book; however, one should be able to follow the material anyway. I would recommend this as an introductory book for beginner traders only with another book such as The Futures Game (which can provide a more well-rounded education into Futures trading).

I use a Grundig G6 World Traveler radio. It is also also small and compact but very, very good for FM Dxing The antenna fits nice in a small case I have that I carry my radio and a log book in. I like to try different locations to DX. The antenna is abit tricky to rewind but worth the effort. I can pick up many stations with it that the whip would never pull in.The attachment for connecting it to the whip is great. It's nothing a 23 three foot piece of insulated wire and a couple alligators clips wont do and definetly not as good as my permanent grounded home antenna but it's compact, travels well and is basically pretty cool.

The writing is exciting and holds the reader's attention. This is an author we'll definitely be hearing more from!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Complicated Is Sometimes Nice","review":"While the complicated plot gets a little tricky to follow at times with the lack of characters being named. The storyline is excellent. I love vampire stories and this has a nice flare of modernism and historical concepts twisted together making it a very unigue telling of an old theme. There are vampires you love to hate and those you love. I really loved the complexity of how Dakari has to handle his duty and his emotions. With a background of romance in their lives, you feel their loss when they loose someone to death.

And when they do have the whole pas de deux, it is quite mediocre. I bought this DVD to see the whole pas de deux, not just bad versions of excerps.Also, the quality of the dancing is quite out-dated.

With the Chinese as my mother language, I think it is almost impossible to fully understand the beauty of these poets without learning Chinese. So the translation could be unbelievable hard, because something important are inevitably lost after the translation. But I still appreciate the effort of the translator and these translations are really impressive.By the way, Bai Juyi (Po Chu-yi) is one of my favorite poets(and half of the book is works of him). I love The Song of Everlasting Sorrow and The Song of a Lute. The rhythm of the words and sentences are just sooooooo beautiful. Yeah, just like the title, they are really like lyrics of songs.

Sometimes there is at least a minute of nothing happening. Drives me crazy.-He shows you things, but gives no explanation of what they are or how to use it. He simply points it out, for instance, a scrollable list, he scrolls through the list so that you can read what's on the list and then moves on to the next topic.I could go on and on and on, but I think you get the idea. The author may be very knowledgeable in SQL, but he is not a trainer. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good in places, but very forced","review":"While the premise and beginning of this book are very plausible it soon breaks down. The author appears determined to create a situation where the CSA & USA will combine against Britain regardless of how silly the action required to do this. I am also struck by the very uncharacteristic behavior of Grant in this book. One of the most fluid generals ever is portrayed fighting incompetants in the same way he was forced to fight Lee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now we know why Turtledove is #1","review":"Harrison is not a historian. It shows. Badly. His writing is okay -- if you happen to enjoy his somewhat unique style -- but gee whiz: there's hardly a single historically plausible idea in this whole book after the point of divergence (the British go to war over the Trent Affair). It was *drudgery* reading it after about 40% of the way through, because everytime you turned around, something else was happening that would NEVER have happened, even in an alternate world where everyone routinely did LSD. Just pitiful. The whole idea of alternate history is to show -- in an entertaining way, of course -- what *could* have been. This *never* could have been, period. If you know any more history than the average junior high student, this book will tick you off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Although this sounds like a fascinating book, it is spoiled by a lifeless execution. Much of it reads like a dry and dusty history textbook, and only rarely do the historic personages \\"come to life\\" on the page. The saddest thing is that, now that Harrison's botched it, nobody else can do this idea the way it ought to have been done, because such an work would look like a rip-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"From the sublime to the ridiculous","review":"How can this Harry Harrison be the same one who wrote the masterful King's Way series? Mr. Harrison is apparently more comfortable and familiar with the distant past than with the relatively recent. I have seldom seen a worse example of \\"alternate history.\\" As we've often been told, the key to alternate history is that it must be plausible. S&S is certainly not plausible in plot, characters, or sentence structure. Perhaps the safest thing for Mr. Harrison's fans to do is to view this as fantasy, not alternate history, and thereby give him (and themselves) a break from the link to reality that \\"alternate history\\" implies. Or perhaps they should do as I have done: choose to believe that an evil force from a parallel timeline has substituted a poor imitation of a good writer for the genuine article."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was hugely disappointing.","review":"As a Civil War buff and alternate history addict, I found this book to be a huge disappointment. The premise of U.K. intervention as a result of the Trent affair is a good one, but that is the only positive thing I can say about this work. The dialogue was dreadful, the characters unconvincing, the research slip-shod, and the editing worse. The story-line, with its preposterous British invasion of the South, transcendantly goofy North-South reconciliation, and bizarro Victoria just made me wince. It simply was an insult to the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoyable, but really really stupid","review":"Ok so the premise for the book is a good one, one star earned there. But the execution is retarded. For one, HH has the United States progress through four years of industrialization in a matter of months, completely ignoring the obvious impossibilities of such a rapid change in 1861. Second, how the hell could three/four corps conquer America and reincorperate the Americans back into the British empire, the limeys were not stupid as they are in this book. Basically the book completely devolves into a series of mindless drivel, entertaining drivel, one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Work-but.....","review":"I greatly enjoyed Harrison's \\"Stars and Stripes Forever.\\" It was a far more cheerful alternate history than Harry Turtledove's \\"Greatwar\\" Series, but that in and of itself was the problem with the book. Nothing went wrong, for long, for the US. Still, overall, a great and enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neat idea, no research....at all","review":"I love books like this, if they are well done and at least on some level believable. Unfortunately, this one is neither. The author obviously has not bothered to research the period at all and most of the action frankly makes no sense. Is it possible the North and South would have joined together? I suppose so. In fact I commend Mr. Harrison for not portraying the Confederates as one dimensional, evil villains as so much other fiction does. That said, it does not seem plausible. Especially considering that they joined forces after the British ACCIDENTALY attacked the South. The most powerful Navy in the world can't tell Mississippi from an island? Apparently in Harrison's world the British are all buffoons and the unbreakable Union could defeat anyone simply because they are American. Overall, the book is a disappointment. I give it 1.5 stars, mainly for the idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Idea, Poor Execution","review":"It's weird. Harrison obviously did _some_ research. So why did he not go the full length to make it accurate? There are many, many problems with the ships in the book, problems that could have easily been fixed if he had bothered to find a single good reference book. The Warrior in the book is not the same ship as in real life and would have been far more than a match for the Monitor. For that matter, the Monitor succeeds because the British are \\"strawmen\\", designed specifically to fail. I didn't take as much offense at the North and the South joining forces against Britain (when the actual Trent Affair occured, some members of Lincoln's cabinet actually thought a war with Britain might bring the two sides together), but its execution in the novel is rather hackneyed.I didn't bother with the other books in the series. I was totally turned off by this one. Go read something by Harry Turtledove if you want Civil War alternative history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea. Poor execution.","review":"This trilogy starts with a good concept but delivers it so badly........Characterisation (mostly of the British) isn't even two dimensional; they are poor stereotypes at best. But even the Americans are flat and lifeless.Also, if an author is going to write about historical warfare it behoves him to do some research, the number of simple errors in these books is terrible.Amusing but not worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I was hoping for a much more belivable alternative history. The point of divergence was an excellent one -- the British almost did go to war with the U.S. over the Trent Affair. But even if the British were to accidently attack the Confederacy instead of the Union, would they just say \\"hey, what the heck\\" and continue on and battle both sides? Utter foolishness. I couldn't take this novel seriously after that. Skip this one and stick to Harry Turtledove's works in alternate history."},{"rating":"1","title":"A self imposed tax on stupidity","review":"To avoid paying this tax, resist buying this turkey of a book and donate the money to a deserving charity instead.Alternatively buy it and treat it as a pot-boiling, dashed-off-by-dictation-in-a-weekend exercise in satire directed at the alt.hist fiction genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"I am a fan of alternate history and have a couple of issues with this book. First, even before the English attack, the Union feels like it is being set up with a perfect hand to beat the stuffing out of England Spoilers <<(the repeating rifles, a better monitor, monitor not sinking...)>> End Spoilers Second and more to the point, your view hops from one historic character at a moment of key crisis to another. There is no sense of people and as a result, little engagement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do your research","review":"The research that went into this series of books was very poor. The weapons, geography, historical figures, and units were completely misrepresented. There was no sense of time in the story, either. A ship or unit would cover hundreds of miles in a day or two just to fill in a plot point. This might be a minor point for others, but it was a major sticking point for me. A glaring example of this is the casualties reported at the Battle of Shiloh. 22,000 casualties is a world apart from 22,000 dead. If you are going to write about something, you had better do your research or you will look like an imbecile. The writing itself was dreadful, too. Save your time, read something, anything, else."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was written as if it was real","review":"I thought the book was great, an alternate ending to what was America's most decisive chapter. What I liked was how the combined strength of the two armies proved what odds they could accomplish together and not apart. America's invasion of Canada, was also great, with the Rebels showing why they were a force to be reckoned with. Imagine if this had really happened. No Gettysburg No Andersonville, a peaceful end to slavery. And worst of all. Lincoln not getting assassinated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely NOT vintage Harrison","review":"I have read and enjoyed most Harry Harrison books, but this one came to me so full of grammatical errors and horrid misspellings that I must conclude that the day of the proofreader is done. There is too much philosophizing and a rather overdone glorification of William Tecumseh Sherman, as well as more than enough of Grant's drinking problem. How could Sherman have commanded the respect of Lee (who was not at the time of the story, however historically distorted, \\"Commander in Chief of the Confederate Army\\")? Lee was Commander of the Army of Northern Virginia in 1861, 62, 63. It is easy to believe that we beat the British in less than a year after the \\"Battle of Biloxi,\\" but distortions of history are little use unless preceded by true history. Irishness must be catching!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book requires far too great a leap of faith.","review":"Harry Harrison starts out with a promising premise but it quickly falls apart in an ever growing string of preposterous events. For any student of history or fan of alternate history that is intrigued by the possibilities that may have been brought about to history by the altering of one or two events this is not the book for you. The author makes great leaps of faith in most of his assumptions (leaping over any type of logic most of the time) about what would have happened if Britain would have entered the Civil War. The image of Confederate General J.E.B. Stuart riding into New York to save the Union army of U.S. Grant from the evil invading British ravaging hordes brandishing Spencer repeating rifles just boggles the mind. Overall a book better left to those who enjoy pure fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Rubbish","review":"I must have been very bored when I read this book as I actually managed to finish it and not throw it in the garbage where it belonged. Harrison must have been having a really off day when he wrote this claptrap. Having read a lot about the period that this book is set in I find the notion of the U.S. and the C.S.A. joing forces to fight the British even under the circumstances described to be way beyond even the most extreme A.H. At the time the book was set in it was the U.S. and not G.B. who were the bunglers. After all who was it that was killing each other off in huge numbers, certainly not the British. I suppose if you dislike the British this would be a good read, but if you enjoy believable A.H. then this is not the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best house cd's i've heard","review":"I did not know that this was a 3 man group when I first heard the CD.

That sucks that this movie is the new version, but i suggest this movie to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"This was at one point a decent DBZ anime movie. However, Funimation feels that in addition to changing voice actors, they needed to change the music and dialogue as well. The original music, from the Pioneer version, was much more energetic and well timed. Also: while Gohan's song was slightly annoying and in a language inaccessable to many people throughout the world, it's still better than Gohan laughing inanely. If you wish to purchase this, buy the Pioneer version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yo, not that special","review":"This is simply a revervsioning by FUNimation. Though Pioneer released edited only episodes, their DBZ movies were UNCUT. I know for a fact because I own the Pioneer DVD ans it has English and Japanese audio, that you can even switch back and forth during video play. FUNimation is just redubbing it and replacing the original Japanese soundtrack that Pioneer left alone. You can buy the Pioneer version right now, probably for less than ten dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"uncut and remastered","review":"This is the first dragon ball z movie.

After teaming up with piccolo and having a long fight garlic jr decides to use his trump card and opens the portal to the dead zone. How will piccolo,goku,krilen(forgot to mention krilen comes in to help goku)and gohan survive the only way to find out is to get this dvd.

I think I first read this book when I was 9 or 10, but I wasn't mature enough to really get all of it yet. Rose is definitly growing up, separating from her mother, making good and bad friends, falling in love, taking big risks and thinking about her future. Frankly she is dying to ditch her boring, ordinary life in her small Ozarks town, but she also has to decide what she is going to do about Paul, her first love, who is gone most of the time. Basically it is a coming-of-age story set in small-town turn-of-the-century America. I liked it especially for the historical value, and would recommend it to anyone who liked the Laura books, or likes historical fiction for young adults. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleasant story...","review":"Young Rose Wilder, daughter of Laura Ingalls Wilder, is becoming a young woman.

Now she is a woman of her own. Rose does things her mother would not approve. But it is a very pleasant story of Roses' life.PS- Missouri Bound is probably the next book(and the last) after this.

I found this book simply unreadable. Royce writes in the florid style typical of his time (think Bulwer-Lytton), and in his treatment of the philosophers mentions mostly his own reaction to them so that I could simply not hack through all the verbiage to get to what the philosophers actually said. It baffles me how anyone could rate this 5 stars. Variety is the spice of life, I guess.

However, I bought it for her to use the bezel to time her exercise. I had a heck of a time turning the bezel. Also, the seconds hand was not aligned well with the seconds ticks around the dial - did not like that as well. I sent it in for warranty repair and it was returned with both items not repaired. I guess this level of quality was found to be normal for this watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre product, terrible service","review":"Bought this watch as a present for my girlfriend Dec 2009. I know wasn't buying a Rolex but I did expect it to last at least a few months or gasp, at least 1 year! 6 months on the dot, the bezel falls off. We didn't even notice until later as it wasn't dropped or bumped against anything, it just fell off. Shoddy manufacturing I guess. As usual I guess for these types of companies, nothing is actually covered under the warranty so the bezel will need to fixed at an extra charge, in addition to the shipping and handling fees, which come out of the customer's pocket. All in all, it will require 50% of the purchase price just to get this fixed as the warranty does not cover anything. Stay away from Invicta watches, you're better off buying a 10$ Timex from your corner store. Heck, you're better off buying with a dollar store watch in terms of value for the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last 1-2 months","review":"I just noticed this weekend that the pin that holds the saftey clasp has a broken end, meaning it could fall out at any time and render the clasp useless.

The next section is a wonderful biography of Saint Margaret Queen of Scotland and how she came to become Queen and change the landscape of what would become known as Great Britain and even Europe. A small write up reminds us that Saint Margaret is the wives' saint and a statue of her can be found at Lourdes.

Some death threats, some secrets, several anonymous food reviews and the birth certificate of a young man all play into this culinary mystery. This was one of the books by this author that I really enjoyed. The characters have real personalities and reactions you would expect. This story kept me guessing until the end as to who was guilty of murder and why. The ending was truly explosive! The recipes as always never fail to tempt you with such choices as Strawberry Super Pie, Scout's Brownies, New Potato Salad and the Chile Relleno Torta, along with six other possibilities. Can't wait for the next mystery from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept me guessing right up until the end","review":"This is one of the few mystery books that I have read where I didn't have it figured out who the \\"guilty\\" party was. I was so surprised that I dropped the book and lost my place. The plot just moves along with characters that seem like real humans and it was almost like watching a movie in my mind. The interaction of Goldy and Arch is so much like watching my own mother with my youngest brother and her attempt to \\"get it right, but not smother\\". Because this book took me only two days to read, I can't wait until I get my hands on the next one. On a side note, the recepies look so good that I am going to have to try a couple.

The character Goldy is a hoot with her stubborn inquisitiveness. A Jessica Fletcher with a twist, she always is around when there's trouble, or vice versa. She is an every day *real* woman that readers can identify with even when her situations are unreal. You'll want to hold her hand to help her through her problems (and a plate of her brownies would be great too!) A fun turn into the world of mystery.

Prior to reading this novel, I'd only liked mysteries by Agatha Christie and Poe. I'd definitely like to read more books in this series. I only had a few qualms about this book. Too much of the novel passed without the certainty that there had been a murder; in effect, there was little sleuthing in the first half. I would have preferred if the murderer had been caught differently. This ending/capture is not very original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as some of the later books","review":"After floundering through a few of the later books, I finally decided to go back and read Goldy's story from the beginning. It was strange to hear about the characters in their \\"before\\" stages, but it was engrossing enough that the weirdness wore off after awhile. I don't think the characters, at this point, are particularly well developed, and the peripheral characters are a little flat and rough about the edges, but then, I'm comparing it to her later books. I definitely think this is a story line that gets much better as it goes along.

I hope the kids aren't too hard on the chinrest, though, the Wittner is rather flimsy.So...check to see if it will fit before you buy, and think about spending your money on ebony or rosewood instead of thin plastic with very slender mounting screws (under those black screw covers)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Eden is a nice lady, but get something more current and better produced.

The costumes, scenery and music are still wonderful. The dancing is a miracle since the characters caper in costumes that fully realize the animals of Beatrix Potter. To see the cat dance with a tail and full skirt is amazing since her vision is obscured by the big cat mask. An excellent film for young kids who will be enchanted by these animal personalities. Each dance is like a little book so you can start and stop the film if you have a short attention span kid.I was disappointed in the quality of the video. The color in the theater was outstanding. In this video version there are scenes so dark that you cannot see the dancing. Some of the country side is murky also. I am watching on a computer so that may be my problem. If you are in the same techno boat rent the film anyway. There are enough great dance sequences that are visible to make watching this worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prepared to be charmed","review":"This absolutely delightful rendition of the Beatrix Potter tales is a must for Potter fans and for ballet fans.

They are just beautiful, well-made and come in a pretty wooden box.The product picture makes the gold look dull and the stones look opaque, which is not at all true. The moissanites sparkle beautifully, and are not as tiny as they seem in that picture. I recently bought a pair of 2ct H-I-J/I2 diamond hoops for twice the price from another online store, and I'm going to return them because they look dull and flimsy next to the moissanite pair. Moissanites are more like D-E-F/VVS so a comparable diamond pair would be 3-4 times the price.I'm a moissanite convert. Although I had read about their superior dispersion and luster I still wasn't expecting them to be this lovely. I suppose all those De Beers ads must have had an effect because I was expecting them to have the glassy superficial twinkle of CZs. Not so -- moissanites look more like diamonds than any diamond I've seen outside of a De Beers ad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try harder, Gulliermo!","review":"I would like to know what the author is trying to say.....besides the obvious revenge (for what?), the already exploited visual effects and the solarization of close ups of the environment.

Alternating back forth from the past to the future, David Michaels and Daniel Brenton spin their yarn and weave their spell seamlessly. It got me looking up at the moon every evening looking for signs of life from Grishka. Not only are the Soviet era space race scenes real enough to be believable, but the depictions of a post Soviet future Russia - a decade or two beyond the present - are remarkable for their insight into the Russian psyche. Which in my opinion, as someone who has spent significant time in Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union, goes a long way toward unwrapping the mystery inside of the enigma - which is what Mother Russia is really all about anyway. The best compliment i can pay Messrs. Michaels and Brenton is that Red Moon is a tale that truly needed to be told.

Michaels has written a skillful blend of fact and fiction that captures all of the thrills and challenges of the space race era, when the \\"evil empire\\" of the Communists threatened the free world in an epic struggle for technological supremacy and world domination. I found this fast-paced novel impossible to put down. Michaels' elegant style provided continuous entertainment throughout the entire book.

A story like this one is surely destined for the big screen.Robert Simon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Novel - Didn't Want it to End!","review":"I'm an avid reader of many different types of books - from science-fiction, to mystery, to espionage... this novel was extremely well-written, and covered all of these different genres. The author did a superb job weaving a story across two different timelines. The characters were so real. It was easy to become fully engrossed in the story... empathize with the characters... and not want the story to end... but at the same time to learn of the ending.

The course was just like the book said. It was easy to learn, very effective and best of all taught avoidance at all costs.The world is very unpredictable and safety should, but isn't always, in the forefront.

In fact, it looked a bit familiar. With the checklists, the boxed tips, the statistics and the vignettes, it looked an awful lot to me like Be Alert, Be Aware, Have A Plan: The Complete Guide to Protecting Yourself, Your Home, Your Family, by Neal Rawls. Really, it looks like Patire got his whole idea on how to present his material from the Be Alert book (which, by the way, was a much much better book). I say don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Be Better!","review":"I impatiently awaited for this title to be released only to be disappointed. The author essentially begins the book by bragging about who he is and about how many training centers he has acrossed the country. Little of which, has anything to do with the subject at hand. He then follows this up with minor vague safety tips and gives the reader little solid instruction. As if that wasn't enough, he then describes 5 very questionable self-defense techniques. Techniques that likely work extremely well in a controlled instructional environment against willing training partners but will unlikely work against the average mugger or rapist who happens to be big, mean, and high on drugs.I would suggest that people interested in saving their lives or the lives of their loved ones, purchase the following titles- \\"Strong On Defense\\" by Sandford Strong, \\"The Gift of Fear\\" by Gavine De Becker, \\"Defensive Living\\" by Bo Hardy, and \\"Protecting The Gift\\" by Gavine De Becker."},{"rating":"1","title":"MISLEADING","review":"After I was told about this book I decided to make the purchase. Not only was this book filled with common fodder, it is unfortunately also filled with fantasy stories. The common sense stuff was OK, but like I said it was common sense. Nothing new or groundbreaking info available. The author even uses the pages to promote his other business's. Very shameful and NOT what I purchased the book for.I would not recommend this book as a safety book, the title is misleading.

If you a big time Berlin fan or want to hear some early 80's synth pop pick this up. Berlin became much more radio friendly with later hits like \\"No More Words,\\" and the classic \\"Take My Breath Away,\\" but it was these early songs that put this group in the New Wave category. The song \\"Metro\\" or \\"Riding on the Metro\\" is very synthesizer driven. As is, \\"Sex..I'm a..\\" I discovered this CD in the 90's and was really suprised that Berlin changed their style so much on later albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Berlin: Don't be hatin'!","review":"Can naybody see that Berlin is much more than a girl and two guys? This is one of the best Cd's in my collection: a production I can really call music.

I wonder what the 2097 New York Times front page will look like--perhaps we will be printing the papers out on our own printer each morning, who knows.

My husband keeps it on a lanyard since he uses it all the time, and that's where the blemish shows itself: the end cap won't stay put. It falls off easily and fairly frequently. If you don't actually travel with the drive it probably won't matter to you, but if you take it out and about, it's an annoyance. The cap can't protect the connector if it's on the floor or rolling around your bag.For the money ($27), I'm still happy with the purchase, I just hope that Dane learns to make a cap that will stay put."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not compatible with Windows 7?","review":"A coworker of mine has two DANE elec 4GB USB drives, the devices are not recognized in Windows 7.

The author makes clear St. Francis' personal humility and self deprecation.I found this book to be more devotional than biographical.

The box was also damaged."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"A plane crashed here...\\"","review":"That was a classic moment, where Walker's Cherokee roots and well-tuned sense of taste came in handy. Yes, he actually tasted that a plane had crashed there. How, the hell, was that possible? Seriously. Only on Walker: Texas Ranger.This show was extremely cheesy. Now, don't get me wrong, Norris is tough; he can fight like no other. But all of that \\"coolness\\" goes away once he opens his mouth, and the camera focuses on him long enough for the viewer to see his mullet. Walker is too much of a nice guy. Everything he says is corny.The show's corniness transcends to a state of absolute hilarity in the long run. If anyone saw Conan O'Brien's \\"walker texas ranger\\" lever bit, it was by far the funniest thing I have ever seen on Conan.

I had seen the shortened version on Idol and was blown away by the vocals on the full length version of Bohemian Rhapsody.The emotions displayed by the talented Constantine (who will probably be known as a one name singer) added to his rich voice made this an enriching experience. Several of my friends also received their cd today and we have been emailing back and forth that we are afraid we are going to wear out track 3, Constantine's Bohemian Rhapsody.Fat Bottomed Girls was fun by Antigone Rising.

His rendition of \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" is faithful to the original, yet Constantine definitely puts his vocal signature on this song. Reprising his AI performance which brought the house down, this track alone is worth adding this cd to anyone's collection.Jason Mraz is the other star on Killer Queen. I really enjoyed his version of \\"Good Old Fashioned Loverboy\\". His voice has nice quality to it.My Chemical Romance's version of \\"Under Pressure\\" is much more entertaining than Joss Stone's version on this cd. I thought she could have given my favorite Queen song a little better effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't imagine ever wanting to hear this...","review":"With exception of the Flaming Lips and Josh Homme, there is no real talent on this. Once again, we have the debate of singers vs. songwriters. Anyone can hold a note with enough practice folks (most not very well). Talent, in music, requires some ability to write your own songs and not let it be manipulated. If you can't write a song or play an instrument, than you are not a musician. You are simply a performer, and performers can be anywhere and everywhere, including on top of a shoebox on the corner. American Idol is not talent; it is a circus side show, and no character from that program has any business covering Queen. I say character because the program is fabricated. This does not even deserve a star; really no band should cover Queen, not even the remaining members with Paul Rodgers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going slightly mad....","review":"Buy this disc if you want to feel like someone stole your favorite toy, tagged it with profane sharpie writing, and then tried to sell it back to you as something new;Gavin's version of we are the champions made me feel like stabbing myself in the eye with my pen;Eleven's version of stone cold crazy made me feel like i was having a seriously horrible acid trip;and breaking benjamin's version of who wants to live forever sounded like i had the vocals slowed down but the music was sped up;good rock song + crappy artists = cringe worthy remakes that never should have been released;this album is only getting 1 star because i dont think it will let me give it 0 and Constantines version of bohemian rhapsody is awesome! it the only song worth listening and you can probably download it some where or get it from your dumb friend who bought the disc and then relized it what a piece of crap..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Wow, Constantine Maroulis along with WWRY really nailed Bohemian Rhapsody; what an amazing voice he has. This is one song that needs to be on the radio and will draw younger people to appreciate the great music of Queen.

However, overall this CD rocks and I would love to hear what else might come from Constantine Maroulis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Constantine Rocks Killer Queen","review":"Killer Queen is an amazing collection of hits by various artists.

I am not ashamed to say that I watched him on American Idol. Actually, Constantine was the SOLE reason that I watched AI. His shortened performance of Bohemian Rhapsody on AI4 was the BEST performance that Idol has ever had. When I found out that Constantine would be doing the FULL Version, I was thrilled. I think that Freddie Mercury would be very honored by the way Constantine did Bohemian Rhapsody. He has kept the song very close to the original,while adding his own beautiful voice and sings it with so much intense feeling. I also enjoyed Antigone Rising and their rendition of Fat Bottom Girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tribute or just cover?","review":"I would suppose that any band as phenomenal as Queen was/is would have throngs of hopefulls willing to cover their songs but to pay tribute to the genius song writing and performance that was Queen is the talent that only a handful showed on this cd. They showed it with such penazz and guts that I gave the cd the 5 stars. Queen was pomp, camp and grandiosity at its best...along with brillant performance, vocals and musicianship. A lot of that was completely lost on some of the artists on this cd thus making their tracks meh, blah or just plain allful. The 5 star rating goes to the artists that completely GET Queen but still instilled a little of what makes them the artists they are. They are..Tie your mother down...ShinedownBohemian Rhapsody...Constantine MaroulisStone Cold Crazy...Eleven with Joshua HommeSleeping on the sidewalk...Los LobosFat Bottom Girls..Antigone RisingTo everyone else you just covered Queen, you didn't pay tribute.CK"},{"rating":"2","title":"Constantines BoRap Best on the CD","review":"I have never been much of a Queen fan, but Constantines rendition of BoRap is almost better than the original. The accompanying music is superb and his voice suits this song. Brian May made a great choice recognizing his talent by selecting him to be part of this album, I am sure that will increase the record sales alone. When they release this as a single they will have a huge hit. Gavin Degraws - We are the champions and Los Lobos - Sleeping on the Sidwalk are also very good covers of the originals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"I'm astonished the remaining members of Queen permitted this assault on the ears of loyal and potential new fans.Paul Rodgers has done well as a new vocalist & George Michael did a poignant version years ago for a fundraiser, but that was the waters edge, and it's been crossed by \\"Killer Queen\\".The singer Constantine was almost reminiscent of the late, great Freddie Mercury on this waste of plastic but in the end it was not enough to save this disc from the recycle bin.Everything else was pure rubbish to feed the inflated ego's of younger artists and disrespectful, \\"tribute\\" albums and bands should be banned!.Never mess with something already perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"The title gives the impression that the book contains specifics of Costa Rican Spanish, but this is not the case.

If you want info on in situ composting (which is what she does-- it's not her own original idea, and it's not her grandmother's either), look for books by Ruth Stout (whose books on this topic have been in print since the 1950s) or pursue info on the InterBay Mulch method from Seattle.There are no pictures of her garden in this book, despite the fact that she spends tons of time describing what her gardens are like and how she created them.

He makes 10 grand a year. He couldn't afford the car in reality. But is 32 so old? Today there are probably plenty of 30 something lifeguards, but this movie makes anyone over 30 seem vintage. The 1960 high school reunion is a hoot. I realized \\"Moon River\\" was their 1960 hit song. Gad, this movie came out a long time ago. And yet, I enjoyed it for its looks at a simpler time on the beach in southern California when the guys wore Speedos unembarrassedly. There's a surprising amount of smut here. The lifeguard has sex with a 15 year old, plus his stewardess girlfriend and his high school flame. There's a message here about doing your own thing.

I see a rookie lifeguard trying to fit in withElliott. I see and feel boredom all the way through. I have a good copy that will go for $2.00 plus postage. Why? Ho Hum. Some like to see lifeguards rescue stranded people and enjoy photos of sandy beaches, with a few bikinis thrown in. I see a boring film that is thin. Elliott might have made this for some money.

I think his first album was ground breaking, not to mention, consistent. On this ep, most of the songs song like outtakes and secondary compositions compared to his earlier work. Eric's voice has too many effects on it and the guitar solos date the songs a bit. Having said that- Cardinal was phenomenal! It seems, both, Richard and Eric have struggled to capture the magic of that album. These guys, together, was a Godsend! The complimented each other so well.

These lovely battery-powered candles were just what I needed to light up my new home, which happens to have a lot of windows but not enough electrical outlets. I found them in red from another retailer and thought I'd made quite a find. However, the light cast by each candle is not very bright, but more important is the fact that they are not really meant to be used as window candles, because the batteries wear out so quickly. You end up having to replace them every three days or so and pay more for batteries than you did for the candles themselves. So I went back to electric candles with a much brighter bulb.

I thought I had hooked the cables up incorrectly. I purchased the recommeded component cables for the \\"best video picture\\" and it was still dreadful.

OK, so we planned on sending it back, but that wasn't the end.The icing on the cake was when we looked at the unit a couple days later and the lights on the front were flashing. It didn't surprise us that the darn thing wouldn't even turn on. We unplugged it and replugged it and got nothing. So we are sending it back for a refund.

The Panasonic works great for the recording of programs/home video etc. onto DVDs. The main reason I would not buy the Humax all in one unit is that it does not do any type of program editing which is very flexible on the Panasonic unit.If you really want to burn a DVD program it is great to edit it before hand to eliminate commercials and start and finish positions to end up with a clean program for future viewing.So I think I will wait until this segement of the market figures this out with the next generation of products.

They seem to be laid out at random over four large tissue sheets. Some pattern pieces aren't labeled as to which project they belong to. There's no index to the pattern pages to tell you where to find the pieces of the pattern you want, and the pieces for a single project could appear on several different pages. To cram more in on one sheet, pattern sections sometimes overlap. The overalls are one of the worst pattern examples. A single pattern piece to be cut on a fold shows cut lines for short and long versions, front and back, and four sizes. That's 16 different pattern pieces. The intersecting and poorly labeled cut lines make it impossible to find the outlines for the version you need. Or maybe next to impossible. I haven't given up yet. But for the simpler projects, patterns are clearer, and the ideas in the book really are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book on baby stuff!","review":"Bought this book last night after sitting in the store to read. Have three babies to sew for, none of them mine, two unborn. I don't even WANT babies, but I will be making quite a few of these things. The sling and the towel bib look to be the easiest and probably the most useful. For my Aussie friend expecting in early December, I have some time to make the backpack diaper bag with the fold-out changing pad. I hope I can make her the traveling bassinet, too. I haven't bought any baby-shower stuff in some time, but I've never seen things like this before. Shower things are included as well.

I was expecting a full sheet of patterns for all floral quilts in the book. I got disappointed when I found just only 4 patterns and are not for the quilts included in the book. When I started reading, I understood why. Nancy Pearson is a talented artist and a TEACHER. She is teaching you in her book, step by step, all what you NEED to paint with fabrics and create your OWN designs. I was overwhelmed by her way of explaining every single detail, starting from the fabric choices, through the overall design of the quilt.

Remondino's version is so orotund that you will find yourself consulting a dictionary. (Who knew that an aegis is a shield?) It takes over a page and includes references to the fall of the Roman Empire, Belshazzar's feast and the \\"jolly British Boniface [innkeeper]\\".Buy a copy if you are a bibliophile, a student of 19th century American English uninfluenced by the colloquialism of Mark Twain, or a medical historian.

Blood Diamond takes us to the ground where War lords enlist children to be their soldiers and men to be their slaves. DiCaprio plays Danny Archer, an unsavory diamond smuggler, whose paths cross with Solomon Vandy, a simple fisherman and a reporter (played by Jennifer Connelly). His world turns upside when he lets his conscience get the better of himself and once selfish unlawful criminal, now becomes the reluctant hero.

I'm pulling for HD-DVD to pull out at least a tie. What's the matter with players, such as Samsung and LG has introduced, that plays both? And why won't the movie industry support both formats?

Leo DiCaprio is going to get a well-deserved oscar some day, if not for this movie, for another. He's so talented, believable, and puts himself fully into the character. Even his accent was right-on.

Characterizations are lightweight. The African father, in particular, should have been portrayed with a great deal more depth. His character was so obscure and marginalized that there was no preparation for his actions at the film's end.In short, on all counts -- I was deeply disappointed. The best I can say of it is that there is plenty of action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leonadro di Caprio was in over his head with this movie, hey! Hey!

Solomon Vandy's is exceptionally sad. He is trying to find his family from whom he has been separated because of a civil war. Vandy will lead Archer to the diamond in return for help finding his family.

Edward Zwick's filmography alternates the best likeLegends of the Fall (Special Edition)orCourage Under Fireand the worst likeThe Siege (Martial Law Edition)or this BLOOD DIAMOND. Besides Leonardo DiCaprio's superb performance, the film is a total disaster. You can't explain Africa's drama in 120 minutes by using Hollywood clichés.

Fortunately, those depictions do not overshadow the underlying message of the movie.The end of the movie is nice but that's not to say it's predictable.

This movie came along and blew me away. Instantly one of my top 5 movies of all time. What a rollercoaster of a movie and I don't think I have seen better acting in any movie, ever. DiCaprio is near perfect as are his entire supporting cast. The fact that this movie is based on a true story makes it even more compelling and enjoyable. To say the least, I was riveted the entire time and felt immensely for the characters and what they were going through, especially towards the end.

First 10 songs are from 2004, very cool to see the band play the older songs, the sound quality is very decent, but the picture is poor. I think the lack of picture quality is due to the age of the footage, it was never intended to be on a 1080p Hi-Def Flat Screen. The producers of the DVD probably never went back and got the masters to upgrade the picture.The last three songs (Fans and Arizona are great on this) is much better; still not HD, but sound and picture are good enough.If you are a big KOL Fan its worth checking out, just know going into it, that this DVD has its limitations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Audio/Video","review":"not much more to say about it...great footage and potential but,the audio and video is not much better than terrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Live in Spain-","review":"Video is very blurry.

I fond it fascinating and highly inventive. Rev. Dennis Kuby, Berkeley, CA"},{"rating":"2","title":"Marcus at his best!","review":"This is a unique book. After a brief introduction highlighting the important biographical and philosophical parts of Marcus's life, the author recreates a historical meeting between the emperor, Galen (noted physician), Harnouphis (Egyptian high priest) and his brother Lucius (co-emperor) which took place in 168 AD. During this esteemed gathering each of the participants engages Marcus with philosophical questions. At other times Marcus is the inquisitor and asks his guests to express their beliefs. In this way a dialogue is established that brings to life what it must have been like to have been in the presence of each of these noteworthy individuals.Many books have sought to show us the life of Marcus Aurelius but this is the first one I have read which made me feel like I had been in the presence of the master himself. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Words to live by","review":"Although \\"The Dialogues\\" is a small book, it is packed full of philosophical questions that Man has asked over the ages; questions about the reason for our being, the definition of Divinity, our responsabilities as human being towards others. Alan Stedall, an admirer of Marcus Aurelius and a man seaching for answers, manages to take Marcus Aurelius's \\"Meditations\\" and place them in a setting that brings them together in a sensible fashion. He brings to the forefront the question ethic behavior and the need for spirituality in our daily lives. The book is a quick read, yet the reader feels satisfied at the end. While our questions remain, there is a glimmer of hope for Man, whether or not there is anything more after our life in this world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A top quality product.

It's not that I don't like Kafka, I've read most of his fiction and I think he was a brilliant writer. But this book just disappointed me. It's a few hundred pages too long--he pretty much makes most of his main points in the first part of the book and the remaining narrative seems superfluous and, well, tedious. Although his other two novels are also \\"unfinished\\" I think he expressed himself much more clearly in them. I agree with the other reviewers that this novel was about many things, i.e. the quest for truth, the frustration of the invididual facing the state and society itself, etc., but I think it could have been done better, especially by someone like Kafka. While reading \\"The Castle\\" I couldn't get over the impression that I was reading the first draft of something the author probably would have refined and improved had he lived longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Una novela que resume la innata angustia del ser humano.","review":"Al leer esta novela, el lector sentirá esa sensación de desesperación caraterística de las obras de Kafka que representan de alguna manera la angustia que el ser humano siente por la ignorancia de su destino y fundamentalmente de su objetivo y del motivo por el que ha sido puesto sobre la tierra. Pocas obras han representado esta angustia tan común en todos nosotros, pero sin duda, ninguna ha penetrado en nosotros tanto como ésta."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Service","review":"The book came in good time, in exactly the condition as described. Very easy, hassle free process. Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Love Kafka But This Novel Is Not So Great","review":"I've had a lifelong obsession with Kafka, but his novels I can do without. This book is very tedious to get through, and if the point is to make me experience firsthand that that's how dealing with bureaucracy feels--tedious, then I can just go wait in lines at my local DMV for that big revelation. Better to read any of his short stories. There was a reason these novels weren't published in his lifetime--even he himself felt they weren't quite finished or ready for the reader's eye."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Depressing","review":"If you want repetition and boredom and to be depressed in your soul, then read this book...

It would have been better if it was a short story."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel sorry for the main character and the reader","review":"I didn't really like _The Metamorphosis _ when I read it about 5 years ago so I thought it was time to give Kafka a try again.Wrong!If what he was trying to do was portray the hopelessness/uselessness of bureaucracy then he succeeded but the experience of reading the story was anything but enjoyable. Everyone in the story seems to know about everything that happens in the book and they all take turns analyzing the situation(s) ad nauseum. But none of the theories are ever proved true or untrue, and as many know, the story ends in the middle of a sentence leaving ABSOLUTELY no resolution to the problem.I guess I'll wait another 5 years and try _The Trial_ or _Amerika_."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth it...","review":"Because it's unfinished, it comes across more as a manuscript or rough draft than an actual novel. In The Metamorphasis and The Trial, Kafka focused on the main characters, but here he drones on and on about the ins and outs and the over all maze-like beaurocracy (sp?) of the castle. It gets redundant. And if that's not bad enough, a civil servant lectures the hero in full blown metafictional hogwash about the mechanics of castle politics for a whole chapter, while the hero, Josph K, is super tired, and just wants to fall asleep! I feel your pain, dude. The version i read had no ending and stopped mid sentence."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have to read Kafka...","review":"If you like Kafka, you'll like this book. Otherwise, probably not. Of his works, The Castle is more fully developed, less hectic, and generally a much better read than most. He takes the same themes he used throughout his life and delves in deeper and with a more human touch, sparing us the full extent of his obsessions, pretentiousness, and paranoia; the very things that make his work original and, to some, compelling. This tempered presentation of these same themes actually makes them more powerful and engaging. That said, it's worth noting that the book [stinks]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning!","review":"The item called \\"The Castle (Paperback) by Franz Kafka (Author), David Fishelson (Editor), Aaron Leichter (Editor), Max Brod (Editor)\\" for $7.50 is NOT the novel The Castle by Franz Kafka. It is a play by Aaron Leichter and David Fishelson based on a dramatization of the novel by Max Brod. If you think you are buying the book by Kafka, you will find you are mistaken. I am not commenting on the play itself; I'm just letting you know that this is NOT the novel. It is misrepresented. Its actual title is \\"Franz Kafka's The Castle,\\" which was obviously not written by Franz Kafka in this form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Which translation?","review":"Kafka is one of my all time favorite writers, but try as I might, I can't get through the Mark Harman translation of The Castle ... it comes across like a laundry list of details, at least compared to the other versions I've read.A tour de force of literal accuracy, perhaps, but it just isn't funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Materpiece","review":"This is Kafka at his best. An incomprehensible system with incomprehensible procedure but a man, along with the masses, invest their lives into it. The symbolism is obvious and its impact devastating. The monomaniacal attempts to get entrance to the Castle are hilarious and frightening at the same time. At one moment, you think it is so absurd, but then you think how each event can so easily be trnslated into your existence.

She portrayed in three various stages of how a normal, everyday African American family, living in the suburbs survives their marriages, careers, relationships, as well as how they all got along with one another amongst their own family nucleus. The flow of the dialogue from one person to another definitely captured my attention, she touched my heart with a range of emotions: excitement and laughter, saddness to bitter rage - I was so enthralled I dared not put down the book until I was done.

First is the original of course, and second would be ROTLD3. At any account this movie is a very good horror flick. The storyline picks up from the first movie, and doesn't deviate much. Also it is a movie from the 80's and they just don't make them like this anymore. I especially love the James Karen and Thom Matthews characters. I laugh every time that I watch them. This movie has good dark humor, good special effects and good acting. I also love the ending, but I won't give it away for people who haven't seen it.

Same basic plot line as Part 1 with a few of the best lines repeated; \\"Watch your mouth if you like this job!....LIKE THIS JOB!!?\\" Lots of fun! I wish I could find a copy of Part 1 also. A must see for horror/comedy cult fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"This version is unwatchable-don't buy","review":"I read the reviews below and still bought this thinking \\"so what, how bad can the new track be?\\" BAD. The entire music track has been replaced with tooting techno-pop circus music. Not just songs, but every little piece of musical sound used to create tension is replaced. So, for example where you used to have a scary scene that had a wall of violins playing and sharp scary sounds to help the scene, you now have tooting circus music that sounds like it was produced on a $50 Sears keyboard. To the people below that said \\"so what\\", switch it over to the french version when you hear the tooting, and hear what its supposed to sound like. Why Warner would do this is baffling (obviously they have the rights to the sounds, since they are still there in the French track. Also, I have never heard of the rights to a movie being seperate from the background music)."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun fun fun","review":"It's nice to have a serious zombie film(which usually doesn't happen with most of the past efforts 'cause they are too extreme and tend to become funny), but it's fun to take a break from that a watch something like RTLD 2.

The plot is uninspired. The acting is horrid. Worst of all, the zombies and their makeup are laughable by most standards. Even by B-Movie standards, the film and all involved are horrible! Save your money and don't buy this atrocious picture.The film takes place in small-town America where a cannister was dropped off a truck. In it, it contains a dead body and a chemical that raises the dead. The cannister is opened, unleashing the gas and the dead from their graves. The zombies act like some living people and the makeup is very poor. Not very scary at all.I rarely find a film as horrible as this one. However, if you enjoy horribly acted B-movies with Don Johnsonlike zombies, you'll enjoy this. If you want a decent film, look elsewhere.

It fails on all levels. This time around the comedy is more abundant, but nothing is funny here. The effects are bad, the acting is atrocious... and THE MUSICAL SCORE HAS GIVEN ME EAR CANCER. I found out shortly after viewing this turd that the music on the DVD is not the original score. Believe me, 'ROTLD2' might be a hair better if the original music was in place, but it's still a failed attempt at zombie comedy. I felt bad for James Karen and Thom Matthews as they stumbled around trying to be like their characters from the first movie. It's really quite embarrassing to behold.

This is more of a parody than a sequel but unfortunately, it is not that funny nor is is remotely scary. There are a few moments that will make you grin(zombie's stopping their attack momentarily as something good pops up on the t.v.)but nothing more. The effects are okay but nothing special and the rehashed plot feels like it was hastily thrown together without any effort or concern for originality. If you want something different in a zombie flick, try the 3rd installment of return of the living dead. It is a dark, depressing tale of impossible love that takes the zombie idea in a completely different direction...that of a teenager and his girlfriend, a lovely woman who has become a zombie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie gets 4, but the DVD gets 0","review":"The people who put out this DVD have totally messed up the soundtrack.

Burt Reynolds gives the best performance of his career (the fact that he didn't receive an Oscar nomination is dissapointing)as the newly divorced man trying to find his way. The fact that he's still hung up on his wife doesn't help matters. Jill Clayburgh is great as Burt's new woman, and Candace Bergen is a hoot as his ex wife. Other wonderful performances by Charles Durning and Austin Pendleton, make this film worth seeing. So many romantic comedies get it wrong, but this charmer of a film continues to hold up 25 years after it's initial release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pangs of Divorce and Loving Again","review":"Burt Reynolds at his best ever, without a silly comedy behind him, plays a sensitive guy cuckolded by his wife (Candice Bergen) out in the world, alone, to find happiness again. \\"Starting Over\\" is a play on words because it is unclear, until near the conclusion, with whom Reynolds wants to begin again - his ex-wife or his new girlfriend played by Jill Clayburgh. The three main characters are fabulous. They are joined by superb character actor Charles Durning as Reynolds' older psychiatrist brother. Members of Reynolds' divorced men's support group also give the movie a good realistic touch. Bergen is most appropriately annoying in her role, Clayburgh is delightfully warm and sweet, and Reynolds is understandably confused and sympathetic.

There is even a lame song repeated three times! Back in the 70's, us \\"dumb teenagers\\" did not know better when they sold us LPs with 20 minutes worth of music. Now, in hindsight, it seems ridiculous.This just in not that good. Especially for a former Fleetwood Mac member, that was the best that he could do?!!. I can't imagine that anybody really respects this really lame album other than nostalgia buffs.The 2 good songs belong on a 70's compilation, the rest just is not quality stuff!I cannot understand why every cd on this website alwasy gets 4-5 stars. Those high ratings are deceptive. Every album cannot be great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brought back memories about highschool in Millington, Tenn","review":"I've been wanting this CD for so long and finally found it on Amazon.I used to listen to the songs on this album when my highschool baseball teammates used to take to the road for our out of town ball games. I didn't have my driver's license yet so I got to enjoy the ride and listen to Bob Welch.Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you've hit your 40's....","review":"....And are looking back on music you liked, get this one. I had the original album, later the 8-track. Bob, did you review this one in February 1999? There is a review here that looks like someone from the band, maybe even Bob himself reviewed it!!! I quote, \\"We recut it 5 years later in 1977.\\" I listened to this one quite a bit back then. I recently re-aquired the tracks for the album and am enjoying it once again. Excellent music!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob Welch, sometimes forgotten star of Fleetwood Mac","review":"Many years ago, in the late seventies, I first heard Fleetwood Mac's later albums, i.e after Jeremy Spencer and Peter Green had left. This was the time when Danny Kirwan and Bob Welch were playing the lead roles in the band. Future Games was the album where Bob Welch really shone with his songwriting, playing and vocal skills. I got out of touch for a while but then I heard Bob Welch had left the band and sort of disappeared for a while, until he sprang back with this lovely album \\"French Kiss\\". I really loved his playing and singing in this album. Somehow the cassette I used to have got lost, and when I discovered the CD available on Amazon I jumped. Wow, although the music sounds a bit dated now, my kids are starting to listen to this CD now too and have become interested in finding out more about Fleetwood Mac all over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and well-written","review":"A worm's-eye view of 1865 in the South as the Civil War grinds to a halt and social instability (verging on chaos) sets in. This is an excellent counterbalance to the big picture studies of Reconstruction which are too much policy and too little impact on daily life. Four well-written biographies woven together; a book you will enjoy reading even if you start with no interest in the Civil War or the South."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Year in the South: Four Lives in 1865","review":"I purchased this book because my daughter chose this book for a summer reading project. She wasn't too thrilled to have to read non fiction over the summer but she said the book actually was quite interesting. She wrote a paper on the book which had to persuade people to read the book and also do a PowerPoint presentation the first week of school. She got an A and also was surprised because, at least in her class, it was the only book the teacher asked to read. It must have sounded interesting to him! We will probably donate to the library now because we initially got it from the library but there was too much demand for it and she couldn't keep it out long enough so that is why we purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"I followed the instructions, leaving the powder in place for twenty-four hours before vacuuming, but saw no reduction in the number of fleas.

Try another brand (I'm going to!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I saw the movie, now I'm ordering the book.","review":"I'm ordering \\"Athem: An American Road Story\\" because I first saw the documentary.

Good price too, makes it a worth buy. They were the best instrumental group for sure, they had an edge on anyone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice design but questionable quality","review":"This cutlass is nicely designed. The thick metal guard, with an attractive three-masted galleon relief, makes the hilt very heavy. The skull and bones accents on the throat and tip of the scabbard offer a nice piratical touch. The blade is well-crafted (for a display item) and beautifully polished. There are, however, some quality issues with this Chinese-made item. The wooden scabbard does not hold the blade tightly, especially at the throat, making the blade all to easy to slide out of its sheath. The scabbard also lacks a locket, which is useful for wearing the cutlass and peace-tying (peace-bonding) the blade to the sheath. My sword came with the handle significantly offset from the hilt. This was easily fixed by disassembling the entire hilt and then reassembling it for a tighter fit, but the handle can still be moved when wielding the sword. All in all, it is a handsome piece for the price, but a few improvements would make this cutlass even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Looney Tunes Collector's Edition: Welcome to Wackyland\\"","review":"The Clampett cartoons I've watched were on this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like quadruple daily.","review":"The good news is this feeder regularly dispenses flake food (I haven't tried other foods). The bad news is it's a LOT of food since the adjustment level is really irregular and it actually feeds around 4.5 times per day. The amount of food this thing dispenses is ridiculous, especially if you only have a few fish. This thing will KILL your fish from overfeeding unless you have a decently big tank (I have a 6-gallon tank).I haven't tried the alternatives, but I highly suggest you pass on this one unless you have a 20+ gallon aquarium and 10+ fish.Update: I now use this to automatically feed pellet food to my turtle in a 30 gallon tank. He can take the extra feedings, although- he doesn't eat when this dispenses food at night so his tank gets dirty quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I bought this product to use for vacation as well, but beware, if you are going to use it with flaked food. First, you must grind the flakes smaller to even get through the feeder. Also, when water started evaporating a little bit, all the food got wet and stuck in the feeder. I would not recommend this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A piece of Junk","review":"I bought this feeder and it hasn't worked right from day one. It ticks like a clock, but it doesn't move an inch. I even marked it with a piece of tape so I could see if it is moving. I doubled checked the battery as well. This was extremely disappointing. I wouldn't trust this product to feed my fish even if it suddenly decided to work (which I don't think is going to happen)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never worked!","review":"This is a very flimsy feeder. It never worked. It rotated a quarter of the way and would not rotate again. Of course I waited too long to return it. I opened it up hoping to fix it. But I noticed the gears are all plastic and very thin and loose. The gears can get out of alignment very easily, which is why it would work a little bit, then stop working. Worst $20 I ever spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed","review":"I can't even tell you if this Daily Double II Feeder works. Why? The AA battery compartment is too small for AA batteries! Maybe, despite the marking inside to use AA batteries, it requires AAA batteries. I tried that, also. AAA batteries are too small. How any other reviewers got the thing running is beyond me. I tried different brands of batteries and none will fit. I'm very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless....unless you're trying to screw up your tank","review":"I bought this useless contraption for about $12. The first problem is that, unless you have a huge tank...or tons of hungry fish...this thing dispenses way too much food. I spent an hour fiddling with tape and styrofoam to close the hole slightly, and thought I had it set. So I tried it out on the tank. Because it dispsenses a totally different amount of food each time it spins around, I was lucky enough (note the sarcasm) to have it, on my first trial above my tank, dump out about a week's supply of food into the water. Yay! The next hour was spent using siphons and gravel vacuums to try to suck up as much food as possible. I'm going to try to return it tomorrow to the store I got it from. Useless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"This feeder is a waste of money. I ended up having to pay someone to stop in a feed my fish. It would feed them once, then stop working. Save your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't think of that...","review":"I thought this would be the solution to leaving my fish alone for a week. I tested the feeder for a week prior to leaving for vacation. Seeing that it worked properly I placed the feeder over the opening in my tank and left for vacation. The moisture that evaporates from the tank got into the feeder and made the flake food wet and unable to fall out the tube. Unfortunately all my fish died and I now know the reason no one has ever recommended this product to me before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"I bought this for 10 dollars. I bought it mainly for vacations, so i tested it and it took a load of my hands, i just wanted to test it but now i use it daily. It holds a lot of food, and it distributes it evenly, and almost every 12 hours. Haven't had any evaporation problems yet"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have five goldfish and was hoping to use this feeder during the holidays when I go home. It's so-so with flake food and with the little floating pellet food it's works alright if you adjust it to the lowest feeding position. With both types the food falls out little by little to the side before it reaches the vertical position so it doesn't really provide en even feeding. It's even more pronounced with the pellet food because it just rolls out. I also tried to time mine and it's not evenly spaced time wise either. I ended up making my own adjustments inside until it fed them correctly which involved breaking off the stops on the inner tube and taping the opening a bit.Overall I'd just recommend going with one that isn't a rotating drum. Not a particularly great design. Just get one that is actually on a timer and drops the food down at designated times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I read Scliar's columns in the newspapers regularly, but this was the first of his novels that I read. Scliar has recently been accepted to the ABL (Brazilian Academy of Literature) and while reading about him I came across several people's opinions on this book saying it was one of his best work. I can't really compare it to any other book he wrote, however I can say that this story kept me interested from beginning to end. The interesting thing is how the character tries so hard to fit into society, in spite of his \\"handicap\\" which cannot be easily hidden. I kept thinking about how I would react if I were in his situation, with the same \\"problem\\". When you think that nothing else will happen, there's a nice twist in the end. This is a great book. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterical movie!","review":"Great movie, great soundtrack! Recommend to all the children of the 80's! And Dave Chappelle's character is the icing on the cake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like so many other movies at this time.","review":"I now understand why they stopped making this DVD; it isn't worth the materials it's made of. The premise is like many other movies at this time where a dozen subplots and 30 odd characters finally converge in a grand coda. The problem is that none of the individual stories are very good, most of the characters are completely unlikable and the conclusion is so predicable and unsatisfying that you buy the DVD just to find out which bands were in the soundtrack so you can buy their MP3's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie!!!","review":"Great reminder of the time, very funny, great music,great actors, just worth it in every way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture a annoying sitcom made into a movie","review":"This movie was really terrible. If the characters in this movie were supose to irratate you to death than they did a wonderful job. IF this movie was a sitcom it would be equal to a wannabe knock off of \\"Friends\\". -so bad"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rated on the fun factor, but not a GREAT film","review":"I had to give this one 4 stars just because it is so fun. It is deeply flawed at points and as deep as a puddle, yet it is funny and still has some moving moments. The nostalgia factor works as well if you were out and about at the time. Affleck comes across a big dope, but that's okay (cuz I think he is). Ricci is great - why is she so underutilized? That girl has a power in her. Rudd is the sweet sort of everyman good guy and it suits him well. Love is, well, actually ... good here. I liked her and I felt for her character. Hudson is very, very funny, particularly in her scenes with Jay Mohr - they have great chemistry. Garoffalo is the best in a tart-tounged smaller part. Definitely worth a spin for an easy-on-the-eyes comedy.Best line, Garoffalo in a moving cab trying to light a cigarette: These matches are disappointing me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"kind of aimless","review":"I found this movie somewhat entertaining, although the intertwining stories were a mixed bag of annoying and fun. Unfortunately the fact that the stories each receive only limited attention, and the story changes from one focus to another storyline entirely just as things start to seem interesting, makes this film a bit frayed and taxing to the patience. Nevertheless, the film is about a whole host of young people, dressed up and heading for a party (ostensibly Martha Plimpton's party), but they never quite make it there. Plimpton, someone I never really cared for, is actually rather funny in this role, and in fact hilarious when she misses her own party (and her idol, Elvis Costello). Christina Ricci and Gaby Hoffman are both quite funny; Courtney Love, Paul Rudd and Janeane Garofalo are also quite a trio. Overall this is light comedy; nothing special but still worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"200 Cigarettes Goes Up In Smoke","review":"This film has a great cast, but nothing else going for it besides. I was disappointed with the pointlessness and limp dialogue. I wasted eight dollars to go see a bunch of people do nothing but whine on New Year's Eve, get drunk and then get laid, waking up the next morning to discover just who they slept with while recovering from minor hangovers. I could go to a frat party and see the same thing for free. There wasn't even an hour of the reel gone, and I was terribly bored with the constant back and forth of party to party, listless characters and dragging scenes. I kept looking at their shots and martinis and frozen drinks, wishing I could have one so maybe I'd enjoy more of what I was watching. No luck, and I left the theater feeling very cheated. I advise that whoever reads this review remembers the part I said about feeling cheated, and really researches this movie before they buy it. You'll be wasting more than eight bucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great!","review":"This is the worst movie with the best actors! Man, everyone in this movie rocks! As for the movie, that's another story. The only reason I kept watching it is because I hate stopping a movie once I've started watching it. I see that a lot of people who have reviewed it liked it, but I didn't, it got no recognition...and it deserved none. I DO NOT suggest renting this movie, much less buying it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time.......","review":"The main drawback to 200 cigarettes is that it jumped around too much and didn't allow for character development.

I went to see the movie, and I was greatly dissapointed. after about a half an hour, I just got up and walked out. I've never done that before @ a movie, and never have since. It was a horrible movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good cast, bad movie!","review":"This movie doesn't mean nothing, no real plot, not very interesting, very boring, the story go no where, well not really except lots of people get into a party for New Year Eve, what the big deal! Not the movie of the year. Bad script. But the cast is good, maybe too many well know actors are in this movie, they focus in a lot of people and don't stay long enough in one person in particular, it seem like they thought the movie will be good because of the cast but it is not, big name actors cannot save a bad movie. In the cast you have stars like Ben Afleck, Christina Ricci who act very well, Courtney Love who is very good in my point of view, you have the brother of Ben Afleck, don't remember his name he his a good actor, you have other big names that I forget. But still like I said Big Names in a movie don't make the movie Good! It was very boring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best movies i've seen in a long time","review":"200 Cigarettes is an outstanding flashback to a pleasantly disturbing time when the music was good, and the clothes were terrible. This movie takes you there via lovable characters, a wonderfully funny dialogue, and parties that make you miss the eighties. I can't help but to tell all of my friends and everyone I see on the street to see this movie over and over. 200 Cigarettes is my new favorite!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots 'o stars.....but","review":"I could see exactly how it was going to end. True to 80's style movies. But if you're as sick of the 80's revival as I am, don't watch it! Nice cameo by Elvis Costello and Janeane Garafalo is always a scream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre film with a few intruguing characters","review":"This movie is one of the more mundane films I saw in the theater this year, which was disappointing, since the 80's were such a good, unique time. Christina Ricci and Gaby Hoffman prove they have no talent for recreating accents. Courtney Love is the absolute standout performance of the cast, she is a dynamic and comical actress. It's sad that its attached to a movie that is such drivel... Looking forward to Courtney's next film..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anjanette Comer is a beautiful woman...","review":"I'm not a Marlon Brando fan, but Anjanette Comer [Guns for San Sebastian] is a beautiful woman along the lines of Salma Hayek.

It's battery operated (2 C's) and it's small enough to get between rocks or other objects. We've used this item several times. The little catcher bag will fall off if you don't have it clamped tightly on the vacuum. My husband usually just holds it with his hand, but I think you could just put a rubber band on it and that would be fine. Anyway, this little vacuum does a good job and we've used it quite a bit since we bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointing","review":"I hoped it would work in my small aquariums, but it did not. I guess the water levels weren't high enough? I have no idea why it was not able to vacuum anything out, but it would've really been useful and a convenient tool had it worked since I got it so that I wouldn't have to do a full water change so often or use a siphon on such small tanks. It did work okay in my full size tanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, this book made all the difference.","review":"I can't say enough about this wonderful book. It's packed full of examples, covers more than just the pre-adoption and placement aspects, and is incredibly non-judgemental. There's so much information here, more than I expected. It really helped me think through all of the issues related to adoption. It's for both birth and adoptive parents, in fact, two of the birth parents we've been in contact with were excited to hear about it and ended up ordering the book themselves. Reading through this book really helped me conquer my fears about adoption. I'm so glad it was recommended to us.

And while I enjoyed him live and recorded in his \\"sunset\\" years, my favorite Mel period - by a long shot - is the 50's, especially his collaborations with Marty Paitch. Will Friedwald says that \\"Swings the Shubert Alley\\" is the pinnacle of Mel's career and I agree. So if you're a 50's Mel fan, here's more to love. On this disc Mel works his way through the songbook that made Fred Astaire famous and does it with style, technique and inventiveness. And of course....it swings! Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just about perfect","review":"Anybody looking for a Mel Torme CD or any Jazz Vocal CDs from the 50's absolutely positively 100% must have this CD and its predecessor, \\"Lulu's Back in Town\\". These have some of the finest singing and arranging ever to be found on any Jazz CD, period. I'd pick either of these over \\"Swings Shubert Alley\\" in a heartbeat.

You can even store your items from the GB game on to the Stadium cartridge (good for people who never use their items and don't want to trash them) and Pokémon too (good for cheating to get all the starters and keeping your Pokémon so you can restart the game to get Pokémon that you can only get one or the other ;P )! You can even organize you Pokémon and item boxes on the GB game through Stadium.

N64 has some fun games (like Perfect Dark, Pokemon Stadium, Zelda), even though it is now behind in technology. (Playstation 2 and even Sega Dreamcast have more processing power). The biggest plus about N64 is the many 4-player games it has. The BAD THING about N64 is the way Nintendo keeps blocking the Gameshark. WHY???? Gamesharks are expensive, and only hard core game fans buy them. SO WHY MAKE US MAD BY BLOCKING THEM??? My gameshark just got ruined because of Nintendo's safeguards. I am so upset that there is no way I am going to buy the next Nintendo system. I'm going with Playstaion 2. They dont mess with the shark!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great New Price for an N64","review":"If your looking for a videogame system there are alot better choices than Nintendo consols, such as the Sega DC, or the upcoming X-BOX. However, the Nintendo 64 is a great system if your looking for a LOW-PRICE consol. Aside from the dropped price to only 70$, Nintendo 64 has cartirdge games based games, which are good for younger players who cant handle fragile CDs. The games are also triggered for these younger players. If your kid, from 4years old to 10years old wants a good system and you dont wanna spend alot of money on a next generation CD consol, get an N64. In my opionion if your getting a consol for a more mature gamer get a Dreamcast or wait untill the all new XBOX. And pass on Nintendos new system GAMECUBE coming out soon...the graphics will be ok but the games will still be geered to children. Dont even think about a playstation 2...it basically sux...."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome Awesome console!","review":"This Console is awesome of course because its a 64.

Unfortunately, the radio only pretends to be digital (the tuner display) -- it's actually an analog radio and a very poor one at that. In fact, it's effectively unusable as a radio because it won't 'lock' to a station, even when the 'digital' tuner says the correct frequency."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Boccherini fandango","review":"What everyone wants to hear in a recording of the famous Boccherini fandango is how wild can the performers make the final movement. How to squeeze out as much emotion as possible. And in this performance (by Savall naturally) we have that. Not only does he layer on the castanets, violins and guitars, but he does something unexpected but logical, for Jordi Savall that is. He EXTENDS the length of the fandango !! I know this piece of music well ( I have several recordings) and so when I was expecting the coda, instead we get a reprise of the whole spirited finale ratcheted up to even higher intensity and noise. It rocks !! Evidently the published length of the piece was not enough for Savall and his musicians. They wanted to give us a fandango we'd never forget. They succeeded."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD-Purchase","review":"My CD was delivered already after one week and that over a distance of more than 10000 kms(California to the Netherlands).

The nailer worked well with the limited amount of projects that I've used it for. No miss fires, or jams. Drove nail to the correct depth thanks to the flushing adjuster, which is a cool addition from previous models.

The layout was boring, the directions were scanty; offered in the front of the book only. There wasn't much of an introduction at all and there was no ending. The recipes offered covered fudge, toffee, cereal snacks, but most of these were variations of one common recipe: ex- basic chocolate fudge, then choc-mint fudge, cho-coffee fudge..this sort of thing. The maple fudge recipe has no maple in it. Some of the recipes were not even what I would classify as candy since they were made from cooking corn syrup and cereal together. There was way too much emphasis on using sweetened condensed milk, confectioners sugar,and chocolate coatings. The title was inaccurate. It should of been called \\"quick and easy sweets\\". There is not much about real candy making methods in this book at all.I gave this book 2 stars because the photos were good (the identification charts were not) and for the occasional recipe that beckoned.

They're not exactly the most original band, but they've mastered their sound.

Just about every song on this album is catchy and danceable. I saw them live, and despite the small amount of people there and the countless mistakes they made playing the songs, their show was still completely fun and energetic. on the last song, they pulled half the crowd on stage to dance with them. if you like le tigre, but some of the politics grate on you, and you're really just looking for something fun (but worthwhile), buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap rip off of Dean's \\"A Winter's Romance\\"","review":"Buy the Capital release entitled \\"A Winter's Romance\\", and get an ORIGINAL with all 13 songs, not 10.

As a result, it's a great thing to add to your protein shakes no matter what your goal is - cutting, gaining, or maintaining.As with its Creatine and Gold Standard 100% Whey, Optimum Nutrition excels at giving us simple products at affordable prices without a bunch of glitz and extra junk we don't need.

Supplementing glutamine has also been shown to increase growth hormone levels.Bottom line: This is a supplement that you should always be taking, and ON makes high-quality products. I've tried cheaper glutamine powders and while I can't with certainty say that ON's is \\"better\\" (how do you quantify that, really?), I did notice that ON's mixes better with water and is less chunky.

This game has awesome graphics, storyline, weapons, and mecha. It has two senerios that can get anyones attention. The machine's body parts have skills that you can learn that can be very helpful throughout the game (It reminds me of Gundam Wing). It has weapons like shotguns, machine guns, flamethrowers, Missles, Beam weapons, and more. The movies look REAL and the gameplay is just cool (to me). It's a strategy/RPG/role playing game. You can get upgrades and new weapons along the way, including new mecha. Overall it's a good game. I give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but it's not Final Fantasy Tatics!","review":"This game is great, yes it has two, count em two great plots with over 150 missions! It it great game! You go around the battle maps with giant mechs called wanzers. They have different weapons and you can make your own. There is also a huge internet and e-mail system which is very fun.

This story of an undersea mission to a radioactivity-ravaged Europe and the subplot of a traitor in the crew is as readable and believable today as when it was first published.

I remember the track being hard. I expected more from them at the time but as you know expectations in the rap game can be a bit foolish at times (see Fabolous).

Its cool though cause its not like every other cd.....you get video versions and single versions......and the R&B version of MLIFR. This cd is GREAT!

I used to listen to Paula Abdul when I was a little girl. I loved her music and videos. The only problem I had was that the versions presented on most of her videos were not like the ones in the album. This cd makes up for that. Not only does it contain almost all of her hits, but they appear as they were on the videos. I love this album. The version of \\"Oppossites Attract\\" and \\"Cold Hearted\\" are betters than the ones on the album. The only hits missing are \\"Will you marry me?\\" and \\"Ain't Never Gonna give you up\\". It also contains two non album tracks, although I'm not particularly fond of them. If you were a fan of Paula, I recommend buying this cd. It brings great memories."},{"rating":"2","title":"caught singing in the car","review":"Let's admit it, folks, we all sing in the car.

This is my first season of watching American Idol and I am hooked. Paula And Simon so go together. Now this is my favorite. Forget all the yo yo yo who's your daddy crap. This stuff is much better. I actually looked up the words for the rap in the midle of Cold Hearted. That is my favorite song. Next to Straight Up. I find myself singing that alot.

I am her grand daughter Caitlyn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh; Please!!!!!!........","review":"Paula Abdul is just another example of how industry manufacturing can turn someone with absolutely no ability into a successful recording artist............who knows why she was chosen as a judge on \\"Manufacturing pop stars, inc\\" (haha); because she is hardly the person to be commenting on the talents of other people.OK; for anyone wanting an album to help them re-live the 80's/90's, this is NOT A GOOD CHOICE!!! Every single song on here is rubbish except for \\"Opposites Attract\\" which is saved from total oblivion by the dynamic prescence of the Wild Pair. \\"Straight Up\\" is OOOOKKKKKK, so is \\"Knocked out\\"; but aside from these 3 songs this album is just full of over-produced, under-sung fillers.

Where has she been, and why does it take her so long to put out releases. Sure, what ahppened to the cat, but in her heydey, everybody would at least move or smile when \\"Straight Up\\" hit the radio. \\"Rush, Rush\\" her first real ballad is a decent song, albeit, vocal talent has never been her best feature, I'm talking about the moves. Anybody whom is the owner of Shut up and dance is familiar with the Medley Remix,and yes, it serves well again.

Didn't know about their Scottish roots, or reformation after 20 years and am usually dubious about buying live, especially prog-rock. But this is exceptional - tight, fine sound and really stimulating prog-rock, with a rockier feel than Machine. The stand-out tracks are the title track and Circus but they are all strong and stimulating. This is real prog-rock with the fine and sometimes eery violin of Grahame Smith lifting fine tracks to something else, counterpoint to the Chris Adams composition. We like prog-rock because it brings something else to the party - since buying this I'm seeking out the rest of the STD catalogue"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Snap Broke Within 2 Weeks","review":"I bought 2 of these - 1 for me and 1 for a friend.

But alas all the songs are belted out in a routine, and uninspired manner. I do believe that this CD was churned out to cash in on the \\"oldies gold mine\\" so ably exploited by Rod Stewart. Great songs sound boring and a notch below elevator music.If you want to hear some truly great fifties numbers get Anne Murray's superb CD titled \\"Croonin'\\" (NOT the one titled \\"Country Croonin'\\").

This is really terrible !","review":"Oh my god... how can be possible that he had to fall in such deep nonsense, remaking a whole bunch of old tunes to end up like something much worse than even Muzak? This is the music you'll hear again and again at the supermarket, just sufficiently engineered to num the brain.Frankly speaking , I liked his younger self's songs better than some of the Las Vegas numbers he's putting out these days.This cd is mostly nothing new. And I couldn't help but feel like he was trying to crank money out of those old matrons who like his new bimbo look. Could he not have released a completely new album without Mr.Davis' bad advise ?Is he aware of the ruinous massacre of the American songbook perpetrated by Davis and Rod Stewart ? Isn't this enough ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Nightmare! The Studio hacked a classic voice!","review":"I am one of Barry's biggest fans! I have every single disc, you get it. With this CD I was really sad to hear they used Antares Auto-Tune by www.antarestech.com - At times the fake vibrato comes thru like he is underwater, and the phasing sound of the pitch correction. WHY!!!!!!! I am truly bummed out. Too bad they had to use this horrible technology on a true classic voice. Unfortunatly now the bubbling fake vibrato (over his amazing vibrato) is all I can hear.Underneath the I am sure there was an amazing voice that would have easily earned 5 stars, if the studio would have let a classic voice be classic.Even in the Movie above you can here it really bad on the word \\"Need your love\\" just sick..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined covers .","review":"I wasn't going to review this album, because of my strong negative feelings toward this entertainer.I felt that the music was uninspired and his voice was very bland and anodyne.It amazes me how people seem to really like this idiosyncratic brand of easy ,easy ,too easy listening music that has won the arch-priest of schmaltz a legion of adoring middle-aged matrons and...all of sudden , the aura of a charismatic , legendary perdormer....You might be having a nightmare or still watching \\"American Idol'..baby!!Could it be that the very epitome of kitsch might be on the verge of being re-invented as a King of Cool?Don't get me wrong I dont knock it,if that's what you really like,but this is definitely not what I'd call ''real'' music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre.","review":"Banilow looks great with his new nose job on the front cover , and be cursed anyone who says otherwise! but this very compilation, I believe, lacks sincerity, passion, truthiness, so to say:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are a fan buy this","review":"I really enjoy the DUAL Disc, it is interesting to hear background information on the song choices, etc. I never knew the story behind the song Beyond the Sea, puts it in a new light for me and I have a much better appreciation for the song. This is a beautifully done cd and I'm not a big fifties fan, in fact I wasn't certain I'd buy this. I am a Manilow fan though (for 28 years) so I took a chance. I love it! Barry is brilliant.

It seems like yesterday that I was struck by this man's unbelievable voice for the first time. It has been a pleasure enjoying each one of his projects. I am always wowed by each one. This time, however, I was absolutely blown away. There are no words to describe the feelings I get when I listen to his version of these 50's songs. He brought new meaning to each one of them. I thought, I'll see him while I'm in Vegas this week, live just once. Well,it was, as usual, a sold-out, standing-room only, unbelievable experience. I will be going back just to see him again.

I grew up listening to all of the songs he presents and find his renditions to be excellent.

The vocals are horrible, amateurish and uninspired and uninspiring. After hearing this version of \\"Unchained Melody\\" I hope to never hear any version of this song by anyone again. Just horrible. Barry brings \\"generic, uninspired tiredness\\" to the track, as well as to most others on the album. I rarely criticize any album or artist but once in a while there is a recording that is so bad it is hard to believe it was recorded, distributed, and actually selling quite well on the charts. To be honest, William Shatner or Regis Philbin would have made a better quality recording. Shame, shame shame. The sad part is I like older artist covering oldies at the twilight of their careers.

Those who wonder why I won't this time need to listen, even once, even briefly, to this dud. These iconic sounds cannot be duplicated. Manilow's take on them, while heroic, falls far short of the mark.; the originals sounds are simply too ingrained in our ears, the original artists' sounds simply to too strong and vivid to be surpassed, even by someone as talented as Barry.

We think not."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT HITS OF THE 50S, BARRY STYLE","review":"A wonderful selection of million seller plus hits of the 50s. Barry fans won't want to miss this.However, ARE YOU LONESOME TONIGHT, while a great song was not a hit during the 50s. Elvis' rendition of this song from the 20s began it's chart climb during November 1960 and was at the top of the charts at Christmas time.Most people wouldn't be bothered by this but music historians and chart watchers usually don't appreciate this tactic. What happens is that the millions who know nothing about the history of pop are being misled. Why couldn't another of the great songs of the 50s been included instead of this. Are You Lonesome Tonight could have been on the next cd \\"Great Songs of the 60s\\".Even the movie American Graffiti included a Beach Boys song....definitely not 50s!Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A triumph of hype over reality.","review":"I liked some B.M's first CDs's, and was looking for more of those clean, almost sparse, little-trio-in-a-smoky-bar arrangements.

No smoke, no sizzle.I'd read a lot about this album in the past months,before the CD was released,I've seen him so many times on TV in the last days and thought that there must be some substance to the hype, but alas, such is not the case.The sixty years old musician's voice is bland,weak and poorly controlled, and his piano playing pedestrian.

It may have been meant more for clergy even though most of the prayers are for personal benefit. The reason I say it may be more for the clergy is this book greatly details what an indulgence is and the conditions surrounding it. But it is full of information and prayers for lay people also. For example, did you know that just by making a proper Sign of the Cross (In the Name of the Father...) there is an indulgence attached to it?

I think that this is a marvelous translation (No pun intended). You have to understand that even though the Playstation is one phenomenally ingenious system, it does lack in memory because it only has 2MB while Sega boasted about their now dead Saturn's 4MB capabilities. Nonetheless, if you've played the vs. series and liked them then I say go for this one. The graphics are pretty damn good for a PSX title, the sound isn't bad at all, and the animation is pretty awesome for a system with that type of RAM. If you OWN the prequels to this then I say forget it. You'll get tired of it in less than a week. Before you turn a skeptical eye to the game I would hope that you at least rent it and try it out. Many magazines will say that it lacks in everything but they forget that this is all running on only 2MB of RAM, a feat in and of itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of the Tag Feature really hurts the Playstation here","review":"If you have played this game in the arcade or on a Dreamcast unit you know how fast and colorful a fighting game this one is.

First of all the lack of the tag feature really does kill this game. Without being able to tag in another teamate mid battle it takes away some of the games statagy. I think it also seems to move and load much slower on the playstation than in the Dreamcast. We just have to face it, this game is a next generation game on a five year old piece of hardware, and it just does not live up to its true potential.

The other wheel's spring levers were packed unengaged by their brackets and did not stick down.

The release of Big Black Square is a 40-minute-plus improvisation that makes the listening experience tedious. Tarentel have a vague idea of where they want to go, they just don't have a compass, and nothing proves this more than the aforementioned track. Ambient noises and feedback play out for 15 minutes before the drumbeat comes in, going for another 15 minutes over feedback before finally fading away into more ambient noises.

Anyway, this game is a definite must-buy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kirby64 The Crystal Shards","review":"Is is a good game I have beat it 2 times I hope you all like the game it is a good game I have to say is that it is the best game I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and fun!","review":"I had this game since I was a little kid.Pros-Great music for an old game...I still go on youtube listening to them to this day-fun and simple gameplay-great graphics-the simplicity overall is extremely funcons-you basically do the same thing, just kill enemies, so it can get boring once in a while.-pretty short"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is my first Kirby game & I love it! It has enough levels tokeep you busy for a while, cute 2-D,3-D graphics, exellent powers,& moderatley difficult bosses. I think it's fun even after youbeat it!(I mean after you beat the final boss.) It is sidescrolling, but who said sidescrolling games are bad!? I knowlots of good games like that, Yoshi's story, for example.Also,I think the fact that Waddle Dee comes in on little transportationdevices,(rafts,sleds,shopping carts) is adorable! All in all,if you want a game that is challenging, go play a Zelda game.But if you like to play games for pure fun, this is the gameto play."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun until you beat it","review":"This game is very awesome ,and i am not trying to put it down ,but after you beat it there is almost no point to owning it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't look like ad","review":"I do not think this Jack Sparrow bobblehead looks like the ad or the picture on the box it comes in. I don't think the face on the figurine resembles Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow. Looking at the ad, I thought it looked really good. I was so disappointed with the real thing. If I had seen a picture of the actual bobblehead, I wouldn't have bought this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"i recieved a broken item","review":"This Product Is A Nice Product To Have , But The one I Recieved Was Broken, And When I Contacted Them About it, They Said That They Would Ship Me One Back Right Away. And They didn't , cause they also told me that they would let me know when it had shipped and so far it hasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"not necessary to have Nyahbinghi in the title at all","review":"This book is basically repeating what most other books on Rastafari have already said. And if anyone is purchasing this book because they want to learn about Nyahbinghi, this is NOT the book for you. Nyahbinghi should not even be in the title subject of this book. Please purchase books written by people who are from the ancient order of the nyahbinghi. Or even Rastafari who have been born/raised/lived in Rastafari culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Army Men World War","review":"I was very disappointed with this newest addition to the Army Men series. Compared with the last release, Army Men Sarge's heroes, this game is terrible. With other games out there like Medal of Honor and Sarge's Heroes, this game is like playing Pong (the original Pong) I can describe this game in one word... primitive. Don't waste your time (or your money) They obviously didn't put any effort into this game at all (and it shows)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Game is a Disaster!","review":"Personally, I thought that all of Playstation's Army Men titles were pretty lackluster! The graphics failed to maintain my interest for more than ten minutes and I found that navigating your way through certain levels was a major pain in the arse, especially the first level! To tell you the truth, I found N64's version of Sarge's Heroes to be a more thoroughly entertaining game - a real challenge. The graphics might be a bit cartoonish to some but I thought the controller configuration was a lot more manageable. It's too bad that N64 hasn't developed a version of Army Men: World War. My advice is: refrain from buying any of Playstation's Army Men titles and hope to god that Nintendo decides to put out their own version of World War. Nintendo does have its merits!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED!","review":"I wasted countless hours reading info on this game. I thought this would make my Dad play video games with me and instead it was a game that I made him return. Don't get me wrong I love war games, but this game had nothing going for it. To begin with, the first 4-5 levels are a visual mess; all the objects on the screen seem to melt into a solid green blur. You can barly see your own guy let alone the enemy. The next problem concerned the aiming system. It was the worst that I have ever seen in my 15 years of gaming. You have to spray a certain area until you are able to direct your line of fire to the exact spot you want to shoot. I could go on and on about this game. I'm begining to think that I should buy the game back and smash it on the ground so that no other gamer has to go through what I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"good game but no brightness options","review":"The game is good,but the reason why I said there were no brightness options because there really were no brightness options and some of the levels were dark.When you're on the eastern front scenario there was a level that was dark and it was called Take The Bridge and in the Western Front Scenario there were some dark and grainy levels.It is still playable though.I highly recommend it for the ones who are the fans of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS GAME IS 3DO'S WORST GAME YET!","review":"Army Men 3D was great, I recommend it over this crap. Yes the game had great sound, but horrible control, choppy and grainy graphics, and way too dark! Sometimes I would get stuck behind some little rock and get killed because the controls didn't respond enough. 3DO has been known to rush out their games, but in the past it hasn't affected them, until now. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS GAME!","review":"The other day I went out and bought Army Men:World War ....... I had played Army Men 3D and Army Men:Sarge's Heroes earlier that month for the first time, and I thought they were very fun, so I thought World War would only be better. IT IS NOT. Choppy Graphics, some of the worst controls I have ever seen in a game, and AI that is either entirely too dumb, or way too smart. The only fun level is the gunboat level in the second area, but all the rest are boring and repetitive. Don't buy this game, instead go buy Army Men 3D or Sarge's Heroes, cause they are more fun .................."},{"rating":"2","title":"another great game from 3DO","review":"this game is another good army men series addition. The game is very fun.with the tan soldiers smarter to make the game more fun. with awesome new weopens including a 50. calibur machine gun and other classic weopens including flamethrower and bazoka you can shoot burn and blow up your tan enimies. you can also contol a tank, jeep, a pt boat and guns on a trian, but the down side is the graphics. you would think they would be better but there not. but the game is still fun and worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine songs, great guitar","review":"As leader of his own band, and as veteran Supertramp guitarist, Verheyen is a recognized virtuoso in many styles. And this album is a must for fans of versatile blues-tinged rock stylings on guitar. The album features a package of very good original tunes, well sung and wonderfully played by Verheyen and his team. Songs exhibit quite a stylistic range from folk-rock to blues to harder rock. Highly recommended.(P.S. on the star rating: On an \\"I like it\\" scale, this album rates five stars from me. But I am using the stars a la Rolling Stone Magazine--as an artistic rating--so 4 stars means seriously good. The philosophy is simply that if a very good album gets 5, what room is left for \\"Graceland\\" or \\"Rubber Soul\\"?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Release by Fish","review":"Fish's first release following his departure from the Marillion is a classic album. When I first heard \\"Cliche\\" it blew me away. It's sheer emotion and passion that drives this special song and it's one my all-time favorites. I still don't understand why this song hasn't been performed live by Fish or even wasn't included on Yin & Yan compilation cd's. By the way the song urged me to get the CD and wow! it was truly a masterpiece. \\"Vigil In A Wilderness of Mirrors\\" is a fine spacey song which leaves the listener breathless. Other great cuts from include: State of Mind, View from the Hill and Family Business together with Cliche. All in all I do believe that Fish checkmated the Marillion with this release and the debut for his could never be better than this. This album is a classic release and highly recommended for any Progressive Rock fan."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],N={key:0},H={key:1};function x(a,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",B,[(o(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(o(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",H,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,M)):b("",!0)])}const R=d(O,[["render",x],["__scopeId","data-v-c9c81084"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/50.md","filePath":"guide/50.md"}'),W={name:"guide/50.md"},j=Object.assign(W,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{L as __pageData,j as default};
